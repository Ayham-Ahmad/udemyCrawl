      "description": "ASP.NET Core is a modern, cross-platform framework for building web applications on the .NET platform.\nThis course will guide you through ASP.NET Core backend development from the ground up. You don’t need any prior experience with ASP.NET Core — just basic C# knowledge is enough to get started.\nYou'll learn through a mix of theory and hands-on coding. Before jumping into code, I’ll explain each concept with clear visual slides. We follow a problem-first approach: identify an issue, understand the “why,” explore the solution and then implement it in code.\n\n\nHere's what you'll learn:\nThe building blocks of ASP.NET Core\nUnderstand the core concepts behind an ASP.NET Core application — hosting, startup approaches, middleware pipeline, request handling and the role of the Generic Host.\nRazor Views Basics & Rendering Engine\nBuild dynamic UI with Razor syntax and learn how views work under the hood. Understand model binding, layout structure and how the Razor View Engine renders views efficiently at server side.\nController-based Web APIs using MVC Framework\nLearn how to build APIs using the mature MVC Framework. Work with controllers, actions and filters to create structured endpoints.\nRouter-Based Web APIs using Minimal APIs\nExplore the lightweight Minimal API approach. Define endpoints directly, use route groups, endpoint filters, and strongly-typed results to create clean and focused APIs.\nDependency Management & Inversion of Control\nDive into .NET’s built-in IoC container. Learn service lifetimes, service locator and dependency injection patterns, and how to design loosely-coupled applications using modern dependency management principles.\nThe principles behind, plus useful tips and good practices\nGo beyond syntax — understand why we implement things that way. Learn industry practices, practical design tips, and avoid common mistakes.\nYou'll also get a quick introduction to the .NET CLI for those who prefer command-line tooling.\n\n\nThe course structure\nThis course is not just about writing code. It’s about thinking like a developer who understands ASP.NET Core from the inside out.\nImagine this: you’ve just joined a company and you’re handed a poorly structured ASP.NET Core Web API application. Your job? Clean it up, improve it and keep building on it — all while learning the framework's internals along the way. On the way, we will also have tasks from the stakeholders, like Product Managers.\nThat’s exactly how this course is structured.\nWe’ll treat this broken codebase as our playground — discovering problems, understanding the \"why\" behind them, and then fixing or improving them using modern ASP.NET Core practices. It's a mix of pair programming, guided walkthroughs, and visual slide explanations to help you really absorb how ASP.NET Core works under the hood.\nHonest scope: We will cover only the ASP.NET part of the project. Therefore we won’t pretend the final app is “production-ready.” But you’ll walk away knowing how to get it there.\n\n\nWhat makes this course different?\nConcept-first approach: We go beyond just the “how” and focus on the “why” — helping you understand the reasoning behind each decision.\nTheory + Practice: You’ll alternate between hands-on coding and clear, visual explanations that reinforce each concept.\nTackle complexity gradually: We’ll build your understanding layer by layer — starting from low-level middleware pipelines, then moving to higher-level MVC and Minimal APIs, and finally tackling side components like dependency injection.\nNot just copy-paste tutorials: This isn’t a follow-along project. You’ll be encouraged to think critically, solve real problems, and truly understand what you’re building.\n\n\nBy the end of this course\nYou'll be able to build your own ASP.NET Core Web API applications — not just by following steps, but by understanding how everything works under the hood. Eventually, this will enable you maintain ASP.NET applications and troubleshoot issues effectively and make the right decisions when working with ASP.NET Core features.",

The logic and structure of the course will help us with this: different ideas on how to implement one functionality, sometimes up to 5-6 ideas, which will give a more voluminous idea of how WordPress works; familiarize yourself with many patterns that are usually not so easy to detect.\nYou will learn the lifecycle of WordPress, how it is built, and what you will need to expand its functionality.  By doing step by step, as this course is builded, finally you will get enough knowledge to build somethig similar or even more complex project, i have no doubt.\nWe will go through all the steps of WordPress development together, starting with design in figma, and you will get a link to that modern design. We don't focus on building html/css, but sometime we do this also to see more clearly what html structure we need to implement functionality, and we will learn some tricks with css. But most of the time (~90%) is development with WordPress, PHP, JS. We will also take a look at Vue.js (JavaScript framework).\nBriefly:\n1. Create custom theme.\n2. Template files.\n3. Template Hierarchy.\n4. WordPress database. CRUD.\n5. Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, Post Statuses.\n6. SQL Queries. Create Custom WordPress Table.\n7. PHP / JS OOP,\n8. WordPress Hooks. Custom Hooks.\n9. Customizer.\n10. Menus, Comments with Walker.\n11. Vue.js\nAnd so much more.\nThe main advantage of this course is that it constantly refers to the WordPress documentation, which makes it impossible to mislead or misinterpret.

Are you ready to embark on a journey into the world of web development with Laravel, one of the most powerful and elegant PHP frameworks available today? Whether you're a complete beginner or someone with some programming experience looking to dive into Laravel, this course is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills you need to build your very own book review application from scratch.\n\n\nIn this comprehensive course, we'll start by laying the foundation with Laravel 11, the latest version of this renowned framework, and guide you through each step of the development process. By the end of the course, you'll have a fully functional book review app that you can proudly showcase in your portfolio.\n\n\nThe course begins with an introduction to Laravel, where we'll explore its features, benefits, and why it's the preferred choice for building web applications. You'll learn how to set up your development environment, install Laravel, and create a new project. With our development environment ready, we'll dive straight into building our book review app.\n\n\nOne of the core functionalities of our app is user authentication. You'll learn how to implement secure user registration, login, and logout functionality using Laravel's built-in authentication system. We'll also explore how to customize the authentication process to suit the needs of our application.\n\n\nWith user authentication in place, we'll move on to building the backbone of our app: the ability to add, edit, view, and delete book reviews. You'll discover how to set up a MySQL database, create database migrations, and define eloquent models to interact with our database. We'll cover Laravel's powerful routing system, controllers, and views to create a seamless user experience.\n\n\nBut we won't stop there! We'll also implement features such as user roles and permissions to differentiate between regular users and administrators. You'll learn how to restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles and how to manage user permissions dynamically.\n\n\nNo web application is complete without proper validation and error handling. Throughout the course, you'll learn how to validate user input, handle form submissions, and gracefully handle errors to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\n\nAdditionally, we'll explore advanced topics such as pagination, search functionality, and RESTful API development to take your Laravel skills to the next level. By the end of the course, you'll not only have a fully functional book review app but also a solid understanding of Laravel's key concepts and best practices.\n\n\nThis course is designed for anyone who wants to learn Laravel from scratch and build real-world web applications. Whether you're a student, a freelancer looking to expand your skill set, or a developer aiming to level up your career, this course is for you. Join us on this exciting journey and unlock the potential of Laravel to bring your ideas to life!",

JavaScript is primarily used for web-based applications and client-side scripting, while Java is a general-purpose programming language used for a wide range of applications.\nCan JavaScript be used for backend development?\nYes, with Node.js, JavaScript can be used for backend development, enabling full-stack development with a single language.\nWhat are JavaScript Promises?\nPromises in JavaScript represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, providing a cleaner alternative to callbacks.\nIs JavaScript a statically typed or dynamically typed language?\nJavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables can hold values of any type without specifying a type upfront.\nWhat is the significance of 'this' keyword in JavaScript?\nThe 'this' keyword refers to the object it belongs to, providing a way to access object properties and methods from within.\nHow do JavaScript closures work?\nA closure in JavaScript is a function that has access to its outer function’s scope, even after the outer function has returned. This allows for encapsulation and preservation of variable states.\nWhat is a callback function in JavaScript?\nA callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.\nCan JavaScript modify the DOM?\nYes, JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing it to change content, structure, and styles of web pages.\nWhat is event bubbling in JavaScript?\nEvent bubbling is a method of event propagation in the DOM where an event propagates from its target element up through the hierarchy of parent elements, potentially triggering handlers assigned to each of those elements.\nEnroll Now!\nJoin a community of learners and take your JavaScript skills to the next level.

Over 55% of developers say they spend 10-20 hours a week fixing bugs instead of writing new code.

You'll have both the opportunity to solve them on your own or simply watch how we can debug them together. We'll look at common bugs, uncommon bugs, and even some incredibly tricky JavaScript quirks!\n\n\nWhat's included:\n13 short video lessons, each investigating a different bug\nDebug a wide array of HTML, CSS, and JS bugs\nDifficulty ranges from easy to downright diabolical\nMock \"GemWizard\" ecommerce website infested with bugs to bash\nFollow along with a cloned version of the site's repo or just watch!\nBy the time you've finished the course, I'm sure you will have learned something you didn't know before. ?\n\n\nFAQ\nWhat level of Web development knowledge should I have for this course?\nYou'll need at least a basic/foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\nWhat frameworks are used in this course?\nNo frameworks! The code is all vanilla JavaScript and CSS. There are 2 bugs that deal with jQuery but prior knowledge isn't required.\nWhat is the difficulty level?\nSome bugs are relatively easy to figure out others are pretty hard, but there's a solution video for each.\nHow long is this course?\nThere are 13 lessons each featuring a different bug to track down.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Next.js course by Uplatz.\n\n\nNext.js is a popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications and static websites. Developed by Vercel, it simplifies the development of React applications by providing a range of features that enhance performance, scalability, and developer experience.\n\n\nHow Next.js works\nNext.js operates on top of React and provides a set of functionalities that facilitate rendering and routing. Here’s a high-level overview of how it works:\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR)\nInitial Request: When a user requests a page, Next.js generates the HTML on the server for the initial load. This improves SEO and page load times.\nHydration: After the initial load, Next.js sends the JavaScript bundle to the client, which \"hydrates\" the page, making it interactive.\nStatic Site Generation (SSG)\nPre-rendering: For static pages, Next.js generates HTML at build time, which is served directly from a CDN. This provides fast load times and improves performance.\nAPI Routes\nServerless Functions: Next.js allows you to define API routes directly within your application. These are serverless functions that handle backend logic and can be used for tasks like form submissions or data fetching.\nFile-Based Routing\nDynamic Routes: Next.js uses a file-based routing system where the file structure in the pages directory corresponds to the routes in the application. Dynamic routes can be created using file names enclosed in square brackets.\nAutomatic Code Splitting\nOn-Demand Loading: Next.js automatically splits your code and loads only the necessary JavaScript for the requested page, improving load times and performance.\nCSS and Sass Support\nBuilt-in Support: Next.js provides built-in support for CSS and Sass. You can import styles directly into your components or use CSS modules for scoped styling.\n\n\nKey Features of Next.js\n\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR)\nEnables generating HTML on the server for each request, enhancing SEO and load times.\nStatic Site Generation (SSG)\nAllows pre-rendering of pages at build time, resulting in fast performance and easy deployment.\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\nEnables updating static content after the build without rebuilding the entire site. This allows for static pages to be updated incrementally.\nFile-Based Routing\nUses a simple file-based routing system where files in the pages directory automatically become routes in the application.\nAPI Routes\nProvides a way to create backend endpoints as serverless functions, simplifying server-side logic management.\nAutomatic Code Splitting\nSplits code automatically to load only the necessary JavaScript for the requested page, improving performance.\nBuilt-in CSS and Sass Support\nSupports importing CSS and Sass files, along with CSS Modules for scoped styles.\nTypeScript Support\nOut-of-the-box TypeScript support, making it easy to integrate TypeScript into your Next.js application.\nImage Optimization\nProvides an Image component for automatic optimization of images, including lazy loading and responsive sizing.\nFast Refresh\nFeatures fast refresh for React components, providing immediate feedback during development without losing component state.\nNext.js combines these features to create a highly efficient and developer-friendly framework for building modern web applications, balancing the benefits of both static and dynamic rendering.\n\n\nNext.js -

But these two hours are challenging and really push your limits.\nEvery programmer needs to take a leap--from learning the syntax of a programming language or framework to solving real-world problems using what you have learned.\nFor example, a WHILE or FOR loop is very easy to learn. But nesting two loops together and adding an IF statement, you got yourself a bubble sorting algorithm. From there, you can make further improvements, turning the bubble sorting into the much more efficient cocktail sorting.\nThis leap is vital but not easy to take. It calls for creativity, which can be trained. This is also the goal of this lesson, helping and forcing you to take the vital leap.\nIn the first section, we will show you a couple of creative techniques that can significantly improve your code quality, giving you a new perspective of code design.\nVery often, the solution also imposes obstacles. The solution for problem A is often incompatible with that of problem B. This requires you to be flexible, finding ways to get around obstacles.\nThe second section covers eight carefully picked sorting algorithms.\nSorting algorithms are the barbell for your brain. Honestly speaking, you probably never need to write a sorting program in your real-world projects. Basically, every language has built-in methods dedicated to sorting array elements. But it is the process, not the result, that matters. The process of creating a sorting program forces you to exercise your brain and enhance your logical reasoning. You won't see the benefit right away, but in the long term, you will benefit immensely from it.",

A payment system must be securely integrated into your development environment, your testing infrastructure, and your database. Your users will become customers when they pay and they have expectations of user experience and security when it comes to payment. Last but not least you need to be aware of the legal requirements that are a lot stricter when doing online payments.\nIt’s a lot, but don’t panic. This is exactly the course that covers all these topics and gives you tips and best practices from implementing SaaS payment systems for over 15 years.\nWe will start with the fundamentals of how online payment works. We’ll cover all important terms and definitions. So no matter if you are coding the implementation yourself or managing the payment integration project or leading the development team, after this course you know how everything works and can make elaborate decisions about the integration.\nWe are not providing a copy & paste tutorial in this course, this is about the bigger picture to make sure you don’t forget to address the important parts when doing the payment integration. It helps you to choose the right payment service provider (from where you finally get some copy & paste code snippets) and how you need to prepare your existing system to fulfill all the technical and legal requirements.\nBecause payment integration has a high demand for security all payment service providers offer similar approaches to integration. We will cover the different approaches with all the pros and cons to give you the know-how to choose the payment provider that really fits your needs. This course is completely vendor and technology agnostic so all the learned approaches can easily be applied to your existing tech stack and the payment service provider of your choice.\nHaving covered the technical aspects of the integration we will also talk about all the areas a customer is expecting from a paid service in terms of user experience. So that the flow from a free user to a paid customer is as seamless and intuitive as possible which immediately leads to higher conversion rates.\nFinally, we will talk about legal regulations, how they affect the payment process, what you need to be aware of, and what you should check with your lawyer and/or accountant. In terms of legal regulations, we focus on the European Union.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a deep understanding of how the different parts of your SaaS need to integrate and connect with a third-party payment service provider to provide a great UX and secure payment processes. You have the ability to choose a fitting payment service and integration approach based on your requirements. You know the potential obstacles and how best to overcome them. You see and understand the big picture of online payment and know the purpose of each aspect of the integration architecture. With this knowledge, you are well equipped to manage or implement a payment integration project yourself.\nAbout the Lecturer\nChristian Haintz has been writing code for over 20 years. He has co-founded more than one startup and created several SaaS products that are being used in over 100 countries. Sharing his insights isn’t new to him either because he has already taught at Universities and mentorship programs.",

Here's a glimpse into the types of questions you can expect:\nFoundational Queries: These questions assess your understanding of the basics, such as Angular's architecture, module system, and component lifecycle.\nCode Snippets: You'll be presented with blocks of code, requiring you to identify outputs, potential errors, or suggest optimizations.\nScenario-based Questions: These questions place you in hypothetical situations, asking how you might approach specific tasks or troubleshoot issues in an Angular project.\nConceptual Questions: Dive deep into Angular's core philosophies, from its emphasis on reactive programming to its robust form validation techniques.\nBest Practices and Patterns: Questions that challenge your knowledge of industry-accepted best practices, design patterns, and performance optimization techniques in Angular.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Angular:\n1. What is Angular, and how is it different from AngularJS?\nAngular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. Angular is a complete rewrite of its predecessor, AngularJS. While AngularJS was based on the model-view-controller (MVC) design, Angular uses a component-based architecture.\n2. How does Angular's component-based architecture work?\nAngular applications are composed of a set of nested components, each encapsulating its own view, data, and behavior. Components communicate with one another using inputs, outputs, and services, allowing for a modular and reusable structure.\n3. What are directives in Angular?\nDirectives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular templates. They can change the structure of the DOM or modify its attributes. There are three types of directives: component directives, structural directives (like *ngIf and *ngFor), and attribute directives (like ngStyle and ngClass).\n4. What's the difference between template-driven and reactive forms?\nTemplate-driven forms are driven by derivatives in the template itself, using ngModel. Reactive forms are more robust, scalable, and reusable, and they are defined in the component class using the FormBuilder, FormGroup, and FormControl classes.\n5. How does Angular handle dependency injection?\nDependency Injection (DI) is a core feature of Angular, allowing a class to request dependencies from external sources rather than creating them. Angular's DI provides instances of services or values that a class needs to perform its function.\n6. What are Observables in Angular?\nObservables, coming from the RxJS library, are used in Angular to handle asynchronous operations and events. They provide a way to handle streams of data over time, allowing for complex operations like map, filter, and merge to be performed.\n7. How does Angular's change detection mechanism work?\nAngular checks for changes in the data properties and updates the DOM to reflect those changes. It uses a zone.js library to intercept asynchronous operations, then runs change detection to check the old and the new values. Developers can optimize this process by using strategies like OnPush.\n8. What's the purpose of Angular's NgModules?\nNgModules consolidate components, directives, and pipes into cohesive blocks of functionality. They provide a compilation context for templates and can also play a role in application runtime configuration.\n9. How can you optimize the performance of an Angular application?\nThere are various strategies: implementing lazy loading for modules, using the OnPush change detection strategy, optimizing the build using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, minimizing the number of HTTP requests, and using trackBy with *ngFor are some popular techniques.\n10. What is the Angular CLI, and what can it do?\nAngular CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps automate the development workflow. It can be used to create a new Angular application, generate components, services, modules, and perform tasks like testing, building, and deploying the application.\n\n\nThese varied question types ensure that you have a well-rounded grasp of both the theoretical and practical aspects of Angular development.\nWith our Angular Developer MCQ Practice Quiz, you're not just answering questions - you're gearing up to become an Angular expert.\nEnroll today and embark on a transformative learning experience.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Node.js: Building Scalable and High-Performance Applications course by Uplatz.\n\n\nNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side. Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed for building scalable, high-performance applications by utilizing an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This makes it especially well-suited for applications that require real-time interactions, such as web servers, REST APIs, and streaming services. Additionally, Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which provides access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools to streamline development.\n\n\nHow Node.js Works\n\n\nEvent-driven, non-blocking I/O model: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it lightweight and efficient. This means that when a request is made to the server, it doesn't block other requests from being processed. Instead, it continues to process other requests and once the initial request is complete, it emits an event to notify the server.\nSingle-threaded: Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple requests. This is different from traditional web servers which use multiple threads to handle requests. Node.js can handle a large number of requests concurrently due to its non-blocking I/O model.\nModules: Node.js has a rich ecosystem of modules that can be used to perform various tasks. These modules can be easily installed using the npm (Node Package Manager) tool.\n\n\nCore Features of Node.js\n\n\nAsynchronous and event-driven: All APIs of Node.js are asynchronous, meaning that the server doesn't wait for an API to return data. It moves to the next API after calling it, and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.\nFast: Node.js library is very fast in code execution because it is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine.\nSingle-threaded but highly scalable: Node.js uses a single-threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.\nNo buffering: Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.\n\n\nBenefits of using Node.js\n\n\nScalability: Node.js is highly scalable due to its non-blocking I/O model and event-driven architecture.\nPerformance: Node.js is very fast and efficient due to its use of the V8 JavaScript engine and its non-blocking I/O model.\nEasy to learn: Node.js is easy to learn for developers who are already familiar with JavaScript.\nLarge community: Node.js has a large and active community which provides support and contributes to the development of the platform.\n\n\nSome of the reasons why you should learn Node.js\n\n\nHigh demand: Node.js is in high demand and there are many job opportunities available for Node.js developers.\nFull-stack development: Node.js can be used for both front-end and back-end development, which allows developers to build full-stack web applications using a single language.\nMicroservices: Node.js is well-suited for building microservices, which are small, independent services that can be deployed and scaled independently.\nReal-time applications: Node.js is ideal for building real-time applications such as chat applications, online games, and collaboration tools.\n\n\nNode.js - Course Curriculum\n\n\nModule 1.

It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with Continuous modifications. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.\n\n\nWhat is NextJs ?\nNextjs is a React-based framework developed to make web applications built with React more powerful and optimized Nextjs stands out especially with its server-side operations, SEO compatibility and fast performance Developed by Vercel, Nextjs provides many additional features and conveniences to React projects\n\n\nWhat is NextJs used for?\nNextjs is a React framework for building full-stack web applications You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Nextjs for additional features and optimizations Under the hood, Nextjs also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more\n\n\nWhat are the main uses of JavaScript?\nJavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser.\n\n\nWhat are the steps to becoming a web developer?\nSome web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching\nOAK Academy, based in London, is an online education company that offers courses in IT, Software, Design, and Development in Turkish, English, and Portuguese.

But has there been a situation when you or your client updates the theme and that all codes are gone? Well to avoid this, we can build our own custom plugins and use them instead of fucntions.php.\n\nUsing custom plugins instead of functions.php will avoid losing your codes on any updates or whatsoever. You will also not have to set up a child theme. Additionally, you can organize codes on the plugin and also hide them if required.\n\nLike you would add the codes to functions.php using the Theme Editor, you can do so by using the plugin editor too. This is very easy and most importantly there’s no need to create a child theme or have any fear of losing the codes if anything is updated. Additionally, you can take this plugin and use it on any other sites requiring similar functionality.\n\nThe tutorial is short and to the point, and with precise explanations. Please feel free to get back to me for any confusion.\n\nI really hope you will learn something valuable out of this course and protect your WordPress website.\n\n\nThanks,\nSaujan",

      "description": "Many modern frameworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue, are coded in Typescript.\nTypescript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It allows adding types to variables, constants, functions and classes. Typescript extends the capabilities of JavaScript, giving us better tooling to create projects at any scale.\nIn this course we will make a quick visit to Typescript and learn the basics for using it later in the creation of our applications. The course will consist of two parts.\nIn the first part, we will cover the fundamentals:\nWe will begin by understanding What is Typescript. Next, we will review the basic types Then, we will see examples of typed declarations After that, we will understand interfaces declarations. Furthermore, we will deep dive into classes. In addition, We will understand decorators. And, finally we will review the modules in Typescript .\n\n\nIn the second part, we will discuss about how to use TypeScript in Node projects:\nWe will setup the tools to begin. Then, we will configure a very basic node project. After that, we will create a simple project to integrate everything we have seen. Finally, we will build and distribute the resulting app .\n\n\nSo welcome to the course and let's start!",

If you know Italian, you can find my React starter course here on Udemy.\nIn this course, you will find Customerly apps code snippets. We will also discuss how we used the packages we will see in this course in production environments. This is better than having a simple test project because we can see how these packages behave in production environment applications.\nAll the packages in this course are used with Typescript, which is a big pro when using React, because it permits you to save from some mistakes in the code and declare clear types.\nWhat do we talk about in this course?\nReact Router: In the React Router course chapter, we will see how to use the last version of React Router (v6.8) also using new data APIs. We will see how to manage new projects with new React Router functions and old projects with React Router components.\nTanstack React Query: In the Tanstack React Query course chapter, we learn how to use this powerful library to manage API requests and save them in the cache. A library sponsored by some big players like GitHub, Vercel, and Retool.\nFacebook RecoilJS: RecoilJS is a state container library created by Facebook developers. In the Recoil course chapter, we will see how to use the library with atoms and selectors, with some conventions we use in Customerly.\ni18next: In the i18next course chapter, we will talk about this fantastic localization framework, and we will also see the react-i18next package. Other than this, we will also see Localazy, a good service that can help us translate our applications.\nTips and tricks: There is a chapter dedicated to some tips on libraries we would have seen and some general development advice I can give for my experience.\nYou can see the lessons Curriculum here above. You can also see the previews and join the course without risks, thanks to the Money Back Guaranteed by Udemy in the first 30 days!",

In this course you will how to implement add-on to your current or future apps but at the same time show you how to add more features.\nAn add-on is a software extension that adds extra features to a program. It may extend certain functions within the program, add new items to the program's interface, or give the program additional capabilities. For example, Mozilla Firefox, a popular Web browser, supports add-ons such as the Google toolbar, ad blockers, and Web developer tools. Some computer games support add-ons that provide extra maps, new characters, or give the player game-editing capabilities.\nMost add-ons are available as self-installing packages. This means the user can simply double-click the add-on package to install the files for the corresponding program. Other add-ons may require the user to manually move files into specific directories. While not all programs support add-ons, many programs are now developed with add-on support, since it provides a simple way for other developers to extend the functions of the program.\nFrom Beginner to Expert CodeIgniter Developer\nWe know that you’re here because you value your time. If you wanted to watch someone program for hours and hours without explaining what they’re doing, you’d be on elsewhere.\nBy getting this course, you can be rest assured that the course is carefully thought out and edited. The course is practical oriented and it is a not waste time course as we learn by practical.\nDon’t waste your time\nDon’t waste another minute of your precious life on poor quality videos. Or instructors who you can’t understand. Or teachers who have no real world in-person teaching experience. Your time is precious. Take this course and find out why everybody is raving about it.\nSign up today, and look forwards to:\nBuilding complete add-on features to our standard school management system.\nAll the knowledge you need to start building any web app you want\nChallenges and Solutions\nFast and helpful support if you need anything or have questions\nMy great sense of humor.\nBe ready to build meaningful software quickly\nCome join me in this small adventure!",

And if you’re not selling online yet, you’re already behind.\nIn a world where eCommerce is booming and every second person is launching a product, a course, or a side hustle, being able to build your own online store isn’t just a skill—it’s a survival tool. But here’s the catch: most people get stuck paying developers, wasting money on plugins they don’t need, or struggling with complicated platforms they can’t understand.\nThis course changes everything.\n“Build Ecommerce Website With WooCommerce WordPress For FREE” is your shortcut to launching your own beautiful, functional online store—without writing a single line of code and without paying for expensive software. You’ll go from zero to a full-fledged eCommerce business in just a few hours. Whether you're selling physical products, digital files, or even offering courses or downloads—this course gives you the complete toolkit.\nNo fluff. No theory. Just pure, practical, real-world implementation.\nWe start by teaching you how to structure your site with WordPress and WooCommerce—the world’s most popular free eCommerce plugin. Then we’ll move on to design using Elementor (free version), install the necessary plugins, and add features like multi-currency, payment gateways, product variations, and more.\nYou’ll learn how to build every element of an online store that customers trust and want to buy from. We’ll even show you how to test your products and make sure everything works before launching.\nNow here’s the brutal truth: If you don’t know how to build your own online store, you’ll always depend on someone else—freelancers, developers, platforms that charge a monthly fee just for existing. This isn’t sustainable. What happens when you want to add a product, tweak your design, or launch a flash sale? You’ll either waste time, waste money—or worse, lose customers.\nThat’s why this course doesn’t just teach you the \"how\" but gives you full control.\nBy the end of the course, you will have your own fully operational eCommerce store up and running. You’ll have the power to sell anything, anywhere—and scale it the way you want.\nAnd the best part? It’s 100 percent free. You don’t need to purchase any premium plugins or themes.

But the web is extremely diverse - the things we build on the web may vary drastically in form and scale. With that in mind, Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable.

      "description": "Welcome to Web Development Bootcamp: Building SaaS with Python & Django course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn how to build a fully functional expense tracker SaaS website from scratch using Django, HTML, and CSS. This course is a perfect combination between Python and web development, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in SaaS business. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Django, such as getting to know its use cases and technical limitations. Then, in the next section we will create the project folder and install all Python packages needed for this project. Afterward, we will start the project. Firstly, we are going to create a function to enable users to upload a file or image and build optical character recognition using EasyOCR so the system can extract text and transaction amounts from the scanned receipt. This feature enables users to save time by automatically capturing essential expense details without the need for manual entry. Next, we are going to create a function to allow users to add, update, and delete transactions manually. This feature enables users to manage their data with full flexibility and maintain accurate records. Following that, we are also going to create a spending tracker dashboard where users can view a table of recent transactions in a structured and readable layout. This feature enables users to easily track their day to day expenses and gain a clear overview of their spending activity. In the next section, we are going to build expense categorization and data visualization features, allowing users to assign categories such as utilities, travel, healthcare, shopping, entertainment, food and dining. Additionally, the users will also be able to visualize their spending data, for example, the system can present the data using a bar chart to show the top three spending categories and a pie chart showing category breakdown in percentages format. Then, after that, we are going to create a system that detects duplicate transactions and allows users to remove them, while also enabling users to set budget limits for each category. This feature enables users to avoid redundant entries and receive alerts or notification when their spending exceeds the budget. In addition, we are going to create synthetic data for simulation, which will support testing and demonstration purposes. Lastly, at the end of the course, we will conduct functional and performance testing to ensure each feature works correctly and the website performs well under different conditions.\nFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we use Django for web development? Well, here is my answer, Django is a powerful and well organized web framework that helps developers build secure and robust applications quickly. It handles many common tasks, such as user authentication, form handling, database operations, and page routing. This allows you to focus more on building your core features instead of starting everything from scratch. Even if you have limited experience in front end web development, Django makes the process easier by providing built in tools and a clear project structure. Additionally, Django is easy to integrate with other tools and supports a smooth deployment process, making it a great choice for building any type of websites or applications.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of Django, such as getting to know its use cases, technical limitations, and main features\nLearn how to build spending tracker SaaS using Python, Django, HTML, and CSS\nLearn how to create web home page and add multiple tabs\nLearn how to create function for uploading file\nLearn how to build optical character recognition system using EasyOCR\nLearn how to create functions to add, update, and delete data\nLearn how to build spending analytics dashboard\nLearn how to create functions for generating bar chart and pie chart\nLearn how to create function to detect duplicates\nLearn how to set up page routing and create custom filters\nLearn how to create HTML document structure and style tabs using CSS\nLearn how to design navigation and tab structure\nLearn how to design user interface for file scanner and OCR\nLearn how to design user interface for expense & analytics dashboard\nLearn how to design user interface for duplicate detection and budget alert tabs\nLearn how to perform functional and performance testing",

      "description": "In this symfony api project, I explained how to authenticate users with their Google accounts.\n\n\nSymfony application using Google OAuth for authentication. When a user signs in through Google, our system will check if the user already exists in our database. If not, it will create a new user account. Once authenticated, either as a new or existing user, our application will generate a JSON Web Token (JWT). Built on the API Platform.\n\n\nCreating Symfony Applications\nsymfony new my_project_directory\nThe Symfony MakerBundle\ncomposer require --dev symfony/maker-bundle\nAPI Platform\ncomposer require api\ndoctrine/annotations\ncomposer require doctrine/annotations\nLexikJWTAuthenticationBundle\ncomposer require \"lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle\"\nGoogle Provider for OAuth 2.0 Client\ncomposer require league/oauth2-google\n\n\nEnglish Explanation of the Project\nIntroduction\nThis project revolves around integrating Google Sign-In in a Symfony-based application. The primary goal is to provide users with a seamless and secure login experience using their Google accounts. To achieve this, we leveraged the thephpleague/oauth2-google package. Additionally, we utilized JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and efficient user authentication, particularly in API requests.\n\n\nChoice of Technology\nWe chose Symfony for its robust framework capabilities, offering extensive support for web application development. API Platform was selected for its ability to easily create high-performance RESTful APIs. The thephpleague/oauth2-google package was particularly useful for handling Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flows in a standardized manner.\n\n\nArchitectural Overview\nThe application architecture is designed to support RESTful API standards, primarily managed through Symfony and API Platform. This structure allows for efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses, and it seamlessly integrates with the Google authentication process.\n\n\nGoogle Sign-In Integration\nIntegration of Google Sign-In was accomplished by incorporating the thephpleague/oauth2-google package into the Symfony project. This package facilitated the authentication process with Google's OAuth 2.0 servers, allowing users to securely log in with their Google accounts. We managed the OAuth 2.0 flow, including token retrieval and validation, ensuring a secure login process.\n\n\nJWT for Authentication\nJWT played a crucial role in authenticating API requests. After successful Google Sign-In, users were provided with a JWT, which was used for subsequent API requests to authenticate the user. This token-based approach enhances security by ensuring that each request is verified and authenticated, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\n\nChallenges and Solutions\nThe integration presented several challenges, particularly in aligning the Google authentication flow with the existing Symfony framework and ensuring seamless JWT handling. These were overcome through careful configuration and testing, ensuring that the authentication process was both secure and user-friendly.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe project successfully implemented Google Sign-In and JWT authentication in a Symfony application with API Platform, enhancing both the user experience and security. This implementation demonstrates the effective use of third-party authentication services and token-based authentication in modern web application development.",

Each concept is explained well and in as simple words as possible.\nThen the next section is all about the action of coding. First, we will see how to install Tailwind CSS and use it in Vue 3 with JIT mode, then how to create a Firebase project and lastly it is all about coding an app with a proper firebase authentication system. I have been coding web applications for various sizes of companies for 6+ years. I will be putting in all my experience and learning to create this app so that you could also use it to develop your next portfolio or your dream project.\nPlease note that this app is developed completely client-side using serverless logic of Firebase and APIs. However, you could use the same client-side logic and substitute Firebase APIs with your own APIs as per your API logic.\nAbout the App\nThis is app is for educational purposes and is meant to be used ethically.\nWe will be creating a Vue 3 app that will take an IP address and will make an API call to get the details of that IP address. Using Google Maps API we will then plot the location of that IP on the map.\nWe will be then deploying this app on AWS Amplify using Github.\nThis app is developed with line by line code explanation. We will be login in, login out and registering the user using Firebase Auth API and will also put a navigation guard on the route so that only authenticated users could use our IP app. We are storing user details in Vuex and hydrating the store on page refresh.\n\n\nThe mastery time for this course depends from person to person but if you take and study this course properly then you could at least use Vue comfortably for any projects. Of course, some practice will be required from your side but this course will give a clear direction and understanding of  Vue 3 and composition API.\n\n\nDisclaimer for the course\nAll the information provided in this course is published in good faith and for general information purpose only.

Kubernetes appeared to be the next logical step to explore, and once having the containers, came the time to understand how to orchestrate them. If you are already familiar with containers concepts, and you would also like to learn how to orchestrate them, then this course is for you.\nSince I was looking for something practical and fast enough in order to test the orchestration concepts I choose the microk8s environment. Please be assured that all the commands running with microk8s environment are also valid Kubernetes commands, so the examples provided behave the same way as if they run on a production Kubernetes cluster.\nThis course will give you the opportunity to:\ndevelop straight from your console / terminal\nuse microk8s, which offers the lightest possible Kubernetes distribution for testing on your own machine. This means you wont need a special hosting or a powerful server in order to work with the provided examples\ngain stability and assurance that you can apply the learned skills in practice\nharness the power of Kubernetes in order to manage web applications\nAll the videos show hands on approaches, so you'll just need to follow on and try the examples at your own pace. At the same time in order to explain the concepts in the environment of Kubernetes I will guide you through the lectures' content. In case you need further theoretical background, I advise you to check the official Kubernetes documentation.\nAs you might have projects requiring a specific setup, you can use the course material as a base from which you can start, customize and build on, adapting the examples to your own needs. Additionally you will learn how to build Docker images, and I am sure you will enjoy the course if you like to self experiment.\nWhat you'll need in order to start with the course:\nBasic knowledge of Docker in order to fully understand the examples\nThe course is useful for:\nweb developers, who would like to enter in the world of containers and orchestration\nanyone, who wants to try these modern concepts in practice on their local machine\nweb enthusiasts, who want to transfer their project workloads on Kubernetes\nI am staying open for questions on the implementations provided.\nPlease, enjoy and see you soon!\nUPDATE: The Course material is now compatible with Ubuntu, Windows and Mac operating systems!",

Upon doing that, we will handle req and res to our pages. Later we will refactor them to EJS and reconfigure the layout to make it easier for coding and condense the code on each file. After that, we connect to MongoDB and cover the CRUD method in the app where we send commands to the backend in a test.js file and see the results in our console.\n\n\nWe connect the backend to our app to show data for our blog post, and put our code into a controllers, models, and middleware folders to organize our code. We create a user sign up - login and logout function, and where the user must be validated to created a post. Lastly, we add a text editor for the create post page and deploy it to Heroku. Prior to deployment, I cover what were on the files we created in case you may have missed anything or you are getting errors.\n\n\nAfter taking this course you will have an understanding of how to engage CRUD operations with Node and MongoDB, then create your own apps from scratch. Whenever you do create one, please share with me, I'd love to see how it looks!!!",

You can also use it to create one-page applications and handle animations, interactive elements, and graphics. Generating projects is also possible with the user-built presets, which is commonly applicable for coders working in enterprise environments. Because it is based on JavaScript, you can easily integrate Vue into an existing JS project. Vue uses the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which means that the core library of Vue.js focuses on the view layer by default. It enforces a one-way data flow between components. This also makes it easy for you to integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue also uses virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which makes it faster than regular DOM. Instead of re-rendering the whole page, Vue only updates the objects that you change.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Vue and React?\nAlthough Vue has an MVC architecture, you cannot use it with a different architectural approach, which differs from the Component Based Architecture (CBA) used in React. They also differ in how they optimize data. When a component’s state changes in React, it triggers the re-render of the entire component sub-tree, starting at that component as the root. Vue automatically tracks a component’s dependencies during its render, so the system knows which components actually need to re-render when the state changes. In React, everything is in JavaScript. Vue, on the other hand, embraces web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows you to build off of them. Another difference between these frameworks is how you can scale up your projects. React only offers a single template that assumes you’re building a single-page application, while Vue offers several default options for multiple purposes and build systems.\n\n\nIs Vue JS easy to learn?\nVue JS can be easy to learn. Unlike other frontend technologies, Vue doesn’t require in-depth knowledge of libraries. If you want to start learning Vue, all you need to have is basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Compared to other coding technologies, developers typically classify Vue.js as having an easy learning curve. This is due largely in part to Vue’s reputation for having an elegant programming style and patterns. Because Vue is a progressive framework, it makes it easy for you to use it to integrate into an existing project. Because of its familiar templating syntax and use of components, you may find that integrating or migrating existing projects to Vue is fairly straightforward. Vue is known for offering a vast ecosystem of tools and companion libraries, making it a simple framework that you can use to respond to the complex needs of enterprise-grade applications.\n\n\nWhat is Vuex used for?\nVuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue. js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.\n\n\nWhat is difference between Vue and Vuex?\nVue is a progressive Javascript framework and Vuex is the state management tool. We can use redux or flux inside Vue, But Vuex is native to the Vue.\n\n\nWhy do I need Vuex?\nVuex is a popular way to handle a complex app's authentication in Vue. With Vuex, you're able to handle the token's availability and access controls and route blocks throughout your app. Mutations, getters, and setters assist with this task.\n\n\nHow does Vuex store work?\nIt works by having a central store for shared state, and providing methods to allow any component in your application to access that state. In essence, Vuex ensures your views remain consistent with your application data, regardless of which function triggers a change to your application data.\n\n\nWhen Should I Use It?\nVuex helps us deal with shared state management with the cost of more concepts and boilerplate. It's a trade-off between short term and long term productivity.\nIf you've never built a large-scale SPA and jump right into Vuex, it may feel verbose and daunting. That's perfectly normal- if your app is simple, you will most likely be fine without Vuex. A simple store pattern (opens new window)may be all you need. But if you are building a medium-to-large-scale SPA, chances are you have run into situations that make you think about how to better handle state outside of your Vue components, and Vuex will be the natural next step for you.\n\n\nWhat is JavaScript?\nJavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.\n\n\nWhy is JavaScript important?\nJavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.\n\n\nWhat are the main uses of JavaScript?\nJavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.\n\n\nReact vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?\nChoosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.\n\n\nWhat is JSON and what is it used for?\nBecause of the evolution of the JavaScript language, JavaScript has a variety of techniques for creating objects. But, ultimately in the background, JavaScript is using a syntax called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a standard text-based format used to represent objects in JavaScript. The same basic types of data represented in Javascript can also be represented in JSON, including strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and JavaScript objects. Although JSON is based on the JavaScript object, it is not just used in JavaScript. It is also used as a format to transfer data from a web browser to a server and vice versa because of the format's simplicity and small size. The JSON format is used in REST APIs for this purpose and has replaced XML as the standard format for many APIs. Because of this, just about any language you use will have a method of converting data into JSON to interact with REST APIs.\n\n\nHow can I teach myself Javascript?\nOne of the best ways to learn to write code is through an online course that teaches you how to write JavaScript with an instructor that will explain the code, what versions you should use, and why. Learning to develop a real-world application, with an instructor explaining in a step-by-step fashion, will teach you modern code techniques.\n\n\nWhat is the best IDE for Javascript?\nWith all of the different JavaScript IDEs available, the best option depends on how you intend to use it, along with your personal preferences. Webstorm is a popular JavaScript IDE from JetBrains. It provides fast static code analysis, integrated testing, local history, code refactoring, and debugging. While the IDE requires a paid subscription, many developers swear by it because of its compatibility with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those searching for a free option might prefer VS Code. This general-purpose, open-source IDE comes with IntelliSense, Git integration, and debugging features built-in. Many third-party extensions are available to add new language and programming features, making it one of the more flexible choices. Atom is another general-purpose IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers. It is also free, open-source, and has third-party extensions to add functionality.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Way, Simple and Easy With Exercises\nFresh Content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate.

      "description": "Welcome to Building Realtime Chat App with Chat Engine IO & Socket IO course. This is an extensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build and design a fully functioning real time chat app just like Whatsapp or Facebook messengers. To build the chat app, we are going to use Javascript programming language alongside with websocket which will enable real time delivery messages and also Chat Engine IO which is a chat API that enables developers to integrate real-time chat to their website . In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of web socket and get to know more about the chat app project that you are going to build. We are going to specifically talk about use cases and main features of real time chat apps. Then, in the next session, you will extensively learn about how websocket actually works, specifically, you will learn about interaction between server and client. Once, you have learnt all necessary knowledge about real time chat app and websocket, then, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section, firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up your IDE, in this case, we are going to use VS Code as the IDE. Afterward, you will also learn step by step on how to set up a Chat Engine IO account and learn more about its documentation. Once everything is ready, we are going to get started building the real time chat app, the project section is consisted of two main parts, in the first part you will build a real time chat app using Chat Engine IO, meanwhile, in the second part, you will build real time chat app using Socket IO. Then, once the real time chat app has been built, we are going to be conducting testing on the app to make sure that it has been fully functioning and it has a friendly user interface. This course will be focusing on four main testing objectives, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing. Lastly, at the end of the course, we are going to talk about future enhancement and additional feature ideas to make the chat app even better, such as adding end to end encryption feature, adding screen sharing feature, adding voice and video calling features.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we build a real time chat app? Don’t you think the market for this particular product has been oversaturated since almost all social media platforms already have their own versions of chat app or direct messenger feature? Well, here is my answer, obviously building your own real time chat app is not intended to compete with Whatsapp or Facebook Messengers, instead, the chat app will be integrated with other projects, for instance, in a game application, the chat app can be used for communication between players, enhancing their gaming experience and facilitating teamwork or in E-commerce store, the chat app can be used to facilitate customer support, answer product queries, and help users make purchasing decisions. In addition to that, you are also going to learn a lot of valuable knowledge and skill sets from building real time chat apps, especially for those of you who are interested in app development, having this project in your portfolio can be used to showcase your capabilities to your future employers or future clients. Last but not least, knowing how to build a chat app can potentially open a lot of opportunities, both in your professional career or as an entrepreneur.\nBelow are things that you are going to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of real time chat app and WebSocket\nLearn how WebSocket works specifically the interaction between server and client\nLearn how to create new user and new chat on Chat Engine IO\nLearn how to connect your chat app with Chat Engine IO API\nLearn how to initialize React project on VS Code terminal\nLearn step by step on how to build a real time chat app using Chat Engine IO\nLearn how to customize chat app user interface\nLearn how to enable email notification for chat app\nLearn step by step on how to build a real time chat app using Socket IO\nConduct testing to make sure the chat app has been fully functioning\nLearn several testing methods for chat app, such as functionality, user experience, performance, and compatibility testings\nGet to know several additional features that could be added to improve the chat app, such as end to end encryption, screen sharing, voice calling, video calling, and multi devices integration\nAdditional Projects\nBuilding Basic User Authentication System Using JavaScript:\nIn this project, you'll create a simple user authentication system using JavaScript, which allows users to securely sign up, log in, and manage their sessions. By utilizing tools like local storage or server-side authentication, you can ensure that user data is protected and securely handled, giving you a solid foundation in building web applications that require user authentication.\nDesigning Chat App User Interface Using UX Pilot AI:\nIn this project, you'll use UX Pilot AI, an AI-driven text-to-UI design generator, to create a sleek and functional chat app user interface. By inputting design requirements and features, the AI will help you generate a professional UI design quickly, providing you with a layout that's optimized for usability and enhancing the user experience, which you can then integrate into your chat application.",

You can save all your website files to your pc / laptop or hard disk and restore or migrate it to another domain. Both methods, where you have the access to cpanel and where you can’t access cpanel have been demonstrated. No any paid plugins will be used, but you will have the full access of the database (same as we access from cpanel > PHPMyAdmin).\nSometime some of the clients do not have access to their cpanel but only can login to their WordPress website – using one of the method shown here you can backup the website’s files (contents, plugins, themes, theme settings etc) and Database without having to access the cpanel. The other method when every login is available has also been demonstrated.\nThe course also shows how to transfer the website from one domain to another domain –  while having all the access and logins or without having cpanel login but only with Wordpress login.\nAll instructions with Live & running websites as examples!\nI really hope these methods will be of great help especially to the freelancers where clients have different requirements.\nHappy Learning!",

      "description": "Welcome to Building Video Call App with Javascript, Supabase and WebRTC course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn how to build real time video call applications similar to Zoom and WhatsApp. This course is a perfect combination between web development and WebRTC, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in real time network communication. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of WebRTC, such as getting to know its use cases, technical limitations, and key features. Then, in the next section, you will learn how WebRTC works in a video call app. This section covers the step by step process starting from user media capture, creating a peer connection, signaling to exchange metadata, offer answer exchange, interactive connectivity establishment, establishing peer to peer connection, streaming media, maintaining connection, and handling disconnect. Afterward, in the next section, you will learn about all features that you will build in this project, those features include basic user authentication, realtime video and audio communication, join request host approval, mute and unmute video and audio. Following that, we will start the project, firstly, we will start with the backend, we will build a basic user authentication system and integrate it with Supabase. This feature ensures that only users with the correct email and password can log in which adds a layer of security to the app. Following that, we also will implement Socket IO to handle real-time signaling between users. This feature enables seamless communication between peers by exchanging metadata required to set up and manage video call connections.\nOnce it has been set up, we will establish the peer to peer connection using WebRTC protocols.\nThis allows users to directly connect and communicate without relying on a centralized media server, ensuring low latency and high quality streaming. Then, after that, we will create functions to allow users to mute and unmute their audio and video streams during a call.\nThis feature gives users full control over their communication and privacy throughout the session. Afterward, we will design a clean and user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.\nThis ensures the application is easy to use and visually appealing. Lastly, at the end of the course, we will test the video call app using two testing methods, performance testing and functionality testing. By doing so, we will be able to ensure the app runs smoothly under different conditions and all features work as expected.\nBefore getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we build a video call app using WebRTC? Well, here is my answer, this project strengthens your understanding of real-time communication and exposes you to the same core technologies used by platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. The skills you will learn, for example, setting up peer-to-peer connections, handling signaling, and implementing secure user authentication are not only limited to video call apps. They can also be applied to other projects including live chat systems, live streaming platforms, and E-learning softwares. These are highly in demand skills that open doors to a variety of career paths in tech and media industries.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of WebRTC, such as getting to know its use cases, technical limitations, and main features\nLearn how WebRTC works in a video call app. This section covers user media capture, creating a peer connection, signaling to exchange metadata, offer answer exchange, interactive connectivity establishment, establishing peer to peer connection, streaming media, maintaining connection, and handling disconnect\nLearn about video call app features like user authentication, real time video and audio communication, join request host approval system, and audio video muting\nLearn how to build video call app using Socket IO and WebRTC\nLearn how to install Express JS and Socket IO\nLearn how to create Socket server and join room logic\nLearn how to create SDP offer answer exchange using Socket IO\nLearn how to setup Supabase storage for user authentication\nLearn how to build basic user authentication system\nLearn how to create functions for login, signup, and logout\nLearn how to create functions to start video call and access user media\nLearn how to create function for joining video call room and structure host approval workflow\nLearn how to create WebRTC peer connection and send SDP offer\nLearn how to create functions to handle SDP offer and answer\nLearn how to create functions to generate meeting room ID, mute audio, and mute video\nLearn how to design video call app dashboard\nLearn how to design login and signup page\nLearn how to style video call app user interface with CSS\nLearn how to conduct performance and functionality testings",

      "description": "Welcome to \"Next.js | Master Modern Web Development From Scratch\" course.\nNextjs | Build React-based SEO friendly web applications with SSR, static rendering, Firebase and next js Travel app\n\n\nNextjs is an open-source web development framework created by the private company Vercel providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static rendering. You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Nextjs features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, and caching - all while improving the developer and end-user experience\n\n\nNext.js is a React-based framework developed to make web applications built with React more powerful and optimized. Next js stands out especially with its server-side operations, SEO compatibility and fast performance Developed by Vercel, Nextjs provides many additional features and conveniences to React projects\n\n\nFeatures of Nextjs\nNextjs is a powerful React framework that enhances React's capabilities to build server-rendered and statically generated web applications. Below are some of its key features:\nServer-side Rendering (SSR): This boosts SEO and performance by rendering pages on the server Content is available for search engines to index, and users see a fully rendered page right away, enhancing the first load experience\nStatic Site Generation (SSG): This method pre-renders pages at build time, ensuring they load quickly\nAutomatic Code Splitting: This feature splits your application code into smaller bundles, optimizing load times by only loading the code required for the current page\nFlexible Data Fetching: Nextjs offers several ways to fetch data, such as getStaticProps for build-time data and getServerSideProps for fetching data on every request This flexibility allows you to select the best approach for your needs\nRouting: Nextjs simplifies routing by automatically creating routes based on your pages directory structure, making it easy to manage URLs\nImage Optimization: Nextjs automatically optimizes images by resizing and compressing them for faster loading times and better SEO\nBuilt-in CSS and JavaScript Bundling: Nextjs takes care of bundling and optimizing both CSS and JavaScript, simplifying the development process\nAPI Routes: You can create serverless functions directly within your application using API routes, adding backend functionality to your React app without needing a separate server\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn to develop powerful web applications with Nextjs from the ground up Whether you're completely new to Nextjs or looking to strengthen your skills, this course is perfect for you\nDesigned for all skill levels, this course will take you step-by-step through essential concepts, from beginner topics to advanced techniques With hands-on examples, clear explanations, and engaging projects, you'll master the full stack of Nextjs features\n\n\nReady to build powerful web applications with Nextjs? This course is the perfect starting point!\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\nPage Rendering Logic: Understand Nextjs page rendering methods, including the App Router and Pages Router We’ll cover both, with a focus on the more modern App Router\nBasic Features: Learn how to create web pages by naming files and folders — a key feature that sets Nextjs apart from React\nAdvanced Topics: Explore how Nextjs compiles pages both on the server and client side\nData Fetching with Nextjs: Master how to fetch data dynamically in your web applications\nAuthentication with Firebase: Learn how to implement Firebase authentication in your app\nApp Router & Pages Router: Gain hands-on experience with both routing structures\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll be confident in building robust web applications with Nextjs and equipped with the skills to tackle complex projects\n\n\nWhat is NextJs used for?\nNextjs is a React framework for building full-stack web applications You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Nextjs for additional features and optimizations Under the hood, Nextjs also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more\nIs NextJs worth learning?\nYes, Nextjs is definitely worth learning, because it is a very powerful and popular framework in modern web development Nextjs supports both SSR and SSG, optimizing performance and allowing you to develop SEO-friendly web applications This feature is especially useful in projects where search engine optimization (SEO) is importantNextjs has a file-based routing system You don't need to use an extra library for routing and you can easily create dynamic routes\nIs NextJs hard to learn?\nNextjs is not hard to learn, especially if you already have a basic knowledge of JavaScript and React Since Nextjs is a framework built on React, it offers a very user-friendly experience for someone who knows React However, it can also be learned if you're completely new, because the Nextjs documentation and community is quite strong Here are the factors that can affect the learning process:\n\nWhat is Next.js vs React?\nNext JS is a framework that holds React on its base, while React JS is an open-source JavaScript library, developed and maintained by Facebook. Next JS is used to create web applications and performs server-side rendering, whereas React JS focuses on rendering towards the DOM.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company OAK Academy gives education in the field of IT, Software, Design, development in Turkish, English, Portuguese, and a lot of different language on Udemy platform where it has over 2000 hours of video education lessons.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise\n\n\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our content is created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you the best learning experience\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nWe offer full support, answering any questions\n\n\nDive in now into the \"Next.js | Master Modern Web Development From Scratch\" course.\nNextjs | Build React-based SEO friendly web applications with SSR, static rendering, Firebase and next js Travel app",

Code and authenticate like a pro!\n- Request and Response classes\n- Your very own .env parser, so you can easily have your own .env variables!\n- Return a model or collection of models just like laravel, no need to encode into JSON!\n\n\nSo...\nIf you are ready to embark on a new journey and advance your PHP and MySQL skills, this is the course for you!",

We will also add the tooltip which like dropping from the heart icon and it will disppear after a few seconds. This tooltip display how many users just following you.\nAlso, the tooltip of the search will render only when user click on the input box. The search icon will disappear when\n\n\n\n\nWhy Nextjs?\nAll of the React components that make up a website's user-facing section are rendered on the server first. This means that after the HTML has been transmitted to the client (the user's browser), the user can read the material on the page without having to do anything further. The user perceives page loading speeds to be substantially faster as a result of this.\nSSR also provides an out-of-the-box, indexable and crawlable website, which is critical for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) because no client-side javascript is required to view the page content. Essentially, increased technical SEO benefits our clients.\n\n\nWhy tailwindCSS?\nTailwind CSS is a popular low-level CSS framework with a lot of customization options. Bootstrap is widely used as a comparison. They are, nevertheless, essentially different. Rather of delivering pre-designed components like Bootstrap, Tailwind provides building pieces that allow developers to quickly create designs.\n\n\nWhy Daisy UI?\nDaisy UI enhances Tailwind with attractive component classes that are totally customisable and themeable. Daisy UI creates a scalable and designer-friendly design system.\n\n\nWhat we will cover\nUsing the react hook to check the user click on the inputbox or not, use the fontawesome, heroicon and daisy ui to help us create this beautiful ig header.

The client makes requests to the API in order to retrieve some information or change something within the application. Your web browser is a client — it interacts with APIs. The requested info is sent back to your browser and displayed on your screen.\n\n\nA resource is any piece of information that the API can provide the client. For instance, a resource in Facebook’s API could be a user, a page, a photo, or a post. Each resource has a unique name, called the resource identifier.\n\n\nA server is used by the application that receives client requests and contains resources that the client wants. The server has an API to interact with clients without giving them direct access to content stored in its database.\nNow for our definition. REST is a set of guidelines that software can use to communicate over the internet in order to make integrations simple and scalable. A REST API (also called a “RESTful” API) is a specific type of API that follows these guidelines.\n\n\nYou will learn\nHow  Rest API works\nAPI development and management for mobile apps i.e  Android, Iso\nAPI to power your React and Angular frontend Apps\nCI/CD  with Digital Ocean Apps platform\nConstant updates and upgrades to new technologies as relates to Api development with flask\nLearn how to secure your  API using JWT token\nLogging  for error detection  and app insights\nTogether, we will develop a student  management project which will encompass all the great topics covered in the course of the lectures",

      "description": "\"even the prime minister of Norway herself, reposted the photo to Facebook, only to have it quickly removed.\" Custodians of the Internet (Tarleton Gillespie)\nA very nice application of artificial intelligence is on content moderation. Our goal is spotting whether a content has something that should not be shown on a conversation. On this course, we use TensorFlow.js (machine learning in JavaScript), a pretrained model, for content moderation. It is very easy to use: just call the model and get a reply, a list of types of contents to be blocked and their respective flags.\n\n\nOnline Content moderation is the process by which one must decide what stays online vs. what should be moderated or even eliminated; no one is happy to be moderated, I was not when I was the target of several online moderations on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. The “Napalm girl” was a famous case in which Facebook classified as nudity, which is a historical picture.\nWhat is the best and most efficient way to safely moderate content online?\nSeveral programming savvies are doing their best. Like in String Theory, they gather the best, but no practical answer came out yet. Recently, we had chatGPT that can make sentiment analysis in an advance approach, this course shows an alternative, which is free. chatGPT has a small chart per API call. Furthermore, chatGPT requires much less coding expertise\nOn this course, I want to share a trivial case, which was not also easy to solve for a scientists, but now easily implemented as public library: direct insult (i.e., calling people names).\nThe bot is a classical pattern recognition: it gives out a number, and you must decide your tolerance for insults. This number, already standard on deep learning, is a sort of probability, loosely speaking.\nWe are going to use two MIT license Google public tools: TensorFlow.js and Angular. The former is a deep learning tool for freely creating smart web application, whereas the latter is a free framework for creating frontend application, no need to create servers.",

So, you are all set after learning HTML and CSS and you want to go further as a web developer or web designer, obviously next step would be to learn Javascript. If you will ask anyone about the three fundamentals of Web development, everyone will say, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But learning a programming language for the first time can be little intimidating and we totally understand that. You have come to the right place.\nJavaScript is the most demanding language of 2016. Yes, this is a true statement. If you had told me this statement, around 5 years back, I would not have believed you. But in present scenario, javascript is very powerful. Things like nodejs, angularjs, reactjs and almost everything that has js at the end is based on javascript. In order to learn them, javascript is a must have knowledge in the belt.\nSo what will you get in this course?\nThis course is crafted in such a manner that beginner feels right at home and if you know a little about other programming languages, you will learn best practice to write JS codes. We will start from installing a code editor, although you can stick with your favorite one too. Then we will move towards variable declaration, conditionals, loops and functions. There is an entire section to talk about functions in depth. No Javascript course can be called complete without discussing about DOM, Document Object Model. We will explore about DOM, nodes and events too. Further as a bonus section we will also have a look for installing a web server and getting our hands dirty with Ajax too.\nThis course is made with perfect recipe for the beginners. Students from 180+ countries have trusted our training quality and we are evolving everyday. On top of everything we are so sure about our quality that we offer 30 days money back guarantee, but that won’t be needed.

If you've ever wanted to build real websites and apps from scratch, this is the full stack course that takes you from beginner to confident developer — step by step.\nYou'll start with the very core of the web: HTML5 and CSS3. You'll learn how to structure pages properly, build accessible layouts, and design fully responsive websites using Flexbox, Grid, and modern CSS. You'll even master ARIA roles, semantic tags, and multimedia like video, audio, and captions.\nThen we move into JavaScript, where the magic begins. You'll understand how the browser really works. We’ll cover the latest standards (like async, defer, and modern ES functions) and apply them through hands-on projects like a Tax Calculator, Navbar with scroll effects, and a Weather App using live APIs.\nAfter that, you’ll enter the world of React — where you’ll build dynamic components, manage state, work with React Router, and even get started with testing your apps.\nBut that’s not all.\nWe’ll take your skills to the backend with Python fundamentals, where you’ll build your own file organizer project. Then we bring it all together with Django — a powerful Python framework — to build and deploy your personal portfolio website from scratch.\n--\nWhy This Course Is Different\nMost courses focus on just frontend or backend. This one shows you the full journey — from HTML to React, and from Python to Django — all in one place.\nThis is not just a tutorial series. You’ll build real projects, debug real code, and actually understand how things work — both on the browser and the server.\nBy the end, you'll have:\nA strong grasp of how the web works from top to bottom\nThe confidence to build and deploy complete websites\nA ready-to-show portfolio of full stack projects\nThe clarity to choose your next path — frontend, backend, or full stack\n--\nThis is the full stack web development course I wish I had when starting out.

      "description": "In this course you will learn how to secure your NextJS Application with JWT Cookie based Authentication.\nSecuring a Next.js application with JWT and cookies involves creating a server-side authentication endpoint to handle user logins. Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with a secret key. This JWT is then sent to the client as an HTTP-only cookie, enhancing security by preventing JavaScript access.\nOn the client side, implement functions for user authentication, including login, logout, and status checking. For authenticated requests, include the JWT in the request headers to verify the user's identity on the server.\nIn summary, the process entails validating user credentials on the server, generating a signed JWT, and securely transmitting it to the client via an HTTP-only cookie. The client-side implementation manages user authentication functions, and the server verifies requests using the received JWT. This approach enhances application security by utilizing the capabilities of JWTs and secure cookie handling.\n\nJSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. In web development, JWTs serve as secure tokens for transmitting information, often used for user authentication. Comprising three parts—header, payload, and signature—JWTs are encoded and signed, providing a lightweight and tamper-evident structure. Their versatility and self-contained nature make JWTs widely adopted for transmitting authenticated data, and they are commonly employed in various web-related protocols and frameworks.",

However, each step is fully explained in detail. If you are a proficient PHP coder then this course is probably not right for you!  If you are familiar with my other courses then you should really enjoy this one as you will create a full project.\nAs an experienced teacher, I often find that some courses are just too long and students lose interest. By keeping this course short (around 4 hours of content) and targeted, you should learn some valuable skills quickly and effectively without the need to sit through hours of code. You will follow along as you and I work together to develop scripts. You will learn about my thought processes as we develop the hangman game. You will also see how I avoid many errors that plague beginner coders.\nIn this course I will show you how to create a simple hangman game using PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.\nYou will learn the basic code structure and then begin to enhance the game by adding HTML5 canvas graphics and some Bootstrap styling. You will continue to develop the game as the lessons progress and learn how to integrate PHP code with HTML, CSS and jQuery.\nAt the end of the course you will find a series of challenges with full solutions. These are intended to help you advance the game with some new features.\nI strongly recommend that you watch the free course preview videos to see if this course will be suitable for your level of ability as it is aimed at beginners.  If you like the previews, then join today.\nI look forward to welcoming you to the course.\n\n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT\nIMPORTANT: Please read carefully\nYou are free to use ANY development environment including the one that you are already using (if any). In this course, I show you how to download and install Visual Studio Code and MAMP (both of which are FREE and available for Mac and Windows).\nIf you are unsure about which code editor option is best for you then I encourage you to contact me and I will be happy to discuss the options with you.\nYou can also follow this course using your own preferred code editor.\nOnce again, using Visual Studio Code with MAMP is OPTIONAL. You can use ANY suitable development environment of your choosing.\n\n\nMY PROMISES TO YOU\nAs a registered teacher (yes, I teach in a real classroom every day), I strongly believe it is my job to ensure you feel totally supported when taking my classes. I therefore promise the following:\nto respect you as a student and individual with your own learning needs\nto be courteous and polite in our interactions\nto answer your questions about the course content promptly\nto fix any issues you may encounter with the lessons\nto respond promptly to feedback\nI really do look forward to welcoming you to this course. I am confident you will enjoy the approach of learning what each line of code actually means.\nJoin the course today.",

Unlike Entity Framework, Dapper emphasizes direct SQL queries for enhanced performance and granular control, making it an excellent choice for developers prioritizing efficiency and database control.\n\n\nBy integrating Identity with Dapper, you can manage essential functionalities like user registration, login, role management, password hashing, and claims-based authentication. This setup typically involves customizing the UserStore and RoleStore to map Identity entities like users, roles, and claims to your database schema. Dapper’s flexibility allows you to optimize SQL queries, manage joins, and fine-tune performance for large-scale applications.\n\n\nThis approach is ideal for applications where database operations need to be performant or when a non-standard database schema is in use. Developers can extend or modify the default Identity logic to suit unique business requirements. Moreover, leveraging Dapper ensures a minimal memory footprint and straightforward query debugging.\n\n\nBy combining Identity with Dapper, developers achieve a balance between robust authentication features and high-performance data access, making it a preferred choice for applications that demand speed, scalability, and customization.",

The MERN stack is an ever popular and growing stack which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS. While NodeJS is becoming more and more popular, JavaScript is starting to take a back seat in the industry to TypeScript. Unfortunately, setting up all the technologies of the MERN stack with TypeScript is not as cut and dry as it should be, which is why I came up with this tutorial to get beginner web developers a step in the right direction with modern technologies.\n\n\nIn this course we are going to gain a fundamental understanding of the MERN stack by building a full stack application that I call Library Management System. Unlike other courses on Udemy, we will be building something more powerful than a simple Todo Application and I am going to walk you through every step. Including setting up the NodeJS project with TypeScript, setting up routes on the server, creating the React application with TypeScript, setting up Redux and more. By the end of the course you should feel confident enough to not only put this project on your portfolio, but also expand upon the project with new features all by yourself from the experience gained.",

In fact, this course is best used as a supplement as you work through a comprehensive coding course.\nThis course is structured by doing a lecture about a concept, giving exercises to apply those concepts, then going over the solutions and explanation.

      "description": "You may have heard the phrase: \"To build a chat app, you need WebSockets.\" But have you ever stopped to ask — why?\nIn this hands-on course, you’ll learn to build a real-time social media API using NestJS and WebSockets (Socket IO) — not just by memorizing syntax, but by understanding the fundamentals behind real-time communication. We’ll explore how sockets work under the hood, how data flows between client and server, and how to architect a system that can scale and respond instantly.\nRather than spoon-feeding you code, this course teaches you how to read documentation, think critically, and apply these skills to your own projects. You'll gain the confidence to build and extend real-time features independently.\nWe start with a deep dive into the fundamentals of WebSockets, from how the TCP handshake works to the HTTP upgrade process that opens a persistent WebSocket connection. You’ll clearly understand what’s happening behind the scenes before writing a single line of code.\nNext, you'll build a simple chat app using raw WebSocket APIs, giving you a solid foundation before introducing any libraries. Once you understand the basics, we’ll transition into Socket IO, where you’ll explore its core concepts including custom events, rooms, and namespaces — and how they simplify real-time communication.\nOnce your WebSocket knowledge is solid, we shift gears and jump into NestJS fundamentals. You’ll learn about modules, controllers, services, and guards — and then apply them to build a complete, real-time social media backend\n\nWhy This Course?\nThis is not just another crash course. It’s a practical, project-driven guide that helps you think like a backend engineer. If you’re comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript, have some Node.js or NestJS experience, and want to level up your backend skills with real-time architecture, this course is for you.\nBy the end, you’ll walk away with a complete real-time backend — ready to power your own chat app, live feed, or social platform.",

      "description": "Hi there,\nWelcome to \" Vue & Vuex | Vue Js Front End Web Development with Vuex \" course.\nComplete Vue Js & Vuex Course. Learn Vue 3 with Vuejs projects & Vuex state management to build modern web applications\n\n\nVue (pronounced like view) is a frontend development framework for JavaScript (JS) that you can use to build web-based user interfaces. You can also use vue js to create one-page applications and handle animations, interactive elements, and graphics. Generating projects is also possible with the user-built presets, which is commonly applicable for coders working in enterprise environments. Because vuejs is based on JavaScript, you can easily integrate Vue into an existing JS project.\nWhether you’re trying to build a full single-page application or merely add a bit of interactivity to your existing app, Vue.js has a spectrum of tools to help you get your job done, and that course can help you get up and running quickly.\nIf you’re looking for a JavaScript web framework that isn’t going to drown you in complexity, take a look at Vue.js. Vue.js takes what other frameworks have done before, but does it in a way that’s fresh and easy-to-use. Using Vue.js lets you focus your application rather than on your framework.\nVuex is a state management library for Vue.js, and you can use it to build web-based user interfaces. Additionally, you can utilize Vuex to create single-page applications and handle animations, interactive elements, and graphics. It's also possible to create projects with user-generated presets, which is often suitable for developers working in corporate environments. Since Vuex is based on Vue.js, you can easily integrate Vuex into an existing Vue.js project. Whether you want to create a full single-page application, multi-page application, or just add some interactivity to your existing application, Vuex will help you get the job done quickly.\nVue.js is designed to be incrementally adaptable, and while it provides a simple and flexible way to build reactive components for modern web applications, managing state across components can become challenging as an application grows in complexity.\nVuex solves this problem by providing a centralized state management pattern. It serves as a state management library that can be integrated into Vue.js applications to help manage the state of the application in a predictable way.\nKey concepts of Vuex include:\n1. State: This is the centralized state of the application. It represents the data that needs to be shared among components.\n2. Getters: These are functions used to compute derived state from the store's state. They can be thought of as computed properties for the store.\n3. Mutations: Mutations are responsible for modifying the state. They are synchronous transactions that ensure the state changes in a predictable way.\n4. Actions: Actions are similar to mutations but can handle asynchronous operations. They are often used to perform side effects, such as making API calls, and then committing mutations.\n5. Modules: As an application grows, the store might become too large. Modules allow developers to organize the store into separate, smaller modules, each with its own state, getters, mutations, and actions.\n\n\nIn this course, begins by explaining the fundamentals of Vue.js. Before diving into sample applications, we will walk you through how to use each Vue.js feature in code. We will cover topics in the following order: starting with how DOM operations are done in Vue.js. Next, we will explore Vue.js directives. Afterward, we will delve into crucial topics for Vue.js, such as components, props, and lifecycle methods. While learning all these topics, we will also discuss how styling is done in Vue.js. Following that, we will reinforce all that we have learned by building an application. After this application, you will have advanced to a new level in Vue.js. We will then progress towards developing applications by fetching data from an API source. Before reaching this stage, we will learn how to work with form elements. We will cover topics like async components, mixins, and nextTick. Subsequently, we will develop another application where we apply all these learnings. Following this, we will explore the 'Vue Router,' which is used for developing multi-page applications in Vue.js. After this topic, we will learn how to create our components using the Composition API. Later on, we will undertake a comprehensive shopping website project. Thus, having learned everything related to Vue.js, we will then begin to learn Vuex. Alongside Vuex, we will develop two applications to conclude our course. By the end of this course, you will become proficient Vue.js developers.\n\n\nIn this tutorial you will learn;\n· How to create Web Application with Vue.js.\n· Most important Vue.js topics.\n· How to create a multi-page web app with vue-router.\n· How to easily build the largest and most advanced applications using Vue.js and Vuex\n· How to create Web Application with Vue.js.\n· Most important Vue.js topics.\n\n\n\nWhat is Vue JS?\nVue (pronounced like view) is a frontend development framework for JavaScript (JS) that you can use to build web-based user interfaces. You can also use it to create one-page applications and handle animations, interactive elements, and graphics. Generating projects is also possible with the user-built presets, which is commonly applicable for coders working in enterprise environments. Because it is based on JavaScript, you can easily integrate Vue into an existing JS project. Vue uses the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which means that the core library of Vue.js focuses on the view layer by default. It enforces a one-way data flow between components. This also makes it easy for you to integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue also uses virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which makes it faster than regular DOM. Instead of re-rendering the whole page, Vue only updates the objects that you change.\n\nWhat is the difference between Vue and React?\nAlthough Vue has an MVC architecture, you cannot use it with a different architectural approach, which differs from the Component Based Architecture (CBA) used in React. They also differ in how they optimize data. When a component’s state changes in React, it triggers the re-render of the entire component sub-tree, starting at that component as the root. Vue automatically tracks a component’s dependencies during its render, so the system knows which components actually need to re-render when the state changes. In React, everything is in JavaScript. Vue, on the other hand, embraces web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows you to build off of them. Another difference between these frameworks is how you can scale up your projects. React only offers a single template that assumes you’re building a single-page application, while Vue offers several default options for multiple purposes and build systems.\n\nIs Vue JS easy to learn?\nVue JS can be easy to learn. Unlike other frontend technologies, Vue doesn’t require in-depth knowledge of libraries. If you want to start learning Vue, all you need to have is basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Compared to other coding technologies, developers typically classify Vue.js as having an easy learning curve. This is due largely in part to Vue’s reputation for having an elegant programming style and patterns. Because Vue is a progressive framework, it makes it easy for you to use it to integrate into an existing project. Because of its familiar templating syntax and use of components, you may find that integrating or migrating existing projects to Vue is fairly straightforward. Vue is known for offering a vast ecosystem of tools and companion libraries, making it a simple framework that you can use to respond to the complex needs of enterprise-grade applications.\n\nVuex Advantages\nVuex is a state management library for Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vuex provides several advantages for managing the state of your Vue.js applications. Vuex offers a range of advantages, including centralized state management, predictability, debugging tools, modularity, and integration with Vue.js reactivity. These features help developers build more organized, maintainable, and scalable Vue.js applications.\n\nIs Vuex easy to learn?\nVuex can be relatively easy to learn if you have prior experience with Vue.js and some familiarity with state management concepts. The documentation and available learning resources make it accessible to beginners as well. However, it may take some time and practice to become proficient, especially if you're dealing with more complex state management scenarios. Patience, practice, and hands-on experience are key to mastering Vuex.\n\n\n\n\nFresh Content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New tools are released every day, Vue updates its system, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge.

We learn the following highlight topics:\nBasic ASP.NET Core MVC Development\nData binding\nEntity Framework Core\nSession and Distributed Caching\nASP.NET Core Identity\nDeployment\nWe start by developing basic ASP.NET Core MVC development such as exploring Models, Views and Controllers. Making data binding from Models to Views. We apply data binding to HTML web forms, Tables, and Charts.\nWe access database like SQL Server using Entity Framework Core 5.x. We can generate codes from existing database and then use them in ASP.NET Core MVC applications. We implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with SQL Server and ASP.NET Core MVC.\nTo improve your ASP.NET Core MVC performance, we implement sessions and distributed caching.   In this section, I will show to work with external distributed caching in ASP.NET Core MVC. We use external caching data such as In-Memory Database, Redis and SQL Server.\nWe also learn ASP.NET Core MVC Security with ASP.NET Core Identity. We explore how to create users, get users and delete users. We learn how to retrieve account (username), change password and email. We also implement how to reset password. To obtain a valid email on user registration, we implement ASP.NET Core MVC registration with email confirmation. To prevent user registration bots automatically by bots, we can apply CAPTCHA in ASP.NET Core MVC. We use Google reCAPTCHA. Last, we work with multi-factor authentication. Users can enable their multi-factor authentication on ASP.NET Core Identity. Then, each user with enabled multi-factor authentication will be challenged for second authentication. In this scenario, we use email with codes for implementing multi-factor authentication.\nAt the end of course we learn how to deploy our ASP.NET Core MVC applications. We use IIS web server and Microsoft Azure for targeted deployment.",

In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of web animation, such as getting to know its use cases, its technical limitations, and different types of animations commonly used in web design. Then, in the next section we will start the project, In the first section, we will start with CSS animation tutorials, we are going to create variety of animations like text animation, floating animation, bouncing animation, rotating animation, zoom in animation, button animation, gradient background colour transition, and menu dropdown animation. This will give you a solid foundation in using CSS to make web elements visually engaging and interactive. Afterward, in the second section, we will animate web components using Javascript and Anime JS, we are going to create fully animated countdown timer, following that, we are going to create an animated cursor that follows the mouse with a floating bubble effect, and we are also going to create colourful isometric animation. This will train you to effectively combine JavaScript with animation libraries to design seamless, responsive, and highly engaging interactions that enhance user engagement and elevate the overall web experience. Then, in the third section, we will design interactive websites using Tailwind CSS, specifically, we are going to design and animate flight booking pages and pricing pages. These layouts will include hover transitions, animated buttons, and responsive designs. In the fourth section, we will create beautiful animations using Python and turtle, we are going to create colourful loading spinner animation and a growing tree animation that can be used as a decorative background element on a web page. Then, in the fifth section, we will animate data visualization using D3 JS, specifically, we are going to build a bar chart that visualizes the population growth of a city over ten years, complete with animated transitions and dynamic rendering. This will show you how to present complex data interactively while maintaining a clean and engaging user interface. Lastly, at the end of the course, we are going to build and design an ecommerce product page that includes flipping card animations. The front of each card will display a product image and title, while the back reveals the product description and price, additionally, we are also going to create an animated add to cart button.\nBefore getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we learn about web animations?

Sites created with the JAMstack are delivered by pre-rendering files that are served directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.\nJAMstack is the new standard architecture for the web. Using Git workflows and modern build tools, pre-rendered content is served to a CDN and made dynamic through APIs and serverless functions. Technologies in the stack include JavaScript frameworks, Static Site Generators, Headless CMSs, and CDNs.\nBetter Performance\nWhy wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimising the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.\nHigher Security\nWith server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.\nCheaper, Easier Scaling\nWhen your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.\nBetter Developer Experience\nLoose coupling and separation of controls allow for more targeted development and debugging, and the expanding selection of CMS options for site generators remove the need to maintain a separate stack for content and marketing.\nProject 1: You're gonna learn how to build a website from start to finish. You are going to learn how to setup an 11ty project, pull the data from Contentful CMS, style your pages using Tailwindcss and deploy it to Netlify.\nProject 2: You will learn how to build a blazing fast and secure shop in no time. Using Gatsby you will be able to pull all your product at build time and pre render them so they load almost instantly.",

A lot of OOP examples that you'll find online don't help when you're trying to start out with object oriented programming. I've always wanted a real world world class example, until I decided to rewrite a pagination code that I wrong a long time ago, and covert it into OOP.\nIf you're looking for a real world class example, this course is for you. Anyone wanting to improve their programming skills in general may take the course. To become a very good programmer, it's important to watch how other developers do things and copy from them. I've bought a couple of courses from Udemy myself. And that paid off, I've been told I'm a good developer by different programmers including my boss. So I'd highly encourage anyone willing to improve to their OOP skills to take this course, and other courses as well that are not mine. Good developers never stop learning. And remember, every time you seat in front of a computer and learn something new, you're growing. Every little thing you learn will certainly help you in future and save you a lot of time",

      "description": "Django is a high-level, open-source web framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly and efficiently. It is written in Python and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which encourages the separation of concerns between the data, presentation, and logic layers of an application.\nWeb development is the process of designing, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a wide range of tasks and technologies, including front-end and back-end development, user experience (UX) design, database management, and web server configuration.\nWeb development can be divided into two main categories:\nFront-end development (Client-side): Front-end development focuses on the visible parts of a website or web application that users interact with. This includes creating the layout, design, and user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end developers must ensure that the website looks good and functions properly across different devices, browsers, and screen sizes. They may also use various libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js) to facilitate the development process and create more interactive user experiences.\nBack-end development (Server-side): Back-end development deals with the server-side logic, data processing, and database management that support the front-end. Back-end developers create and maintain the underlying infrastructure that powers a website or web application. They work with server-side programming languages (e.g., Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, or Node.js), databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB), and server technologies (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or IIS) to build the systems that process user input, manage data, and serve content to the front-end.\nMaster Django web development by building a real-world, fully functional Law Firm Management System from scratch. This comprehensive, hands-on course will guide you through Django's essential concepts, best practices, and advanced features, allowing you to create a professional and robust web application.\n\n\nIn this course, you'll learn how to:\n\n\nLearn how to set up and organize a Django project, including apps, settings, and configurations.\nUnderstand how to create models to represent data entities, relationships, and constraints in the application.\nLearn how to use Django's migration system to manage and evolve the database schema.\nUnderstand the concept of views in Django and how to create functional views or class-based views to handle different types of requests.\nlearn how to define and configure URL patterns and route requests to the appropriate views.\nUnderstand the Django templating language and how to create reusable templates for rendering HTML content.\nLearn how to use template inheritance to create a consistent look and feel across the entire application.\nLearn how to use built-in and custom template tags and filters to manipulate data and add functionality within templates.\nUnderstand how to create and process forms in Django, including form validation, error handling, and saving data to the database.\nLearn how to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in a Django application.\nLearn how to manage and serve static and media files in a Django application.\nUnderstand how to integrate third-party libraries, such as Bootstrap , into a Django application.",

All using FREE software and accounts!! It doesnt get any better than this! If you love Svelte (and you should), then you will also love Netlify and this course brings you both!\nThe course starts off by briefly covering some important concepts you should consider before developing any application before moving on to the Setup of all software and accounts you will need. Setup sheets are provided for items you can install/setup. Svelte and Mongodb Atlas/Compass will be covered in the course.\nThe course sees you taking on the role of freelancer and your client has provided you with a requirements specification for a project they want to be completed as a web-app. Having considered your client's needs, the application will be built using Svelte, Mongodb and Netlify Serverless functions and deployed to Netlify. The course will take you through the data-flow of the project, covering all important state management, component by component, step by step, giving you exercises along the way to build on your knowledge and skill, culminating in a very fast, very visual web application that will more than satisfy your client's requirements. You will get lots of exercises along the way and to get the most out of this course you need to do these exercises and not just copy code. That way, you build your skill and confidence.\nYou will use Netlify to deploy a temporary website before writing a single line of code and you will see the power of Netlify when it comes to providing the client with a temporary but live view of the progress of your application. At completion of the project we will deploy to Netlify via Github for a seamless efficiency which is the hallmark of Netlify (called Continuous Deployment).\nThis course was developed in late 2022 in preparation for release early 2023 so you will be using latest versions of software as at that time. After Section 2 all sections have a Checkpoint zip file with all the code at the each of that section, checked and confirmed accurate, to aid you in completing the course. If you get stuck, check the next Checkpoint! A lecture on Troubleshooting is included. Try to troubleshoot before you post to Q&A.\nI hope you enjoy the course and that it leaves you not wondering what to do next nor how, but instead KNOWING what you need to do AND how you will do it in your next project. I wish you every success!",

The web handler would receive a JSON document that may contain a collection of many payloads that needed to be written to Amazon S3, in order for our map-reduce systems to later operate on this data.\nTraditionally we would look into creating a worker-tier architecture, utilizing things such as:\nSidekiq\nResque\nDelayedJob\nElasticbeanstalk Worker Tier\nRabbitMQ\nand so on…\nAnd setup 2 different clusters, one for the web front-end and another for the workers, so we can scale up the amount of background work we can handle.\nBut since the beginning, our team knew that we should do this in Go because during the discussion phases we saw this could be potentially a very large traffic system. I have been using Go for about 2 years or so, and we had developed a few systems here at work but none that would get this amount of load.\n\nConclusion\nSimplicity always wins in my book. We could have designed a complex system with many queues, background workers, complex deployments, but instead we decided to leverage the power of Elasticbeanstalk auto-scaling and the efficiency and simple approach to concurrency that Golang provides us out of the box.\n\n\nIt’s not everyday that you have a cluster of only 4 machines, that are probably much less powerful than my current MacBook Pro, handling POST requests writing to an Amazon S3 bucket 1 million times every minute.",

You’ll learn how to set up the Gmail API with OAuth2, involving the creation and management of client credentials such as the client ID, client secret, access tokens, and refresh tokens.\nOnce our backend is ready, we will test the email functionality using Postman, ensuring everything is configured correctly.\n\nThe course doesn’t stop there; we'll also build a React-based frontend client that includes a contact form. This form will be integrated with our Express server, allowing users to submit inquiries directly to your inbox via email.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a fully functional email-sending system using modern, secure practices, ready to be applied to your projects.",

      "description": "Hi there,\n\nWelcome to my \"JPA | Learn Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA & Hibernate Basics\" course.\nSpring Data JPA, Spring Boot with Rest API examples on PostgreSQL & also different databases like MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB\n\n\nSpring Data JPA is a part of the larger Spring Data project, which aims to simplify data access and manipulation in Spring-based applications. Specifically, Spring Data JPA provides a high-level, abstracted approach to working with relational databases using the Java Persistence API\nIn the world of software development, simplification is often the key to productivity and efficiency. Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA are two powerful tools in the Spring Framework ecosystem that make it easier to develop robust and maintainable Java applications, especially when it comes to working with databases.\n\n\nSpring Boot: The Foundation of Modern Java Applications\nSpring Boot is a part of the Spring Framework that is designed to simplify the process of building production-ready applications. It achieves this by providing a set of conventions and tools to eliminate the need for extensive configuration, boilerplate code, and a steep learning curve .\nSpring Boot embraces the concept of \"opinionated defaults\" . It comes with predefined configurations for common scenarios, such as database connections, web servers, and templating engines . This allows developers to get started quickly without having to make countless decisions .\nOne of the standout features of Spring Boot is its auto-configuration. It automatically configures components based on the dependencies you include in your project. If you're using Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot will configure your data source, entity manager, and transaction management with sensible defaults.\nSpring Boot includes support for embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow . You don't need to deploy your application to an external server; Spring Boot packages the server with your application, making it easy to run and deploy.\n\n\nSpring Data JPA, a part of the Spring Data project, simplifies database access in Java applications, specifically when working with relational databases using the Java Persistence API (JPA) .\nIn Spring Data JPA with Rest API course you will Learn;\nInstalling java jdk and most useful IDEs like eclipse and intellij.\nSpring Basics\nLombok\nPostman,\nDocker\nDBeaver\nPostgre Database\nSpring Rest API\nORM,\nJPA,\nHibernate\nSpring JPA Annotations\nSpring JPA Methods\nQuery methods and Finder methods\nsorting and pagination\nRelationships of Entities\nUsing JPA with different Databases.\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine the benefits of Spring Data JPA\nRepository Abstraction\nSpring Data JPA introduces the concept of repositories. These are interfaces that define common database operations, such as saving, retrieving, and deleting entities. You can create custom repository interfaces to define your own data access methods, and Spring Data JPA generates the corresponding implementations.\n\n\nQuery Methods\nOne of the standout features of Spring Data JPA is the ability to define query methods by method naming conventions. It can derive queries from method names, which makes it easy to create custom queries without writing SQL or JPQL queries manually. For example, a method named findByLastName(String lastName) in a repository interface will automatically generate a query to retrieve entities by their last name .\n\n\nAutomatic CRUD Operations\nSpring Data JPA provides automatic implementations for common CRUD operations. You can save, retrieve, update, and delete entities with minimal code, allowing you to focus on your application's business logic.\n\n\nPagination and Sorting\nImplementing pagination and sorting for your queries is straightforward with Spring Data JPA. It abstracts the complexities of database-specific query syntax, making it easy to retrieve subsets of data.\n\n\nIntegration with Spring Framework\nSpring Data JPA seamlessly integrates with the broader Spring ecosystem. It works well with Spring's dependency injection, transaction management, and security features, creating a cohesive development experience .\n\n\nWhen you combine Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA, you get a powerful toolkit for building Java applications that interact with databases. Spring Boot provides a strong foundation for your application, with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and cloud-native support, while Spring Data JPA streamlines your data access, reducing the need for boilerplate code and manual SQL queries\nSo, this course will be a great chance for you to progress faster in the software world\n\n\nWe will start to our course with installing java jdk and most useful IDEs like eclipse and intellij. After that we will learn basic information about spring and Lombok to use in our training. Then we will examine some other tools or apps to use in our training like sts tool, Postman, Docker and postgre Database.\nAfter that we will learn basics of spring API . Because this training is about JPA and I want to teach Data jpa on API pages.\nThen we will start spring data JPA.\nWe will learn some programming concepts like ORM, JPA, Hibernate, Spring data jpa and we will examine differences between them.\nAfter that we will start to JPA with rest API on postgre SQL. We will learn spring annotations that used in JPA like\nEntity\nId\nTable\nColumn\nGenerated vale\nUnique constraint\nAuto Identity, Sequence.\nAlso we will examine JPA repository and most useful methods od JPA repository like\nSave\nFind by\nSave all\nFind all\nDelete\nDelete by Id\nCount and exist by Id.\nWe will continue with Query methods and Finder methods. After that we will continue with JPQL.\nThen we will learn sorting and pagination, relationships between tables like\nOne to one\nOne to many\nMany to one and many to many.\nAlso we will examine the search functionality, transaction management and unit testing.\nWe will make all operations with postgre SQL database. but also we will change our database with difference databases like mysql, mssql, mongo etc.\nI think these are enough reasons to start the course. If you're ready, let's get started.\n\n\nWhat is Spring Boot and why it is used?\nJava Spring Boot (Spring Boot) is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier through three core capabilities: Autoconfiguration. An opinionated approach to configuration. The ability to create standalone applications.\n\n\nWhat is Spring Data JPA?\nSpring Data JPA, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA-based (Java Persistence API) repositories. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies. Implementing a data access layer for an application can be quite cumbersome.\n\n\nWhat is the use of JPA?\nThe Java Persistence API (JPA) is one possible approach to ORM. Via JPA the developer can map, store, update and retrieve data from relational databases to Java objects and vice versa. JPA can be used in Java-EE and Java-SE applications. JPA is a specification and several implementations are available.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between spring data JPA and Hibernate?\nWhat Is the Difference Between Hibernate and Spring Data JPA? Hibernate is a JPA implementation, while Spring Data JPA is a JPA Data Access Abstraction. Spring Data offers a solution to GenericDao custom implementations. It can also generate JPA queries on your behalf through method name conventions.\n\n\nWhy do we use spring JPA?\nSpring Data JPA aims to significantly improve the implementation of data access layers by reducing the effort to the amount that's actually needed. As a developer you write your repository interfaces, including custom finder methods, and Spring will provide the implementation automatically.\n\n\nWhat is difference between Spring and Hibernate?\nSpring is useful for transaction management, aspect-oriented programming, and dependency injection. Hibernate provides Object-Relational Persistence and Query service for applications. Spring has a number of modules such as Spring core, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring JDBC & more.\n\n\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Way, Simple and Easy With Exercises\nFresh Content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New tools are released every day, Vue updates its system, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge. With this course, you will always have a chance to follow the latest trends .\n\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our content is created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you with the best learning experience .\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\n\n\nDive in now into;  \"JPA | Learn Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA & Hibernate Basics\" course.\nSpring Data JPA, Spring Boot with Rest API examples on PostgreSQL & also different databases like MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB\n\n\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\n\nSee you on the other side!",

In this example, we demonstrate how to login with microsoft account. We will also learn how to setup sendGrid so we can make a passwordless signin with email. Also, we will setup firebase adapter and mongodb adapter, so the users data will store in these database. At last, we will also deploy the app to the Vercel.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Nextjs?\nAll of the React components that make up a website's user-facing section are rendered on the server first. This means that after the HTML has been transmitted to the client (the user's browser), the user can read the material on the page without having to do anything further. The user perceives page loading speeds to be substantially faster as a result of this.\nSSR also provides an out-of-the-box, indexable and crawlable website, which is critical for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) because no client-side javascript is required to view the page content. Essentially, increased technical SEO benefits our clients.\n\n\nWhy tailwindCSS?\nTailwind CSS is a popular low-level CSS framework with a lot of customization options. Bootstrap is widely used as a comparison. They are, nevertheless, essentially different. Rather of delivering pre-designed components like Bootstrap, Tailwind provides building pieces that allow developers to quickly create designs.\n\n\nWhy Daisy UI?\nDaisy UI enhances Tailwind with attractive component classes that are totally customisable and themeable. Daisy UI creates a scalable and designer-friendly design system.\n\n\nWhat we will cover\nUsing the react hook to check the user click on the inputbox or not, use the fontawesome, heroicon and daisy ui to help us create this beautiful ig login page. Take our css skill to next level by using the TailwindCSS and NextJS to build the login page.",

Instead of manually writing CloudFormation templates, you’ll define AWS infrastructure using TypeScript, synthesize it to CloudFormation, and deploy it with the ease of a modern programming workflow.\nYou’ll start by setting up your AWS environment—creating your account, configuring budgets to prevent surprise costs, setting up IAM users for CLI access, and installing the AWS CLI and CDK. You’ll learn how to initialize and structure CDK projects, understand stack definitions, and work with deployment commands like cdk deploy, cdk diff, and cdk synth.\nFrom there, the course walks you through a progressive series of projects, each introducing new AWS services and design patterns:\nS3 Bucket Stack – Create secure, private S3 buckets with proper removal policies and lifecycle management. Learn about static website hosting, public access configurations, and deployment troubleshooting.\nAPI Gateway + Lambda + Secrets Manager Stack – Build HTTP APIs with Lambda backends, manage environment variables, handle CORS, and securely store and retrieve secrets. Explore how to structure Lambda handlers, integrate with API Gateway routes, and enforce cross-stack dependencies.\nUsers API with DynamoDB – Design a RESTful API for user management with API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. Implement CRUD operations, generate test data, and manage permissions. Learn about partition keys, billing modes, and DynamoDB query best practices.\nProduct Management Stack – Combine DynamoDB for product data and S3 for image storage, building APIs for product creation, retrieval, and deletion. Manage IAM permissions, handle file uploads, and optimize Lambda execution for performance.\nEvent-Driven Workflows with SQS – Integrate Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) into a document processing pipeline with Lambda and API Gateway, ensuring reliable, decoupled communication between services.\nThroughout the course, you’ll gain experience in:\nDesigning scalable, maintainable CDK stacks.\nManaging multiple stacks and their dependencies.\nUsing NodejsFunction for automatic TypeScript bundling with esbuild.\nConfiguring resource policies for safe deletion in development and data retention in production.\nUnderstanding AWS service pricing models and cost optimization strategies.\nHandling common deployment errors and using troubleshooting techniques.\nBy the end, you’ll have a portfolio of deployed AWS projects, a strong grasp of CDK fundamentals, and the ability to design and deploy complex cloud architectures in a repeatable, version-controlled manner. Whether you’re aiming to enhance your DevOps skills, automate infrastructure deployments, or build cloud-native applications, this course gives you the practical knowledge and confidence to do it efficiently with AWS CDK v2 and TypeScript.",

      "description": "Event-Based Architecture? Covered! Server side rendering with React? Yep. Scalable, production-ready code? Its here!\n\nHow This Course Works\nThis course doesn't focus on using an off-the-shelf microservices framework. Many exist, but they hide the inner workings and challenges of microservices away from you. Instead, we will be using a minimal number of libraries, and write as much custom code as possible. This will expose you to challenging problems and clever solutions when handling subjects like async events!\n\n\nWhat Technology You'll Use\nBecause we are building a full stack application, we will use a variety of technologies. On the frontend, we'll use React and Next JS to present content to users. Each service is created using Node and Express. Data for each service is held in either a Mongo database. The entire app is deployed and runs in Docker containers executed in a Kubernetes cluster. Finally, almost all of the code in this course is written with Typescript.\nThis is a scary list of technologies! Not familiar with some of these? No problem! The course is built assuming that you only know the basics of Javascript and Express. No other knowledge is needed - you will learn everything you need to know.\n\nWhat You'll Be Able to Do\nBy the time you complete this course, you will be able to:\nArchitect a multi-service application\nDetermine whether your app is a good fit for a microservices approach\nUse Docker and Kubernetes to deploy a multi-service app to any cloud provider\nOrganize and enhance the reusability of code in large projects\n\n\nWhat You'll Learn\nAn absolute incredible number of topics are covered in this course. Here is a partial list of what you'll do:\nPractice patterns to create scalable microservices for a variety of app domains\nWrite a custom implementation of an event bus\nOptionally, run a development environment through a cloud provider\nGuarantee consistently structured responses from your different API's\nConfigure and scale your services using Kubernetes Deployments\nLimit access to your APIs using Google-JWT-based authentication\nAnd much more!",

      "description": "Docker is an open-source project that automates the development, deployment and running of applications inside isolated containers. Containers allow developers to bundle up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it as one package.\nDocker is both a daemon (a process running in the background) and a client command. It’s like a virtual machine but it’s different in important ways. First, there’s less duplication. With each extra VM you run, you duplicate the virtualization of CPU and memory and quickly run out resources when running locally. Docker is great at setting up a local development environment because it easily adds the running process without duplicating the virtualized resource. Second, it’s more modular. Docker makes it easy to run multiple versions or instances of the same program without configuration headaches and port collisions.\nThe goal of this course is to show you how to get a Node.js application into a Docker container. This course is intended for development, and not for a production deployment. The guide also assumes you have a working Docker installation and a basic understanding of how a Node.js application is structured.  The course covers installation of Docker Desktop just in case you need help.\nIn the first section of this course we will create a simple web application in Node.js, then we will build a Docker image for that application, and lastly we will instantiate a container from that image.",

      "description": "En este curso aprenderás JavaScript, el lenguaje de programación más popular y versátil de la Web. Se trata de una formación completa y 100% práctica, con 262 lecciones que representan 58 horas de contenido, e incluye el desarrollo de 12 proyectos orientados al mundo real.\nEl curso es ideal para diseñadores web con conocimientos básicos de HTML y CSS que desean avanzar en su profesión, pero también es recomendado para programadores y desarrolladores que dominan otros lenguajes y desean ampliar sus habilidades y conocimientos para crear aplicaciones modernas y avanzadas.\nQué aprenderás\nEste es un curso de vanilla JavaScript o \"JavaScript puro\", es decir, JavaScript sin incluir ninguna biblioteca o framework adicional, lo que es una excelente forma de aprender y dominar su sintaxis y estructura, así como aspectos básicos del lenguaje tales como variables, operadores, cadenas de texto, números, booleanos, objetos, arreglos, funciones, estructuras de control de flujo, bucles e iteradores y manipulación de fechas. Además, estudiaremos temas avanzados como el modelo del objeto document (DOM), eventos, el modelo del objeto browser (BOM), expresiones regulares, programación orientada a objetos (OOP), programación asincrona, entre otros aspectos avanzados de este lenguaje.\nCada lección del curso es tratada mediante ejemplos simples, prácticos y fáciles de comprender, pero profundizando en cada aspecto del lenguaje, lo que hace que este curso sea ideal tanto para principiantes como para programadores experimentados.\nAdemás, aprenderás buenas prácticas de programación y consejos para evitar errores comunes. También conocerás herramientas y recursos online que facilitarán tu trabajo y aumentarán tu productividad como desarrollador/desarroladora web.\nAlcance del curso\nEl curso abarca todas las versiones del lenguaje JavaScript, pero con especial énfasis en la especificación ECMAScript 6 hasta la actualidad.\nSi bien JavaScript es un lenguaje de programación capaz de funcionar tanto en el contexto del navegador como del servidor, en este curso solamente nos enfocaremos en JavaScript del lado del cliente o navegador.\n¿Por qué es importante aprender JavaScript?\nJavaScript es el lenguaje de programación más popular y versátil de la Web. Es utilizado ampliamente para desarrollar aplicaciones modernas y avanzadas que requieren una interacción dinámica con el usuario.\nAunque otros lenguajes como Python, Ruby, PHP y Java también se utilizan para desarrollar aplicaciones web, en la actualidad JavaScript es el lenguaje más popular para estos fines, debido a su facilidad de aprendizaje y utilización. Además, dado que muchos sitios web y aplicaciones móviles utilizan este lenguaje para su funcionamiento, el conocimiento de JavaScript es una habilidad altamente valorada, que ofrece grandes oportunidades laborales que permiten trabajar en diferentes roles, como front-end, back-end, full-stack o mobile app developer.",

Fue creado inicialmente por el programador danés-canadiense Rasmus Lerdorf en 1994. En la actualidad, la implementación de referencia de PHP es producida por The PHP Group.\nMySQL: MySQL es un sistema de gestión de bases de datos relacional desarrollado bajo licencia dual: Licencia pública general/Licencia comercial por Oracle Corporation y está considerada como la base de datos.\nPDO: Significa Obejtos de datos de php una extensión para acceder a bases de datos. PDO permite acceder a diferentes sistema de base de datos  con un controlador específico (Mysql, SQLIte ,Oracle entre otros) mediante el cual se conecta. Independientemente del sistema utilizado, se emplearán siempre los mismos métodos, lo que hace que cambiar de uno a otro resulte más sencillo.\nXAMPP: XAMPP es un paquete de software libre, que consiste principalmente en el sistema de gestión de bases de datos MySQL, el servidor web Apache y los intérpretes para lenguajes de script PHP y Perl. El nombre es en realidad un acrónimo: X, Apache, MariaDB/MySQL, PHP, Perl.\nJavaScript: JavaScript es un lenguaje de programación o de secuencias de comandos que te permite implementar funciones complejas en páginas web, cada vez que una página web hace algo más que sentarse allí y mostrar información estática para que la veas, muestra oportunas actualizaciones de contenido, mapas interactivos, animación de Gráficos 2D/3D, desplazamiento de máquinas reproductoras de vídeo, etc., puedes apostar que probablemente JavaScript está involucrado. Es la tercera capa del pastel de las tecnologías web estándar, dos de las cuales (HTML y CSS) hemos cubierto con mucho más detalle en otras partes del Área de aprendizaje.",

Dengan demikian, pengertian terhadap ketiga unsur-unsur pokok ini akan sangat membantu dalam memahami GIS. Dengan melihat unsur-unsur pokoknya, maka jelas GIS merupakan salah satu sistem informasi atau GIS merupakan suatu sistem yang menekankan pada unsur informasi geografis. Istilah geografis merupakan bagian dari spasial (keruangan). Kedua istilah ini sering digunakan secara bergantian atau tertukar hingga timbul istilah yang ketiga, geospasial. Ketiga istilah ini mengandung pengertian yang sama di dalam konteks GIS. Penggunaan kata geografis mengandung pengertian suatu persoalan mengenai bumi yang berarti permukaan dua atau tiga dimensi. Istilah informasi geografis mengandung pengertian informasi mengenai tempat-tempat yang terletak di permukaan bumi, pengetahuan mengenai posisi dimana suatu objek terletak di permukaan bumi, dan informasi mengenai keterangan-keterangan (atribut) yang terdapat di permukaan bumi yang posisinya diberikan atau diketahui.\nDengan memperhatikan pengertian sistem informasi, maka GIS merupakan suatu kesatuan formal yang terdiri dari berbagai sumberdaya fisik dan logika yang berkenaan dengan objek-objek yang terdapat di permukaan bumi. Jadi, GIS juga merupakan sejenis perangkat lunak yang dapat digunakan untuk pemasukan, penyimpanan, manipulasi, menampilkan, dan keluaran informasi geografis berikut atribut-atributnya\nframework adalah sebuah kerangka program yang digunakan untuk membantu developer untuk mengembangkan kode secara konsisten.\nDengan adanya framework developer bisa mengurangi jumlah bug pada website atau aplikasi yang dibuat. Karena, fungsi dan variabel yang sudah tersedia di dalam komponen framework.\nDalam artikel ini, Anda akan mempelajari lebih dalam pengertian dan fungsi framework. Tak hanya itu, Anda pun akan diajak mengenal jenis jenis framework yang sering digunakan.\nCodeIgniter adalah salah satu framework PHP yang ringan dan bersifat open-source. Framework ini memungkinkan Anda untuk mengembangkan aplikasi web dengan fitur lengkap secara lebih cepat. Hal itu berkat dukungan library yang beragam.",

Ensuite, vous ajouterez MongoDB, une base de données NoSQL (la plus populaire du moment) afin de rendre votre site web dynamique et vos données pleinement persistantes.\nCe que vous apprendrez dans la première partie\nApprendre et maitriser Node.Js, Express Js & MongoDB\nApprendre et maitriser la création d'un serveur Web Avec Express\nApprendre et maitriser le routage avec Express\nApprendre et maitriser la gestion des formulaires avec le module body-parser\nApprendre et maitriser la validation des données d'un formulaire\nApprendre et maitriser l'utilisation du générateur d'une application Express en 3 secondes\nApprendre et maitriser la manipulation d'une base de données MongoDB en ligne de commande\nApprendre et maitriser la manipulation d'une base de données MongoDB avec l'interface Mongoose\nApprendre et maitriser le chargement d'un fichier image sur un serveur\nApprendre et maitriser la mise en place d'un système d'authentification\nApprendre et maitriser l'envoi de mail via un site Web, gestion de formulaire de contact\nApprendre et maitriser la gestion de la réinitialisation de mot de passe\nApprendre et maitriser le deploiment d'un site web sur Heroku et GitHub\nLa deuxième partie de cette formation vous permet de vous spécialiser dans le développement Backend. Dans cette partie, l'application front-end est déjà créée ! De cette façon, vous pourrez vous concentrer sur la création de votre API et la regarder évoluer, en affinant vos compétences back-end et en choisissant librement votre propre parcours.\nL'application sur laquelle vous travaillerez est un magasin en ligne simple. Vous créerez une API pour Créer, Lire, Mettre à jour et Supprimer (CRUD pour l’anglais Create, Read, Update and Delete) des éléments en vente. Vous ajouterez l'authentification à votre API pour la protéger, et vous intégrerez également la gestion des fichiers utilisateurs pour autoriser les utilisateurs à télécharger des images\nCe que vous apprendrez dans la deuxième partie\nApprendre et maitriser la création d'une API REST FULL\nApprendre et maitriser la protection des routes par des tokens\nApprendre et maitriser la configuration du CORS pour autoriser les clients qui peuvent accéder à notre backend\nApprendre et maitriser la rédaction de la documentation d'une API\nApprendre et maitriser le deployment en ligne d'une API REST FULL\nLa troisième partie de cette formation vous permet de vous spécialiser dans le développement Frontend.

В практическом разделе мы вместе по шагам прямо с чистого листа разработаем полностью рабочее single page application с возможностью регистрации, научимся работать с API и базами данных. Практический раздел мы завершим тем, что разместим уже готовое рабочее web приложение на хостинге и вы сможете смело добавить его в своё портфолио. Не думай, присоединяйся! Сейчас самое время! Будет интересно!",

Dla frontend developera HTML to język „pierwszego kontaktu”, bez którego nie może ruszyć dalej, ku JavaScriptowi i jego frameworkom.\nAkronim HTML z angielskiego oznacza: hipertekstowy język znaczników (HyperText Markup Language).

Dla kogoś, kto nigdy nie miał do czynienia z HTML-em, nie widział na przykład, jak wygląda w nim zapis kodu strony internetowej, powyższe definicje mogą brzmieć skomplikowanie.

      "description": "\"Das Internet ist eine Spielerei für Computerfreaks. Wir sehen darin keine Zukunft.\" - Ron Sommer\n\n\nDa hat sich der ehemalige Telekom-Chef Ron Sommer im Jahr 1990 leicht getäuscht. Das Internet ist inzwischen allgegenwärtig und man kann mit Fug und Recht behaupten, dass es die größte Revolution der Menschheitsgeschichte darstellt. Es hat unser Leben stark verändert und noch immer ist kein Ende abzusehen - eher im Gegenteil. Das spannendste dürfte uns noch bevor stehen.\nDeswegen wird es auch immer wichtiger, dass man Programme für das Internet schreiben kann. Zahlreiche Frameworks haben sich entwickelt, die es ermöglichen, mit der Programmiersprache serverseitige Java Programme zu schreiben, die dynamische Internetseiten anzeigen.\nJavaServer Faces (JSF) ist ein solches Framework, das zu dem offiziellen JavaEE-Standard (Java Enterprise Edition) gehört. Es soll die Entwicklung großer webbasierter Unternehmensanwendugen ermöglichen. Dabei geht JSF den Weg, dass die Vermischung von Java- und HTML-Code vermieden werden soll. Außerdem möchte JSF dem Programmierer viel 0815-Arbeit abnehmen und die Schwierigkeiten bei der Entwicklung von Web-Anwendungen möglichst vor ihm verbergen.\nIn diesem Kurs sollst du dieses sehr mächtige Java-Framework in all seinen Facetten kennenlernen. Wir starten bei den absoluten Grundlagen und arbeiten uns dann immer weiter in die Tiefen des Frameworks vor. Ich zeige dir neben den grundlegenden Bausteinen, den ManagedBeans, die Datenvalidierung, Konvertierung, Listener, außerdem den Templating-Mechanismus, der die Wiederverwendbarkeit von Teilen der Webseite erhöht, und vieles mehr.\nAm Ende schreiben wir zusammen ein großes Programm, in dem alle Inhalte noch einmal vorkommen. So entsteht vor deinen Augen eine relativ große Anwendung, die alles miteinander verbindet.\nNeben den Videos gehören zu dem Kurs noch weitere Materialien: Du erhälst Foliensätze als pdf, mit denen du die Inhalte noch einmal wiederholen kannst. In den Videos programmiere ich meistens und arbeite wenig mit den Folien, aber die Folien enthalten noch einmal alle wichtigen Informationen zusammengefasst fürs Wiederholen und schnelle Nachschlagen. Außerdem stelle ich dir natürlich sämtlichen Quellcode aller Beispiele zur Verfügung, damit du sofort loslegen kannst. Einige Quizes und Übungen vervollständigen den Kurs.\nNeben dem eigentlichen Thema JavaServer Faces zeige ich dir noch die Grundlagen des Servers GlassFish, der die Referenzimplementierung von JavaEE ist, und die wichtigsten Elemente von CDI - ein Bestandteil von JavaEE, der inzwischen zusammen mit JSF verwendet werden kann.  Außerdem ist es mir ein Herzensanliegen, auch ein wenig über eine gute Architektur für Web-Anwendungen zu sprechen, die ich dann in dem großen abschließenden Beispiel auch realisieren werde.\nAls IDE verwende ich Eclipse, aber es ist dir natürlich freigestellt, eine andere IDE zu verwenden. Jede größere IDE sollte ähnliche Funktionen anbieten wie ich sie dir in Eclipse zeige.",

Katılımcılar, Microsoft'un güçlü .NET 8 çatısı ve popüler front-end çerçevesi Angular 17 üzerine kurulu \"eMuhasebe\" adlı bir muhasebe uygulaması geliştirme sürecine adım adım dahil olacaklar.\nKurs içeriği, Temiz Mimari (Clean Architecture) yaklaşımını benimseyerek, uygulamanın sürdürülebilir ve bakımı kolay olmasını sağlamak için ayrıntılı bir şekilde işlenecektir. Katılımcılar, Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) ve Result pattern gibi ileri düzey yazılım tasarım desenlerini uygulayarak, uygulamanın veri okuma ve yazma işlemlerini daha verimli hale getirecekler. Ayrıca, Repository pattern ve Unit of Work gibi desenlerle veri erişim katmanını optimize edecek ve Entity Framework Core (EF Core) ile veri manipülasyonunu yönetecekler.\nEğitim, her bir kiracı için izole veritabanları sunan çok kiracılı (multi-tenant) bir yapı üzerine inşa edilecektir. AutoMapper ve FluentValidation gibi araçlar kullanılarak, veri transfer nesnelerinin (DTO) yönetimi ve model doğrulama işlemleri kolaylaştırılacaktır. Kurs boyunca, teorik bilgilerin yanı sıra gerçek dünya senaryoları üzerinden pratik uygulamalar yapılacak, böylece katılımcılar öğrendiklerini pekiştirme fırsatı bulacaklar.\nBu derinlemesine eğitim, katılımcılara güçlü ve esnek bir muhasebe uygulaması geliştirmede gerekli olan araçları ve teknikleri sunarak, yazılım mühendisliği kariyerlerinde bir adım öne taşıyacak.\n\n\nThis comprehensive training course is designed to teach participants how to develop an effective and scalable accounting application using modern web technologies and best software architecture practices. Participants will be immersed step-by-step in the development process of an accounting application named \"eMuhasebe\", built upon Microsoft’s powerful .NET 8 framework and the popular front-end framework Angular 17.\nThe course content will meticulously implement the Clean Architecture approach to ensure the application is sustainable and maintainable. Participants will apply advanced software design patterns such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Result pattern to enhance the efficiency of the application's data reading and writing operations. Additionally, patterns like Repository and Unit of Work will optimize the data access layer, managing data manipulation with Entity Framework Core (EF Core).\nThe training is structured around a multi-tenant architecture that provides isolated databases for each tenant. Tools such as AutoMapper and FluentValidation will be utilized to facilitate the management of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and model validation processes. Throughout the course, alongside theoretical knowledge, practical exercises based on real-world scenarios will be conducted, allowing participants to reinforce what they have learned.\nThis in-depth training will provide participants with the necessary tools and techniques to develop a robust and flexible accounting application, advancing their software engineering careers.",

      "description": "Automatize a criação dos seus CRUDs por meio do FilamentPHP!\nPainéis gerenciais são uma tarefa muito repetitiva que normalmente levam a criação de muitos CRUDs, uma tarefa cansativa se o painel for muito grande mas após este material você vai alcançar o Nirvana da criação de painéis gerenciais com recursos avançados e dashboard stats, gráficos e tabelas.\n\n\nO FilamentPHP é um projeto que te permite criar painéis admin com gerenciamento, upload, filtros, buscas globais, widgets para gráficos e card stats além de te permitir criar forms customizados com upload de imagens e agregar a facilidade de criação junto dos relacionamentos dos models do Laravel Framework.\n\n\nNeste programa de aprendizado vamos trabalhar a ideia de uma painel gerencial de uma loja virtual com gerenciamento de Produtos, Usuários, Pedidos e Categorias. Vamos trabalhar o relacionamento M:M entre Produtos e Categorias além de trabalharmos com o processo de ACL dentro do Admin diretamente com Filament e os Recursos do Laravel e depois com o uso do Shield que vai nos permitir ativar e desativar recursos por papéis e associa-los a nossos usuários.\n\n\nVocê vai aprender também a criar Gráficos na Dashboard  e neste gráfico iremos contar as vendas por mês além de criarmos cards stats para os últimos pedidos no período de 30 dias e o total de pedidos recebidos, ainda vamos falar também da organização do menu, como customizar o rodapé de nossa tabela e muito mais!\n\n\nVenha transformar sua jornada e deixe de perder tempo fazendo CRUDs no dia a dia e foque no que importa: O Negócio e Suas Regras!",

      "description": "Sie sind eingeladen auf eine aufregende Reise, bei der Sie angeleitet lernen, Google's Programmiersprache GO einzusetzen, um moderne Webanwendungen zu entwickeln, die sowohl in Tiefe als auch in Umfang hochgrading skalierbar sind. Sie nutzen die außergewöhnlichen Möglichkeiten, die GO für Full-Stack Entwickler bereit hält, um alle möglichen Arten von Server/Client-basierten Anwendungen zu entwicklen.\nDieser Kurs ist als reichhaltige Ressource für das Erlernen von Programmiergrundlagen und -konzepten im Allgemeinen und für die Entwicklung moderner und schneller Webanwendungen mit Googles Programmiersprache GO (golang) im Besonderen - eine umfassende Lernerfahrung.\nNeue Programmiertechniken und moderne Konzepte im Software-Design erlernt man am Einfachsten durch die Anwendung anhand lebensnaher Beispiele. In diesem Kurs lernen Sie, wie Sie eine moderne Webappplikation - eine Homepage zum Vermieten von Bungalows als Ferienwohnungen - planen, implementieren, testen, debuggen und schließlich auf einem Webserver installieren.\nSie werden die Vorteile der Programmiersprache GO kennenlernen und auf dem Weg zur fertigen Anwendung die Integration weiterer Elemente wie SQL/PostgreSQL Datenbanken, JavaScript (client- und serverseitig), AJAX-Techniken, HTML, CSS und die Benutzung essentieller Werkzeuge für Full-Stack-Entwickler kennenlernen.\nNeben dem Programmieren in GO beschäftigt sich dieser Kurs auch mit\nHTML5 / CSS / DOM\nJavaScript (Vanilla, keine jQuery Abhängigkeit)\nSQL / PostgreSQL\nMigrations / FIZZ\nJSON\nRoutes, Handlers, Models\nTests, Error Handling\nLinux (bash), Windows (Command Line), macOS (bash)\ngit / github\nInstallation der Webanwendung auf einem Server\nund vieles anderes mehr\nDer Kurs eignet sich zwar auch für Anfänger mit grundlegenden Programmiererfahrungen, ist jedoch für angelegt als umfangreiche Resource für moderat fortgeschrittene Entwickler. Er ist angefüllt mit Beispielen, Erklärungen und Erläuterungen zu Konzepten, die zur Entwicklung von modernen, schnellen und sicheren Webanwendungen notwendig sind, und kommt mit einem begleitenden Code-Repository auf Github und einer umfangreichen Kursübersicht als PDF, die sich als Teil des Kurses versteht, daher.\nEingebundene externe Packages und Abhängigkeiten:\ngo-chi | Router\nscs | Sessions\nnosurf | CSRF-Token\ngovalidator | Validator (server-sided)\npgx/v5 | PostgreSQL Driver & Toolkit\ngo-simple-mail | Golang package for sending e-mail\nCaddy 2 | a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in GO\nEbenfalls eine Rolle spielen:\nbootstrap | Bootstrap - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework (no jQuery)\nRoyalUI-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template | Free Bootstrap 4 Admin Template\nSimple-DataTables | DataTables but in TypeScript transpiled to Vanilla JS\npostgres | PostgreSQL Server (mirror only)\npop | Soda/Migrations - standardization of database tasks\ndbeaver | Dbeaver - free multi-platform database tool\nvanillajs-datepicker | Vanilla JavaScript datepicker\nnotie | unobtrusive notifications - clean and simple JavaScript\nSweetAlert2 | so many options for JavaScript popups\nMailHog | Web and API based SMTP testing\nFoundation for Emails 2 | Quickly create responsive HTML e-mails that work\nCobra | A Framework for Modern CLI Apps in GO\nGoDotEnv | A GO port of Ruby's dotenv library\nWenn Sie sich für diesen Kurs anmelden, haben Sie lebenslangen Zugang zum Kurs. Sie können in Ihrem eigenen Tempo lernen und jederzeit zu Inhalten zurückkehren, um tiefere Einblicke zu bekommen oder zusätzliche Konzepte zu lernen, wenn Sie dazu bereit sind.\nDieser Kurs wird außerdem mit einer 100%igen Geld-zurück-Garantie angeboten*.\nMeiner Meinung nach ist dies einer der umfassendsten Kurse in deutscher Sprache für die Entwicklung moderner, schneller und sicherer Webanwendungen von Grund auf.\nUnd wenn der Kurs aus irgendeinem Grund nicht für Sie funktioniert, können Sie innerhalb der ersten 14 Tage eine volle Rückerstattung* erhalten.\nMelden Sie sich jetzt an!\n\n\nSie können großen Nutzen aus diesem Kurs ziehen und, was noch wichtiger ist, Sie werden eine gute Zeit beim Erlernen der einer der besten Programmiersprachen aller Zeiten haben - der Programmiersprache GO, der am schnellsten wachsenden Programmiersprache mit den bestbezahlten Programmierern in den USA.\nGO ist eine Open-Source-Programmiersprache, die es leicht macht, einfache, zuverlässige und effiziente Software zu entwickeln\nGO wurde von Koryphäen der Informatik bei einem der besten, wenn nicht sogar dem besten Softwareentwicklungsunternehmen entwickelt, das es je gab - Google. Die Entwürfe stammen von Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike und Ken Thompson.\nGO ist eine sehr gute Wahl, um eine Programmiersprache zu lernen, da sie von einigen der gleichen Personen entwickelt wurde, die bereits die Programmiersprache C, Unix und UTF-8 erschaffen haben - einige der einflussreichsten Beiträge zur Informatik. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike und Ken Thompson schufen mit GO eine moderne Sprache, die problemlos auf mehrere Prozessoren parallel arbeiten kann, problemlos in verschiedenen Umgebungen funktioniert und dem Programmierer das Schreiben von Programmen durch eine sehr schlanke und benutzerfreundliche Syntax erleichtert.\nWarum hat Google eine neue Programmiersprache entwickelt?\nIn Googles Worten: \"GO wurde aus der Frustration über die bestehenden Sprachen und Umgebungen für die Systemprogrammierung geboren. Das Programmieren war zu schwierig geworden, und die Wahl der Sprachen war daran mit schuldig. Man musste sich entweder für\neine effiziente Kompilierung,\neine effiziente Ausführung oder\neine einfache Programmierung\nentscheiden. Alle drei Möglichkeiten waren nicht in ein und derselben Mainstream-Sprache verfügbar. Programmierer, die dazu in der Lage waren, zogen die Einfachheit der Sicherheit und der Effizienz vor, indem sie zu dynamisch typisierten Sprachen wie Python und JavaScript wechselten und nicht zu C oder C++ oder, in geringerem Maße, zu Java. GO ist ein Versuch, die Einfachheit der Programmierung einer interpretierten, dynamisch typisierten Sprache mit der Effizienz und Sicherheit einer statisch typisierten, kompilierten Sprache zu kombinieren.\nAußerdem sollte Programmieren auf moderne Art und Weise möglich sein, sowie Netzwerk- und Multicore-Computing unterstützen. Und schließlich soll die Arbeit mit GO schnell sein: Es sollte höchstens ein paar Sekunden dauern, eine große ausführbare Datei auf einem einzelnen Computer zu erstellen. Um diese Ziele zu erreichen, musste eine Reihe von linguistischen Fragen geklärt werden: ein ausdrucksstarkes, aber leichtgewichtiges Typsystem, Nebenläufigkeit und Garbage Collection, starre Spezifikation von Abhängigkeiten und so weiter. Diese Probleme können durch Bibliotheken oder Werkzeuge nicht gut gelöst werden; eine neue Sprache war erforderlich.\"\nLernen Sie mir mir zusammen die Vorteile in der Webprogrammierung einer der besten Programmiersprachen kennen, die je entwickelt wurde. Sie werden  Wissen, Ideen, Konzepten, Inspiration und Code-Beispielen erhalten, um selbst Software und Anwendungen nach Ihren Wünschen zu gestalten.\n\n\n* Lesen Sie die Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen von Udemy für Details.",

      "description": "Powitanie\nChcesz rozpocząć pracę z ASP NET MVC i zrozumieć zasady rządzące najpopularniejszą technologią do tworzenia aplikacji internetowych na platformie Microsoft .NET? Trafiłeś pod dobry adres! Wspólnie z ewangelistą Microsoft, Bartłomiejem Zassem, przygotowaliśmy dla Ciebie obszerny, 12-godzinny kurs w którym opowiemy o wszystkim, co chcesz lub powinieneś wiedzieć na jej temat.\nPodstawy wiedzy na temat dynamicznych aplikacji internetowych oraz ASP.NET\nKompleksowe kompendium wiedzy na temat podstaw ASP NET MVC, w tym:\nKonfigurację środowiska deweloperskiego\nRouting i kontrolery\nPobieranie i walidowanie danych od użytkownika\nTworzenie widoków\nPraca z bazą danych\nWdrażanie aplikacji\n\n\nCo znajdziesz w kursie?\nPodczas tworzenia kursu przyjęliśmy założenie, że masz już pewne doświadczenie w pisaniu aplikacji w języku C#, HTML i CSS, ale nie pisałeś wcześniej aplikacji internetowych. Rozpoczniemy więc od podstaw - pokażę Ci specyfikę aplikacji webowych, wytłumaczę Ci różnice pomiędzy poszczególnymi podejściami do pisania aplikacji, jakie oferuje ASP NET (np. Web Forms, Web Pages) a następnie skupimy się na dogłębnym wytłumaczeniu zasad działania poszczególnych filarów ASP NET MVC. Najbardziej docenianą przez programistów zaletą ASP NET MVC jest możliwość dowolnego dopasowywania elementów platformy do swoich potrzeb. Dlatego obok tematów prostych pojawią się także fragmenty trudniejsze, ponieważ będę tłumaczył jak poszczególne komponenty działają \"pod spodem\" i w których miejscach możesz zmodyfikować ich domyślne działanie. Zależało mi na przekazaniu Ci wiedzy kompleksowej, wytłumaczeniu wielu szczegółów związanych z poszczególnymi filarami ASP NET MVC, ponieważ to ułatwi Ci dalszy rozwój w kierunku programisty ASP NET MVC.\nKurs zaprojektowany został w taki sposób, żebyś mógł w dowolnym momencie do niego wrócić i obejrzeć tylko wybrane moduły, które akurat będą Ci potrzebne w pracy. Jeśli znasz już podstawy - możesz ominąć lekcje o routingu i przejść od razu na przykład do lekcji o pisaniu własnych walidatorów. Jeśli dane zagadnienie okaże się dla Ciebie jeszcze zbyt skomplikowane, lub nie interesuje Cię ono zbyt szczegółowo - możesz przeskoczyć do kolejnej lekcji.\nPotraktuj ten kurs jako kompleksowe kompendium wiedzy o ASP NET MVC, do którego będziesz z czasem wracać.\n\n\nSpecyfika aplikacji internetowych\nJeśli nie pisałeś wcześniej dynamicznych aplikacji internetowych, na początek powinieneś zrozumieć specyfikę aplikacji webowych. Dlatego na początek zobaczysz czym różni się żądanie GET od POST, jak przekazywać parametry do serwera. Podejrzymy komunikację między serwerem a przeglądarką internetową a nawet sami skonstruujemy i wyślemy do serwera proste komunikaty. Kiedy już uzupełnimy podstawy, przejdziemy do pisania aplikacji w technologii ASP NET.\n\n\nWprowadzenie do ASP.NET i konfiguracja środowiska\nASP NET MVC nie jest jedynym frameworkiem do tworzenia aplikacji internetowych na platformie .NET. W rodzinie ASP.NET znajdziemy także ASP NET Web Pages, ASP.NET Web Forms, usługi ASP NET Web API czy SignalR. Wytłumaczę Ci jakie są różnice między tymi technologiami - która sprawdzi się najlepiej w danym scenariuszu. Następnie skupimy się już na ASP NET MVC - zrobimy prostą aplikację, żebyś miał przedsmak tego jak wygląda pisanie takich rozwiązań. W kolejnych modułach dokładniej omówimy poszczególne elementy platformy. Przygotujemy także środowisko deweloperskie - będziemy korzystali z bezpłatnych narzędzi Visual Studio Express.\n\n\nRouting\nWszystko w ASP NET MVC zaczyna się od definiowania szablonów adresów URL i mapowania ich na odpowiednie kontrolery. Zobaczysz jak definiować routing w sposób klasyczny a także poprzez atrybuty. Pokażę Ci jak korzystać z wartości domyślnych i ograniczeń (Constraints). Pokażę Ci rozwiązania ułatwiające szukanie błędów w tablicach routingu. Wytłumaczę Ci bardzo dokładnie jak routing przekazuje parametry do innych komponentów ASP NET MVC - w tym do kontrolerów.\n\n\nKontrolery\nKontrolery są podstawowym miejscem, w którym określimy jaki kod ma zostać wywołany po wysłaniu żądania przez przegladarkę. Pokażę Ci w jaki sposób przekazywane są parametry do metod kontrolera. Zobaczysz jakie dane mogą być zwracane - może będziesz chciał, żeby była to strona HTML, a może plik do pobrania? Wytłumaczę Ci również jak rozbudować framework o własne selektory i filtry.\n\n\nWidoki, AJAX i narzędzia\nW większości przypadków będziesz chciał po prostu wyświetlić użytkownikowi stronę HTML po odebraniu żądania od przeglądarki. W ASP NET MVC oznacza to wygenerowanie tzw. widoku. Pokażę Ci jak korzystać z różnych składni pisania widoków i w szczegółach nauczę Cię korzystania z najpopularniejszej składni Razor. Zobaczysz jak tworzyć szablony stron, widoki cząstkowe, a także własne helpery - aby uprościć umieszczanie powtarzalnych elementów na stronach. Pokażę Ci jak korzystać z technik AJAXowych, jak optymalizować działanie takich stron poprzez ich kompresję. Zobaczysz narzędzia do budowania jak i testowania widoków.\n\n\nModel i praca z bazą danych\nWiększość aplikacji webowych korzysta z baz danych. Pokażę Ci techniki komunikacji z bazami, dostępne w ASP.NET oraz dokładniej omówimy jedną z najpopularniejszych - Entity Framework. Zobaczysz, że praca z bazą danych nie musi być trudna. Zobaczysz także w jaki sposób weryfikować dane pobierane od użytkownika, zanim je jeszcze zapiszemy do bazy danych - pokażę Ci jak korzystać z gotowych jak i własnych walidatorów.\n\n\nKontrolowanie stanu aplikacji\nAplikacje webowe potrzebują często zapamiętać pewne dane. Może to być stan koszyka w sklepie internetowym. Innym razem będą to cache'owane dane z bazy danych, ze względów wydajnościowych. Zobaczysz różne techniki radzenia sobie z bezstanowością aplikacji internetowych - praca z sesją, z ciasteczkami, zmiennymi statycznymi. Zobaczysz różne rodzaje cachingu. Wyjaśnię Ci którą z metod zapisywania danych wybrać w określonych scenariuszach.\n\n\nBezpieczeństwo aplikacji ASP NET MVC\nAplikacje internetowe muszą być bezpieczne - dlatego pokażę Ci jak zabezpieczyć Twoją aplikację webową przed najpopularniejszymi typami ataków. Zobaczysz jak dodać mechanizm logowania do Twojej strony, jak uchronić się przed atakami Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) i innymi.\n\n\nWdrażanie aplikacji\nNa koniec pokażę Ci jak wdrożyć aplikację na serwer, aby podzielić się nią z innymi. Zobaczysz jak wdrożyć ją na własny serwer, na płatny hosting a także bezpłatny wariant usługi hostingowej opartej o Azure Websites.\n\n\nPodsumowując, kurs zawiera między innymi:\nPodstawy wiedzy na temat dynamicznych aplikacji internetowych oraz ASP NET\nKompleksowe kompendium wiedzy na temat podstaw ASP NET MVC, w tym:\nKonfigurację środowiska deweloperskiego\nRouting i kontrolery\nPobieranie i walidowanie danych od użytkownika\nTworzenie widoków\nPraca z bazą danych\nWdrażanie aplikacji\nI wiele, wiele więcej!\n\n\nDla kogo jest ten kurs?\nKurs opracowaliśmy dla osób, które znają już język C# oraz HTML i chciałyby nauczyć się pisania dynamicznych aplikacji internetowych opartych o ASP NET MVC. Jest on także dla osób, które miały już styczność z ASP NET MVC,  ale chciałyby usystematyzować lub rozszerzyć swoją wiedzę - w takim wypadku można pominąć pierwsze moduły kursu. Idealnie również sprawdzi się dla osób, które wcześniej pisały aplikacje w ASP.NET Web Forms a teraz chciałyby poznać różnice w nowym podejściu jakie ofertuje ASP NET MVC. Osobom początkującym zdecydowanie polecamy skorzystanie w pierwszej kolejności z kursów podstaw C# oraz HTML na eduweb.\n\n\nDlaczego wybrać właśnie ten kurs?\nKurs wideo to najbardziej efektywna a zarazem najprzyjemniejsza forma nauki. Jest on tak prowadzony, byś cały czas mógł go śledzić z zainteresowaniem i zaangażowaniem, a także czerpać satysfakcję z tworzonych projektów.\nWiedza, którą otrzymujesz w tym kursie, to nie tylko sucha teoria, ale również wskazówki od praktyka z wieloletnim doświadczeniem, dzięki którym dużo łatwiej będzie Ci opanować materiał i przygotować ciekawe projekty w ASP NET MVC.\nUczysz się na praktycznych przykładach. Otrzymasz wiele gotowych projektów, które ułatwią Ci poznawanie ASP NET MVC.",

      "description": "Czego się nauczysz ?\nJeśli do tej pory nauczyłeś się podstaw HTML, CSS, Bootstrapa lub PHP ale nadal nie wiesz jak wykorzystać tą wiedzę w praktyce to ten kurs jest odpowiedzią na Twoje potrzeby. Został stworzony w taki sposób, żeby wprowadzić Cię w praktyczne wykorzystywanie tych technologi przy kodowaniu strony internetowej zupełnie od zera. Po tym kursie programowanie przestanie być tylko teorią i stanie się o wiele bardziej zrozumiałe. W kursie poznasz interakcje między znanymi technologiami: Bootstrap, JS, PHP w połączeniu z bazą danych opartą o Mysql.\n\n\nzakodujesz przygotowany szablon w oparciu o siatkę\nnauczysz się stosować funkcje Bootstrapa\ndodatkowo wykorzystasz elementy HTML, CSS i JavaScript\nstworzysz dashboard dla admina w PHP\npołączysz zalety języka PHP z technologiami frontendowymi\nnauczysz się pracować z bazą danych Mysql\nstworzysz tabele w bazie danych dla użytkowników\npołączysz relacje między tabelami w bazie danych\nzobaczysz jak radzić sobie z błędami w PHP\nstworzysz mini system zarządania kierowcami\nprzekonasz się jak łączyć front i back-end z bazą danych\n\n\nZakoduj szablon od zera\nW tym kursie przebrniesz przez wszystkie etapy kodowania działającej witryny zarówno po stronie front-endu jak i back-endu. Wykorzystując Bootrstapa pokażemy Ci jak korzystać z jego możliwości i w szybki sposób stworzyć szkielet witryny, na który składa się header, menu, stopka oraz oczywiście poszczególne sekcje strony. W efekcie czego powstanie szablon typowej witryny firmowej ( w naszym przypadku transportowej), który możesz wykorzystać praktycznie do każdego typu działalności. Przekonasz się, że własna strona dla małej firmy może powstać w jeden wieczór.\n\n\nStwórz dashboard admina\nW kolejnym kroku stworzysz zaplecze strony czyli back-end gdzie posłużysz się językiem PHP oraz bazą danych Mysql.\nUtworzysz panel administracyjny wraz z logowaniem admina gdzie będziesz mógł zarządzać danymi kierowców. Tutaj nauczysz się tworzyć tabele bazy danych i łączyć je między sobą. Zobaczysz jak stworzyć dane w taki sposób, by synchronizowały się zarówno na froncie jak i na zapleczu.\n\n\nProste i elastyczne strony\nW kursie korzystamy z najpopularniejszych technologi webowych, dzięki temu wiedza wyniesiona z tego szkolenia będzie przydatna na każdym kroku projektowania stron zarówno od strony klienta jak i zaplecza. Poznasz możliwości najpopularniejszego na świecie frameworka w kategorii frontu – Bootstrapa. Stworzysz na nim elastyczny i responsywny układ oparty o 12 kolumnową siatkę. Dodatkowo poszerzysz możliwości strony o przypisanie niestandardowych ikon z Fontawesome.\n\n\nPHP + Mysql\nCzym była by funkcjonalna strona bez technologii takich jak PHP w połączeniu z bazą danych Mysql. To właśnie dzięki nim będziesz mógł na swojej witrynie dodać o wiele bardziej skompilowane funkcje zarówno we froncie jak i na zapleczu. W kursie stworzysz funkcje zarządzania kierowcami z poziomu zaplecza, a dodatkowo aktualizowane dane tych kierowców będą wyświetlać się na części frontowej.",

      "description": "¿Qué es WebdriverIO?\nWebdriverIO es un marco de automatización progresivo creado para automatizar aplicaciones web y móviles modernas. Simplifica la interacción con su aplicación y proporciona un conjunto de complementos que lo ayudan a crear un conjunto de pruebas escalable, robusto y estable.\n\n\nEstá diseñado para ser:\n\n\nAmpliable: agregar funciones auxiliares o conjuntos y combinaciones más complicadas de comandos existentes es simple y realmente útil\nCompatible: WebdriverIO se puede ejecutar en el protocolo WebDriver para verdaderas pruebas entre navegadores, así como también en el protocolo Chrome DevTools para la automatización basada en Chromium usando Puppeteer.\nRico en funciones: la gran variedad de complementos integrados y comunitarios le permite integrar y ampliar fácilmente su configuración para cumplir con sus requisitos.\n\n\nPuede utilizar WebdriverIO para automatizar:\n\n\nAplicaciones web modernas escritas en React, Vue, Angular, Svelte u otros marcos frontend\nAplicaciones móviles híbridas o nativas que se ejecutan en un emulador / simulador o en un dispositivo real\nAplicaciones de escritorio nativas (por ejemplo, escritas con Electron.js)\n\n\nBasado en estándares web\nWebdriverIO aprovecha el poder del protocolo WebDriver que es desarrollado y respaldado por todos los proveedores de navegadores y garantiza una verdadera experiencia de prueba entre navegadores. Mientras que otras herramientas de automatización requieren que descargue un navegador modificado que no utilizan los usuarios reales o que emule el comportamiento del usuario inyectando JavaScript, WebdriverIO se basa en un estándar común acordado para la automatización que se prueba adecuadamente y garantiza la compatibilidad durante las próximas décadas.\n\n\nDurante el desarrollo de este estándar de automatización, la web ha cambiado mucho y muchos de los requisitos que los desarrolladores tienen hoy para probar su aplicación web ya no se pueden cumplir con WebDriver. Si bien algunos de los principales contribuyentes de este proyecto ayudan a respaldar la próxima generación del protocolo WebDriver, WebdriverIO proporciona una solución de automatización alternativa basada en el protocolo Chrome DevTools. Esto permite al usuario cambiar sin problemas entre los comandos convencionales basados en WebDriver y las potentes interacciones del navegador a través de Puppeteer.",

Pourtant selon les régions, je peux clairement te dire qu’Angular reste le framework le plus demandé en entreprise..\n\n\nPourquoi ?\n\nCar il a été le premier à être mis en place dans le domaine frontend.\nLes sociétés ne peuvent pas se permettre de porter leur code d’un framework à un autre, cela engendrerait trop de sur-coûts !\n\n\nC’est aussi un framework cross-platform !\n\nOui et encore oui ! Angular est le premier framework qui a été mis en place sur la plupart des autres frameworks !\n\n\nPourquoi ? Car il est le plus utilisé et le plus mature.\n\n\nJ’en prends pour preuve Ionic (Framework Mobile) qui a, pendant les 4 premières versions, travaillé avec uniquement Angular ! Depuis quelques mois seulement il est possible de travailler avec React/Vue.\n\n\nUn autre exemple ? Bien sûr, le framework MeteorJS qui a décidé de travailler uniquement avec Angular au départ puis d’ouvrir les possibilités avec React/Vue.\n\nOui, Angular est difficile à prendre en main !\n\n\nCar c’est un FRAMEWORK ! React et Vue ne sont que des bibliothèques, elles n’apportent pas tout le cadre de travail puissant d’Angular.\nComme tout framework, il est nécessaire de monter en compétences et de travailler sur différents cas afin de comprendre tous les mécanismes.\n\nUne formation 100% pratique\n\n\nCar il est inutile de faire de la théorie, tout du moins, de faire un cours magistral sur Angular.\nIl est nécessaire de mettre « les mains dans le cambouis » dès que possible !\n\n\n+  de 15h de formation\n\n\n[Angular To The Moon] est pour le moment composée de 3 parties, l’apprentissage des bases sur un cas concret, la création d’un site pour client type, la création d’une application mobile avec Ionic 5 + Angular.\nLa formation est évolutive et disponible 24h/24, 7j/7.\n\n\n+ de 40h de pratique\n\n\nJe t’ai dit que la formation été orientée 100% pratique, je ne vais pas te laisser partir sans avoir pratiqué un maximum.\nEn plus de l’acquisition des connaissances sur des cas concrets, tu auras accès à de nombreux exercices, et ils seront tous corrigés en vidéo !\n\n\nCar j’ai à coeur de faire de toi un vrai dév Angular\n\n\nJe reste entièrement disponible pour répondre aux questions de mes apprenants !\nSeul on va plus vite, ensemble on va plus loin !\n\n\nEn bref, [Angular To The Moon] c’est :\n✔️ + de 15h de formation\n✔️ + de 40h de pratique\n✔️ du contenu à forte valeur ajoutée en approche (Symfony + Angular / Electron + Angular / NodeJS + Angular)\n\n\n✨ Je te l’ai dit, je t’accompagne du début jusqu’à la fin, car ta réussite est la mienne !\n\n\nJe t’attends de l’autre côté,\n\nÀ tout de suite !\n\n\nThomas,",

Pero no es un paseo tranquilo, es un viaje intenso, lleno de desafíos reales. Aquí no solo aprendes a usar servicios como CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy o CodePipeline en Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS), sino que te conviertes en alguien capaz de desplegar soluciones robustas con Terraform, desde cero y con herramientas de nivel profesional.\nAl principio, te arremangamos y te sumergimos en la instalación de herramientas indispensables. Después, entramos en el corazón de los contenedores y las imágenes: las piezas con las que se construyen las aplicaciones más modernas. Y en el clímax, tus contenedores no solo se almacenan en Elastic Container Registry, sino que cobran vida en Elastic Kubernetes Services. Eso es poder. Eso es profesionalismo.\n¿Por qué esto es importante? Porque los microservicios son el presente y el futuro. Kubernetes no solo optimiza recursos, también da agilidad y flexibilidad. Esto no es teoría, es la realidad de las empresas grandes, medianas y pequeñas. Y tú estarás preparado para liderar esa transformación.\nNo importa si eres un desarrollador experimentado, un líder técnico, un arquitecto cloud o alguien autodidacta con hambre de aprender. Aquí hay algo para todos, desde código fuente hasta prácticas guiadas. Cada video está diseñado para que construyas, despliegues y brilles en tu carrera.\n¿Estás listo para dejar de ver cómo otros avanzan y empezar a construir tu futuro? Este curso es el primer paso. Nos vemos dentro.\nGracias y hasta pronto. Tu momento empieza ahora.",

No quiere decir que no hayan servidores, discos, cables de red, máquinas virtuales, etc., solo que nosotros le dejamos esa responsabilidad y aprovisionamiento a una entidad experta, como lo es en este caso Amazon. Nuestra tarea es hacer uso de los servicios que nos proveen, para alojar nuestra aplicación.\nTodo esto lo iremos aplicando con una herramienta Open Source llamado Serverless Framework, que mediante ciertas configuraciones podremos desplegar nuestra aplicaciones fácilmente en AWS. Incluso esta herramienta nos permite probar en local como funciona la aplicación antes de desplegar.\nNo olvidar que usaremos NodeJS para construir la lógica de nuestra aplicación, pero teniendo este conocimiento de base, podemos en un futuro trabajar con otras tecnologías como Go, Java y otros que sean soportados por el SDK de Amazon.",

Одна из главных тем курса - это не просто выполнить все требования тестового задания, а сделать это правильно, используя лучшие практики написания кода. Начинается курс с установки Фреймворка и настройки сервера. Отдельно уделено время заполнению базы данных фейковыми данными и проработке миграций. Дальше мы вспомним основы git. Правильно подключим фронтенд библиотеки (Bootstrap 5 и т.д.) и разберемся как ими пользоваться и как они работают. Следующим шагом мы начнем реализовывать страницы сайта. К каждой странице в тестовом задании есть отдельные требования. На данном этапе мы изучим возможности Laravel, напишем модели, обозначим взаимоотношения между моделями, оптимизируем запросы к базе данных в контроллере и вынесем их в scope, создадим сервисный слой для бизнес логики, научимся использовать очереди, подключим свои helper функции и т.д. В части посвященной VueJS мы разобьём страницы сайта на компоненты. Изучим возможности библиотеки Vuex, и научим компоненты общаться друг с другом использую центральное хранилище. Научимся использовать библиотеку axios для выполнения AJAX запросов к базе данных. И в последнем видео уроке посморим как использовать модули для того, чтобы  хранилище Vuex не разрасталось.",
