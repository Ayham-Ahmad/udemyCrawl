Instead, we'll dive right into how to make use of the concepts you already understand in another language, in Python.\n\n\nWe'll start with the most important syntax first, so that after the first section or two you'll already be able to write Python scripts. Then we'll cover how to work with classes, containers, regular expressions and files in Python, and more.\n\n\nYou'll also learn how to use Numpy for numerical computing (less complicated than it sounds!) and how to use Pandas as a virtual spreadsheet. In the final section we'll cover how to draw charts so you can visualise your data, and how to use a simple artificial neural network to make predictions based on your data.\n\n\nThe courses includes suggested exercises and quizzes to help you check your progress. With a little practice, you can quickly learn to make use of Python for automating routine tasks, processing text data, working with numerical data, or whatever you need to do.\n\n\nIf you already have some programming knowledge and don't want to sit through explanations of basic concepts, but do want to learn to use Python alongside your existing programming skills, this course is for you.",

The language supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing developers to choose the approach that best suits their needs.\n\n\nPython's simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for beginners. Its extensive standard library and third-party packages cater to various domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Python's \"hello world\" program serves as an entry point for beginners, introducing them to the basic syntax and structure. From there, learners can progress to more complex projects, such as building simple games or web applications.\n\n\nOperators play a crucial role in any programming language, and Python provides a rich set of operators for different operations. These include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=), logical operators (and, or, not), and assignment operators (=, +=, -=). Understanding how to use these operators effectively is essential for writing efficient and concise Python code.\n\n\nPython's popularity continues to grow due to its simplicity, versatility, and extensive community support.

Generics are an important part of the Java programming language.\nWe have extra lessons on Java Optional which helps us avoid null pointer exceptions in Java. You will learn about Optionals because it's knowledge will be applied when you learn about Java Streams API.\nFinally, we learn about the Streams API, how it works and the various methods such as filter(), map(), flatMap(), reduce(), collect() ... and so on.\nAfter this course, you should have a solid understanding of the Java Generics, the Collection Framework with its Data Structures and the Java Streams API.\nIn a nutshell, generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods. Much like the more familiar formal parameters used in method declarations, type parameters provide a way for you to re-use the same code with different inputs. The difference is that the inputs to formal parameters are values, while the inputs to type parameters are types. (Java Docs)",

      "description": "Angular Version 5\nPurpose: To keep this course on the cutting edge of Angular technology and be consistent in providing instruction for the features found in the latest Angular release (v5)\nIn this update we addressed the major changes in the Angular version 5 major release. Per our course content, including hands-on coding exercises, there were a few breaking changes in the 5.1 releases which ripped across much of the original project code and also included minor, non-breaking changes which outdated certain aspects of our original content.\nWe've updated all of the course’s code-along video content with version 5 code, including:\nAngular-CLI repositioning & syntax usage related to its repositioning\nAngular-CLI & npm syntax usage\nAngular-CLI template output changes\nMaterial 2 Library Module massive positioning changes\nMaterial 2 inclusion and configuration syntax changes\nMaterial 2/Animations Module repositioning\nFallout of the above deltas outdated a large percentage of the course’s existing content. Each affected video in the series was updated to reflect the current release.\nThe Angular Forms Module has been in flux since the inception of Angular 2. Fortunately, it has stabilized in the later 4.x releases and we feel comfortable enough in it’s current state to have included it. Forms are a pillar of web-based development and we feel this content adds significant value to the course.\nWhile closely tied to the Angular core library, but not included in it, the Material 2 styling library has endured a lengthy, rough development and release lifecycle. As this library is so closely tied to the Angular core, we’ve included content in this video series from the beginning. Again, in this current release, many breaking changes and previously unavailable features were included. We made significant changes to existing content and created additional content to appropriately cover the current state of the Material library.\nAs with prior updates to this video series, we applied incremental improvements to existing content (that was not updated for v.4.3 changes) in an effort to continuously improve the overall effectiveness and appeal of the entire course.\nWeb frameworks can be difficult enough to get your head around at the best of times. When it comes to Angular, it can be especially challenging to keep up; new versions are released every 6 months, and although the latest version is Angular 5, there wasn't actually an 'Angular 3'! Confused? Don't be. This online course will explain it all...\nKeeping Current with Angular\nThis course will continue to be updated regularly to reflect the constant changes in the Angular framework. We're teaching this course in a modular style rather than project-based style so that small changes in Angular can be updated right away, and not affect your ability to learn in any way.\nAngular for All\nUnderstand Angular and how it can make you a better developer\nCode an Angular project with an online IDE\nLearn to code with TypeScript\nUtilise dependency injection to keep your applications lean\nImplement services in an Angular application\nGet to grips with component paradigms, pipes, data binding, component nesting and more\nMaster Frameworks\nThis Angular 5 online course was designed for those who already know a little about creating web UIs with JavaScript tools. Those who have experience programming with a common object oriented scripting language will also be at an advantage. However, absolutely no Angular experience is needed to keep up with the lessons.\nWhat does the course cover? Everything from Angular's best practices in building components, templates, services, routes and modules to designing and building all of the above. You'll also learn how to use templates to create your application's user interface, how to extend HTML with directives, pipes and data binding, and how routing is done with a modular approach.\nEach of the most important features of Angular 5 have a dedicated section in this course, along with practical exercises to compound your learning and helpful guidance from our expert tutor every step of the way. Don't worry, we've covered all angles so you can learn what you need to know, and fast.\nWhether you're an IT professional, an aspiring web, mobile or service app developer, a tester, a UI designer or an architect, this course will get you right up to speed on Angular 5. By the time you've finished, you'll know how Angular solutions are designed, administered and developed and will have a solid understanding of how to get Angular projects up and running.\nWhat is Angular 5?\nAngular, or Angular JS, is a structural framework for dynamic web applications. In other words, it helps turn simple HTML into cool web apps that actually do stuff (rather than just staying static like a simple informational website would do), by using it as a template then extending its syntax to express components. Angular 4 is the newest and most recent 'majorly revamped' version. It is backwards compatible with Angular 2 and 4.\n\n\nAngular Version 4.3\nPurpose: To keep this course on the cutting edge of Angular technology and be consistent in providing instruction for the features found in the latest Angular release (v4.3)\nIn this update we addressed the major changes in the Angular version 4.3 release (scheduled for early July 2017). Per our course content, including hands-on coding exercises, there were a few breaking changes in the 4.3 beta/rc releases which ripped across much of the original project code and also included minor, non-breaking changes which outdated certain aspects of our original content. With this update we were also able to comfortably include an entirely new course content section focusing on the Angular Forms module. This Angular module has stabilized enough in the v.4.3 release to be included in the course.\nWe updated all of the course’s code-along video content to fix the breaking changes, including:\nAngular-CLI repositioning & syntax usage related to its repositioning\nAngular-CLI & npm syntax usage\nAngular-CLI template output changes\nMaterial 2 Library Module massive positioning changes\nMaterial 2 inclusion and configuration syntax changes\nMaterial 2/Animations Module repositioning\nFallout of the above deltas outdated a large percentage of the course’s existing content.

      "description": "People say that python is an intuitive language to learn and use. Beginners write their first programs in no time and more advanced programmers make educated guesses how to use parts of Python they have never used before. Even third-party libraries seem to work exactly how you expected.\n80% of our time we are using operators like +-/* to calculate, use for-loops to go through lists, use len() to count and indexers to access elements from lists. After a while you don't even have to think about these language features anymore. You just use them and expect things to work the same way everywhere.\nBut why and how does this work?\nIn this course, you learn how to design your classes and objects to support common language features so other programmers can make smart guesses about how to use them. You learn how to support iteration, subscripting (indexing), context managers, hashing, equality checking etc.\nAfter this course, you are able to:\n- Explain the origin of the names Python datamodel, magic methods, dunder methods and special methods.\n- Write an indexer to support subscripting with the __getitem__ method\n- Apply __iter__, __next__ to make your objects iterable\n- Define the object identity\n- Use __hash__ to make objects hashable\n- Specify  language featureswith special methods __eq__, __ne__, __lt__, __gt__, __le__, __ge__\n- Make objects callable with __call__\n- Describe how objects are constructed by methods __new__ and __init__\n- Wrap existing code into context managers with __enter__ and __exit__\nThe length of this course is 2 hours. Each topic shows clear examples of how to make your classes more Pythonic by implementing special methods, the secret weapon of your objects. This course has no exercises.\nThis course is meant for developer with basic Python experience who want to improve their skills or developers who bring experience from another language like c#, java, javascript, c++ and want to learn about Pythons unique language features.\nThis course is taught by Loek van den Ouweland, a senior software engineer with 25 years of experience. Loek is the creator of Wunderlist for windows, Microsoft To-do and Mahjong for Windows and has 15 years of experience teaching software engineering to a wide variety of students.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Python Interview Questions & Answers course by Uplatz.\n\n\nUplatz provides this course on the most frequently asked questions in Python Developer / Software Programmer interviews. In this Python interview questions course, you will learn and get familiarized with the correct and comprehensive answers to the trending questions related to Python programming.\n\n\nDue to Python's popularity and widespread applicability to build complex applications and analyze complex data as well as it's prominence in Data Science and Machine Learning areas, there are huge job opportunities for Python developers and programmers. As per Indeed, the average base salary of a Python Developer is $109,904. Hence skilled Python developers command premium salaries. Moreover, with the knowledge of Python, it is easy for the individuals to enter fields like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science & Engineering, Web & Applications Development, and the like.\n\n\nPython is an open source general-purpose coding language which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development. Python is a rising star in the programming world for two main reasons: the big range of tasks it can handle, combined with the fact that it’s actually a very beginner-friendly language. Python code syntax uses English keywords, and that makes it easy for anyone to understand and get started with the language. A good definition of Python from Python Software Foundation is - \"Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes.\"\n\n\nIn essence, Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide variety of applications. It includes high-level data structures, dynamic typing, dynamic binding, and many more features that make it as useful for complex application development as it is for scripting or \"glue code\" that connects components together. It can also be extended to make system calls to almost all operating systems and to run code written in C or C++. Due to its ubiquity and ability to run on nearly every system architecture, Python is a universal language found in a variety of different applications.\nPython is most often compared to Ruby, JavaScript, and Scheme. What sets Python apart from other programming languages is that it is simple to use, can be taught to a beginner, can be embedded into any application, and can run on all current operating systems, including Mac, Windows, and Linux. It is also one of the most powerful languages a programmer can use and is about three and five times faster to code than JavaScript and C++, respectively.\n\n\nApplications of Python\nPython is used for prototype development, coding websites and applications, processing images, scientific data, and more. The program can be found in action on the Google search engine, NASA, Disney, Pinterest, and more. It was built for ease of use and speed and is less complicated than Ruby and other similar object-oriented programming languages. Because it is open-sourced, the program has enjoyed a popularity among developers and programmers, and it continues to be the base program for most websites in operation on the internet today.\nPython works perfectly with Django, which functions as the base framework system that Python builds on. Python also enables programs to script professional-grade web-based products. From back-end to front-end development, full-stack and web-based options, Python programmers continue to find more economic prospects as the use of the language grows to encompass all areas of software and web development.",

      "description": "TypeScript- Typescript- Type script\n\nWelcome to the \"TypeScript: Learn Typescript & Type script Pro In Details\" course.\nLearn TypeScript. With my Type script course walkthrough features that you need to know to get started in Javascript JS\n\nTypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It introduces additional features like strict type binding (variables are bound to specific data types) to JavaScript and can also be compiled down to Java Script as well.\nThis course is for beginners. To be able to take this course, all you need is the basic understanding of JavaScript.\nIn this course, we're going to start with the basics and I'm going to show you how fun it is to build Type Script programs. After you're familiar with the syntax, we're going to move on to more advanced Type script development techniques, such as: working with closures, object-oriented programming, real-time asynchronous development, and decorators.\nYou'll also learn that you're not limited to Angular 2+ or plain JavaScript/ Typescript Projects. A complete Module covers how to use TypeScript with ReactJS to benefit from its Features, there, too.\n\nThis is a beginner-level TypeScript tutorial, however, a knowledge of JavaScript will be very helpful. If you have no exposure to Javascript you should consider taking one of Oak Academy Java Script courses, either before or after this course.\nI tried to tell all complex topics in very detail on the course. I used some diagrams to tell some important topics and created applications.\n\nWhat is Typescript?\nTypeScript is a programming language that helps developers turn medium-sized JavaScript projects and prototypes into large-scale ones. JavaScript, a widely-used programming language, was designed to be easy to use for developers and non-developers alike. As a result, JavaScript development is difficult to scale up. Microsoft introduced typescript react to solve this scalability problem. TypeScript is often referred to as JavaScript with typescript react because it allows developers to find errors while writing their code rather than wait until the application is running. And because TypeScript  is a syntactical superset of JavaScript, any JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program.\n\nWhat is the difference Typescript and Javascript?\nTypescript is a superset of JavaScript. As its name suggests, Type script adds optional static typing to the JavaScript language. JavaScript is a scripting language that allows developers to create dynamic web content. It is known for being fairly easy to use and learn. This makes it a popular programming language for small and medium-scale web projects. Developers use Type script when they need to scale up their JavaScript development. Its language is more powerful and intuitive, allowing developers to find and correct errors during compile time, rather than only during run-time, as with JavaScript. TypeScript is better suited than JavaScript for large applications, but it requires a foundational knowledge of JavaScript to use.\n\nWhat careers use Typescript?\nTypeScript is mainly associated with development careers. Typical job titles for TypeScript developers include senior developer, front end developer, stack developer, and software engineer. Because react typescript and typescript node is a superset of JavaScript, learning react typescript is a great next step for engineers who are already skilled in JavaScript. Programming knowledge is applicable in just about every industry, so developers with an understanding of TypeScript (which implies skill in JavaScript) might work in a wide range of fields building applications for both server-side and client-side execution.\n\nWhat is TypeScript and why use it?\nTypeScript features, syntax, and keywords in nodejs typescript\nTooling and Framework Options\nHow to create a class\nTypeScript variables and functions in angular typescript\nTypeScript declarations\nTypeScript classes and interfaces\nMuch more...\nAt the end of the course;\nTypes and how to use them\nHow the TypeScript Compiler works\nES6 Features in TypeScript\nClasses in TypeScript\nInterfaces\nunderstanding typescript\nIn this TypeScript tutorial, you will learn the key concepts and features to get started building applications with TypeScript. Topics that are covered include:\n\nThis course is going to take you from the beginning to a further level.

      "description": "The magic happens when you want to find something. Usually, you’d have to look through the entire database if you didn’t have some “index” (think like the index at the back of a large textbook) to tell you where everything was. Databases index a whole bunch of metadata so that looking for stuff is really fast.\nMicrosoft SQL is an exceptional reason programming language that is utilized to interface with databases. It works by understanding and analyzing databases that include data fields in their tables. For example, we can take a large organization where a lot of data has to be stored and managed. The organization has to collect and store all the information from the various departments. All the gathered information is organized and stored in a database, but it has to be valuable and accessible — that’s the place where SQL comes in. In such a situation, MS SQL is a platform that associates with front-end and back-end databases (computers and databases held on servers).\nThe advantages of learning Microsoft SQL are expanding and significant. MS SQL had a colossal increment in utilization during the most recent couple of years. Now, this tendency proceeds because companies gather more and more information that has to be stored and comprehended afterward.\nData storage and management have always been the backbone for every field. Databases have become a vital part of many industries. The need to understand the concept and operations of databases has become critical with the evolution of big data, Data Science and Data warehouses.\nThe foundation of the advanced topics of data management could only be built by learning the basics of databases and querying languages. Hence this course provides an opportunity to those who want to make their position in the technical market.\nAlso, the world is shifting its paradigms towards computerized methods and ways of doing things. A lot of this includes data stored in databases, be it banks, stores, hospitals, e-stores, educational institutes or government operational offices all have shifted towards databases as their storage mechanism. SQL has the highest job postings and markets all over the world compared to any other programming language. Hence taking this course provides you with an edge and a better chance at scoring a job.",

      "description": "Greetings course seekers. My course, “Ethical Hacking: Design Command and Control using Python 3” is hot off the press here in 2024 and 2025. The way this course works is as follows:\nI will start at ground zero and show you how to design and build a fully featured command and control tool using Python 3. I will take the time to explain to you every bit of the code that I use to make this project happen. This is a project that I accomplished myself a couple of years ago, but during my recording sessions for this class, I decided to re-do the code quite a bit, to make it better, and thus, you will get a live and realistic experience, because when bugs show up, they are new for me just as they are for you. I will record for you how I handle these situations and hopefully you can learn from this process.\nI will show you how I started the project with a very humble beginning with a small little w3schools search, but then gradually expanded the code, turning it into a fully featured command and control tool over time, including both a client and server portion with many custom commands built in and with full end to end symmetric encryption.\nI will move slowly and try to explain everything to you, including the Python code and best practices. I am not trying to rush through anything here with you. I really do want you to learn. However, if you are looking for contrived exercises to do and those sorts of things, this is not the course for that. I am showing you real code for a real Red Team tool that will have real application for you, if you work in or have an interest in Cybersecurity or Ethical Hacking.\nThe way this course will progress is that we will build the tool together starting from just a couple of lines of code. During every video, I am always using the term “we” because I expect you to be following along with me every step of the way. I will also provide you with 100% of the source code after each lesson, and the final state of the code at the end of the course. My code will become your code and you can take the tool to the next level, although it will be at a prominent level already.\nThe course is divided up into sections with each video building upon the last. At the end of each section, I always do a Python summary review that speaks directly to the new Python code we covered during a section of the course. Some of you that have Python experience may want to skip these videos, but for beginners or for those who are rusty, I recommend watching them.\nThe entire course is just over 18 hours in length and unlike other courses that cover many different topics and speed through everything, that is not what happens here. This course covers one topic, or you might consider it to be two topics and that is it. We have the command-and-control tool itself and we have the Python code that is building the tool. That is where all my energy and time will be directed, and this allows you to focus and learn.\nMy goal is that my course here will be a spark that some of you need to start building your own tools, or to make this tool even better. Learning is easy and fun when you have an interest in something, thus if you have that interest, give my course a try. If you do not care about coding your own custom tools for ethical hacking, then this course is not going to be the right fit for you.\nEnough reading already! Go watch a few of my free preview videos and see what you think.",
      "target_audience": [
        "Ideally, it is for those that have some basic knowledge in at least one programming language and has an interest or experience in ethical hacking/offensive cybersecurity and would like to learn how to build their own tools. However, I start at ground zero and explain every line or block of code, thus beginners can follow along and learn too. Full source code is available within the course, which allows those that do not care about learning the Python or those that already know Python to skip most of the lessons if they prefer, but still be able to use the code."

VEX Robotics hosts the world's largest robotics competition for students all over the world to compete against one another using a robot of their own design. VEX has text-based coding in the most universal programming language: \"C'. It also has a capacity for data management and analysis and finally, VEX has a capacity to use coding and robotics to solve real world problems.\n\n\nWhat is special about this course?\nAfter eight lessons, students complete several quite advanced examples of INPUT / OUTPUT programming whereby they control the speed and the direction of a motor by bringing their hand closer to and further from a distance sensor. This task is broken down into the simplest possible steps; in each step students add two to three lines of code, experiment with changing variables and observing the output of the robot. This ensures that they understand not only what each line of code does, but how it does it and what will happen when it changes. This course will help you understand and achieve the skills of VEX robotics.",

      "description": "Last Updated: Aug 2025\n\n\nAre you planning to advance your career beyond the pure technical execution of junior positions to a Staff Engineer and beyond?\nDo you want to work on cutting-edge technologies and innovations but feel stuck with execution work and don’t have any exposure to the strategic product initiatives and roadmap?\nHave you ever struggled to convince your product manager to plan a code refactoring but failed as it does not affect customers in an obvious way?\nOr have you ever been in a situation when you were asked to build a feature without context on WHY it is needed?\nPerhaps you are de-facto playing a PM role in a tech startup that does not have a product team yet, even in the formal software engineer role, and want to know how the product management process really works?\nFinally, maybe you are considering whether transitioning to a Product Manager role could be your next career challenge.\n\n\nIf any of these questions resonate with you, we are inviting you to join us at the course Learn Product Management to Grow as an Engineer!\n\n\nYou will learn the end-to-end product management process, from defining product vision and strategy through product discovery to launching a product to market.\nThis knowledge is a must-have for those  looking to grow to a Staff Engineer and above, as your influence must extend beyond the engineering team and technical expertise. You will need to understand how key strategic product decisions are made to inject engineering context there and how to bring the most value to your business and customers.\nIt's common practice in many companies to require people to demonstrate their ability to perform new role duties before promoting them. So, a strong strategy to get ahead is periodically showcasing your product skills, gaining more exposure to strategic product roadmap, and using the knowledge from this course to boost your career.\nMoreover, if you can speak the Product team's language and understand what drives their decisions, it will be much easier to frame your requests in a way that appeals to them.

      "description": "You have probably heard about WhatsApp by now. And you might also have heard that it handles a fair amount of users each day. In fact, they managed to grow their user base to millons of users with an engineering team of only 32 persons using Erlang, before being acquired by Facebook. But WhatsApp is not the only success story. You would be surprised if you knew how many of the things you take for granted in your daily life are in fact powered by Erlang. It all started with the telecom business, but Erlang has since then gained popularity in many areas, including fintech, IoT, Healthcare and gaming. Just to name a few!\nThere are two main paradigms of the Erlang language. The functional paradigm, and the concurrent paradigm.\nIn this course, we will put our focus on the sequential part of Erlang. You will often hear people claiming that functional programming is very intuitive. And it is. But only once you have understood it! Until then, it can be a struggle to put it mildly. You can think of it a bit like learning how to ride a bicycle. You will probably crash a lot in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, you’ve got a truly amazing skill at your disposal.\nSo by taking this course, you will not only learn about Erlang in particular, but you will also learn about functional programming in general. And we will hopefully sort out some confusing topics such as pattern matching, recursion, side effects and higher order functions along the way.\nAnd this will also give you the tools needed for my second course, concurrent Erlang. This will enable you to build massively scalable soft real-time systems.\nSo, if any of this sounds interesting to you, give it a try and tell me what you think.",

But given a situation, we should live up or fight up in such a way that the whole action sequence should make us proud and be giving us goosebumps when we think about it right after 10 years.\n\nHere in this course, We are covering the 3 Major subsystems of Unix Operating System:\nThe File Management Subsystem which deals about the internal representation of files\nThe Process Management Subsystem which talks about the structure of the process and various process control calls\nThe Inter process Communication talks about the signals, pipes, message queues and shared memory\nThe Algorithms of various important system calls will be explained here in this course\nHere in this course, you will get to learn the Internal working of the Unix operating system. Though there are quite a few differences between a Linux operating system and the Unix operating system. Knowing The Internals of the Unix Operating system will help us to Understand The Working Of Linux Kernel Or at least start with Understanding the Linux Kernel.\n\nThere are assignments given in each section. The answers to the assignments are uploaded as a zip file. The assignments includes the following questions and answers:\nWrite a c program to implement your own malloc library function\nWrite a c program to implement your own free library function\nWrite a c program to implement your own realloc library function\nWrite a c program to implement your own ls (list) command\nWrite a c program to implement your own cp (copy) command\nWrite a c program to implement stat command\nWrite a c program to implement your own tee command\nWrite a c program to implement your own size command\nWrite a c program to implement your own touch command\nWrite a c program to implement your own fopen, fread, fwrite calls\nWrite a c program to implement a sample state machine\nWrite a c program to implement your own ps command\nWrite a c program to implement your own sleep command\nWrite a c program to implement your own shell\nWrite a c program to which demonstrates the functionality of daemons\nImplement client server program using FIFO\nWrite a C program to demonstrate pipes using child and parent\nWrite a C program to demonstrate fifos\nImplement client server program with message queues using semaphore\nWrite a program to demonstrate shared memory using semaphores\nPlease check the course overview, and If you are interested, Kindly take up the course.\n\nNote: This course covers the internals of Unix Operating System.

      "description": "Course overview\nHow programming languages work under the hood? What’s the difference between compiler and interpreter? What is a virtual machine, and JIT-compiler? And what about the difference between functional and imperative programming?\nThere are so many questions when it comes to implementing a programming language!\nThe problem with “compiler classes” in school is such classes are usually presented as some “hardcore rocket science” which is only for advanced engineers.\nMoreover, classic compiler books start from the least significant topic, such as Lexical analysis, going straight down to the theoretical aspects of formal grammars. And by the time of implementing the first Tokenizer module, students simply lose an interest to the topic, not having a chance to actually start implementing a programing language itself. And all this is spread to a whole semester of messing with tokenizers and BNF grammars, without understanding an actual semantics of programming languages.\nI believe we should be able to build and understand a full programming language semantics, end-to-end, in 4-6 hours — with a content going straight to the point, showed in live coding sessions as pair-programming and described in a comprehensible way.\nIn the Programming Language with LLVM class we focus on compiling our language to LLVM IR, and build a lower-level programming language. Working closely with the LLVM compiler infrastructure level you will understand how lower-level compilation and production-level languages, such as C++, Rust, etc work today.\nImplementing a programing language would also make your practical level in other programming languages more professional.\nPrerequisites\nThere are three prerequisites for this class.\nThe Programming Language with LLVM course is a natural extension for the previous classes — Building an Interpreter from scratch (aka Essentials of Interpretation), where we build also a full programming language, but at a higher, AST-level, and also Building a Virtual Machine. Unless you already have understanding of how programming languages work at this level, i.e. what eval, a closure, a scope chain, environments, and other constructs are — you have to take the interpreters class as a prerequisite.\nAlso, going to lower (bitcode/IR) level where production languages live, we need to have basic C++ experience. This class however is not about C++, so we use just very basic (and transferrable) to other languages constructs.\nWho this class is for?\nThis class is for any curious engineer, who would like to gain skills of building complex systems (and building a programming language is an advanced engineering task!), and obtain a transferable knowledge for building such systems.\nIf you are interested specifically in LLVM, its compiler infrastructure, and how to build your own langauge, then this class is also for you.\nWhat is used for implementation?\nSince lower-level compilers are about performance, they are usually implemented in a low-level language such as C or C++. This is exactly what we use as well, however mainly basic features from C++, not distracting to C++ specifics. The code should be easily convertible and portable to any other language, e.g. to Rust or even higher-level languages such as Python. Using C++ also makes it easier implementing further JIT-compiler.\nNote: we want our students to actually follow, understand and implement every detail of the LLVM compiler themselves, instead of just copy-pasting from final solution. Even though the full source code for the language is presented in the video lectures, the code repository for the project contains /* Implement here */ assignments, which students have to solve.\nWhat’s specific in this class?\nThe main features of these lectures are:\nConcise and straight to the point. Each lecture is self-sufficient, concise, and describes information directly related to the topic, not distracting on unrelated materials or talks.\nAnimated presentation combined with live-editing notes. This makes understanding of the topics easier, and shows how the object structures are connected. Static slides simply don’t work for a complex content.\nLive coding session end-to-end with assignments. The full source code, starting from scratch, and up to the very end is presented in the video lectures\nWhat is in the course?\nThe course is divided into four parts, in total of 20 lectures, and many sub-topics in each lecture. Below is the table of contents and curriculum.\nPart 1: LLVM Basic constructs\nIn this part we describe compilation and interpretation pipeline, starting building our language. Topics of LLVM IR, object, compilation of the bitcode are discussed.\nPart 2: Functions and Stack\nIn this part we implement control flow structures such as if expressions and while loops, talk about stack variables, nested blocks and local variables, and also compile functions.\nPart 3: Object-oriented programming\nIn this part we implement OOP concepts, such as classes, instances, talk about heap allocation, and garbage collectors.\nPart 4: Higher-order functions\nIn this part we focus on closures, functional programming, lambda functions, and implement the final executable.",

Want to sit back and relax for a couple of seconds while your script performs the task that would have taken you two hours to accomplish manually? Then you have come to the right course!\nThis course will help you build your own scripts and understand the ones written by others. No more relying on scripts that others built and hoping that they will solve your custom problems. Just writing your own solutions to your own problems.\nTake this course to get:\nLearning by example, so that instead of going through boring theoretical concepts, you get to see exactly how each concept applies in practice.\nMonthly challenges to help you gain experience and trust in your own abilities.\nInteractive, supportive experience, as I promptly reply to your questions when things just don't work.\n30-day money back guarantee if you don't like this course for any reasons, no questions asked.\n\n\nIn short, you will learn the basic building blocks of bash, watch how a real-life utility is built, do the monthly challenges and solve coding problems in the discussion area to gain experience (did I mention the prizes?).\nThe first section covers basic building blocks that allow you to write your own shell scripts, which are presented in a learn-by-example fashion. Here you will learn about basic linux command line utilities used throughout the course, a simple script structure, defining functions, using input/output redirection, pipes and command substitution. The last lectures in this section focus on control statements, like if, case, while and for.\nIn the second section I will show you how to build a simple real-life utility for monitoring the amount of traffic on a network interface. There are two scripts involved in this utility. The \"core\", that queries system data about a network interface and adds it to a comma-separated-values (csv) file, one line at a time. The other one will take care of scheduling the \"core\" to be run at specific times, based on a user specified interval. The result is a csv file that contains data collected at specific points in time, data that can be later processed into a spreadsheet application (e.g. build graphs from it).\nThe rest of the course, what I call the dynamic part, is built in time. You will find here lectures on various command line utilities (e.g. find) or more in-depth lectures on subjects like redirection. I also post monthly challenges for you to gain some much needed experience, in order to ascend from a beginner to an intermediate level.\n==========================================================\n\n**** Monthly challenges (with prizes) ****\nJun '16: Utility to count the occurrences of a letter inside a text file\nMar '16: Textify, an utility that takes an integer number and converts it to text\nJan '16: Utility to equally space lines in a text file\nDec '15: Host ping reply time monitor\n==========================================================\n\nUpdate History\nMay 22nd 2016: Published solution for the January challenge\nFeb 29th 2016: Published solution for the December challenge\nJan 3rd 2016: New lecture on xargs\nNov 22nd 2015: New section on standard end error output redirection\nNov 15th 2015: New lectures on the find utility and the proc filesystem.\nOct 10th 2015: New quiz on parameters",

So he knows which is important and crucial area in Python concepts and that's what is focused in the course. You will be able to write optimum Python code by following this Python code.\nEverything taught practically with diagrammatical explanation\nFocus on \"why\" to do some programming concept, apart from \"how\"\nWe believe that the proper way to understand programming concepts is, \"by really doing it and learn from errors\"; and that is what used in this course. In many cases, we think about various possibilities in the coding and analyze reasons of errors if they appear on our way.\nReal world scenarios and use cases explained for each smaller concept of Python\nMore scope for your involvement in practice with assignments / exercises, MCQs, interview questions etc.\nSource code, python cheat sheets are provided to download\nCaptions (CC) in English are provided for all lectures\nYou can get Instructor's help by asking questions in \"Q&A\" section, if you face any challenge at your practice time\nCovers all essential concepts of Python rather than just rushing through basics / overview of several programming concepts. Check the course curriculum for more details.\nCourse content will be kept up to date with future updates of Python\n\n\nWill the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?\nNo, it is not – All of these topics are branches of Python programming. And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.\nNearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.\nThis course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.\nBy the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above.\n\n\nI don't know anything about programming. Will I still be able to learn Python?\nThis course assumes you have no previous knowledge of programming. Whenever a programming term is mentioned in the class (e.g., a variable), that term is explained thoroughly, so you not only understand how to use that particular term in Python, you also understand what that term means in programming.\n\n\nWhat IDE/editor is used in this course?\nWe use PyCharm Community (free) in all lectures, to build python programs. You can use it with Windows / Mac, as per your convenience.\n\n\nNo Risk – Money-Back Guarantee\nFinally, there is no risk. You can preview first few lectures of the course for free. Once you buy this course, for some reason if you are not happy with the course, Udemy offers a 30-day money back guarantee.\n\n\n\n\nThis course is offered by Web Academy by Harsha Vardhan.

      "description": "Unlock the power of Go with our Go Syntax series, meticulously crafted for busy professionals like you. Designed to fit seamlessly into your spare time, this series allows you to incrementally master Go syntax through short, repeatable exercises—no lengthy projects here!\nThis is the first of three volumes, each a self-contained gem. Start with this foundational volume to gain the essential knowledge that will make the next two volumes even clearer and more impactful.\nJoin us and transform your coding skills, one step at a time.\nWhat you will learn\nTo give you a more effective study environment, this course is purposefully limited in scope.\nAttempting to cover everything about GO would not be practical, and it would do you a disservice.\nHowever, you will learn quite a lot in a truly short time, and you can always return to repeat the exercises.\nThis is the first volume of a Computer Literacy Series with emphasis on the Go language,\nbut if you are already familiar with programming and just want to see how Go syntax is written,\nthis course has taken your prior knowledge into consideration by keeping explanations simple and to the point.\nIt serves as a learning tool and a review tool as well.\nEven if you have taken Go before, this volume is written to expand awareness on the subject.\nThe Go Language: Your First Code Adventure covers the fundamentals of GO in plain language,\nand as quickly as possible for practicality and enjoyment reasons.\nWhen you less expect, you would have covered the following topics:\n\n\nBasic syntax introduction.\nVariables.\nDatatypes and their purpose.\nControl flow with if, else, and switch.\nBasic functions, arguments, parameters.\nPassing data by value.\nPassing data by reference with pointers. (Great explanation)\nLoops.\nHow to install and test GO locally.\nBasic command line or terminal skills. (step by step)\nHow to get input data from the keyboard\nHow to create files and folders via the terminal.\nHow to create a GO file.\nHow to run a GO file.\nHow to create an executable file from GO source code.\nIntroduction to input output in GO and how to write to a file.\nSome advanced concepts that need to be covered early on.\n(Data structures will be introduced on other volumes.\nYou will not need them for the GO exercises discussed in this volume).\nEach lesson is short and to the point\nI know, it is hard to return home after a long day's work and still try learning something anew.\nYou want to study a programming language, perhaps your very first one, but at the end of the day, your energy is just not there.\n\n\nSo, what can you do?\n\n\nFirst, choose a programming language that matters in 2025 and beyond, one that is not in constant morphing and deprecation. Example: The Go Language.\nWith so many languages to choose from, what if you pick the wrong one and only discover your mistake months later?\nShould you go with JavaScript, Python, C#, or C?  Should you select a more modern one, like the GO language from Google?\nSo many decisions and so little time to waste.\nThis course will assist you in your GO learning journey. Learning Go will also help you learn other languages later.\n\n\nSecond, choose a short (but meaningful) course of study.\nMy friend, if you feel overwhelmed but still want to learn something new, this course series is for you.\nFirst, you will be learning one of the hottest languages in the planet, the Go language or Golang.\nLearning Go will put you ahead of the game.\nBut even if you don't care about language popularity and demand, the Go language is a great tool to work with because it is simple, very powerful, and contemporary. Go will also help you understand what other languages are trying to do, such as PHP, JavaScript, and Python.\nYes, being a well written language, studying Go may clear up any confusion you have about older languages you already know.\nYou see, many languages offer a variety of ways to accomplish a similar outcome.\nIn contrast, Go offers a one-way to write code and write it well, and that makes the language easier to learn at first and easier to program with. It also makes you a better programmer because you have more energy to think about solutions rather than syntax.\nFor example, when it comes to loops, why should you learn so many keywords, such as while, do, until, for, and so on?\n\nThe creators of GO decided that we only need a single keyword to declare a loop, the for keyword.\nWhen programmers know what they are doing, they avoid unnecessary abstractions that bloat the language.\nYou can write any other loop outcome by just using FOR.\nAs a benefit, you will not have to memorize unnecessary commands that lead to the same outcome, and you will think more of finding solutions to help you in your professional projects.\n\nThat's simplicity at its best.\n\n\nIn addition, this course series takes into consideration your limited daily study time.\nHere, topics are written recursively and with plenty of self-contained exercises so that you don't have to start afresh when you forget things after taking a few days off.\nEvery concept is explained in plain language, avoiding industry jargon.\nIf you concentrate on this a few minutes a day, you will learn and relearn how to program in GO.\nSummary\nAnd that is it, my friend. I was thinking of busy people while designing the course.\nIt's like something I wish I had when I began my Go studies instead of spending countless hours doing extra research to discover why things worked the way they work. Time is money!\nIf you invest a few minutes a day in it, you will learn and grow, and you'll still have enough of your evening to enjoy quality  moments with your family and friends.\nRead the reviews from other students and make an investment decision\n- Subscribe now so we can get started. This is a joyful approach to the Go language you won't regret.",

I will teach you the art of writing complex code piece by piece using basic techniques.\n\n\nThis course aims to accomplish the following:\nSending clear commands to the application\nYou will learn about direct and indirect referencing of objects.\nLearn how to achieve more results with indirect referencing of objects\nLearn the VBA coding principle and send clear commands to the system.\nKnow the VBA language fluently,\nand understand every piece of your code.\nString Manipulation\nString manipulation is an important skill in solving complex problems.\nWith this skill, you can drastically reduce the size of your code, and target objects with precision.\nI will teach you how to create dynamic strings with the objective to solve complex queries.\nI will teach you how, when is it necessary, and why you should manipulate strings.\nCode Management\nIf you want to be a fluent Excel VBA programmer, code management must rank first in your priorities.\nWithout this skill, your code is likely to be a heavyweight, too long, with too many duplicates, clustered and confusing\nTherefore, I will teach you:\nseveral ways of debugging your code,\nthe principle of separation of concerns,\nand how to search and eliminate redundancy.\nStrategies for writing an intelligent VBA code\nComplex problems are won through strategy and not through sophisticated coding.\nThis means you win before you write the code. Yes, you win before you start.\nIn this course, I will teach you how-to strategies. This includes:\nthe naming conversation used in the programme.\nStudying the programme and anticipating its move as if it's your opponent.\nChoosing the best move because, in VBA, there are many solutions to a single problem. However, not every solution is perfect in all circumstances; some come with consequences.\nSystem Function\nWe will dive into numerous built-in system functions and learn how to use them to achieve the task at hand.\nUser-defined Functions\nYou will learn why, when, and how to create your own functions\nYou will learn the difference between sub-procedures and functions\nLearn how to lighten your code by teaming a variable with a function and learn why is it important.\nAvoid common coder mistakes; use of functions where variables are the best choice.\nUnderstand that not everything that works is as efficient as it seems.\nSolving conditional-based problems\nConditional problems are solved by using conditional statements or manipulating the execution of the code itself.\nLearn code manipulation techniques like looping, arrays, select case statements, and various kinds of if-statements.\nLearn how, why, and when to use each or a combination of both.\nSystem memory\nLearn how to create system memories e.g., Variables, Constants, and arrays\nLearn the difference and understand when to use a variable, an array, and a constant.\nEvents and Sub procedures\nYou will learn what event procedures are, and how are they different from user-defined sub-procedure.\nYou will get an in-depth understanding of the Initialize event and the click event.\n\n\nI put a lot of planning into this course so that you will learn with understanding, and without overwhelming yourself. Your learning will be practical, and there is a clear step-by-step guide.\n\n\nCheck out the reviews and listen to what those who have finished the course had to say.\n\n\nIf you have tried Microsoft Excel VBA before and it seemed too complicated for you, you can try it with me. Learn the skills of writing a clean Excel VBA code, sending clear commands that can be easily decoded by the system and executed to your expectations.\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Signup now and I will gracefully guide you, and you will become a fluent coder in no time.\n\n\nThank you",

Its powerful type system and memory safety rules prevent all memory corruption bugs without compromising developer productivity.\nIn this course, you’ll begin by getting familiar with the basic syntax and concepts of Rust, from writing a Hello World program to defining functions and creating variables. Then you’ll see how to manage toolchains with Rust up and build your first command-line program.\nMoving on, you’ll explore Rust’s type system to write better code and put it into practice in a simple markup language. You’ll learn to use Rust’s functional programming features to perform a physics simulation and use the Rayon crate to parallelize your computations. Finally, you’ll discover the best practices and test your code by building a simple crate with a tested, usable, well-documented API using Cargo and RustDoc.\nBy the end of the video, you’ll be comfortable building various solutions in Rust. You’ll be able to take advantage of Rust’s powerful type system and a rich ecosystem of libraries, or “crates”, available through the Cargo package manager.\nAbout the Author\nLeo Tindall is a software developer and hacker from San Diego whose interests include scalability, parallel software, and machine learning.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Course \" Learn C++ From Interview Questions \"\nThis course is from a software engineer who has managed to crack interviews in around 16 software companies.\nSometimes, life gives us no time to prepare, There are emergency times where in we have to buck up our guts and start  bringing the situations under our control rather then being in the control of the situation.  At the end of the day, All leave this earth empty handed. But given a situation, we should live up or fight up in such a way that the whole action sequence should make us proud and be giving us goosebumps when we think about it right after 10 years.\nWe observe in quite a lot of interviews that most of us find it quite confusing (at the moment) to answer basic questions like the format of the a.out file, not having a clear understanding of the distinction between protected and private data members of the class, finding it difficult to create static libraries and dynamic libraries, not knowing that is there is really a difference between static and dynamic libraries, confusion in the usage of different combinations of dynamic memory allocation and free calls like new, delete, malloc and free , unknown about the difference between up casting and object slicing, thinking that the concepts of function templates and template functions are similar.\nThe basic problem is here even though most of us are good at concepts, We get confused while answering when we come across a tricky question. As we all know, these tricky questions are simpler ones which are twisted and turned while asking them in the interviews. This is just to confuse the candidate in order to check whether the candidate really has a strong hold on the concepts.\nHere in this course, We have tried an approach where in we are trying to make our audience understand the concepts of c++ through tricky interview questions.\nThis course is designed for almost 7.5 hours and a preview of 30 mins. Please go through the c++ questions dealt and the preview of the course. If you are interested, Kindly enroll in the course.\nKindly adjust the talking speed in accordance to your convenience (Please set the course narration speed to 1.24x on your conveniencce.). The concepts are presented in Neutral English.\nAs per Udemy Policy, you can always refund if you want to withdraw from the course at any point of time.\nThe Questions handled in the course is as follows:\nWhere are the function declarations found\nWhere are the function definitions found\nAfter compilation, are the function definitions found in a.out file\nIn static library, are the library files part of the executable file (a.out)\nIn dynamic library, are the library files part of the executable file (a.out)\nWhat is the full form of a.out\nWhat is the format of a.out file\nIs reference a constant pointer\nWhat happens when a reference variable is re-assigned a value from another variable\nWhat happens when a reference variable is used with & and is re-assigned a value from another variable\nWhat is the difference between a reference and constant pointer\nWhat is the advantage of a reference over a pointer\nHow does a reference to a reference work\nIn the given program, convert all the const pointer statements to references\nExplain the below statements:\nint *const p;\nconst int *p;\nconst int * const p;\nint const *p;\nWhat is the difference between the operators (&) and (&*) when used in the context of pointers\nIn C++, is it mandatory to name a structure or a union\nIs the life time of a locally declared reference limited to the function in which it is declared\nDeclare the following:\nan array of 5 integers\nan array of 5 pointers\na pointer to an array of 5 integers\na reference to an array of 5 integers\nIs it possible to create an array of references\nCan we have multiple definitions of a function in a single module\nWhat is the difference between declaration and definition of a variable\nDefine a structure which contains a member function to add 2 of it’s data members and print the result\nDoes a pointer to a variable act like a constant reference OR Does a reference to a variable act like constant pointer\nA reference can point to different variables but a variable can’t be tied to multiple references\nDoes scope resolution operator help us in retrieving only the value of global variables whose identifier names are similar to the local variable names\nWhat is the difference between the below two statements:\na constant reference\nreference is a constant pointer\nCan we call a pointer ( which points to a read only string ) as a constant pointer\nDo we get a lvalue error in an assignment statement where a function call is placed on the left hand side of the assignment operator\nAre there only 2 ways to pass variables to a function ?\nDoes passing arguments by reference really advantageous\nIs static variable intermodular or intramodular\nAre Inline functions similar to macro definitions\nFunction overloading is asking the same function to perform different tasks in different contexts of the program\nName mangling is the concept where a name management database is used to maintain different global variables across different modules\nCan we overload the function to accept an char value and an char reference\nSuppose I have a structure having data members.

I did however add a huge bonus section that goes more indepth and shows some different examples, and also challenges you to work on a project after every video to make sure you understood the topics.\nThis course is for programmers that want to learn Java. You can skip some sections though. And it is also a great starting point for beginners in programming. I have also included some videos to help ultimate beginners get started.\nI'm an incompany Java trainer and I've helped many complete beginners to get OCA certified and kickstart their jobs as software developers.\nMy passion is to help people from a different field or with a different career path to get into software development, but this course is also useful for Java software developers preparing for the OCA exam and for software developers coming from other languages that want to know more about Java or get their OCA certificate.\n\n\nMore content will be added over time :)\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out!",

      "description": "Projects In Python For Beginners\nHere Is What You Get By Enrolling In This Course:\nWord-By-Word Explanation: In the entire course, I explain each line of code, without skipping a single line of code.\nAwesome Quality Content: Over 8+ hours of HD Videos.\nWell Structured & Easy To Learn: Course has been specially designed to make it easy for the students to learn Django starting from a basic level and gradually moving up to advance concepts.\n24 X 7 Support: I will always be there to guide you in your journey to become a Django expert.\n\n\nHere Is Everything You Will Learn In This Complete Course:\nIn this hands-on course, you will learn how to build Python projects using your existing Python skills.\n\n\nIn this course we will build 4 Major apps covering technologies like Django, OpenCV, Implementing Machine Learning Models, Rake NLTK, Tkinter and a lot more.\n\n\nHere is a brief description of what you will learn in each section of the course:\nSection 1: Building A Data Analysis & Visualisation Web App.\nTechnologies used:\nPython : Programming Language\nDjango : For web based app.\nPandas: For data analysis.\nChartJS: For data visualisation.\nProject description:\nIn this section we will be building a data analytics and visualisation web app. This app will read data from a raw CSV file in a pre-defined format and will generate visualisation charts for us. We will start off by reading and understanding the software requirements specification document and figuring out what exactly needs to be built. This SRS document will mimic the real document which is given by clients to software developers. We then setup the required development environment on our machine required to build the project. As this is a web app, we use Django as a platform to build our entire app, we learn how to download and install Django on our machine and also learn a view basics about Django to get started. We will then learn how to make our Django app read a CSV file submitted by the user and then read data from it. We will learn how to convert the CSV data into a pandas data frame so that the data could be manipulated and analysed. We then render out this data to a HTML page and display it in a tabular format. We also analyse the data using pandas and then feed the analysed data to a Django template and display it in terms of charts for data visualisation. We make use of a library called as ChartJS to display data on our webpage. Hence in this project we learn how multiple technologies like Django, Pandas, ChartJS integrates together to form a working web app.\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Computer Performance Monitor Using Tkinter.\nTechnologies used:\nPython : Programming language\nTkinter : For building graphical user interface\nPsutil : For accessing hardware stats\nSpeedtest: For getting the internet download, upload speed and ping.\nProject description:\nIn this section we will build a desktop app that monitors CPU & RAM usage in real-time. This project would be built using technologies like Python, Tkinter, psutil and speediest. This app will also be able to calculate the ping, internet download and upload speed as well. We will learn how the psutil library allows us to access the OS level APIs and in turn give us access to the computer performance stats in real time. We will first calculate the CPU usage, then RAM usage and finally the internet speed. We then learn how to represent this information in a desktop app using Tkinter. We build the entire interface for our app using Tkinter and then display all the statistics on a window. We also learn how to use custom fonts, colours and images to give our app a better look and feel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Contextual Advertising Platform.\nTechnologies used:\nPython : Programming language.\nDjango : For web app.\nRequests: For making HTTP request to blog pages.\nBeautifulSoup: To parse webpages\nRakeNLTK : To find relevant keywords\nProject description:\nContextual advertising is a technology that finds our relevant ads from a given blog article to maximise a blog or websites revenue. Contextual advertising is the reason why you see an ad for nike shoes on a fitness related article. In this section we will be building a contextual advertising platform which reads data from any blog who's URL you pass in, find relevant keywords on that blog and find ads which are relevant to them and all of this is done automatically. First we create a basic Django app that could accept a blog URL, then read all the data on that blog page using the requests library and parse the data using BeautifulSoup. We then feed the parsed data to the rake library which then finds the most relevant and prominent keywords in that blog article and save them. These relevant keywords are then matched with the ads present in our database and gives us back the ads which are most relevant to the blog post. We will also use Tailwind to style up the web app.\n\n\nSection 4: Gesture Volume Control Software For Mac & Windows.\nTechnologies used:\nPython: Programming language.\nOpenCV: To capture webcam input.\nMediapipe: To detect, track hands.\nOsascript : To control system volume on Mac.\nPycaw: To control system volume on Windows.\nProject description:\nThis project would be the most interesting one, we will build a gesture volume control software which will allow you to control the volume of your computer by just using two fingers. This software captures your webcam input, detects focal points on your hand like the fingertips and joints and allows us to find the distance between two points. To build this app we use opencv's python module which allows us to capture video from our web cam, frame-by-frame. Once the video is captured we then use MediaPipe which provides us a set of already trained machine learning models which allows us to detect hands in a live video. We then detect the key points on our hands to detect a gesture and find the distance between tips of two fingers so that we could control system volume. We then make use of osacript on Mac and pycaw on Windows to control the system volume and integrate the two things together so that volume could be controlled by two fingers.\n\n\n\n\nSo let's begin the journey of developing projects with Python\nIn addition to the Udemy 30-day money back guarantee, you have my personal guarantee that you will love what you learn in this course. If you ever have any questions please feel free to message me directly and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible!\n\n\nMake sure to enrol in the course before the price changes.\nTake yourself one step closer towards building complex python projects by clicking the \"take this course button\" now!\nJoin the journey.\nSincerely,\nAshutosh Pawar",

Java is inspired by C and C++ and uses an object-oriented programming model, which means that concepts or things are represented as “objects” that have data fields and methods. One of the biggest advantages of Java is that it runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), meaning that you can execute Java code on any platform that has a JVM, without re-compilation. This is different from C and C++, which require re-compilation for every hardware platform you execute the code on. Java has many other advantages, including automatic memory management. This eliminates hard-to-understand pointers used in languages like C, which can help Java developers write better code in a shorter period of time.\nWhat does it mean that Java is an object-oriented programming language?\nJava is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means concepts or things are represented as “objects” that have data fields and methods. In object-oriented programming, models called “objects” represent either a programming entity or an abstract concept. These objects are created and assembled independently of one another but can work with each other in logical ways. Objects are manifestations of classes and can inherit code allowing for code re-use, which can drastically reduce code duplication if used correctly. Additionally, encapsulation, another core OOP concept, allows you to create code with the implementation hidden. Although, in many cases, writing OOP code in Java (and other OOP languages) can take longer than using a procedural language, the benefits obtained with OOP, namely code reusability, encapsulation of data, and readability of code, often result in code that is easier to maintain in the long run.\nWhat is Java used for?\nJava is a very versatile language. Several fields use Java, including Android app development, desktop applications that work on many operating systems, server-side applications, and more. The virtual machine required to run Java programs has been ported to numerous operating systems allowing Java to run on virtually all hardware. According to the TIOBE index, Java has consistently been in the top 3 most-used and popular languages since its initial release in the 1990s. Many developers still consider Java the language of choice in areas such as enterprise and application servers, and even in embedded systems development. Many Fortune 500 companies rely on Java to run their core systems and employers often view Java experience on a résumé as favorable due to its popularity.\nWhat certification is best for Java?\nOracle, the owner of the Java programming language, has the Oracle Certified Developer: Java SE 11 Developer program, which is easily the best certification to obtain for Java developers. The main reason why it’s the best certification, is, unlike most other certifications for Java, the Oracle certification is both well known and universally accepted by employers all over the world. The exam is challenging. You also must bring an ID with you to the exam, so you cannot get anyone to take it for you. Certification is really valuable for both the certification holder and for future employers. There are few, if any, other certification programs so universally accepted as Oracle’s Java certification. Thus, getting Java certification is one of the surest ways to give yourself an advantage over other job seekers in the marketplace.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of java?\nJava is a very popular language and has been for over 20 years. Because of its popularity, it’s built up a huge range of frameworks, toolkits, tutorials, and support. Not to mention, Java developers have a huge number of career opportunities. Another pro of Java is platform independence. A wide variety of computer hardware and operating systems can use Java. Java is also relatively easy to learn and relatively secure. Java runs on its own virtual machine, via byte-code. When compared to traditional languages like C++ that compile to native machine code, Java’s performance can be slower for applications that are time-critical. Java code is verbose and requires much more code to achieve the same functionality compared to languages such as Python. Overall, developers will likely continue to use Java for many years to come because of its popularity and huge adoption.\n\nShould ı learn java or python first?\nIt’s always difficult to advise someone which language to learn first. Any decision should be based on your longer-term goals. Do you want to learn a language, fast? If so, Python is probably quicker to learn; it has less formality and is often just more fun to learn. Are you coming from another programming language like C# or C++? If so, Java is similar, so you would probably learn Java faster compared to a language like Python, which does things very differently. For example, Python has indentation instead of curly braces. The choice of Java vs Python might come down to the languages’ ability to meet certain goals. For example, if you want to create an Android application, Java is best. Python is not used to write Android applications. Both languages are very popular, offer great career opportunities, and you can learn either in a relatively short period of time.\n\nWhat is the best IDE for Java?\nWhen comparing the top three Java IDEs — Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA — NetBeans tends to be the strongest all-around candidate. First released in 1997, it has a significant body of documentation and a thriving community. You can easily develop mobile, desktop, and web applications with the help of its cross-platform support and visual debugger. Ultimately, though, the best IDE is whichever you're most comfortable using. Many developers prefer to use Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA because their tools better-align with their workflow. For instance, Eclipse supports application development for a variety of languages through plugins. It also has advanced features for reporting, charting, modeling, and testing. IntelliJ IDEA has both a licensed version and a proprietary commercial version. It has some advanced, powerful features like data flow analysis and cross-language refactoring, but it will also be more expensive than Eclipse or NetBeans.\n\nAre Java and Javascript the same thing?\nJava and JavaScript don’t have a lot in common, apart from the word Java. They are different languages, each with strengths and weaknesses. Netscape created JavaScript in 1996. Sun Microsystems created Java in 1991, with the first version released in 1995. Netscape then added Java to the name JavaScript as a marketing ploy to piggyback on the success of the Java language. JavaScript is primarily used in a web browser to make web pages more interactive (web-based applications) whereas Java is used to create standalone applications to run on single computers and servers. Both languages share a similar syntax based on C, but JavaScript is a lightweight language and Java is an object-oriented language with its own virtual machine.\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

Furthermore, it supports the OOPs concept, such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Therefore, everything in the VB dot NET language is an object, including all primitive data types (Integer, String, char, long, short, Boolean, etc.), user-defined data types, events, and all objects that inherit from its base class. It is not a case sensitive language, whereas, C++, Java, and C# are case sensitive language.\nApplications built using the VB dot NET language are very reliable and scalable, relying on the dot NET Framework to access all libraries that help to execute a VB dot NET program. With this language, you can develop a fully object-oriented application that is similar to an application created through another language such as C++, Java, or C#. In addition, applications or programs of VB dot NET are not only running on the window operating system but can also run on Linux or Mac OS.\nThe VB dot NET language is designed in such a way that any new beginner or novice and the advanced programmer can quickly develop a simple, secure, robust, high performance of web, windows, console, and mobile application running on dot NET Framework.\nAs we know, it is a high-level programming language with many features to develop a secure and robust application. These are the following features that make it the most popular programming language.\nIt is an object-oriented programming language that follows various oops concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and many more. It means that everything in VB dot NET programming will be treated as an object.\nThis language is used to design user interfaces for window, mobile, and web-based applications.\nIt supports a rapid application development tool kit. In which a developer does not need to write all the codes as it can get various code automatically from its libraries. For example, when we create a form in Visual basic dot net, it automatically calls events of various form in that class.\nIt is not a case sensitive language like other languages such as C++, java, etc.\nIt supports Boolean condition for decision making in programming.\nIt also supports the multithreading concept, in which you can do multiple tasks at the same time.\nIt provides simple events management in dot NET application.\nA Window Form enables us to inherit all existing functionality of form that can be used to create a new form. So, in this way, it reduced the code complexity.\nIt uses an external object as a reference that can be used in a VB dot NET application.\nAutomatic initialized a garbage collection.\nIt follows a structured and extensible programming language for error detection and recovery.\nConditional compilation and easy to use generic classes.\nIt is useful to develop web, window, and mobile applications.",

GraphQL queries give clients great flexibility in the way they request data from the server, preventing issues such as fetching or under fetching of data, and allowing multiple resources to be retrieved in a single request.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to use GraphQL both on the server-side and in client applications through practical examples in the form of full-stack JavaScript applications. You will be introduced to all the main GraphQL concepts like schema definition, Queries, Mutations, and Subscriptions, as well as to solutions to common requirements such as handling authentication/authorization and client-side caching.\nThe examples use Apollo Server with Node.js and Express on the backend and Apollo Client with React on the frontend. The aim however is not just to cover specific GraphQL libraries, but to give you a more general understanding of the underlying concepts. For instance, Apollo Client is only introduced after learning how to write a simple client \"by hand\" to make sure you understand GraphQL over HTTP format.\n\n\nIntroduction to GraphQL\nCore Concept of GraphQL\nProject Creation\nFirst GraphQL Demo\nMongoDB complete course\nMongoose Model\nTypeDef\nResolvers\nGraphQL Server\nGraphQL Insert\nGraphQL Update\nGraphQL Delete\n\n\nThis course assumes a good knowledge of modern JavaScript, and ideally some familiarity with Node.js/Express and React.",

The Java course includes all the content that is covered in this course.\n\n\n\nBuilding reliable software is not just about understanding how Java exceptions work, but to also understand how to use them in the right way. So, it is more than learning Java exceptions as a language feature and that is what this course aims to teach. This intensely practical specialized course has been designed with following objectives:\nTo give you a complete understanding of the Java exceptions mechanism\nTo teach the best practices & idioms for effectively writing Java exceptions\nExceptions are almost always covered as a short chapter/topic (typically 30 - 45 minutes) in a larger Java course and they only cover the basics of Java exceptions. This may suffice most of the times. But to build truly robust software that can withstand test of times and also help you to quickly identify and debug any bugs, you would need to have a more solid understanding of exceptions and how to use them effectively. Through the above objectives, this course aims to give you that kind of a solid foundation in just about 3 hours of time.\nTeaching Style:\nAll the topics will be covered by writing code. Sometimes, the topics are first explained in slide format for better clarity and then will be demonstrated in code. Most of the code is based on a single concept of sharing data with a partner in a programmatic way. The code will be built gradually with each discussed topic. Every lesson that includes a demo will also come with downloadable code that was implemented in that lesson. You may have to change the file extension to .java for running the downloaded programs. Everything is demonstrated in Eclipse IDE.\nSome lessons have additional supplementary notes, which can be downloaded from the resources section of each lesson.\n\nCourse Structure:\nWe first cover all the exception-related language features following which best practices are discussed. Following are most of the language features covered:\ntry/catch/finally & throw/throws\nchecked vs unchecked exceptions\ntry-with-resources statement & suppressed exceptions\nassertions (discussed after best practices)\n\nAs for the best practices & idioms go, we discuss in code all exception-related principles outlined in the popular Effective Java book. This is one of the highlights of the course and will make you truly complete!\nThere is also a bonus chapter where we demonstrate how to debug Java programs in Eclipse and also how to use JUnit unit testing framework.\nThe course also ends with a carefully crafted quiz to validate what you have learnt.\nInstructor & His Motivation for Creating this Course:\nI have over 10 years of experience in Java developing products for start-ups in silicon valley and elsewhere. Fortunately, I also had the opportunity to design & implement few critical data integration software components where exceptions had a very important role to play. By implementing a good exception handling mechanism that followed proper idioms & best practice rules, we were able to handle many serious issues. While we were aware of some of the idioms, we also had to learn some on-the-go, which required some code refactoring. And we also missed out on some due to lack of knowledge about them. Part of the reason was that we were never exposed to these best practices & rules when we first learned Java (or Java Exceptions) through some course/book. So, learning best practices & rules would have to be a separate endeavor, which sometimes may never happen due to various reasons (time is one of them). I realized that it is entirely possible to teach both fundamentals & many of the advanced concepts like best practices in a single comprehensive course. So, this course is a result of that realization where a more holistic approach is taken to teach concepts.\nBuilding this course itself has been a wonderful journey for me and I hope you will also find this course to be equally enriching & useful. I will continue to devote myself in building this course. Always, feel free to message me if you have any questions and I promise to address them as quickly as I can. Also, don't forget to leave a review (good or bad) as it helps me and other prospective students. Thanks!!",

      "description": "C# programmers are highly in demand for corporate and government projects. So, congratulations on choosing to learn this amazing language. :-)\nBut as it is often the case among beginners, the struggle to put into practice the theoretical concepts and language syntax is very real. How do you implement your knowledge into actual projects? How do you practice without feeling like you're running in the circles without ever moving forward to intermediate level? You turn on Visual Studio and then...you just stare at it the same way a painter stares at a blank canvas. But fear not! With this course, you can learn to eliminate your fear of code! And all it takes is a little practice and determination. And that’s where this course will help you greatly!\nThe course goes over variety of C# programming projects. I show you how to put the theory you learned into practice by showing you how to solve each exercise and walking you through all the Why’s and How’s.\nBecause the course is all about practice, some of the concepts are repeated across multiple exercises. The course is not meant to follow any particular guidline where each exercise builds up on the previous one, but rather serves as a comprehensive reference, allowing students to skip exercises if they are already familiar with the concept in those exercises.\nIn the process, you will learn a alot about C# language and Windows Forms. You will learn how to translate the project requirements into a working code. You will learn to use many different basic programming concepts, such as Conditional Statements, Loops, Arrays, OOP, … and pick the right one for your solution. But above all, you will learn to think like a programmer!\nThis course is all about practice. Therefore, to benefit from this course, you need to be an active student. It doesn't matter if you are self-taught or attend a programming course. What matters is the time and effort you are willing to put into learning and practicing your skills.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: There are no lectures in this course. However, I explain what I am trying to accomplish with each line of code, and touch on common pitfalls, too.\nThis is a course for beginner C# .net programmers who need to put the concepts and theory they learned into practice and for people who prefer to learn by doing. If you are still learning basic concepts and require lot of explanation and theory, then this course may not be the best fit for you! But if you are ready grow your skills through practice, than you will love this course!\nLet's start coding!",

      "description": "*** THE BEST COURSE ON JAVASCRIPT PROTOTYPES AND OBJECTS ***\nStart from the Ground Up: JavaScript was created in 1995 as a \"prototypal-based\" language - begin with the fundamentals of JavaScript prototypes, ensuring a solid foundation.\nLeverage Prototypal Inheritance: Learn how to create objects with multiple levels of inheritance, unlocking the full potential of JavaScript’s prototypal nature.\nMaster Object Creation: Transition from basic object literals to complex pseudo-classical inheritance patterns with ease.\nDifferentiate Between Paradigms: Understand the distinctions between class-based languages (like Java and C#) and prototypal-based languages like JavaScript.\nExplore Instantiation Patterns: Dive into various instantiation patterns, including functional instantiation, functional-shared, prototypal, pseudo-classical, and pure classical approaches.\nLET ME SHARE MY KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU\nI’ve been coding for a long time. At the age of 7, in the early 90’s, I got my first pc and a few days later I became an avid gamer. I have always surrounded myself with coders. I remember at 10 years old a family member managed to hack into a bank’s system. I still recall the days of floppy disks and playing “Doom”, “Duke Nukem” and of course one of my all-time favorites, “Red Alert”.\nI’ve always been around computers, and that’s what makes my teaching style direct, to-the-point, and powerful!\n\n\nNow, why did I create a course on JavaScript Prototypes?\nPrototypes are a fundamental concept of JavaScript. They are used to implement inheritance, object creation, and other important features. It is therefore crucial that you understand prototypes – what they are, why they are there, how to use them, how to create them, and when to use them!\nUnderstanding JavaScript is ongoing process. To give you a foot up, I’ve structured an all-encompassing, focused course on JavaScript prototypes, which I deliver to you in a way that will benefit you the most. My course teaches you \"why\" things work and not just \"how\" to do something mindlessly.\n\n\nWhat this course covers?\nIt starts at the beginner level of what JavaScript prototypes are\nIt then goes more in-depth by teaching you how to leverage the power of prototypes to create objects with multiple levels of inheritance\nYou’ll learn how to create objects, starting from the basics of object literals to more complex pseudo-classical inheritance patterns\nLearn the difference between class-based languages (like Java, C#, C++) and prototypal-based languages like JavaScript\nLearn the different instantiation patterns, such as functional instantiation, functional-shared, prototypal, pseudo-classical and pure classical\nMaster the differences between [[Prototype]] and __proto__ and the .prototype property\nLiterally this course everything you need to know about prototypes in JavaScript, all in one place :)\nAll the strategies I teach follow timeless coding principles and tactics.\n\n\nWHAT ARE PROTOTYPES?\nJavaScript was created by a guy called Brendan Eich in the mid-1990s. Eich decided to make JavaScript a prototype-based language because he wanted to create a language that was easy to learn and use. He wanted to create a language that was powerful and flexible, and he believed that prototypes were the best way to achieve this.\nPrototypes are a powerful feature of JavaScript, because they allow you to reuse code, create complex object hierarchies, and implement inheritance in a simple and efficient way. However, prototypes can also be confusing, and they can make it difficult to understand how JavaScript works.\nDespite the challenges, the benefits of prototypes outweigh the drawbacks.\nQ: The million dollar question is \"why does learning about prototypes matter?\"\nA: It matters because EVERY object in JavaScript has a [[Prototype]] property. It is this [[Prototype]] property that is often referred to as the “prototype”. By mastering prototypes, you can create complex objects that are extremely memory efficient - improving your website's speed.\nThe prototype itself is also an object … which means that it also has a [[Prototype]] property. Can you begin to see that there’s a prototype “chain” forming? You can think of the prototype chain as a linked list of objects, where each object in the list has a pointer to the next object in the chain.\nThis is the reason why all objects you use and create have inbuilt properties and methods that you can access. This is why:\nstrings have toUpperCase() and toLowerCase()\narrays have sort(), map(), push() and filter()\nnumbers have toFixed(), toPrecision(), parseFloat()\n...\nYou get the idea.\nWhy is learning about prototypes useful?\nBy understanding how prototypes work, how they are created, and how to set them up yourself, you’ll be able to create objects that inherit properties and methods from other objects, without having to explicitly define them.\nThis makes it possible to reuse code and create complex object hierarchies in a simple and efficient way.\nCan you begin to see how powerful prototypes are and how essential it is today?\nKnowing the power of how to use prototypes in JavaScript is crucial if you want to become a serious fullstack developer, as it will allow you to build complex data types and web apps.\nCreating objects can get tricky at times, and I don’t dispute this, but with correct training which includes explaining the fundamentals of prototypes and object creation in a simple way, you will, like me, learn to master and love JavaScript’s dynamic approach to object creation.\nIf you want to become a full stack web developer, you need to know about prototype’s and that’s what this course is all about.\n\n\nWHY IS UNDERSTANDING JAVASCRIPT PROTOTYPES IMPORTANT?\nJavaScript is built on prototypes\nTo master JavaScript, you need to master prototypes\nPrototypes is a way to implement object-oriented programming\nPrototypes allow you to extend existing objects\nPrototypes allow you to implement inheritance in JavaScript\nPrototypes allow you to create custom object constructors\nPrototypes allow you to understand the JavaScript engine better\nUltimately, by understanding how prototypes work, you can write more efficient and reusable code.\nAfter completing this ultimate prototypes course, you will certainly be knowledgeable, confident and able to manage or help others create objects in the most optimal way.\n\n\nWHAT THIS JAVASCRIPT COURSE COVERS\nThis JS course is comprehensive, covering the fundamentals of prototypes, composition and class-based languages.\nSimple enough.\nThe only problem is that in order to truly understand JavaScript, you need to move beyond the basics. That’s why this course covers the basics, and more advanced concepts.\nFirst, this course teaches you basics:\nLearn what prototypes are\nLearn why everything in JavaScript is considered to be an object\nLearn how to set and get an object’s prototype\nLearn how to create custom prototypes\nLearn about the instantiation patterns in JavaScript\nUnderstand class instantiation introduce by ECMAScript\nMaster the prototype chain\nLearn about the __proto__ property\nLean about the function’s .prototype property\nUnderstand why everything in JavaScript is considered to be an object\nand a whole bunch more!\nThis course also teaches you the advanced concepts:\nLearn why it’s not good practice to amend the prototype during runtime\nWhy you shouldn’t add everything to an object’s prototype\nLearn the limitations of prototypes\nLean the modern ways to get and set an object’s prototype\nLearn why __proto__ has been partly deprecate by ECMAScript\nUnderstand why the [[Prototype]] is a hidden property\nLearn why the \".prototype\" property only matters for constructor functions\nPractical example of setting up a prototype chain by using the new keyword, using Object.create() versus setPrototypeOf(), and comparing this to the new class syntax\nUnderstand the differences between prototypal languages vs classical languages\nUnderstand composition vs prototypes\nAnd yes, we will code examples in a fun way, and look at how objects work under the hood.\n\n\n## The most comprehensive JavaScript Prototype course on Udemy ##\nSuccessful programmers know much more than memorizing a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how a programming langauge works under the hood. Because the JavaScript creators decided to build JavaScript on prototypes, it becomes crucial to understand what prototypes are, how they work, when to use them and why they are so powerful.\n\n\nIS THIS COURSE FOR YOU?\nYes. If you fit in any of these categories then this course is perfect for you:\n#1: BUSY PEOPLE who want to become certified in JavaScript in the shortest time possible.\n#2: PROGRAMMING DESIRE.

You must adapt your code by upgrading to the latest versions or downgrading if necessary.\nAbout the Instructor\nI’m Mohammad H. Rafiei, Ph.D., and I’m honored to be your guide throughout this journey. As a machine learning engineer, researcher, and instructor at Johns Hopkins University, Whiting School of Engineering, I bring both academic and practical experience to the course. I’m also the founder of MHR Group LLC, based in Georgia.\nCourse Focus & Materials\nThis course will introduce you to Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), also known as Representation Learning, with a focus on image data. Starting with simple supervised and semi-supervised learning tasks, we’ll gradually dive into SSL techniques in later lectures.\nSelf-Supervised Learning is an emerging and highly sought-after approach in machine learning, particularly useful when working with limited labeled data. In this course, we will explore two main SSL techniques: contrastive and generative, with a focus on contrastive models.\nYou’ll have access to several examples and experiments to help you fully grasp the concept of SSL. While the course focuses on the image domain, the techniques can be applied to other fields, including temporal data and natural language processing (NLP).\nYou’ll be provided with Python notebooks (.ipynb) for each lecture, optimized for execution with a GPU accelerator. Details on running these notebooks are covered in an upcoming lecture.\nTips for Optimal Learning\nVideo speed: Adjust the playback speed if necessary to match your pace.\nCaptions: Enable captions for clarity.\nVideo quality: For the best experience, set the video quality to 1080p.\nThis course is designed for use on Google Colab with GPU accelerators. The TensorFlow version used in the lectures is 2.8.2. As of October 2024, the notebooks work smoothly with TensorFlow 2.15 on Colab. We’ve included an extra cell in most notebooks for easy downgrading to version 2.15 if needed.\n\n\nAs machine learning libraries evolve, staying updated and adjusting your code is crucial.\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into four sections and ten lectures:\nSection 1: Introduction\nLecture 1: Introduction to the Course\nLecture 2: Python Notebooks Overview\nSection 2: Supervised Models\nLecture 3: Supervised Learning\nLecture 4: Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning\nSection 3: Labeling Task\nLecture 5: Challenges in Labeling\nSection 4: Self-Supervised Learning\nLecture 6: Introduction to Self-Supervised Learning\nLecture 7: Supervised Contrastive Pretext, Experiment 1\nLecture 8: Supervised Contrastive Pretext, Experiment 2\nLecture 9: SimCLR: An Unsupervised Contrastive Pretext Model\nLecture 10: SimCLR Experiment\nI look forward to guiding you through this exciting subject and helping you master Self-Supervised Learning in Python!",

Cryptography occurs all across software fields: it protects all HTTPS traffic between browsers, encrypts phone storage against prying eyes, and can even hide files inside other files through a technique called steganography. This course is for developers looking to design a system that uses cryptography, rather than designing new algorithms. Most developers simply need to put the right pieces together to make their own system work.\nIn this course, you will break down the concepts behind cryptography into simple lessons, covering terminology, algorithms, standards, and encryption/decryption techniques. We will also walk through how cryptographic systems are hacked to bypass (rather than break) their cryptographic capabilities.\nThe course answers questions such as:\nWhat is cryptography used for?\nWhat are keys and where do they go?\nWhy do networked systems sometimes give certificate validation errors?\nIf I need to encrypt something, how should I do that?\nBy the end of this course, you will recognize cryptographic problems and understand the right knowledge to apply a verifiable solution.\nAbout the Author\nErik Costlow ran Oracle’s Java Root Certificate program, coordinating efforts with many cryptographic organizations.

      "description": "Kubernetes is an open source platform designed to automate deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. Kubernetes automates various aspects of application development, which is extremely beneficial for enterprises. Centralized logging is crucial for any production-grade infrastructure, especially in a containerized architecture. Since Kubernetes is dynamic and does not store change logs except the recent changes, logging and monitoring is highly imperative for saving pod logs.\nIn this course, you’ll learn to analyze and locate critical pod log files in your Kubernetes clusters. You’ll create a centralized logging system with a configured EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana) stack for Kubernetes. Using a hands-on approach, you’ll follow the entire logging and monitoring process, which actually goes hand-in-hand. In your Kubernetes cluster, you’ll find out that your clusters are working with too many containers and it’s difficult to keep track of each of them.\nYou’ll learn how to build your centralized logging and send data for monitoring. To set up centralized logging, you’ll establish one logging agent per Kubernetes node to collect all logs of all running containers from disk and transmit them to Elasticsearch. You’ll search for log data, monitor the containers, and also collect metrics using Kibana. You’ll decide how your final log data will be presented. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to use centralized logging and monitoring techniques for debugging purposes to find out reasons for crashes, and trigger alerts if there is a spike in error messages (which can be more efficient than a system health check).\nAbout the Author\nWalter Dolce is a Software and Platform Engineer based in London, United Kingdom. He has worked for both small and medium-sized businesses as well as large enterprises such as the BBC and Just Eat. Over the course of the years, he has developed a deep knowledge of various areas of Software Engineering concepts and practices such as test-driven development, behavior-driven development, SOLID principles, design patterns, and more. He later transitioned to the DevOps/Platform Engineering space where he used that knowledge to implement highly available, resilient systems and platforms running on today’s major Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.",

By leveraging advanced machine learning models, AI can generate human-like text, code, images, and even personalized learning experiences, making education more accessible, engaging, and efficient.\nOne of the key benefits of generative AI in upskilling is its ability to provide personalized learning pathways. Traditional learning systems often follow a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not cater to individual learners’ needs. AI-powered platforms analyze user interactions, knowledge levels, and preferences to create tailored content. This ensures that learners receive the most relevant information, helping them progress at their own pace. Additionally, AI chatbots and virtual tutors can provide instant feedback, answer questions, and reinforce concepts, making learning more interactive and efficient.\nGenerative AI also enhances content creation for educational purposes. AI models can generate quizzes, summaries, presentations, and even full-length tutorials based on a given topic. This reduces the time and effort required by educators to develop high-quality learning materials. Moreover, AI-powered transcription and summarization tools enable professionals to extract key insights from lengthy documents, lectures, or meetings, streamlining knowledge acquisition.\nGenerative AI is transforming upskilling and learning by offering personalized, efficient, and interactive experiences. As technology continues to evolve, AI-powered education will play a pivotal role in equipping individuals with the skills needed for the future workforce.",

You'll also discover how to browse the directory structure, show the contents of directories, the best method to comprehend and operate with file permissions, the way to replicate, move, and remove files and directories. We will also cover regular expression syntax in the context of studying grep, then utilize what we have heard as we all perform.\nThen we are going to begin with data types of C, then understand C's strongest component, the pointer. Recognizing pointers makes it possible for us to grasp the inherent character of arrays and structs, parameters passed by reference, and a number of different things hidden by additional languages but vulnerable in C.\nWe'll have a look at how to run the interpreter from the control line in Python, in addition to the way to do our Python source documents. Following that, we'll learn how to control a few fundamental information types. We'll learn about how use Python to perform simple arithmetic. Afterward, we'll find out about working with characters and words, with a data type called the \"series\". We'll also pay for the Boolean form, which will be a representation of True and False interior of a programming language.\nI hope you’ll join us for this exciting course.",

After all it has many uses, including games.\nPerhaps your boss or client threw you in the deep end with a Ruby on Rails project, and you are struggling with Ruby?\nOr maybe you just decided you would like to add the Ruby programming language to your resume to give yourself some better opportunities.\n\nIf so, you are in the right place.\nThis course is going to teach you have to program in the Ruby programming language.  No previous programming experience is assumed.\nThis is the perfect primer for developers looking to tackle Ruby on Rails.  You need to know Ruby well to be a great Ruby on Rails developer, and this course will give you the skills you need in Ruby.\nWhy Ruby?\n\nRuby is used in a wide range of fields, but is best known as a language for Web Applications, because of the Ruby on Rails framework. The general purpose nature of Ruby makes it suitable for a wide array of programming tasks, just like Perl, Python and other general purpose languages.\n\nRuby was originally designed with the goal of making programming fun, and in Japan, where it came from, Ruby was used to make games. You will actually learn to create a game in Ruby in this course.\n\nPlus, Ruby programming code reads like English and that makes it a lot easier to understand if you are just starting out as a programmer.\nAs a dynamically typed language, Ruby does not have all of those hard rules other languages do, and in many respects is similar to spoken languages. This empowers you by giving you flexibility to solve problems in a more human way than other programming languages.\nWhat is covered?\nSome of the features covered in the course include...\nThe Ruby Class\nMethods\nOperators\nConditional Assignment Operators\nLoops\nComparison Operators\nIf, Else, Unless, Then...\nFile Creation, Read, Write and Update\nGenerate A Webpage Using A Ruby File\nRuby Switch Statements\nHow to use GitHub\nBuilt in Ruby methods\nInteract With API Data\nUsing Ruby Gem libraries\nBuilding Gems\nUpload Gems to RubyGems dot org\nRegular Expressions\nBuilding Games\nWhy enrolling in this course is the best decision you can make.\n\nThis courses uses non complicated examples to do complex things.  The goal is to get you to understand exactly what you are doing and the reasons why, rather than typing in code you don't understand. No code is glossed over, as it is important for you to understand what each line is doing.\n\nYour instructor, Stephen Chesnowitz became a fan of Ruby and Ruby on Rails back in 2012 and dove in head first. Over the years he has worked on some pretty cool projects, and is here to share what he can and help you along your path into the world of application development using Ruby.\n\nAs a result you are dealing with someone who not only knows the Ruby language really well, but has the skills to teach things in a way that anyone can understand.\nAfter completing this course, you will have the necessary skills to be able to use Ruby to create your own programs, and even games.\n\nThe sooner you sign up for this course, the sooner you will have the skills and knowledge you need to increase your job or consulting opportunities.    Ruby skills are in high demand (via Ruby on Rails especially) and you will understand and be able to use the Ruby programming language after going through this course.\n\nYour new job or consulting opportunity awaits!\nWhy not get started today?\nClick the Signup button to sign up for the course!",

Java Graphical User Interface (GUI)\nLearning Java programming language and understanding Java programming language are two different things. Almost every student enjoy learning Java programming language. But, only a few number of these students actually understand Java programming language afterwards. This is where the remaining students are left behind and kept wandering from one course to another over the internet to get the best knowledge on understanding Java programming language with cups of coffee on their table everyday.\nComplete Java Bootcamp! Swing, JavaFX, PostgreSQL, JDBC, JSP is a comprehensive and concise guide with over 15 hours of content that is designed to pick up every interested student from the state of \"zero-knowledge\" to a state of \"Hero-knowledge\" in Java programming. As a senior software developer and an instructor with many years of experience in the industry, I have mastered the best way to give my students packages that will help them to learn and understand Java programming in one course without the need to waste their hard earned money on different courses that will limit them to one side of Java programming and forcing them to pay to learn the other sides.\nJava is an Object Oriented Programming Language and this course will help you to understand the entire concept of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This is the most difficult part of Java programming language and I have taken my time to build my strength on this path to ensure that my students walk over it with ease and understand every aspect of this topic. Programming Java is fun! But without the knowledge of OOP, it becomes a nightmare and a hard nut to crack for some developers. To live your full life as a happy Java developer, you must understand Object Oriented Programming (OOP) very well.\n\n\nWhy Must I Take This Course And What Benefit Is It To ME As Java Developer?\nThis is the only course on the internet that will help you to become a certified and successful Java developer with an in-depth knowledge of the entire aspect of Java development and prepare you with the required skills necessary to build you to face job interviews and get employed as a full stack Java developer.

Different path types? what is file encoding? Differences between ASCII and Unicode?, and so on. to advanced techniques required for high performance IO operations such as buffers, channels, flipping, clearing buffers, scattering read, and gathering write.\nEach complicated concept is clearly explained step by step with code as well as visual representation so that you can catch up with the ideas.\nThe course is divided into 2 main sections:\nThe first section will discuss about Stream model:\nRandom access files withe RandomAccessFile\nBinary Streams with FileInputStream/FileOutputStream\nCharacter Streams with FileReader/FileWriter/BufferredReader/BufferedWriter/PrintWriter\nObject Streams/Serialization with ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream\nThe second section will be time to discuss about NIO library.

It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python.\nAs with most other modern Tk bindings, Tkinter is implemented as a Python wrapper around a complete Tcl interpreter embedded in the Python interpreter. Tkinter calls are translated into Tcl commands, which are fed to this embedded interpreter, thus making it possible to mix Python and Tcl in a single application.\nThere are several popular GUI library alternatives available, such as wxPython, PyQt, PySide, Pygame, Pyglet, and PyGTK.\nThe generic term for any of the building blocks that make up an application in a graphical user interface.\nCore widgets: The containers: frame, labelframe, toplevel, paned window. The buttons: button, radiobutton, checkbutton (checkbox), and menubutton. The text widgets: label, message, text. The entry widgets: scale, scrollbar, listbox, slider, spinbox, entry (singleline), optionmenu, text (multiline), and canvas (vector and pixel graphics).\nTkinter provides three modules that allow pop-up dialogs to be displayed: tk.messagebox (confirmation, information, warning and error dialogs), tk.filedialog (single file, multiple file and directory selection dialogs) and tk.colorchooser (colour picker).\nPython 2.7 and Python 3.1 incorporate the \"themed Tk\" (\"ttk\") functionality of Tk 8.5. This allows Tk widgets to be easily themed to look like the native desktop environment in which the application is running, thereby addressing a long-standing criticism of Tk (and hence of Tkinter). Some widgets are exclusive to ttk, such as the combobox, progressbar and treeview widgets\n\n\nThe graphical user interface is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.\nThe actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements. Beyond computers, GUIs are used in many handheld mobile devices such as MP3 players, portable media players, gaming devices, smartphones and smaller household, office and industrial controls.     Ref : wikipedia",

      "description": "Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\nFor instance, an object could represent a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.\nPut another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things like cars as well as relations between things like companies and employees, students and teachers, etc. OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\nObject-oriented programming is based on the imperative programming paradigm, which uses statements to change a program's state. It focuses on describing how a program should operate.\nOOP uses the concept of objects and classes. A class can be thought of as a 'blueprint' for objects. These can have their own attributes (characteristics they possess), and methods (actions they perform).\nIn this course you will learn the key concepts of object oriented programming which includes:\nClasses\nMethods\nInstantiating\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\nEncapsulation\nAbstraction\nC# is an object-oriented programming language. The four basic principles of object-oriented programming are:\nAbstraction Modelling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.\nEncapsulation Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.\nInheritance Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.\nPolymorphism Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.\nObject oriented programming (OOP) is a programming structure where programs are organized around objects as opposed to action and logic. This is essentially a design philosophy that uses a different set of programming languages such as C#. Understanding OOP concepts can help make decisions about how you should design an application and what language to use.\nEverything in OOP is placed together as self-sustainable “objects.” An object is a combination of variables, functions, and data that performs a set of related activities. When the object performs those activities, it defines the object’s behaviour. In addition, an object is an instance of a class.",

There is no pressure or time limit for the tests and are not included to encourage students to practice and write code themselves.\nBy the end of the course, students will have various small programs written with the guidance of the instructor and by themselves which they can build upon as their own.\nWho is the instructor?\nMy name is Nate and I have been working with C++ for about a decade now.\nMy profession (Game developer/Game programmer) involves working closely with the C++ language to build large-scale projects for games, tools, plugins, etc. I use C++ on a daily basis and have gained a deeper understanding of how the language works, what should be used when writing code, and what software companies look for when hiring new programmers.\nI have been teaching programming and game development both in person and online for the past two years.\nMy style of teaching is straight-to-the-point fast-paced lectures as I hate people's time, using many examples and external documentation to give students as many resources as I can to speed up their learning journey.\nI make myself always available to answer questions and discuss with students.\nWhat is included in the course?\nThe topics and material of lectures for the course were carefully chosen based on what's most commonly used in the industry and what skills and knowledge software companies are looking for in new programmers during the hiring stage.\nThe material will give students a strong fundamental knowledge of C++, exploring various concepts commonly used when using the language, and a look into more advanced usages of the language.\nThe course includes 45 lectures, 6 assignments, and 2 tests. Each lecture discusses a new topic that is explained in detail and with many examples. Assignments and tests are only included to ensure you get the necessary practice to be a confident programmer. They are not meant to stress you in any way, nor are they going to be graded (there is no pass/failed).\n\nWhy C++?\nEfficiency: C++ excels in performance, offering efficient memory manipulation for faster, resource-optimized programs.\nControl: Developers have unprecedented control over hardware, making it ideal for speed-critical applications.\nCross-Platform Flexibility: C++ facilitates seamless cross-platform development.\nUniversal Language: Known as a \"general-purpose\" language, C++ handles a wide spectrum of programming tasks.\nModularity: Supporting Object-Oriented Programming, C++ fosters modular and organized code structures.\nC++ evolves with modern demands, ensuring relevance and adaptability for years to come.\nCareer Catalyst: C++ proficiency is a sought-after skill, unlocking diverse job opportunities and career advancement.\nReal-World Applications:\nGaming Development: C++ is the backbone of the gaming industry, powering popular titles and delivering immersive experiences.\nWeb Browsers: Many browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, rely on C++ for their core functionalities.\nEmbedded Systems: C++ is a key player in embedded systems, driving the functionality of devices like smart appliances and IoT devices.\nSystem Software: Operating systems and system-level software often leverage C++ for its efficiency and control.",

Such problems can arise in practically every field of science, engineering and business, and the demand for efficient and reliable solution methods is increasing. The task is challenging because, instead of a single optimal solution, multi-objective optimization results in many solutions with different trade-offs among criteria, also known as Pareto optimal solutions. A multi-objective Genetic Algorithm is a guided random search method suitable for solving problems with multiple objective functions and variables. Solutions of the Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm are illustrated using the Pareto fronts. Academics, industrial scientists, engineers engaged in research & development will find this course invaluable.\nThis course will teach you to implement multi-objective genetic algorithm-based optimization in the MATLAB environment using the Global Optimization Toolbox. Various kinds of optimization problems are solved in this course. At the end of this course, you will utilize the algorithm to solve your optimization problems. The complete MATLAB programs included in the class are also available for download. This course is designed most straightforwardly to utilize your time wisely. Take advantage of learning and understanding the fast-growing field of evolutionary computation.\nHappy learning.",

      "description": "Multithreading is an ability of a platform or an application to create a process that consists of multiple threads of execution. Multithreading is used when the parallel execution of some tasks edges to a more productive use of resources of the system. Multithreaded applications execute multiple threads in a single processor environment, allowing developers to achieve concurrency. Multithreading with C++ has diverse benefits as C++ being an intermediate level language and comprises a confirmation of both high level and low level language features. If you're interested to master multithreading and concurrent processing with C++, then go for this Learning Path.\nPackt’s Video Learning Paths are a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that each video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.\nThe highlights of this Learning Path are:\nLearn to use tools such as Val grind to analyze the multithreaded performance of an application\nExplore an advanced multithreading implementation using C++ 14's native threading API\nLearn how multithreading can be done across multiple systems\n\nLet’s take a quick look at your learning journey...\nThis step-by-step guide will get you started with examples that will help you become a master at writing robust concurrent and parallel applications in C++.\nTo get started, this Learning Path gives you a brief introduction to the fundamentals of multithreading and concurrency concepts. The comprehensive coverage of essential multithreading concepts will help you code and apply efficiently multithreading concepts while coding in C++.\nMoving on, you’ll learn the finer points of multithreading and concurrency concepts and how to apply them efficiently in C++. After this, you’ll take an in-depth look at how these concepts work at the hardware-level as well as how both operating systems and frameworks use these low-level functions. Finally, you’ll learn about the native multithreading and concurrency support available in C++ like synchronization, and communication between threads. After completing this Learning Path, you’ll have learned the concepts required to be a functional programmer and write functional web-apps using modern JavaScript.\nAfter the completion of this Learning Path, you’ll have mastered multithreading and concurrent processing with C++ as well as write robust, concurrent and parallel applications.\nMeet Your Expert:\nWe have the best work of the following esteemed author to ensure that your learning journey is smooth:\n\nMaya Posch is a software engineer by trade and a self-professed electronics, robotics, and AI nut, running her own software development company, Nyanko, with her good friend, Trevor Purdy, where she works on various game development projects and some non-game projects.

Python is what is referred to as a high level language. That means it is a language that is closer to humans than computer.It is also known as a general purpose programming language due to it's flexibility.\nIn this course,you  learn the basics of  graphical user interface (GUI) programming. The primary GUI toolkit we will be using is Tk, Python’s default  GUI. We’ll access Tk from its Python interface called Tkinter (short for “Tk interface”).Tkinter is Python’s default GUI library Python, along with Tkinter, provides a fast and exciting way to build useful applications\n\n\nOnce you have designed the application and the look and feel that goes along with your program, you will use basic building blocks known as widgets to piece together the desired.\nPython is object -oriented means it regards everything as an object. An object in the real world could be a person or a car.\nPython is an interpreted language that does not need to be complied like for example java programming language.\nIt is interpreted and run on the fly the same time.\nPython has been used in a lot of places like in creating games, for statistical data and visualisation,speech and face recognition.\nSome of the biggest websites on this planet earth use python\nin one way or another. Examples include:\n\n\nGoogle\nYoutube\nFacebook\nNasa\nDisney\nPixar\nReddit\nPinterest\nInstagram\nSpotify\nSurvey Monkey\nYahoo Maps\nProjects we will create:\nBasic calculator\nCurrency converter\nMusic Player\nLoan calculator\nYouTube Video Downloader\nMp4 to MP3 Converter\nFeet to Meters Conversion App\nImage Slider\nTip Calculator",

      "description": "I think that most of us programmers start developing applications in single threaded mode. Which means that tasks or actions defined in this application will be executed in a certain predefined sequence. But at some point, we need to start tasks simultaneously and to be completed asynchronously in order to save execution time and to boost up performance.\n\nHere is an example. You need to compare the execution speed of two tasks. In a single threaded program you have to perform the speed measurement tasks one after another, then compare the time difference at the end of when both tasks are done. Let’s say Task A needs 30 seconds and Task B needs only 0.5 second. Therefore, if you start Task B after Task A, you won’t see Task B to be completed until Task A is finished.\n\nIf we do it in a multithreaded mode, then no matter which task first, we can always see Task B to be finished in 0.5 second while Task A is still running. And if we use the right multi-threading technique, Task A might not even need 30 seconds to run. This is the beauty of multi-threading programming.\n\nFor the time being, there are several multi-threading techniques available in C# and .Net. Including Thread, ThreadPool, Task, TaskFactory, Task Run, BackgroundWorker, async and await, Parallel.For/Parallel.ForEach… Wow! So overwhelming!\n\nDon’t worry, this two-hour long course provides you a very good insight on when to use what. Topics that will be mainly covered including the followings:\nProblems with single threaded application\nBasics of mult-threading model of C#\nThe BackgroundWorker\nUse Dispatcher to update UI in progress\nThread and ThreadPool\nTPL (1) - Task. Run and Task. Factory\nTPL (2) - async and await\nTPL (3) - Parallel programming\n\nAnd the sample being used in this course is quite interesting as well. We are going to compare the speed of concatenating a string 50,000 times by using a string type variable and a StringBuilder type variable, respectively. You will be surprised at the performance that they yield.\n\nEven though this course just brings you the basic concept of .Net’s multithreading techniques, the codes introduced in this course should be useful enough in your real world projects. Hope you enjoy this course.",

      "description": "Module 1: Challenges in Core Concepts (Integrated Mathematics)\nThis module consists of five challenges, each of which presents several programming concepts and then challenges the student to solve a coding problem by applying these very concepts. A fantastic aspect of Scratch is that in it’s very DNA coding are contained three important mathematical algebraic principles, present in every single mathematical curriculum from year 6 to year 10. We are more deeply exploring the Cartesian plane across which the Scratch Sprites move and the variables that keep score and object location in Scratch games. We are also investigating equations which are necessary to bring realism to the movement of objects.\n\n\nModule 2: Open Ended Activities\nAfter learning the fundamentals in Module 1, a whole new world of possibilities opens up. Each lesson in this module takes students to the brink of creating a playable game in Scratch and leaves them with a set of improvement suggestions that would take the game to the next level of playability. The idea here is that each student in class can complete a different amount of upgrades and in a different fashion. There is no finishing line and there is an infinite potential for improvement. In a way, this ensures that advanced students don’t sit around and wait for the next lesson (low entry – high ceiling).\n\n\nModule 3: Advanced Concepts\nWhen students arrive at this module, they are comfortable with Scratch. They begin to make a brilliant realisation that an advanced concept is simply three or four basic concepts put to use all together at one time. So, some examples of what we cover in this module are:\n1. Projectile Motion equations which are brought to life in a doughnut shooting game.\n2. Zero G Equations (Newtons Laws of Motion) which are brought to life in a spaceship which moves just like objects do in outer space\n3. Custom Blocks which amount to functions with parameters which are used to create a program that simulates fireworks\n\n\nModule 4: Complex Problems\nIn order to maximise students’ potential and achieve a level of excellence students need to take on big challenges which in all likelihood will not be solved at the first attempt. After all, professional mathematicians do not spend their day solving easy math problems. Rather they spend most of their time taking on world changing difficult problems, often without success. Still, it is this experience of pushing your limits and attempting amazing things that is so much fun and helps those who do it to become a little smarter every day! In this module, you have three complex problems to choose from. We recommend you cover at least two.\nOption 1: Ski Racing Game\nSetting up ski races is something that could be performed really well by a computer program. We have some 40-60 sets of gates that the skier has to go through. These need to be positioned at different angles and distances, which we can do using random number ranges. Then there is an issue of the skier; here the students learn how to perform two different movement dynamics (mouse following and arrow activation). The main goal of the students is to fine tune the game dynamics and find a way to measure and record the times of the skiers so that they can challenge their friends to beat their best times.\nOption 2: Fruit Slicing Game\nWhat if you could interact with Scratch by waving your hands around? Well you can, and all you need is an ordinary webcam! Scratch has a way of measuring the movement of your hands and any other object you bring into the room being viewed by the webcam. The game you will see is similar to the popular game called Fruit Ninja, but it’s a whole lot more fun to wave your hands around than swipe a phone screen. The ultimate goal is to slice up a specific number of apples and oranges.\nOption 3: Physics Engine\nThis is the hardest challenge, designed for the students who are doing really well with coding and also enjoying the integrated mathematics. The idea here is that every popular 3D game uses physics to simulate the real world and make the game feel realistic. This is precisely what the students will be asked to do with a ball object which should bounce off the walls in natural arcs and eventually come to rest. Once this big challenge is solved, students can easily create realistic soccer or volleyball games",

The selected development language is Solidity. We have a \"Solidity and Remix in a Nutshell Lecture\" for students who have a background in other development languages but lack smart contract development experience. This would help them to understand the content and to be able to run provided code parts along with various explanations throughout the course dealing with language/platform-specific issues.\nThe security weaknesses addressed in this course include some popular weaknesses such as Reentrancy but also many others. We visit numerous terms as we explain these problems and related solutions. Whenever we encounter a pattern to solve a problem we explicitly mark this on our slides. We will be looking at code samples which will be provided from the course web site when we discuss the problems and solutions.\nFinally, the tools and libraries which used in the course either to introduce new tools/libraries or as helper tools are Remix, Docker, VeriSol, DotNetTool, Oyente, Open Zeppelin Access Control, Open Zeppelin Tokens, Open Zeppelin, Manticore, and Slither.",

      "description": "Hello Students\n\n\nWelcome to Python Firebase with Firebase Admin SDK course, there are different topics and sections in this course.\n\n\nWhat is Python ?\nPython is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n\n\nWhat is Firebase ?\nFirebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development.\n\n\nWhat is Firebase Admin SDK ?\nThe Admin SDK is a set of server libraries that lets you interact with Firebase from privileged environments to perform actions like:\nRead and write Realtime Database data with full admin privileges.\nProgrammatically send Firebase Cloud Messaging messages using a simple, alternative approach to the Firebase Cloud Messaging server protocols.\nGenerate and verify Firebase auth tokens.\nAccess Google Cloud resources like Cloud Storage buckets and Cloud Firestore databases associated with your Firebase projects.\nCreate your own simplified admin console to do things like look up user data or change a user's email address for authentication.\nFirebase Admin SDK supports different programming languages like Java, C#, NodeJS, C++ and Python, in this course we are interested in\nintegrating Firebase Admin SDK with Python Programming Language.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Structure\nThis course is divided in to different sections.\n1: In the first section we are going to learn that how we can create a Project in Firebase, how we can generate private key for our service account, and how we can initialize Firebase Admin SDK in Python Programming Language.\n\n\n2: In the second section we are going to learn about Firebase Authentication,  so Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords,  phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google,  Facebook and Twitter, and more, in this course we are interested in creating users with email and password.\n\n\n3. In the third section we are going to learn about Firebase Realtime Database, now the The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience.\n\n\n4. In the fourth part we want to talk about Firebase Cloud Firestore with Python, the Cloud Firestore is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database that your Apple,  Android, and web apps can access directly via native SDKs. Cloud Firestore  is also available in native Node.js, Java, Python, Unity, C++ and Go SDKs, in addition to REST and RPC APIs.\n\n\n5. In the fifth part we are going to learn about Firebase Cloud Storage, the Cloud Storage for Firebase lets you upload and share user generated content, such as images and video, which allows you to build rich media content into your apps. Your data is stored in a Google Cloud Storage.\n\n\n6. In the sixth part we are going to learn that how we can work with Pyrebase4, it is a wrapper library around firebase admin sdk.",

      "description": "We can add anything onto our standard databases and then search up queries like listing them in a particular chronological order or for instance, showing people who has a name starting with the letter a. But have you ever thought about how we save a particular location, more precisely, their latitude and longitude information by using queries? What about listing these queries from the nearest to the most far, most far to the nearest and everything else like searching up within a particular kilometer?\nIf the subject is location, we also need to learn how to use other data types as well as customary databases like pointfield or polygonfield.\nWhat is a PointField?\nSimply put, it is a type of data that we use to save the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the users.\nWhat is a PolygonField?\nThis is the type of data that you would need to use if you want to plot a particular area instead of just plotting a point on the map. Examples include: land, patch of an area, country, city, the area of a house etc.\nWhere can I use PointField? Where would it benefit me?\nFor example, when you check-in using the swarm app, the app will receive your latitude and logitude information where you have checked in at that moment. This information will be sent to their server and will be saved into the pointfield after being transformed into a point. Then your location will be shared with everyone instantly.\nWhat else does Swarm do?\nFor example, when you are checking in, it comes up with some suggestions. For example, if you are eating in London in Burger King, and you have a Starbucks nearby, it will be suggested to you.\nHere is an example of what the suggestions may look like:\nBurger King\nStarbucks\nLondon\nOthers...\n... but how does swarm know that you are near these places?\nBecause these are actually saved into the database of Swarm as a pointfield. So it's listing these localities from the closest to the most far. After you have learnt from these lectures, you will find it's really easy make such filters.\nAdditionally, you will also learn how to add limitations within a chosen quantity of kilometer . So you could request to show people for instance only within 10km in distance and list those from the nearest to the farthest.\nLet's talk a bit about Tinder.\nWhat does Tinder do? It shows you the nearest opposite sex. If you are not interested in the users nearby, it will show you someone else that is farther and the distance will gradually become higher. For example, if you are not interested in the people within 0.3km away, the distance will gradually increase to like 2km, 5km, 10km but for example if you are using Tinder in Turkey, you obviously won't see people who are in Germany.\nBasically, Tinder saves your location into their pointfield and lists people who are the nearest to the farthest to your location.\nTinder also shows your distance to other users.\nWith these lectures, you will also learn these and how to calculate the distance in between two users using km's or miles.\nCongratulations, you can now create apps such as swarm, tinder or foursquare.\nSo what else can we do?\nFind my friends: you can make an app where you can find all your friends over a map.\nYou can create a special app where people can follow their girlfriends over a map.\nYou can create an app for rent a car type of businesses to follow the location of the vehicle.\nFor example, you can create an app for an employer who has a business that is usually done outside by an employee like working as a taxi driver. Usually, you would need an expensive GPS device for such things but you can simply make them download an app for their mobile phone and constantly watch their current location.\nNot only these.\nIf you have a website about selling property (real estate) and instead of writing just the km2 of the house, you can show the location of the property on the map including its area giving more details. Who wouldn't want that?\nNot only all of these, after these lectures, you will also learn about all the basics of Google Maps.\nYou will be able to show the people you have previously saved over google maps too.\nYou will gain knowledge about map markers.\nYou will gain knowledge about complex map markers.\nYou will see the photos which you have taken from the database as a marker and be able to add links to them.\nI have learnt everything about Geodjango, learnt about the types of data, I understand Google Maps too, yes, but you talk a lot about the latitude and logitude information. Where can I find that information?\nThis is a very smart question. If you want to do this on web, don't worry, I also talk about the usage of the html 5 geolocation feature.\nIf you have a mobile app (objective-c for iOS and java for android) it is extremely easy to receive the latitude and longitude information. What you do with mobile applications is the same as posting the latitude and longtitude information to the server.\nWow, the amount of information in the lectures are unbelievable! I think that's all we learn.\nNo. Lastly, let's talk about GEOIP. Basically, GEOIP works by receiving the IP adress to receive information such as the country, county, city, district, adress. And yes, with these lectures, you would be able to learn how to use the GEOIP library.\nMore info on geodjango . tumblr address.",

It starts from zero, builds up the design, then gives plenty of real-world examples, but crisply and quickly.\nThe course is also quirky. The examples are irreverent. Lots of little touches: repetition, zooming out so we remember the big picture, active learning with plenty of quizzes. There’s also a peppy soundtrack, and art - all shown by studies to improve cognition and recall.\nWhat's covered:\nThe Object-Oriented Paradigm: Classes, Objects, Interfaces, Inheritance; how an OO mindset differs from a functional or imperative programming mindset;\nMechanics: the mechanics of OO - access modifiers, dynamic dispatch, abstract base classes v interfaces.\nPrinciples: The underlying principles of OO: encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism\nInterfaces, abstract base classes and interface default methods\nPackages and Jars: The plumbing is important to understand too.\nLanguage Features: Serialisation; why the Cloneable interface sucks; exception handling; the immutability of Strings;\nTypes: the Object base class; the instanceof operator, primitive and object reference types; pass-by-value and pass-by-object-reference.",

Separate attention will be given to the data structures (like structs, unions, enums, and arrays), and control flow statements (such as if and switch expressions, while and for loops). We will also learn memory management (pointers, slices, Allocators), and Zig's comptime concept.\nAfter the lectures, we will solidify our understanding of the language with various projects.\nThis course is a work in progress, and it will be updated with new lectures and projects.\nTopics learned in this course will carry over to other of your programming endeavors, and will make you a more rounded developer. As Zig is a lower level language than most popular languages today (such as JavaScript, Python, C#), you will experience first hand how these languages operate under the hood. Learning Zig will make you more comfortable with using other lower level languages, and will teach you to appreciate the work done for you by the higher level languages.\nBasic programming experience is required for this course. If you can write basic scripts in any programming language, know what are and how to use functions, you are ready for this course.\nDisclaimer on the use of AI:\nNo AI assistance was used to create any content used in this course.

      "description": "Microservices are a popular new approach to building maintainable, scalable, cloud-based applications. AWS is the perfect platform for hosting Microservices. Recently, there has been a growing interest in Serverless computing due to the increase in developer productivity, built in auto-scaling abilities, and reduced operational costs.\nBuilding a microservices platform using virtual machines or containers, involves a lot of initial and ongoing effort. There is a cost associated with having idle services running, maintenance of the boxes and a configuration complexity involved in scaling up and down.\nIn combining both microservices and serverless computing, organizations will benefit from having the servers and capacity planning managed by the cloud provider, making them much easier to deploy and run at scale.\nThis comprehensive 3-in-1 course is a step-by-step tutorial which is a perfect course to implementing Microservices using Serverless Computing on AWS. Build highly availableMicroservices to power applications of any size and scale. Get to grips with Microservices and overcome the limitations and challenges experienced in traditional monolithic deployments. Design a highly available and cost-efficient Microservices application using AWS. Create a system where the infrastructure, scalability, and security are managed by AWS. Finally, reduce your support, maintenance, and infrastructure costs.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Building Microservices on AWS, covers building highly available Microservices to power applications of any size and scale. This course shows you how to build Microservices-based applications on AWS. Overcome the limitations and challenges you experience in traditional monolith deployments. By the end of the course, you'll have learned to apply AWS tools to create and deploy Microservices-based applications. You'll be able to make your applications cost-effective, easier to scale, and faster to develop.\nThe second course, Building a Scalable ServerlessMicroservice REST Data API, covers practical solutions to building Serverless applications. In this course we show you how to build an end-to-end serverless application for your organization. We have selected a data API use case that could reduce costs and give you more flexibility in how you and your clients consume or present your application, metrics and insight data. We make use of the latest serverless deployment and build framework, share our experience on testing, and provide best practices for running a serverless stack in a production environment.\nThe third course, Implementing ServerlessMicroservices Architecture Patterns, covers implementing Microservices using Serverless Computing on AWS. In this course, We will show you how Serverless computing can be used to implement the majority of the Microservice architecture patterns and when put in a continuous integration & continuous delivery pipeline; can dramatically increase the delivery speed, productivity and flexibility of the development team in your organization, while reducing the overall running, operational and maintenance costs. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to build, test, deploy, scale and monitor your microservices with ease using Serverless computing in a continuous delivery pipeline.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll create a secure, scalable, and Serverless data API to build highly available Microservices to power applications of any size and scale.\nAbout the Authors\n●        Alan Rodrigues has been working on software components such as Docker containers and Kubernetes for the last 2 years.

We'll also set up Python SDK so we can create and run Python code.\n\n\nSection 2 - Getting Started In Python:\nWe'll create our first Python program. We'll learn about printing in python and learn what strings are and how we can slice them in order to extract certain data from them. We'll also understand how strings are a sequence of characters and that we can actually index through those characters, so this will be a small introduction into Lists.\n\n\nSection 3 - First Steps In Python:\nIn this section we're going to learn about code blocks and how we can use conditional statements to execute certain code only in certain conditions. We'll learn how we can use the Debugger in IntelliJ and understand how important it is. We'll also delve into testing operators, Boolean values and Truth Tables. Finally we'll see what complex expressions are and how we can use them to our advantage to make code more readable.\n\n\nSection 4 - Loops In Python:\nThis will probably be the most fun section. We'll delve into Loops, for loops and while loops and learn the difference between them and when to use each. We'll learn different tricks to use in loops such as break and continue and apply those tricks to create fun games. We'll also learn Binary Search Algorithm that will introduce a bit of intelligence to our program.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn In This Course:\nDownload and install Python\nDownload and set up IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE\nSet up Python SDK\nLearn how print works in Python\nLearn how stings work in Python\nUnderstand what special characters are in Python\nUnderstand how to index through strings\nLearn how to slice strings to extract data\nHow to using string operators\nCreate conditional statements\nBecome an expert in complex expressions\nLearn about Boolean values\nUnderstand what Truth tables are\nLearn for loops loops\nLearn While Loops\nDelve deeper into loops and use them in new games",

Or do you want to advance your career as a technical writer in the software development industry?\nIf your answer is yes, then this course can help you!\nPython is currently the most popular programming language in the world. According to SlashData, \"there are now 8.2 million developers in the world who code using Python, and that population is now larger than those who build in the Java language.\"\nIf you are serious about your technical writing career, you must be able to communicate efficiently with your development team about the software code they have been developing. Moreover, top-paying companies in the software industry often require technical writers to not only read and understand Python source code but also to develop sample code exercises that enrich developers' documentation.\nBut how can you do that if you're just a technical writer who has never written a single line of code? You should find someone to show and guide you through this software development jungle, preferably quickly so that you can get back to writing documentation that helps your target users!\nThis course is designed to help technical writers learn Python programming language in order to communicate more efficiently with their development team and develop sample code exercises for documentation.\nPh.D. Sehrish Aqeel, a top expert in Python from JPDocu School of Technical Writing, shares her vast experience with Python in a friendly and relaxed manner. She has over 14 years of experience teaching at the university and online, and now she shares her knowledge with the technical communications community through this course through practical explanations and hands-on exercises.\nBy the end of the course, participants will become technical writers who can confidently read and understand Python source code, use Python terminology, and develop a simple application following the instructor's guidelines.\nYou will soon realize that Python language can be easy to understand and learn when you have the right teacher. There is no complicated theory, just practical explanations, and simple hands-on exercises to smoothly introduce you to the language. Of course, this course does not aim to turn you into a developer - do not expect to gain solid development skills here. However, by the end of this course, you will become a technical writer who can read and understand Python source code, use Python's terminology confidently, and get the chance to develop a simple application yourself, following the instructor's guidelines.\nSo, enroll now and see how simple and easy Python can be. Impress your development team with the skills of a professional technical writer who knows Python language too!",

Time proven techniques.\n\n\nHow To?\nThe ability to keep track of each and every word on the Internet seems like a daunting undertaking... But underneath all of the contracts and service agreements there is a simple data-and-file indexing capability.\n\n\nFar from keeping a copy of everything that has ever been placed on the Internet places like Google instead create indexes. Files and techniques that allow us to point to pages to allow us to readily search index files for the information we're looking for.\n\n\nBottom Line ...\nWe will leverage what we have learned so as to be able to tag & keep track of what has been stored in any data-file type ... in Python 3000: Tactical File I/O we're going to show you how to create an index your own data using Python! -By the time you have completed this training, you will know what you will need to do to manage & track data without using any 3rd party database technologies!",

We also learn the difference between concurrency and parallelism.\nWe also discussed shared memory model, distributed memory model and hybrid model etc relative to their implementation in parallel programming.\nWe discussed what a task region is, and how to declare one.\nThen we dived in to writing parallel programs using openMP APi.\nSome of the programs demonstrated each of the openMP work sharing constructs including;\n1. Parallel Regions –\ne.g #pragma omp parallel\n2. Runtime functions/environment variables –e.g\nint my_thread_id = omp_get_num_threads(); – omp_set_num_threads(8);\n3. Synchronization –\ne.g #pragma omp barrier\n4. Work sharing –\ne.g #pragma omp for, #pragma omp sections\n5. Data Environment –\ne.g #pragma omp parallel shared/private (…)\n6. tasks. etc.\nA lot of practical examples are also included in most lectures to enable the reader get a good grasp of the concept being discussed.\nAt the end of the course the student would be able to efficiently implement parallel programming to improve the speed and standard of programs written in C and C++.\nThank you .",

These variables will be used to create and solve equations and also to investigate factorisation and prime numbers.\nCoding ties in with co-ordinate geometry through user interfaces (the very screen you are looking at right now) this screen is a Cartesian two dimensional plane where every single pixel is a unique co-ordinate. These pixels are essentially the same as squares on a plotting paper and so we can use them to plot various functions, intersections points and axis intercepts.\nWhat you can do with this knowledge?\nIf you are a high school student you can gain a novel insight into your most important maths skills and come to realise their value in applying them to computer programs\nIf you are a teacher you have just acquired a capacity to create some amazing interactive activities for algebra and co-ordinate geometry. Beyond this you can create automated quizzes which your students can use to test their skills.\nIf you are budding game designer you can better understand the equations that govern the movement of objects and so begin creating basic physics engines\nHow long will the course take?\nThis course can be completed in approximately 4 hours by someone proficient in Scratch, a Scratch novice would need about 6 hours\nWhat else is included?\nAll the solution files are attached in a zip file inside the very first introductory lecture",

The core features and fundamentals are explored in a fun and practical way, encouraging the development of real-world projects while establishing a solid understanding of game development principles.\nThis Learning Path starts with the essentials of Python programming. This will touch upon all the necessary Python concepts related to data structures, OOP, functional programming, as well as statistical programming. You will get acquainted with the nuances of Python syntax and how to effectively use the advantages that it offers.\nThen, you’ll be introduced to the world of parallel computing. Explore thread-based parallelism model using the Python threading module by synchronizing threads and using locks, mutex, semaphores queues, GIL, and the thread pool. Moving on, you’ll get to grips with the asynchronous parallel programming model using the Python asyncio module, and will see how to handle exceptions. You will discover distributed computing with Python, and learn how to install a broker, use Celery Python Module, and create a worker.\nThe course focuses on building 4 fun projects from scratch with easy-to-understand explanations and practical applications. You’ll learn how to create a well-designed architecture and increase performance of the current applications. You will learn how to build enterprise ready applications with the Python language.\nThe goal of this course is to make you proficient at Python programming, able to make projects from scratch.\nAbout the Authors:\nThis Learning Path is authored by some of the best in the field.\nSteven F. Lott has been programming since the 70s, when computers were large, expensive, and rare. As a contract software developer and architect, he has worked on hundreds of projects, from very small to very large. He's been using Python to solve business problems for over 10 years.\nGiancarlo Zaccone has more than 10 years of experience in managing research projects, both in the scientific and industrial domains.

Salesforce integration relieves them from this problem and provides them with a centralized platform to work on.\nFor example, Salesforce PayPal integration would allow you to use your Salesforce org as a payment gateway. Similarly, Salesforce Twilio integration would streamline your communication processes with your clients.\nSalesforce Integration Processes\nThere are two major approaches to carry out the process of Salesforce integration – App-based and code-based.\nCourse Outline\nSalesforce Integration Overview\nSalesforce to Salesforce Integration\nJSON Format\nJSON Generator\nJSON Parser\nJSON Parser Deserialization\nPostal Pincode API / Use case\nWeather Map API Integration / Use case\nRest Web Services Overview\nCreating Web Services\nOauth Username password and flow overview\nOauth Username password Use case\nFuture Callout with Oauth\nEmail Services",

Rust is very popular with Concurrency, memory safety at compile time,  and multithreaded applications and type safety. Variables and mutability. By default variables are immutable in Rust. There is a concept called shadowing in Rust. We use println!() macro for printing. Macros are an extended version of functions. Data types. Automatic type casting is not allowed in Rust. Number separator for large numbers using underscores possible in Rust. The mut keyword is used for mutability. Rust strings are divided into string literals and string objects. Match statement is used in Rust like the switch case statement in C/C++. For returning values from functions we can use a single arrow --> like this to indicate a return type.\nParameters are passed to functions by value as well as by Reference  as in other languages. There is a concept called Rust Ownership. The move operation in Rust is similar to a shallow copy in other languages. We have the stack memory as well as the Heap memory. Rust trait is very much similar to the concept of interfaces in Object oriented programming languages. There is a concept called copy trait in Rust.\nRust References and Borrowing. Observe Rust does not have the idea of Garbage collection. There is nothing like Exception handling also in Rust. Rust slices. A slice is a pointer to a block of memory. String slices are literals. Rust  structure is similar to structures in other languages. Rust has Enums as well as Modules. Rust collections include Vector, Hash Map  and Hash Set. Rust Error handling . Recoverable and Unrecoverable errors in Rust. Panic macro and Unrecoverable errors. Generic types, Generic structures.",

These are straightforward coding videos\n2. I explain things sometimes in excruciating detail\n3. There are questions embedded throughout the videos\n4. There is no talking head or fancy graphics\n5. There are zips under lesson resources with the project files where needed\n6. If you want to push your skills up, you have to type and run the code just as I do. Experience is the greatest and most effective teacher.\n7. As you create the code, stop and ask yourself this question: can you make one meaningful change to the code to produce a new effect or to show something slightly different? If you do this repeatedly, even if slowly at first, your programmer's \"brain\" will grow much faster.\n8. This course uses classic ASP.NET, and NOT MVC or anything like that where the templates are already very elaborate. My code is built from scratch, line by line.\n9.

      "description": "Removing the concept of a “server” from your application is huge. Cloud-based infrastructure was a game changer for software development and serverless architectures is the next step in that evolution. Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. Many companies have started adopting serverless architecture for their applications to save costs and improve scalability. This course demonstrates a key strength of serverless computing in AWS using Spring.\nThis course will introduce you to Serverless Architecture and lead you to build a simple image-resizing service using a Java-based AWS Lambda function. Then we’ll move onto how the Spring framework supports the cloud and in particular AWS. There are a number of different services made available through Spring annotations to make your life easier.\nMoving on, you’ll start to build your Spring-based, serverless application that will take a URL and convert it into a short URL that will be stored in DynamoDB and you’ll receive a short URL. You can then use that short URL in a browser and then be redirected to the real site. To demonstrate integration with AWS’ Simple Notification Service (SNS), the application will also send a notification to you whenever someone creates a new short URL. Lastly, you’ll learn about monitoring your application using AWS cloud watch.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to build scalable and cost-efficient Spring applications with serverless architectures.\nAbout the Author\nMarc Thomas is a Solutions Architect that is still actively involved with the development team. He has 19 years of experience in software development from embedded software, desktop applications, through to the latest web application technologies. Marc has worked in a number of different industries from Networking to Process Improvement, Asset Management, Defense, and Marketing.

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to the \" Tkinter Python & Python GUI with Real Tkinter Applications \" course.\nTkinter Python & Python Gui - Master Python Tkinter to build desktop applications with hands-on Python Gui applications.\nTkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit and is Python's de-facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from the Tk interface. Python, Tkinter, Gui, tkinter python, python tkinter, Python GUI, desktop application development,\nTkinter is the de facto way in Python to Graphical User interfaces (GUIs) and is included in all standard Python Distributions.  Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that's built into the Python standard library. In fact, it's the only framework built into the Python standard library.\nTkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\n\nIn this course, we will learn what is the GUI, and Tkinter and how they work. And also how we create a program with GUI in python. For those who want to use Python not only in AI and Data Science, but also to develop a program using Python.\nAnd in this course, We will open the door of the Python world and try to move deeper. We will learn fundamental things about Python, step by step. Throughout the course, we will do a variety of exercises to reinforce what we have learned.\nCreating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps −\nImport the Tkinter module.\nCreate the GUI application main window.\nAdd one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.\nEnter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.\nThis course has suitable for everybody who is interested in Python.\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization.\nSee why millions of people turn to Oak Academy’s real-world experts to learn Python. Learn at your own pace with hands-on exercises and quizzes. Our courses are frequently updated so you’ll always be working from the latest information. This is the training you’ll need to become a professional Python developer.\nTake one of Oak Academy’s range of Python courses and learn how to code using this incredibly useful language. Its simple syntax and readability make Python perfect for Flask, Django, data science, and machine learning. You’ll learn how to build everything from games to sites to apps. Choose from a range of courses that will appeal to both beginners and advanced developers alike.\nAs you all know or have guessed, Python is the most powerful programming language used in data science and artificial intelligence. Everyone is talking about it. This is said everywhere. Python is for data science.\n- But don't we programmers ever wonder?\n- Can we code an application using Python?\n- How can we use GUI in Python?\n- I wonder if we can quickly prepare a user interface?\nIn this course, we will seek answers to these questions with you. First of all, in our course, we will explain the fundamental topics of Python so that those who are new to Python can understand it. These fundamental topics will include the most powerful and important topics of both Python and software development, such as OOP. Then we will try to develop some programs with GUI using Python with you. While doing this, we will learn how to do GUI design in Python. We will also learn how to make database connections in Python.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nWhat is a Tkinter in Python?\nTkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. Tkinter is not the only GuiProgramming toolkit for Python. It is however the most commonly used one.\n\nWhat is the easiest GUI for Python?\nTkinter is one of the most popular GUI libraries in Python. It is one of the first choices for beginners to GUI development because of its simple and easy-to-learn syntax.\n\n\nIs tkinter easy?\nIf your goal is to learn how to create GUIs, tkinter is arguably one of the best toolkits there is to reach that goal. It's simple and easy to learn and can provide a fantastic introduction to concepts you must master in order to create graphical desktop applications.\n\n\nWhy tkinter is used in Python?\nTkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\n\n\nIs tkinter included in PyCharm?\nThe Tkinter library is built-in with every Python installation, so it's already installed in PyCharm per default. This means that you have to do nothing else but run “ import tkinter ” or “ import tkinter as tk ” in your Python 3 script without installation.\n\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popular.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile development.\n\n\nWhat skills or experience should I have before learning Python?\nPython is often taught in college-level classes because it is well-suited to being someone's first programming language. So, while it can be easier to learn Python if you already know Java, JavaScript, or other common languages, it isn't necessary. Before you learn Python, it might be helpful to understand the basics of programming logic, such as \"if/then\" gates, \"while/for\" loops and procedural vs. objective programming. You might also want to understand how applications get built, the difference between frontend and backend programming, and how computers utilize given applications. Udemy has a lot of beginner courses that can help you pick up Python quickly.\n\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\nOur goal is to learn how to write a program using Python at the end of the course. Are you excited? Because I'm excited.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the Tkinter Python & Python GUI with Real Tkinter Applications course!\nPython Tkinter & Gui Masterclass - Master Python TkInter to build desktop application skill with Python Gui applications",

Using Cygwin and Windows Sub-System for Linux (WSL) even students working on Microsoft Windows can begin to master the Linux / Unix programming world!\n\n\nStandardized since 1998, Modern C and C++ share a rich & common legacy. Often called upon to work with legacy code, modern C/C++ software developers are more likely to encounter older, rather than newer, software. C/C++ 1000: GNU For Beginners is designed for students who will need to be able to detect the difference between the standards.\n\n\nPart of a three (3) part series, GNU C/C++ For Beginners begins by covering what every new software developer should know. Starting out by focusing upon basic compiler concepts, our keyword-centric approach ensures that no concept will be left behind!\n\nWhy C/C++?\nYet another forever go-to technology, discovering how to create high-performance software often involves using some part - if not all - of the C/C++ programming standard. Not only does every operating system rely upon some part of the C/C++ standardization effort, but every modern, popular operating system supports both C/C++ as well as the GNU Tool-set. -Almost all other programming languages also support, if not directly rely upon the free & open C/C++ community!\n\n\nFrom popular applications, robotics, and operating systems to the Cloud itself then at some point in time everything relies upon software written in C/C++.\n\n\nWhat Will I Learn?\nUsing the cross-platform, time-proven GNU tool set, understanding how products such as Cygwin can be used to create standards-compliant, portable software also allows students working on Microsoft Windows to begin to master the Linux / Unix programming world.

I can see that look on your face. Yes, I wanted to be realistic. without practice on Day 1, you feel that you mastered it. Week 1, you will feel low on confidence. Month 1, you will rarely remember that you put in the time to learn Apex.\n\n\nwhy give half a try? if you really want to learn to code.\n\n\nIf you are reading this line. My job is half done.

Then we will learn how to create modules in Haskell. We will learn about the various Haskell repositories and how to use them.Once we have our Haskell package in place we will end by testing our package using third-party ecosystems.\nThis course builds on the foundations provided by the Fundamentals of Practical Haskell Programming course and helps to bridge the gap between introductory and advanced Haskell by teaching you how to manage and develop complex programs. We'll also dispel the myth that Haskell is only useful for toy programs.\nThis course covers the important parts of the Haskell development process that are frequently neglected by beginner-level tutorials.\nAbout the Author\nRichard Cook is a staff software engineer at Tableau Software and works on high-performance relational database systems. He works primarily in C++, but has experience in a broad range of languages and technologies.

A computer system used for this purpose is called a speech computer or speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware products. A text-to-speech (TTS) system converts normal language text into speech; other systems render symbolic linguistic representations like phonetic transcriptions into speech.\nSynthesized speech can be created by concatenating pieces of recorded speech that are stored in a database. Systems differ in the size of the stored speech units; a system that stores phones or diphones provides the largest output range, but may lack clarity. For specific usage domains, the storage of entire words or sentences allows for high-quality output. Alternatively, a synthesizer can incorporate a model of the vocal tract and other human voice characteristics to create a completely \"synthetic\" voice output.\nThe quality of a speech synthesizer is judged by its similarity to the human voice and by its ability to be understood clearly. An intelligible text-to-speech program allows people with visual impairments or reading disabilities to listen to written words on a home computer. Many computer operating systems have included speech synthesizers since the early 1990s.\nA text-to-speech system (or \"engine\") is composed of two parts: a front-end and a back-end. The front-end has two major tasks. First, it converts raw text containing symbols like numbers and abbreviations into the equivalent of written-out words. This process is often called text normalization, pre-processing, or tokenization. The front-end then assigns phonetic transcriptions to each word, and divides and marks the text into prosodic units, like phrases, clauses, and sentences. The process of assigning phonetic transcriptions to words is called text-to-phoneme or grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Phonetic transcriptions and prosody information together make up the symbolic linguistic representation that is output by the front-end. The back-end—often referred to as the synthesizer—then converts the symbolic linguistic representation into sound. In certain systems, this part includes the computation of the target prosody (pitch contour, phoneme durations), which is then imposed on the output speech.\nText-To-Speech Application System With TKinter & Python 3 teaches you the complete application of Python technology in the real life instance of speech synthesis. You will be able to implement the text to speech process from scratch following python programming principles.\nSome Fundamentals of text-to-speech application system that were covered in this course are as follows:\nPython GUI design\nHow to use voice command in python\nYou will know about Engine\nHow to use the entry box\nHow to create buttons\nHow to build a full text-to-speech alphabet application in python\n\n\nEmenwa Global instructors are industry experts with years of practical, real-world experience building software at industry leading companies. They are sharing everything they know to teach thousands of students around the world, just like you, the most in-demand technical and non-technical skills (which are commonly overlooked) in the most efficient way so that you can take control of your life and unlock endless exciting new career opportunities in the world of technology, no matter your background or experience.",

Sections are broken down into lectures, where each lecture contains several related topics that are packed with easy-to-understand explanations and real-world examples.\nThe course is designed for beginners and intermediate-level professionals who want to learn TypeScript and use it for building applications.\nWhat is TypeScript?\nTypeScript is an open-source object-oriented programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It’s a superset of JavaScript.\nTypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transpiler to JavaScript.\nWhy TypeScript?\nAs we already know that TypeScript transpiles to JavaScript as browsers can only understand JavaScript.\nSo you might be thinking that what’s the need of adding an extra layer if the executable code is going to be JavaScript itself?\nThere are many benefits of using TypeScript, listing down a few of them.\nTypeScript integrates well with React, Vue, and Angular.\n\nTypeScript is a statically typed language and this makes the code easier to refactor. Statically typed programming languages are those in\nwhich the type of a variable is known at compile-time instead of at run-time.\n\nTypeScript is easier to read and access. Helps in code maintainability.\nThe course has the following topics\nIntroduction to TypeScript\nVariables\nData Types\nConditional Statements\nLoops\nType Checking\nType Assertion\nFunctions\nAccess Modifiers\nNamespace\nModules\nGenerics\nTypeScript Resources",

It's here!\nThis is the most interactive course online for mastering Regular Expressions In JavaScript with tips & tricks, visual illustrations, and a lot of animated explainer videos.\nWhen you begin to learn Regular Expressions for the first time, it might seem like a random string of nonsense. While they might look awkward at times, they are very useful. Once you have a solid understanding of regular expressions you will become a much more effective programmer. To fully understand regular expressions you need to learn the basic concepts which you can build upon.\n\n\n1. So What Is A Regular Expression?\nA regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational expression) is a way to describe a pattern to work with strings by using special syntax.\nBy formulating a regular expression you can...\nSearch for text in a string,\nReplace a sub-string in a string,\nExtract information from a string.\n\n\n2. A Little History About Regular Expressions.\nRegular Expressions began to emerge as a way to describe regular languages.\nIn the 1950s, Regular expressions originated when mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described regular languages by using his mathematical notation called regular sets.\nRegular expressions later became an important part of the tool suite that emerged from the Unix operating system—the ed, sed and vi (vim) editors, grep, AWK, among others. But the ways in which regular expressions were implemented were not always so regular. They really began to show up in the programming world during the 1970s.\nA variety of programming languages like: C#, C, C++, VB. NET, VB 6, Delphi, Java, Groovy, Perl, PHP, JavaScript, VBScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Tcl, PowerShell, R, and more support Regex very well.\n\n\n3. Situations Where Regex Can Be Used.\nCommon applications include data validation, data scraping (especially web scraping), data wrangling,  simple parsing, syntax highlighting systems, text or string processing tasks where the data need not be textual, and in search engines such as Google in order to determine an algorithmic match to the query a user is asking.\nNow have you ever wondered how you get feedback from an online form informing you that you had entered invalid information?\nHow did it know you entered invalid information?\nThe answer is that behind the scenes Regular Expressions is used to validate your input.\nAlmost every programming language implements regular expressions. JavaScript is one of the programming languages with regular expressions support directly built-in. Since you can also run JavaScript on the server with Node.js, the Regular Expression Concepts In JavaScript is the same as Regular Expressions In Node.js\n\n\n4. What You Will Learn In This Course\nThis course aims to introduce you to JavaScript Regular Expressions in a simple way by using annotations, tips & tricks, images, and a lot of animated explainer videos.\nHere is exactly what you're going to learn:\nDifference Between A Character And A String.\nHow To Match Simple Specific Characters.\nHow To Match Different Characters In A Single Position - Character Sets.\nHow To Define A Character Range To Match Different Characters In A Single Position - Character Ranges.\nHow To Define A Negated Character Set OR Range.\nHow To Match Any Character With A Period Or Dot (Except For A New Line).\nHow To Escape (Turn OFF Special Meaning) Reserved Regular Expression Characters By Using The Backslash \"\\\" Character.\nHow To Match Any Word Character (Alphanumeric).\nHow To Match Any Non-Word Character.\nHow To Match Any Digit.\nHow To Match Any Non-Digit.\nHow To Match A Character Either Zero OR One Time.\nHow To Match Either Zero OR More Repetitions Of A Character.\nHow To Match Either One OR More Repetitions Of A Character.\nLine Anchors - Assert The Start And The End Of A String.\nHow To Specify The Exact Amount Of Repetitions To Match.\nHow To Specify The Least (Minimum) Amount Of Repetitions To Match.\nHow To Specify The Minimum And Maximum Amount Of Repetitions To Match.\nHow To Match Alternate Strings OR Words.\nHow To Create Regular Expressions In JavaScript.\nJavaScript Regular Expression Flags.\nJavaScript Regular Expressions Methods.\nValidating A Username By Using Regular Expressions And JavaScript.\nValidating A Password By Using Regular Expressions And JavaScript.\nValidating An Email By Using Regular Expressions And JavaScript.\nYou will also get some practice using regular expressions, and then you will use all that you've learned to build a dynamic Client-Side Form Validation System that uses Regular Expressions And JavaScript to validate the data typed in.\nBy the end of this course, you will gain valuable information to read and create your own regular expressions.\n\n\nI learned Regular Expressions years ago by hard trial-and-error. Now you can learn at 5x the speed I did. This is the course that I wish I had when I first got started with Regular Expressions.\nNow, I hope to welcome you as a new student in this course! So click that \"Enroll\" button right now, and join me in this adventure today of learning Regular Expressions in JavaScript!\nBut if you're not 100% sure yet, just go ahead and watch the promo video and free lectures to take a look at the course project.

The server can handle multiple concurrent games with multiple clients per game. The Client application has a Canvas component that players can use to draw doodles and send as part of the game. The lobby also consists of a chat feature that players in a game can use to communicate with one another prior to the start of the game. The lobbies themselves segregate data so that even with multiple games running at once, all of the chats, users, and images are only seen within a particular lobby! All communication between the server and client applications are done via QWebSocketServer and QWebSocket. We'll also go over some Qt Creator tips and tricks, as well as how to combine multiple projects into a single Qt Project. As we run into bugs along the way, we'll see how we can also use some debugging to track down and fix common mistakes and issues.\n\n\nThank you for your interest and if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me!",

      "description": "Over the past 20 years, I have worked as a professional software developer in various fields. During this time, I have worked as a junior developer, senior developer, and team leader. I founded my own company and collaborated with nearly 20 employees for over a decade. This journey allowed me to delve into different software technologies. After working with dozens of technologies across numerous products, I spent the last five years as a software architect.\n\n\nThroughout my career, besides the technical questions I frequently receive, one question I consistently hear from those interested in this field is: \"How can I learn to code?\"\n\n\nHaving been asked this question countless times, I've always tried to provide my own answers. I've guided many people who turned coding into a career or a fulfilling hobby. Those who succeeded were the ones who charted their own career paths or brought their hobby projects to life. Of course, failures were also part of this journey. Looking back at these failures, I realized that those who struggled the most were usually the ones without a clear goal. Without a solid plan, people who tried to learn multiple things at once or aimed to learn the most popular programming language often lost motivation and gave up when their efforts didn't align with their dreams.\n\n\nAfter contemplating this, I recognized that what many beginners truly need isn't just another course on a specific programming language. Amidst thousands of courses teaching various programming languages, I began to think there was a different need. Many people actually require a course that helps them understand what software development is, where software developers work, and which platforms they should focus on based on their own goals. Drawing from what I've learned from those around me and my experiences, I created this course to fulfill this purpose: for someone who knows nothing to understand what software is, the fields in which it operates, the most fundamental tasks involved, and how they should learn them. My aim with this course is to help newcomers plan their learning journey and avoid the common pitfalls that cause many to quit.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, I should mention that you won't be learning a programming language in this course, nor will you learn mobile device programming or server software development. Instead, you'll gain an understanding of the areas in which software developers work, how these areas are categorized, and the technologies and methodologies they typically use. This course is designed entirely for those who know nothing or who have some knowledge that's scattered like a cloud of gas and dust.\n\n\nSo, what will you learn in this course?\n\n\nIn the first lecture, we have an introductory video about our course. I recommend watching this public video whether you enroll in the course or not.\n\n\nIn the second lecture, we'll take a very general look at the software world and briefly examine the different areas where software developers work.\n\n\nMoving on to the third section, we'll delve deeper into these areas. We'll explore different fields like backend and frontend, specializations like database and API, and what the various specialization principles entail. To help you understand even better, this section will include practical applications where you can work through some code examples.

However, most pipelines faced performance issues when processing large datasets in Python. This limitation hindered Python's ability to manage \"Big Data\".\n\n\nBut in recent years, Polars unlocked the door to processing large datasets with its high performance data structures. It uses parallel processing to quickly read data into DataFrames and Series.\n\n\nAnd its performance doesn't stop there! Not only can Polars read and write data quickly, it can also manipulate vast amounts data faster than Pandas.\n\n\nAfter Finishing the Course, you'll be able to:\nRead CSV files into Polars DataFrames\nKnow how to push data directly from Polars into a database\nExport DataFrames to Excel\nAggregate complex datasets\nJoin DataFrames together\nUtilize Polars' superior processing speed\n\n\nFAQs\nQ: Is the switch from Pandas difficult?\nA: No. The basic concepts are the same. There are definitely differences between the two libraries, but functionality between the two are very similar. If you can do it in Pandas, you can do it in Polars!\n\n\nQ: I'm already learning Pandas, would you say I'm wasting my time?\nA: No. My first exposure to DataFrames was using Pandas. Many of the concepts I learned in Pandas helped me understand Polars. They are definitely different in terms of performance. Pandas may at some point release a faster version, but as for now Polars is much faster when working with large datasets.\n\n\nQ: Pandas has integrations with many more libraries than Polars. Won't I be missing out on these if I make the switch?\nA: Absolutely not. Its true that Polars does not have as many integrations with other python libraries, but switching from a polars DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame is easy. Polars has a function that allows you to convert to and from a Pandas DataFrame. This allows you to get the performance of Polars while also getting the integrations of Pandas. Other libraries have also begun to build integrations with Polars so that may change altogether.\n\n\nQ: What kind of bear is best?\nA: There are basically two schools of thought... Pandas and Polars are indeed competing DataFrame libraries. Its probably for you to decide the answer to this question!",

As more and more people move their activities online, the data companies and websites collect on them will become even more relevant. And guess what that means? Programmers and developers who know their way around databases – and more importantly, who can actually interpret and build things from them – will be in high demand. MongoDB is one of the most dynamic databases out there, so getting to grips with it sooner rather than later means you’ll stay well ahead of the curve.\nBecome a MongoDB Master\nGain an in-depth understanding of MongoDB’s capabilities\nLearn how MongoDB can be used for web app design, development, testing and more\nSet up a powerful development environment with an online IDE\nExplore the impressive MongoDB Aggregation Framework\nBuild a complete web application fully integrated with MongoDB\nApproach Data in New Exciting Ways\nThis MongoDB online course has been designed for web developers, web designers, web architects, testers, site administrators, and pretty much anyone who already has a working knowledge of web development.  Although it’s not vital, knowing how to build web UI components and a familiarity with NoSQL persistence will help. This course is absolutely not limited to developers only, however.\nThe goal is to provide a solid foundation of MongoDB knowledge. To get you up and running on building your own web apps with MongoDB at their core, and to help you understand the capabilities, functionality and limitations of what this database can do.\nYou’ll learn how to configure and run MongoDB, start importing data, and then quickly get stuck into creating new databases. You’ll pick up Mongo Query Language commands and dive into one of MongoDB’s most powerful features, the Aggregation Framework. You’ll work through detailed examples to gain an understanding of the various pieces of the puzzle, all the while learning about this database’s scaling, replication, and sharding abilities.\nBy the end of this course, those examples you’ve been working on will all fit together to form a complete, working web application that’s fully integrated with MongoDB. And not only that, you’ll have the confidence, knowledge and practice needed to start working on your own MongoDB projects straight away.\nAbout MongoDB\nMongoDB is an open source database with a document-oriented data model. It differs from a relational database in that instead of storing data in tables and rows, it stores JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. Because of this, it lends developers the ability to create applications rooted in data in ways they never could before.",

Few developers grasp their full potential, and even fewer understand how variable creation operates under the hood.\nUnderstand global scope, local scope, blocks and function execution contexts and how to use JavaScript variables in these scenarios\nBy the end of this course, you’ll not only master the syntax of variables, but also gain a profound understanding of how variable keywords interact with memory, execution contexts, and environment records.\n\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED TO MASTER VAR LET AND CONST?\nUnderstanding VAR, LET, and CONST variable keywords is essential for any serious JavaScript developer because these keywords fundamentally shape how variables behave in your code. Understanding their differences in scope, hoisting, and mutability helps prevent common pitfalls. With VAR being function-scoped and prone to hoisting issues, while LET and CONST offer block-scoping and “partial-immutability” (with CONST), developers can write cleaner, more predictable code. Additionally, knowing how these keywords interact with memory management and execution contexts allows developers to optimize performance and maintainability in their applications.\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN:\nFundamentals of VAR, LET, and CONST: Delve into the core principles that govern these JavaScript variable keywords and how they differ in functionality.\nFundamentals of BLOCK and FUNCTION scope: Delve into the technical logic and contexts that are created whenever the JavaScript engine evaluates variables inside of a block or function.\nAdvanced Concepts: Gain insights into declarative records, components, slots, and more as you explore advanced topics that every JavaScript developer should know. Part of this advanced learning is understanding the difference between immutable bindings vs immutable assignments, which is extremely important when using the CONST keyword.\nExecution Contexts & Call Stack Visualization: Visualize how JavaScript executes your code and how JavaScript variable bindings are created in different contexts.\nHoisting, Binding, and Memory Allocation: Master the concepts of variable hoisting and binding, and learn how memory is allocated differently for each keyword.\nThe Evolution of JavaScript: Discover why LET and CONST were introduced to replace VAR and what this means for modern development practices.\nTemporal Dead Zone (TDZ): Understand this critical concept and learn strategies for effectively managing it in your code.\nComparative Analysis: Compare JavaScript variable scopes with other programming languages like C, Java, and Bash to enhance your understanding of scope management.\nContextual Keyword Selection: Develop the skills to choose the appropriate keyword based on specific coding scenarios.\nMemory Management & Bindings: Grasp how memory management works in relation to LET, CONST, and VAR to write more efficient code.\nVariable Reassignment & Redeclaration: Understand the nuances of variable reassignment and redeclaration in JavaScript depending on whether you're using CONST, LET or VAR\nLexical vs. Dynamic Scoping: Explore these two scoping types to deepen your understanding of variable accessibility.\nHistorical Insight: Was VAR ever broken? Dive into its past to understand its limitations and how they shaped modern JavaScript.\nAND MORE!\n\n\nTHIS JAVASCRIPT COURSE:\nThis course is designed to be interactive and engaging!\nEach section is packed with coding exercises that reinforce your learning. You’ll also find quizzes at the end of each section to test your knowledge, a comprehensive final exam to challenge your skills, and a hands-on assignment that puts your newfound expertise into practice.\nJoin this course to start an exciting adventure as we demystify JavaScript’s reserved variable keywords!\nWhether you’re a beginner looking to solidify your foundation or an experienced developer eager to deepen your understanding, this course will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in JavaScript development.\n\n\nWHY THIS JAVASCRIPT COURSE STANDS OUT?\nThis isn’t just another course; it’s a transformative experience that will make you an indispensable asset on any development team. Every JavaScript developer uses VAR, LET, and CONST, but most do not fully understanding them—become one of the few who do!\n\n\nLet’s get coding!",

      "description": "Java is a most useful language to master! I know that the process of learning programming especially in Java language can be difficult and frustrating. For this reason, we decided to develop a different learning experience for you. Instead of just programming on a screen in a Java compiler:\nWe use the power of animation in order to analyze the basic ideas.\nAt the same time, we use a digital pen in order to develop the solution of the problem for you in a theoretical base that takes into consideration the Java programming principles.\nAnd finally, when you come to a good level of understanding of the problem, we start the actual coding in Java language.\nWith these 3 layers of teaching process, you will never feel that you can’t build a program in Java as a beginner or in any other programming language, because we will be helping you in every step of the way. You will go a step further, by learning not only the command lines in Java programming language but you will also develop your algorithmic way of thinking, in order to solve a problem efficiently and easily in any programming language including Java programming.\nIf you already have previous exposure to a programming language, not only programming in Java but also Python or C++ that we already worked with in our other courses, you already know that the challenging part is not how to write a Java command line correctly. It is how to use all the bits and pieces that you have learned in order to solve a problem. How to take an application idea that you have and transform it into a program in Java that works correctly in every situation. For this reason, we pay the attention that every part of programming really needs. So in the first part of the course we will start by learning the basics about Variables in Java and how to solve interesting and challenging programs only with Java Variables. Then in the next parts you will learn about the If statement, for loops, classes and objects, arrays and many more features that a programming language like Java contains. Our methodology involves solving carefully chosen problems and programming challenges. In many cases, we will create 2 or even 3 different solutions, in order to teach you not only how to solve a problem, but how to craft a solution in Java, and how you can take different paths in order to reach a certain destination.\nTo follow this course you need to have a compiler to work in. You have two main options:\nThe first one is to download Java programming language from the internet. This is easy even for a Java beginner, you can find numerous tutorials for that on YouTube, so I really don’t want to waste your time with information that is not essential.\nThe second one is to use a special web site where you can program in Java language without any installation. More specifically, you can find it in google just by writing “repl_it - Java”.\nFinally I need to note that this is a Java beginners course, because especially in the first sections we teach you how and where to use every programming language technique with a Java beginner driven teaching method. By starting from complete zero and going all the way to intermediate programmer.\nSo come along to check out how our different approach works for you!",

Understanding streams is very important to become an NodeJs Ninja! There are several types of Streams and mostly every course misses this important concept. For example, how do we build a website like youtube that **streams** the video? How the buffering happens? Well the answer to that question is by using Streams.\n\n\nThis course gives you a solid understanding of how streams are working under the hood and at the same time, how one should use them too. The different types of streams will be explained. The following items would be covered:\n1. Streams , why its required\n2. Different types of Streams\n3. Backpressure in Streams.\n4. How to use pipe, pause, resume API\n5. Understanding how internally Streams works!\n\n\nThe course will teach you streams by running different small example. So sign up today and get your Node.js skills to the next level.\n\n\nFew reviews of this course:\n\"Good course. Helps on understanding streams. Examples were also simple and clear. handling of back pressure was really good. I recommend for even experienced node ppl who doesnt have knowledge on this. Atlast wish could have added more examples.\"\n\n\n\"Good introduction on streams. I guess none of the course here on udemy touches on this! Thanks for the course.

You will learn how you can use Docker to support your local development and how you can utilize it to run your application in the cloud. To work with multiple services, you will need (for example) service discovery and reverse proxies. To be able to maintain the development pace, you also need to break up your user interface, so every service can serve its own UI, and you need to learn how to communicate with these services synchronously using REST and asynchronously using events. To run your application, you need to know what is going on in your distributed application, so monitoring and tracing calls is an important topic as well, and one that you'll learn about. So overall, this course will give you valuable insights and recipes with which to create your own distributed application, for deployment to the cloud.\nYou will also see what needs to be done to upgrade a Spring Boot 1.x service to Spring Boot 2 with the recent Spring Cloud release.\nAbout the Author\nPatrick Cornelissen is a software developer at heart and the founder and CEO of the Orchit GmbH and kulinariWeb GmbH. He has written a number of applications in various languages and platforms and specializes in microservice-based applications and the transition of monolithic applications into microservices. He has been using the Spring Framework since 2009 and has been a big fan ever since. After his family, software craftsmanship is a passion of his that he pursues whenever he has any spare time.

Python can also analyze and visualize data and test software, even if the software being tested was not written in Python.\nPython is a popular general-purpose programming language. It is used in machine learning, web development, desktop applications, and many other fields. Fortunately for beginners, Python has a simple, easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python a great language to learn for beginners.\nLanguage concepts\nPython has several useful programming language concepts that are less frequently found in other languages. These concepts include:\ngenerators\ncomprehensions\napplication dependency handling via the built-in venv (as of Python 3.3) and pip (as of Python 3.4) commands\nGenerators\nGenerators are a Python core language construct that allow a function's return value to behave as an iterator. A generator can allow more efficient memory usage by allocating and deallocating memory during the context of a large number of iterations. Generators are defined in PEP255 and included in the language as of Python 2.2 in 2001.\nComprehensions\nComprehensions are a Python language construct for concisely creating data in lists, dictionaries and sets. List comprehensions are included in Python 2 while dictionary and set comprehensions were introduced to the language in Python 3.\nWhy are comprehensions important?\nComprehensions are a more clear syntax for populating conditional data in the core Python data structures. Creating data without comprehensions often involves nested loops with conditionals that can be difficult for code readers to properly evaluate.",

It is named after the mathematician Haskell Curry. The language is very expressive and has an elegant strong typing system. The language allows you to write code at a very high level, making it easier to write correct code. Because of this, Haskell is particularly useful for writing complex mathematical programs, as well as computer programs that manipulate abstract data types.\nThe \"Haskell\" programming language is the most purely functional language ever devised. It has an elegant, concise, highly expressive type system that gives it superior support for software engineering. It allows concise code to be reused in many different scenarios, leading to shorter, clearer, and more maintainable code.\nHaskell is a purely functional programming language that is often used for research and development. The Haskell language, defined in the 1990s, has had a profound impact on how people learn to think about computer programs. The paradigm used (functional programming) is different from the traditional models like procedural programming (C) or object orientated programming (Java, C++, C#).\nProgramming is something you learn by doing, and this course is a collection of programming exercises for the Haskell language. It starts with basic exercises and it gradually increases in complexity.",

      "description": "Tkinter, Python Gui, tkinter python, python tkinter, gui, Python GUI, desktop application development, desktop application, python gui programming\nHello there,\nWelcome to the \" Tkinter Python & Python GUI with Tkinter desktop application \" course.\nPython Tkinter & Python Gui - Boost your Tkinter Python skills with hands- on python gui programming desktop application.\nTkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit and is Python's de-facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from the Tk interface\nTkinter is the de facto way in Python to Graphical User interfaces (GUIs) and is included in all standard Python Distributions.  Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that's built into the Python standard library. In fact, it's the only framework built into the Python standard library.\nTkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\n\nIn this course, we will learn what is the GUI, and Tkinter and how they work. And also how we create a program with GUI in python. For those who want to use Python not only in AI and Data Science, but also to develop a program using Python.\nAnd in this course, We will open the door of the Python world and try to move deeper. We will learn fundamental things about Python, step by step. Throughout the course, we will do a variety of exercises to reinforce what we have learned.\nCreating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps −\nImport the Tkinter module.\nCreate the GUI application main window.\nAdd one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.\nEnter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.\nThis course has suitable for everybody who is interested in Python.\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization.\nSee why millions of people turn to Oak Academy’s real-world experts to learn Python. Learn at your own pace with hands-on exercises and quizzes. Our courses are frequently updated so you’ll always be working from the latest information. This is the training you’ll need to become a professional Python developer.\nTake one of Oak Academy’s range of Python courses and learn how to code using this incredibly useful language. Its simple syntax and readability make Python perfect for Flask, Django, data science, and machine learning. You’ll learn how to build everything from games to sites to apps. Choose from a range of courses that will appeal to both beginners and advanced developers alike.\nAs you all know or have guessed, Python is the most powerful programming language used in data science and artificial intelligence. Everyone is talking about it. This is said everywhere. Python is for data science.\n- But don't we programmers ever wonder?\n- Can we code an application using Python?\n- How can we use GUI in Python?\n- I wonder if we can quickly prepare a user interface?\nIn this course, we will seek answers to these questions with you. First of all, in our course, we will explain the fundamental topics of Python so that those who are new to Python can understand it. These fundamental topics will include the most powerful and important topics of both Python and software development, such as OOP. Then we will try to develop some programs with GUI using Python with you. While doing this, we will learn how to do GUI design in Python. We will also learn how to make database connections in Python.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nWhat is a Tkinter in Python?\nTkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. Tkinter is not the only GuiProgramming toolkit for Python. It is however the most commonly used one.\n\nWhat is the easiest GUI for Python?\nTkinter is one of the most popular GUI libraries in Python. It is one of the first choices for beginners to GUI development because of its simple and easy-to-learn syntax.\n\n\nIs tkinter easy?\nIf your goal is to learn how to create GUIs, tkinter is arguably one of the best toolkits there is to reach that goal. It's simple and easy to learn and can provide a fantastic introduction to concepts you must master in order to create graphical desktop applications.\n\n\nWhy tkinter is used in Python?\nTkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\n\n\nIs tkinter included in PyCharm?\nThe Tkinter library is built-in with every Python installation, so it's already installed in PyCharm per default. This means that you have to do nothing else but run “ import tkinter ” or “ import tkinter as tk ” in your Python 3 script without installation.\n\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\n\nWhat is GUI programming?\nGraphical User Interface (GUI), a computer program that enables a person to communicate with a computer through the use of symbols, visual metaphors, and pointing devices.\n\n\nWhy Python is used for GUI?\nPython has a huge number of GUI frameworks (or toolkits) available for it, from TkInter (traditionally bundled with Python, using Tk) to a number of other cross-platform solutions, as well as bindings to platform-specific (also known as \"native\") technologies.\n\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popular.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile development.\n\n\nWhat skills or experience should I have before learning Python?\nPython is often taught in college-level classes because it is well-suited to being someone's first programming language. So, while it can be easier to learn Python if you already know Java, JavaScript, or other common languages, it isn't necessary. Before you learn Python, it might be helpful to understand the basics of programming logic, such as \"if/then\" gates, \"while/for\" loops and procedural vs. objective programming. You might also want to understand how applications get built, the difference between frontend and backend programming, and how computers utilize given applications. Udemy has a lot of beginner courses that can help you pick up Python quickly.\n\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\nOur goal is to learn how to write a program using Python at the end of the course. Are you excited? Because I'm excited.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the \"Tkinter Python & Python GUI with Tkinter desktop application\" course!\nPython Tkinter & Python Gui - Boost your Tkinter Python skills with hands- on python gui programming desktop application",

      "description": "Course overview\nUntyped programs are often prone to errors, runtime exceptions, and can make debugging much harder. That’s why many production languages implement a static typechecker — an extra module, which is aimed to increase programs safety and make development simpler.\nType checking or type inference? What is Type theory and Type judgements? Is my language weakly or strongly typed? And how am I actually going to implement a typechecker?\nThere are so many questions when it comes to implementing this module. If you’ve been asking those questions in implementing your programming language, or just want to understand how typeckechers work under the hood, on a hands-on practical implementation, this course is for you.\n---------------------------------------------------------\nOften related books on Type theory and type judgements go to theoretical aspects viewing types as mathematical sets, not explaining how actually to build a practical typechecker. I believe we should be able to build and understand a typechecker for a full programming language, end-to-end, in 2-4 hours — with a content going straight to the point, showed in live coding sessions as pair-programming and described in a comprehensible way.\nIn the Building a Typechecker from scratch class we focus specifically on a static typechecker, and build a similar to TypeScript, Java, etc. We slightly touch Type theory and already since the first lecture go into the practical implementation.\nImplementing a typechecker would also increase your engineering level, as it touches several aspects of data structures and algorithms.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nAn optional prerequisite for this class is the Building an Interpreter from scratch (aka Essentials of Interpretation) course, where we build an AST-interpreter for a full programming language. Unless you already have understanding of how programming languages work at this level, i.e. what eval, a closure, a scope chain, environments, and other constructs are — it is recommended to take the interpreters class as a prerequisite.\n\n\nWho this class is for?\nThis class is for any curious engineer, who would like to gain skills of building complex systems (and building a typechecker for a programming language is an advanced engineering task!), and obtain a transferable knowledge for building such systems.\nIf you are interested specifically in compilers, PL and Type theory, and want to build a typechecker module for your programming language, this class is also for you.\n\n\nWhat is used for implementation?\nSometimes people think that to build a typechecker you certainly need to use some programming language which is itself “very related to types and type theory” (such as OCaml of other functional programming languages). But actually no! You can build a fully working typechecker in plain JavaScript, and cover all the aspects of the Type systems. And this is exactly what we use for implementation.\nJavaScript, being the most popular programming language, should be accessible for many engineers, and also our goal is to provide a simple and concise implementation, not focusing on specifics of a host language. So the code should be portable to any language of your taste and choice: TypeScript, Rust, OCaml, C++, Python, etc.\nNote: we want our students to actually follow, understand and implement every detail of the Typechecker themselves, instead of just copy-pasting from final solution. Even though the full source code for the typechecker is presented in the video lectures, the code repository for the project contains <em>/* Implement here */</em> assignments, which students have to solve.\n\n\nWhat’s specific in this class?\nThe main features of these lectures are:\nConcise and straight to the point. Each lecture is self-sufficient, concise, and describes information directly related to the topic, not distracting on unrelated materials or talks.\nAnimated presentation combined with live-editing notes. This makes understanding of the topics easier, and shows how the object structures are connected. Static slides simply don’t work for a complex content.\nLive coding session end-to-end with assignments. The full source code, starting from scratch, and up to the very end is presented in the video lectures\n\n\nWhat is in the course?\nThe course is divided into four parts, in total of 20 lectures, and many sub-topics in each lecture. Below is the table of contents and curriculum.\nPART 1: TYPE THEORY AND BASIC TYPES\nIn this part we start talking about Type theory, type checking and type inference, and also build the foundation of our typechecker. We establish the basic types, implement variables, talk about Typing Environment, and build a parser.\nPART 2: FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING\nIn this part we focus on different types of functions — user-defined, built-in functions, inner function and closure, recursive function and anonymous lambda expressions.\nPART 3: TYPE DECLARATIONS AND CLASSES\nIn this part we implement constructs aimed to define new types. Topics of type aliases and OOP classes are considered.\nPART 4: GENERIC PROGRAMMING\nIn this part we continue with type declarations, and talk about Union types, and also implement generic functions.",

Java IO has two types of streams namely input streams and output streams. They are programming interfaces to the streams. Two general-purpose classes file input stream and file output stream used to copy a file to file. It also has some classes for the file to represent a file, random access files, Tokenizer. file handling in Java is performed by Java IO API. when a user request to process a read a file, a file system determines where the file lives in the drive then it places them in the memory. While talking about Output stream class there are useful methods of output stream respectively with a hierarchy and similar to this is Input streams java io package has object input and object output respectively. To handle character data sets character streams are used. This course covers Java platforms class used for I/O operations and mapped with machine level.\nYou will be able to perform some input/output operations in Java applications. good familiarity in designing user interfaces and collections of learners learn how to write code for Java applications.

Duplicated code blocks and copy - paste code methods can take a place in projects. Some codes might be written at first to show demos and same codes could be the base of your framework. Finally development can be harder than you start. Dreams can be finished at the beginning of you project.\nLet's learn some methods to develop new strategies. Desing Patterns can help you to solve a problem. You can create an algoritm to break the lock. We will talk about what are the design patters and why we should use them, then how can we implement a pattern into your complicated codes. Think about that all developers are speaking same language and you have a flexible arcthiecture which is written by SOLID principles.\n\nEvery new design pattern willgive you another window to look out and every window will open a new vision. I hope this course will be your first step for new visions.\nAre you getting excited when you think your project maintenance? Then think about the cool ways and solve your problems in known options. We will keep in touch during your course time.\nAt the end of module you can download the course code files. And there is a surprise for you. We will develop an application framework using Design Patterns. At that last section you will see how to start up a project and what you need at first.

This introductory course will provide you with a solid foundation to begin automating content management workflows and tasks with ArcGIS Online (or Portal). We will only use the ArcGIS API for Python throughout the course, and the standard Python library modules json, csv, and datetime where required. You can sign up for a free 21-day trial of ArcGIS Online/ArcGIS Pro that includes 2 Creator and 3 viewer licenses along with 400 in credits, which is well beyond the minor credit usage this course will use (approx 0.6 storage credit per day).\nAutomation is a hot topic for the Esri ArcGIS suite of software. Automating workflows in ArcGIS can significantly improve workflow efficiencies to witness time and cost saving. Knowledge of the ArcGIS API for Python will enhance your career prospects. Although this course focuses on Content Management as the main topic, it can also be considered as an introduction to the ArcGIS API for Python.\nWe will begin the journey with an overview of the components of the API used throughout the course and how to use the GIS class as the entry to your organizations ArcGIS Online via the API, before diving into code and scripts.\nOur GIS needs some data! We will accomplish adding a set of Shapefiles and a CSV file as Content Items and publish these as Hosted Feature Services and a Hosted Table.\nFolders are a great way to organize your content per user. We will create a couple of Folders and move created content into them. We will look at a selection of functions available via the ContentManager module to create, rename, and delete folders amongst other actions.\nWhile folders are a great way to organize content per user, Groups can be used to organize and control access to data and provide security of the data across the Organization by granting access to specified users to view and interact with the content assigned to the Group. We will create a Group and look at accessing and updating the Group properties along with adding and removing content from a Group. We will take a look at a handful of methods available with a Group object such as adding/removing users, and prevent a Group from being delete.\nArcGIS Online content items have properties that assign descriptive meaning along with control configurations for that item. We will take a look at the properties for a Hosted Feature Service and Table, and show how to update certain properties with the API, and we will see how these updated are reflected in ArcGIS Online.\nWe will have a look at properties for a Feature Layer Collection object which represents the Feature Service. A Feature Service has settings and capabilities and we will see how we can manipulate these with the API. We can use the ArcGIS API for Python to set, turn on, and turn off various settings and capabilities such as editing and enabling editor tracking, and allowing users to extract the data in various file formats.\nContinuing with accessing and updating properties, we will take a look at the properties associated with a Feature Layer and a Table Layer and how we can update the properties for these two. We will look at how to enable attachments for both.\nThroughout the course we use a content items id to access the various item types. We will show the search capabilities associated with the ArcGIS API for Python and how we can search for content within the Organization and within and individual Group.\nWe will finish up with a some ContentManager methods that were unused through the course but are important to know, and also provide practical, real-life, examples of using the ArcGIS API for Python for Content Management.\nNewly added material - The RecycleBin, SharingManager, SharingGroupManager and more!\n\n\nYour course instructor, Glen Bambrick, has over 17 years' experience with GIS and geospatial data, and has implemented standardized workflows utilizing the ArcGIS API for Python to great affect. In this course he will introduce you to the ArcGIS for Python API and take you through some common tasks with a focus on Content Management.\n\n\nBy the end of this course... you will be fully armed with the capability to start using the ArcGIS for Python API with your own workflows for Content Management. This course will spark your imagination to what can be achieved and give you a solid footing to begin making the ArcGIS for Python API a part of your daily endeavors for automating those repetitive tasks relating to ArcGIS Online. You will be able to add and create content, Folders, and Groups, and alter the properties and settings associated with each. You will be able to access and manipulate the JSON behind the scenes for Feature Services, Feature Layers and Tables.",

      "description": "Hello,\nWelcome to the \"Typescript |  Type script & Angular 13 Bootcamp from Scratch\" course.\nTypescript course helps you understand Typescript in detail with hands-on Typescript & React Typescript projects\nTypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It introduces additional features like strict type binding (variables are bound to specific data types) to JavaScript and can also be compiled down to Java Script as well. TypeScript, Typescript, Type script, typescript react, react typescript, typescript project, type script, type script tutorial, angular typescript, web development angular, full stack web development, angular advanced,\n\n\nTypeScript is a programming language that helps developers turn medium-sized JavaScript projects and prototypes into large-scale ones. JavaScript, a widely-used programming language, was designed to be easy to use for developers and non-developers alike. As a result, JavaScript development is difficult to scale up. Microsoft introduced TypeScript to solve this scalability problem. TypeScript is often referred to as JavaScript with type because it allows developers to find errors while writing their code rather than wait until the application is running. And because TypeScript is a syntactical superset of JavaScript, any JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program.\nTypeScript is a superset of typed JavaScript (optional) that can help build and manage large-scale JavaScript projects. It can be considered JavaScript with additional features like strong static typing, compilation, and object-oriented programming.\nAngular is a popular web development tool that increases your advantage as a developer. Angular training introduces beginners to key concepts and improves existing proficiency for those already familiar with the platform. Begin learning Angular today, and grow your developer expertise with this powerful platform.\nAngular is a powerful platform that allows you to build web applications. It includes a component based framework for making applications scalable and a library collection with a wide range of development features. A suite of developer tools gives you the ability to manage your application at every stage of development, from conception to testing. Udemy offers a range of Angular courses to teach the basics or enhance your skill level.\nAngular is a TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.\nTypeScript is broadly used by developers in Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and many more. Apart from these giants, many start-ups are working on TypeScript. TypeScript is having many technical features, some of them are as follows…\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming: TypeScript provides all features of Object-Oriented Programming where you can form objects because TypeScript provides inbuilt support for classes, interfaces, and many more features of OOP. It helps in designing and implementing them with clean and scalable code. This feature of TypeScript separates it from others and it makes the code more readable which helps to easily maintain and alter code.\n\nJavaScript Library: Typescript supports all the JavaScript libraries and you can change your existing JavaScript project into TypeScript by just changing the extension of the file .js to .ts. You can work with Typescript along with React, Vue, and Angular. Typescript is a superset of JavaScript i.e. Typescript includes ES5 version of JavaScript and ES6 version of JavaScript along with interfaces, generics, classes, and many more features.\n\nStatic Typing: Typescript takes the robust code at another level to write scripts which helps in writing and maintaining larger codes especially in the case of scripting which helps in analysis of code. You don’t have to wait till the runtime to find bugs in your code which reduces complications of designing. It promotes dependable refactoring and makes it faster.\n\nDependency Injection: Typescript allows you to create objects outside the class and provide those objects to a class in many different ways. Typescript helps in the creation and binding of the dependent objects outside of the class that need them. This helps a lot in testing.\n\nOther Features: Typescript compiles the code into the version of JavaScript which helps the code to run on all browsers. TypeScript also has Intellisense which is really helpful in giving hints for code. It supports encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and other OOP features. Typescript code is more readable, clean, and scalable. Typescript is a strongly typed language that supports prototypes, dynamic types, and constructor functions. Also, it helps in changing the document using API. The module is another amazing feature of Typescript just like namespaces.\nThis course is for beginners. To be able to take this course, all you need is the basic understanding of JavaScript.\nIn this course, we're going to start with the basics and I'm going to show you how fun it is to build Type Script programs. After you're familiar with the syntax, we're going to move on to more advanced Type script development techniques, such as: working with closures, object-oriented programming, real-time asynchronous development, and decorators.\nYou'll also learn that you're not limited to Angular 2+ or plain JavaScript/ Typescript Projects. A complete Module covers how to use TypeScript with ReactJS to benefit from its Features, there, too.\n\nThis is a beginner-level TypeScript tutorial, however, a knowledge of JavaScript will be very helpful. If you have no exposure to Javascript you should consider taking one of Oak Academy Java Script courses, either before or after this course.\nI tried to tell all complex topics in very detail on the course. I used some diagrams to tell some important topics and created applications.\n\nWhat is Typescript?\nTypeScript is a programming language that helps developers turn medium-sized JavaScript projects and prototypes into large-scale ones. JavaScript, a widely-used programming language, was designed to be easy to use for developers and non-developers alike. As a result, JavaScript development is difficult to scale up. Microsoft introduced typescript react to solve this scalability problem. TypeScript is often referred to as JavaScript with typescript react because it allows developers to find errors while writing their code rather than wait until the application is running. And because TypeScript  is a syntactical superset of JavaScript, any JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program.\n\nWhat is the difference Typescript and Javascript?\nTypescript is a superset of JavaScript. As its name suggests, Type script adds optional static typing to the JavaScript language. JavaScript is a scripting language that allows developers to create dynamic web content. It is known for being fairly easy to use and learn. This makes it a popular programming language for small and medium-scale web projects. Developers use Type script when they need to scale up their JavaScript development. Its language is more powerful and intuitive, allowing developers to find and correct errors during compile time, rather than only during run-time, as with JavaScript. TypeScript is better suited than JavaScript for large applications, but it requires a foundational knowledge of JavaScript to use.\n\n\nWhat is Angular and what are its benefits?\nAngular is an open-source, client-side framework for building single-page websites and desktop and mobile applications. It is a full-featured JavaScript application built on TypeScript, which operates across platforms and keeps code clean and consistent throughout the codebase. Angular is an all-in-one rapid application development platform that allows web pages to render efficiently by minimizing communication with servers. The Angular framework offers end-to-end tooling or routing, state management, and form validation, as well as dependency injection and declarative templates. Angular offers out-of-the-box functionality and easy updating, along with an extensive collection of pre-made components. The TypeScript base includes high-quality code that reduces the burden of debugging and allows multiple developers to collaborate across platforms with minimal disruption and less coding.\n\nWhy Angular is used for frontend?\nAngular is an open-source frontend framework. It is a JavaScript-based TypeScript development language that eliminates unneeded features and code to ensure lighter and faster applications.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Angular and React?\nAngular and React are both rapid application development (RAD) platforms based on JavaScript. Angular is a multilayered framework that runs on Typescript and is compatible with many different code editors. It is a full-featured web development platform that requires no additional libraries. This means Angular can independently carry out a full range of development functions such as data binding, form validation, and dependency injection. First introduced in 2013, React is a JavaScript library managed by Facebook, and it works for both single- and multi-page web applications. React is a framework for UI development that’s smaller and faster than Angular. However, it requires other libraries or modules to provide the full range of Angular’s functions. React is easy to install and use for anyone who already knows JavaScript, and because it operates with a virtual DOM, the browser load reduces. Angular operates with a real DOM, which leads to longer runtimes and slower performance.\n\n\nWhy Angular is so popular?\nAngular is the platform that makes it easy to develop robust web applications. It unites the declarative templates, dependency injection, the end to end tooling and integrated the top perform to resolve the development challenges of developers.\n\nWhat careers use Typescript?\nTypeScript is mainly associated with development careers. Typical job titles for TypeScript developers include senior developer, front end developer, stack developer, and software engineer. Because react typescript and typescript node is a superset of JavaScript, learning react typescript is a great next step for engineers who are already skilled in JavaScript. Programming knowledge is applicable in just about every industry, so developers with an understanding of TypeScript (which implies skill in JavaScript) might work in a wide range of fields building applications for both server-side and client-side execution.\n\n\nIs TypeScript a language or framework?\nTypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.\n\n\nWhich is better JavaScript or TypeScript?\nJavaScript is better suited for small-scale applications, while TypeScript is better for larger applications. TypeScript supports static typing but JavaScript does not. TypeScript supports interfaces but JavaScript does not. TypeScript features prototyping but JavaScript does not.\n\n\nWhy should I learn TypeScript?\nIt supports encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and other OOP features. Typescript code is more readable, clean, and scalable. Typescript is a strongly typed language that supports prototypes, dynamic types, and constructor functions. Also, it helps in changing the document using API.\nDo I need to learn TypeScript for angular?\nYou can write Angular applications in either TypeScript, ES6 or even ES5 JavaScript. However Angular itself is written in TypeScript, most examples on the web are written in TypeScript, most Angular jobs require you to write TypeScript so this book will be teaching in TypeScript.\n\nWhat careers use Angular?\nAngular is one of the most popular web development platforms in use today. Skills in using Angular can be helpful for several careers in fields related to web design and development. Angular skills are most important for careers in practical web development, including specialties like frontend development, which involves designing client-facing web elements such as visual content, UI and UX development, and general software development. Software engineers and site designers can also benefit from learning Angular. It is a JavaScript application, so it’s also useful for JavaScript developers. It’s also possible to create a career around a specialization in Angular development alone. Angular development specialists can work as consultants or independent contractors with multiple organizations needing web development services.\n\n\nWhat IDE is best for Angular?\nAn integrated development environment, or IDE, is a software application that consolidates essential web developer tools in a single graphical interface, which streamlines the development process and promotes consistency across all relevant platforms. Many IDEs now support Angular development projects, and there’s an option for every budget. The best paid IDE for Angular is Angular IDE. It was developed especially for the platform, so it supports all its features. Angular IDE is available as a standalone plugin or with an Eclipse plugin. New users can get a 45-day free trial before purchasing. Visual Studio Code is a general-purpose IDE that supports multiple development platforms, including Angular. This free, open-source IDE from Microsoft includes support for TypeScript code and several downloadable Angular plugins.\n\nWhat is TypeScript and why use it?\nTypeScript features, syntax, and keywords in nodejs typescript\nTooling and Framework Options\nHow to create a class\nTypeScript variables and functions in angular typescript\nTypeScript declarations\nTypeScript classes and interfaces\nMuch more...\n\n\nIn this course you will learn;\nTypes and how to use them\nHow the TypeScript Compiler works\nES6 Features in TypeScript\nClasses in TypeScript\nInterfaces\nunderstanding typescript\nCreate single-page applications with one of the most modern frameworks\nUse the gained, deep understanding of the Angular fundamentals to quickly establish yourself as a frontend developer\nDevelop a Full Stack application with Angular front-end\nIntroduction to Angular testing utilities\nTesting of complex Angular services\nWhich architecture Angular uses\nHow databinding works\nWhat Pipes are and how to use them\nWhat dependency injection is and how to use it\nProvide appropriate endpoints on your Backend, for your Frontend to consume\nAngular beginner to advanced\nTypescript\nHTTP\nFull stack web development with angular\nAngular full course\nAngular 10\nAngular 2\nAngular beginner\nAngular Advanced\nAngularJS\nIn this TypeScript & Angular tutorial, you will learn the key concepts and features to get started building applications with TypeScript & Angular.

We will also cover the net/http and context packages packages to build resilient networked applications like HTTP servers and clients. We’ll learn how to take in and serve up JSON for our REST APIs using the encoding/json package. Testing is a first class citizen in Go and we’ll learn how to take full advantage of it using the testing package. Lastly, no Go course would be complete without getting into what draws many to Go in the first place, it’s concurrency primitives and patterns.\nAbout the Author\nJohnny Boursiquot is a multi-disciplined Software and Cloud Systems Engineer with two decades of industry experience spanning various server, client, and mobile technologies.

But before everything, the introduction of python is discussed. Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages and if we specifically look from the perspective of things going on in this era, there is no other choice then “python” as a programming language.\nFirst of all, this is an introductory session on python for those who are not very good with python and then there is an exercise for python that is supposed to be solved by you but if you feel any difficulty in solving the exercise, the solution is also provided.\nThen we moved on towards the advanced concepts of Python and we start from OOP, Data Structures, File Handling, and leading towards the end, where there is a complete project of Scrapy that we’ll do together.\nDuring all of these lectures, we’ll be learning a few classical and a few advanced python problems. Some of them will be implemented from scratch and the others will be implemented by using the builtin libraries of python. At the end of every main topic and concept, there will be a practice task or mini-project.\nAbout the Instructor:\nThe instructor for this course is Muhammad Ahmad. He has a master’s degree in Computer Science with over 5 years' experience of working in industry and 4 years of teaching experience.
