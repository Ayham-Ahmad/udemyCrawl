Instead, we focus on understanding how and whywebsites become vulnerable by examining them from the ground up.\nAlthough this is the Theory Edition, you’ll still interact with code to build your own web pages—the kinds of sites that attackers typically target. Through this process, you’ll gain insight into how modern web applications are structured and where security flaws can hide.\nWe’ll use Burp Suite and Chrome Developer Tools to observe real-time web traffic, inspect request/response behaviors, and simulate basic interception techniques. These tools will help you understand how the browser communicates with a server, and how attackers might manipulate that process.\nRather than launching attacks, you'll learn to think like a hacker by debugging the web from both the inside and outside. Guided by a real-world white-hat hacker with multiple CVEs, each lesson emphasizes security awareness through hands-on observation and logical reasoning.\nBy the end, you’ll confidently identify potential weaknesses and better understand the fundamental principles of web security—no prior coding experience needed.\n\n\nLet’s dive in and explore the world of web hacking—one step at a time.",

      "description": "In this course, you will learn the basic concepts of Helm, what is it used for and, most importantly, why you might need.\nThis course assumes you already know what Kubernetes is, as well some of it’s primary resource types, like Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps and Secrets. If you’ve never used Kubernetes before, you will hardly benefit from this lightning course.\nHelm is a package manager for Kubernetes. This description, taken from the Helm website, doesn’t really say much. Let’s look at this from the different angle.\nWhen you deploy an application to Kubernetes, you end up with lots of YAML files - you need a YAML file for the Deployment, for the Service, for some ConfigMaps and so on, for every object that your application needs. Of. course, you could also have all of those in a single big YAML file, but that’s not the point here.\nMany of those objects depend on each other in some way or another - Service finds Pods by labels, and those labels should be the same ones configured in your Deployment’s pod template. Deployment also needs to mount correct ConfigMap, and same goes for PersistentVolumes.\nQuite naturally, you want to configure many, if not all, of those objects depending on the environment - staging Deployment might have different number of replicas, and production Secret for sure will have a different database password.\nIn addition, you also need a simple way to rollback to a previous version, and maybe execute some hooks before and after different stages of the rollout - for example, you might need to run database migrations before deploying the new release.\nHelm is the tool that solves those and few other problems. It allows you to properly template your object definitions, it gives you a set of commands to manage the releases of your application and it provides some extra advanced utilities, like aforementioned hooks.\nWhile definitely not the only tool that solves all or some of those problems, Helm became more or less a standard for packaging Kubernetes object definitions. As a result, almost every software you want to install has an existing Helm package - called chart - that simplifies both installation and updates of this software.\nThis is why Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes - not only due to its features, but also because of how widespread it is. In this course, we will learn how to use it.",

An increasing number of positions require this certification as a foundational cybersecurity skill. ISO/ANSI-accredited, it is the most widely adopted certification on the market, covering in-demand skills related to current threats, automation, Zero Trust, IoT, and more. The CompTIA Security+ exam certifies that professionals possess the skills needed to recommend and implement security solutions.\n\n\nEvaluate the security posture of an enterprise environment and recommend and implement appropriate security solutions.\nMonitor and secure hybrid environments, including cloud, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), and operational technologies.\nOperate with an understanding of applicable regulations and policies, including governance, risk, and compliance principles.\nIdentify, analyze, and respond to security events and incidents.\nThis practical Security+ certification course is not only essential for passing the exam but also equips you with crucial skills to stand out in the job market, where demand for cybersecurity professionals is steadily growing.\n\n\nNow is the perfect time to get started!\n\n\nThe HTP Cyber practice exam is designed to help you master the knowledge needed to succeed in your certification while developing your skills. It includes 90 questions in various formats (multiple choice, matching, scenarios, etc.) and immerses you in real SY0-701 exam conditions. The exam duration is 90 minutes, allowing an average of one minute per question. A passing score is 750 out of 900 or higher.\nThe objectives and associated weightings match those of the CompTIA certification:\n1.0 General Security Concepts (12%)\n2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations (22%)\n3.0 Security Architecture (18%)\n4.0 Security Operations (28%)\n5.0 Security Program Management and Oversight (20%)\nThis course is not just a practice exam but also a comprehensive guide to support your studies.\nYou will find an explanation for each answer, as well as a general explanation section that delves deeper into all concepts covered in domains 1 through 5. Additionally, quality external links are provided to help you further explore topics you may need to strengthen.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: I recommend taking the exam in Training Mode first. Take your time to answer each question, and review each one carefully before moving on to the next. In the \"Global Explanation\" section, you will find detailed information about each domain. Take the time to read each explanation thoroughly to absorb the content and understand your mistakes.\nThis approach will help you succeed in your exam! Once you feel confident with the material, you can retake the practice test in Exam Mode, in a more formal setting, to evaluate if you’re ready to take the Security+ certification.\n\n\nNOTE: If English is not your first language, I have also made a French version.\n\nSee you once it’s completed!\nGood luck!",

      "description": "Kubernetes as the orchestration platform for not only Docker containers is gaining more momentum everyday especially in DevOps like world. Besides other main orchestration systems Kubernetes can be considered as one of the most popular one. All big cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure have already more or less adopted Kubernetes as a part of their portfolio and services. Kubernetes and Docker containers altogether create an ideal ecosystem for deploying micro services - which seems to be the model for next generation applications.\n\nWhen thinking about containers and horizontally scalable applications we might be taking into account also some other other software such as Terraform which helps us tremendously to keep our infrastructure (independent of cloud provider) in immutable state. There are some officially supported tools like \"kops\" which hand in hand  with Terraform makes the Kuberentes deployment to AWS extraordinary easy and comprehensive and makes DevOps  people lives super easy.\n\nThe main goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive explanation to the people who are truly willing to deep dive in Kubernetes and Docker world and perhaps aspiring for DevOps carrier. In order to achieve this goal I have decided to use NGINX web server examples throughout this course - just because year back I was amazed by value which is delivered by web server itself. Imagine that every business in the world is serving their content via some kind of this powerful piece of software. Nowadays, we can take an advantage of deploying and scaling of docerized mainly Open Source web servers to Kubernetes at any cloud provider you can think of.\n\nI hope you guys are going to enjoy this course and I am certain that anybody is more than good enough to complete this course.

We’ll then start building out our home lab using VirtualBox and Elastic’s security offering. Then we’ll run through three different attack scenarios, each more complex than the one prior. We’ll make detections off of our attacks, and learn how to document our detections. Next we’ll dive more into coding and Python by writing validation scripts and learning out to interact with Elastic through their API. Wrapping everything up, we’ll host all our detections on GitHub and sync with Elastic through our own GitHub Action automations. As a cherry on top, we’ll have a final section on how to write scripts to gather important metrics and visualizations.\"",

This course will also show you to set up my proprietary distribution (WAED) which is loaded with vulnerable web applications. This distribution has around 18 vulnerable applications, and you'll have ample opportunity to learn how to identify web application security issues. This course will get you set up, and my next course will go into details of Web Application pentesting principles. This course should take less than an hour to complete, and once you complete you should already see the power of using these tools whether you're a developer, pentester or a QA analyst.\nWeb application pentesting is a lucrative field. You can earn anywhere from $100,000 to $120,000 depending upon your skill sets.\nWhy is Web Application Security very important and Why you should get started?\nGiven the large amount of financial and other sensitive information that is transmitted over the internet all over the world, it would be a very obvious choice for cyber hackers to focus their efforts. In addition to the increased amount of traffic, the proliferation of insecure web applications also makes web-based hacking attacks even more profitable and attractive.\nBreaking into systems is not something new. Since the early 80s skilled hackers and other computer enthusiasts, have used their broad computer knowledge to break into systems with no benefiting intention. However, with the introduction of web applications, the sophistication of hacking activities has greatly increased. Web applications allow visitors access to the most crucial and sensitive information of a website, database server or web server. Developers of these applications dedicate a lot of time on functionality and features but allocate very little time on security. The amount of skills required to carry out such hacking attacks has greatly lessened. Fortunately, there are some ways by which developers can prevent web application hacking.\nAll web applications vulnerabilities, how hackers exploit them and how to stop and prevent them are covered in the OWASP top ten.\nThe OWASP Top 10:\nThe OWASP (open web application security project) is an international organization that is committed to enhancing the security of web applications. OWASP sponsors numerous security related projects including the top 10 project. This project regularly publishes a list of the current top ten web applications security risks (vulnerabilities) worldwide. It provides a detailed report of each vulnerability, gives examples and provides suggestions on how to avoid the risk. The following are its current vulnerabilities and suggestions on how to avoid them.\n1. Injection flaws\nThese flaws occur when a web application sends untrusted data to an interpreter as part of a query or a command. These flaws are often found in LDAP, SQL, NoSQL or Xpath queries, OS commands, SMTP headers, program arguments, XML parsers, etc.\nThe best way to find out whether your applications are vulnerable to injection flaws is to verify that the use of interpreters is clearly separating untrusted data from the query or command. This involves the use of bind variables in stored procedures and prepared statements and by avoiding dynamic queries altogether. Code analysis tools can assist you trace all data flow through the web application.\nPreventing injection flows involves keeping all untrusted data separate from queries and commands by:\n- Using a safe API that avoids the use of an interpreter\n- Escaping the use of escape-special characters using specific-escape syntax for the interpreter\n- Positive (“white list”) input validation.\n2. Broken authentication as well as session management\nThis occurs when application functions that are related to session management and authentication are not implemented correctly. This allows attackers to compromise usernames, passwords, keys and session tokens.\nYou may be vulnerable to these flaws if your authentication credentials are not properly protected using encryption or hashing, if the credentials can be guessed or if session IDs are exposed in your URL.\nPrevent these flaws by:\n- Meeting all session management and authentication requirements as defined in the OWASP security verification standards\n- Making strong efforts to avoid XSS flaws that can be used by hackers to access session IDs\n3. Cross site scripting (XSS)\nThey occur anytime a web application sends untrusted data to a web browser without escaping or proper validation.\nYou are vulnerable to these flaws if you don’t ensure all user supplied data and input is escaped, or if you don’t verify the input to be safe through input validation. You can use automated tools to find XSS flaws automatically.\nPrevent these flaws by:\n- Escape all untrusted data that is based on HTML context (attribute, body, CSS, URL or JavaScript) that your data will be placed into\n- Positive input validation is also an option although it is not a complete defense\n- Consider auto sanitization libraries such as java-HTML sanitizer project for rich content\n4. Insecure direct objects references\nThey occur when a web developer exposes a reference to any internal implementation object, such as a directory, file or a database key.\nThe best way to find whether your apps are vulnerable is to verify that all object references have the right defenses. Testing through automated tools may be effective for identifying these flaws.\nProtect against the flaw by:\n- Using per session or user indirect object references to prevent attackers from targeting unauthorized resources directly.\n- Through check access\n5. Security mis-configurations\nGood application security requires having a secure configuration that is deployed and defined by the application, application server, database server, platform and frameworks.\nAutomated scanners are very useful for the detection of misconfigurations, missing patches, unnecessary services, use of default account, etc.\nProtect against the flaws by establishing the following:\n- A repeatable process for following and deploying all software updates in a timely manner to a deployed environment\n- An application architecture that is strong enough to provide an effective and secure separation between components\n6. Sensitive data exposure\nMany applications do not put into place measures to protect sensitive data including tax IDs, credit cards and authentication credentials. The most common vulnerability here is failing to encrypt all sensitive data. Encrypting data doesn’t mean that it is free from weaknesses; it simply means that it is very hard for attackers to exploit such weaknesses, especially on a large scale.\nDetermine all the sensitive data that require extra protection and act accordingly. Ensure you encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest. It is also important to avoid storing such data unnecessarily.\n7. Missing function-level access control\nDevelopers must include proper code checks to properly protect applications functions, but they sometimes forget. An attacker is therefore able to access privileged functions by simply changing a parameter to the function or through changing the URL.\nThese flaws allow an attacker to access administrative functions and other unauthorized functionalities. If such vulnerability becomes public, your reputation will be greatly damaged.\nIt is important to deny all access by default in order to prevent this flaw from occurring.\n8. Cross site request forgery\nThis attack forces a logged on victim’s browser to send forged HTTP requests to fake web pages. This may include the user’s session cookie and other authentication information. Browsers usually send credentials such as session cookies automatically. Attackers create malicious web pages that are capable of generating forged requests that cannot be distinguished from legitimate ones. They then trick users into submitting requests through XSS, image tags and other numerous techniques. If the user gets authenticated, the attack effectively succeeds.\nYou can prevent cross site forgery through including a unique token that is unpredictable in each HTTP request. Maximize the effectiveness of these tokens through:\n- Including the unique token in a hidden field. This is the best option as it causes values to be sent in the HTTP request’s body hence preventing it from being included in the URL.\n- Including the unique token in an URL parameter or in the URL itself. However, this method is slightly risky as the URL is at a risk of being exposed to the hacker, thereby compromising the secret unique token. Fortunately, the CSRF Guard from OWASP can automatically include unique tokens in Java, PHP or EE apps. ESAPI from OWASP has some methods that developers can use to prevent cross site request forgery vulnerability.\n- Requiring users to re-authenticate or convincingly prove they are real users, for instance through the use of CAPTCHA.\n9. Using components that have known vulnerabilities\nHackers identify weak components in an application through manual analysis or automated scanning. All applications have some flaws because developers don’t dedicate enough time in ensuring that all libraries/components are up to date.\nThe only clear way of preventing this flaw is through avoiding the use of any application that you didn’t write. Unfortunately, this is not very realistic. It is therefore important that you strictly monitor the security of all components of your applications through public databases, security and project mailing lists. Ensure all components are kept up to date.\nYou can also consider establishing security policies and rules governing the use of components, such as requiring all users to pass security tests, insisting on licenses and putting into place certain software development practices.\n10. Invalidated redirects and forwards\nThis occur when a web application redirects and forwards users to other invalidated websites and pages. Hackers target unsafe forwards and redirects to bypass security checks. Such redirects may install malware or even trick users into disclosing sensitive credentials such as passwords; To find out whether your application has an invalidated forward or redirect, review the codes for all uses of forwards and redirects. In each case, find out whether the target URL is included in a parameter value. If the target URL is not validated on a whitelist, then your application is vulnerable.\nTo protect your applications against this flaw:\n- Avoid using forwards and redirects\n- If you use them, do not use users parameters in calculating destination\n- If you cannot avoid destination parameters, ensure that all stipulated values are valid and authorized for the user\n- Consider using ESAPI that can override the Send Redirect method to ensure all redirect destinations are safe and valid.\nAttackers have taken advantage of the increase in number of active web applications to create automated tools that they can use to launch well-coordinated attacks against multiple vulnerable applications at once. Armed with these tools and a little knowledge on hacking, the targets of these hackers are not limited to large corporate web applications and websites.\nThe repercussions of having your applications compromised can be very devastating. Sensitive data may get stolen, user accounts might get compromised, your brand reputation will be damaged, your clients may lose confidence in you and you may end up losing sales revenue. There is therefore a need to eliminate all possible threats that exist on each web application. Avoiding the above ten discussed flaws is of uttermost importance as they are the favorite target for cyber criminals trying to gain users’ trust and confidence. Strictly follow the tips and leave nothing to chance as hackers are eagerly waiting for you to make just one single mistake.",

      "description": "For those who have had no prior training or understanding in hacking or cybersecurity, this hands-on, practical course was designed just for them, with a focus on practical skills and hands-on experience. In this course, you will learn not only what black-hat hatters do and how they do it, but you will also learn how to hack systems like a pro and win the cat and mouse game by protecting systems like a professional security expert, which is the ultimate goal.\n\n\nUsing a combination of hands-on experience and excellent theoretical instruction, we teach you from the fundamentals of ethical hacking all the way up to mastery, providing you with the skills you need not just to hack, but also to protect yourself from being hacked.\n\n\nWhile we recognize that theory is vital, we also recognize that it may be boring and uninspired at times. In order to facilitate learning, this course is filled with real-world examples that you can use. This hands-on approach begins at the beginning, when we will teach you about penetration testing and demonstrate how to install the necessary tools (for Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX) before diving right into hacking.\n\n\nThroughout the course, you will evaluate and attack a variety of systems, ranging from simple websites to complex networks, as well as hacking servers and client computers. You'll study more than just hacking tactics; you'll also learn how to perform effective penetration testing procedures.\n\n\nThis method provides you with the basic understanding that you need not only to hack any given system, but also to secure it, with each module covering both sides of the coin as part of the learning process. The course is divided into six major sections:\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST STEP IS TO LEARN THE ESSENTIALS OF BECOMING A HACKER.\n\n\nA thorough introduction to the fundamentals of networking systems, including how they communicate and function, is provided in this part, which is intended to equip you with the information and skills necessary to succeed in this course.\n\n\nTHE ESSENTIALS OF NETWORKING: Networking might seem like a daunting subject, so don't be intimidated! We break down only the most critical aspects of networking that you need to know and teach you the foundations of networking that you need to be successful.\n\n\nESTABLISHING A HACKING LABORATORY: You can't hack unless you have a lab! Setting up your own hacking lab on your laptop or desktop computer is easy when you follow our step-by-step instructions!\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF LINUX + SCRIPTING: Hackers utilize Linux, which is an operating system that the typical person may not be familiar with. We will go through the fundamentals of Linux so that you will be able to find your way around the operating system during this course. We also cover a few of scripting languages that are absolutely necessary for every ethical hacker, and we teach you the fundamentals of each one through hands-on practice.\n\n\nHIDING YOUR IDENTITY ON THE INTERNET: If you plan on hacking into someone's computer through the internet, you'll want to understand how to remain anonymous. We will demonstrate the tools and tactics that you may employ to ensure that you stay anonymous and untraceable on the internet at all times.\n\n\n\n\n2: BECOME FAMILIAR WITH NETWORK HACKING.\n\n\nThis section explains how to test both wired and wireless systems in the same manner. During this course, you will learn how to move from not having any internet connectivity at all to having access and being able to launch attacks against other computers on the network.\n\n\nAssaults that take place before the target is connected, or even before the victim knows the password, are called pre-connection attacks. Learn how to identify and modify devices that are linked to a network, as well as how to obtain information about your intended target.\n\n\nADVANCED: Learn how to leverage the knowledge you already have about your target to break the key and obtain the access password for a network. This section contains information on a variety of protocols, including WEP, WPA, and WPA2.\n\n\nPOST-CONNECTION ATTACKS: With the use of a key, you may now take use of strong hacking techniques to obtain even more details. Learn how to monitor what people are doing on a network, insert code into web pages, and more on wired and wireless networks in this course.\n\n\n\n\nTHREE: HOW TO OBTAIN ACCESS AND CONNECT WITH NETWORKS\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to build on the knowledge you gained in Section One, by learning how to get complete control over and hack into any computer system you want.\n\n\nSERVER-SIDE ATTACK: Learn how to gather information about your targeted system – including its operating system, open ports, and installed services – without requiring the user to participate. Then, using this knowledge, you may attack vulnerabilities and produce reports for your organization.\n\n\nCLIENT-SIDE ATTACK: Learn how to hack systems that do not have any vulnerabilities by slipping into them with software updates or by downloading backdoor trojans from the internet. You'll also study the skill of social engineering, which is the practice of manipulating individuals into providing you with information.\n\n\n\n\n4: HOW TO USE POST EXPLOITATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE\n\n\nAs the title suggests, this part turns the emphasis to interfacing with compromised systems. Now that you have gotten access, you will learn how to take use of the systems you have discovered.\n\n\nACCESS FILE SYSTEMS: All systems include a plethora of files, all of which you may now change using your access privileges. Learn how to gain access to these systems, as well as how to read, write, upload, and even run files on them.\n\n\nMAINTAIN ACCESS: Obtaining access to a system and its data is just half of the battle. The other half is maintaining access. Learn how to keep your access secure and to resist attempts to re-secure it so that you can continue to abuse a computer system.\n\n\nLEARN TO SPY ON YOUR TARGET: Discover how to record any keystrokes on a computer keyboard, activate a computer webcam, take screenshots, and even take complete control of the system in order to attack, hack, and get access to third-party networks and systems.\n\n\n\n\nThe fifth step is to learn how to hack websites and web applications.\n\n\nIf you read the previous part, you will have a better understanding of how to hack into websites and web apps using Kali Linux. Also covered will be the operation of web-based apps as well as how to identify and exploit security flaws that may exist inside them.\n\n\nLearn how to scan websites/web apps for vulnerabilities that may be used to your advantage.\n\n\nHow to Infiltrate Web Applications Using Brute Force\n\n\nWhen it comes to online apps, SQL injection is a must.\n\n\nHow to carry out Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks (CSRF)\n\n\nExploiting File Inclusion Vulnerabilities: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\n\nExploiting File Upload Vulnerabilities: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\n\nHow to automate the assault on online apps by utilizing a number of different techniques\n\n\nHow to prevent and secure websites and mobile applications on your own.\n\n\n\n\n6: HOW TO MAKE MONEY AS A HACKER, LAND A JOB, AND BUILD A BRAND IN THE INDUSTRY\n\n\nIn this part, you will learn how to generate money as an ethical hacker by employing a range of different strategies and techniques. You'll also learn how to establish your own brand and get your name out there as an Ethical Hacker so that employers and clients will come knocking on your door, eager to hire you for your services after you finish the course. Finally, you'll discover how to get started in a career in cybersecurity, including some insider suggestions on which certifications to pursue and how to acquire a position in this field of expertise.\n\n\nThis includes the following:\n\n\nHow to create your own personal brand as an ethical hacker from the ground up\n\n\nLearn how to instantly establish trust and authority as a hacker.\n\n\nTips on how to effectively network and get people to talk about you\n\n\nLearn how to generate money online by utilizing a number of websites.\n\n\nHow to begin working as a hacker on a contract basis.\n\n\nHow to get started working as a hacking consultant.\n\n\nLearn how to get hired as a cybersecurity professional.\n\n\nThis course is in-depth, and it will teach you about both sides of hacking. You will learn how to think and act like a hacker – and how to put that knowledge to use as a cybersecurity expert to safeguard your own networks and systems as well as those of your clients. With this \"cat and mouse\" method, your comprehensive understanding will provide additional depths and angles to your approach, indicating the avenues that you may follow to successfully neutralize any threat.\n\n\nIn addition to the emphasis on practical examples that you can follow in real life with actual systems, you will benefit from the thrill of hands-on learning, which will enhance your learning experience. By learning firsthand what it takes to hack into any specific target system, you'll also come to understand that no two systems are alike and that all tactics may be tailored to fit the situation.\n\n\nThis hands-on experience is a vital component of your education since it allows you to better understand what hackers are up to and how to defend against even the most sophisticated assaults. Any scenario or complexity of a hacking situation may be addressed in this course, which provides the basic knowledge you need to protect a network and begin your pursuit of a profession in an area that is becoming increasingly in demand as the world's reliance on technology rises.",

Sample Cisco ACL implementations are included to familiarize the audience with selected configuration syntax and demonstrate this technology in a live network.\n\n\nAccess Control Lists (ACLs) are an important and useful tool on a data network. ACLs allow an administrator to select traffic and filter traffic as it flows through a network. In this course, Access Control Lists , you will first examine how standard and extended IPv4 access lists operate. Next, you'll learn how to implement each type of list on a router. Finally you'll explore common errors and how to troubleshoot ACLs. By the end of this course, you will be able to write your own access control lists to filter whatever traffic you want to either permit or deny on your networks.\n\n\nSelecting specific traffic as it flows through a network is valuable to make networks function in a predictable way.

Data Storage is one of the major requirement of any IT infrastructure system along with Computing and networking.\nData Storage Network is considered as one of the most confusing, misunderstood and complex domain in IT industry. This is primarily due to lack of awareness about Data Storage technologies, devices, protocols, features and training. So, due to scarcity of resources available in industry, it is one of the, always in-demand skill set in IT market. Dealing with Storage Security is another pain point, which pinch mostly to Security Engineers and auditors. Due to number of myths, misconceptions and mysteries associated with this topic.\nRAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. It is an arrangement of several hard Disk acting as a single logical drive for a computer system to provide reliability and performance to data storage. RAID technology has now grown from theoretical concept to an industry standard and is a common implementation in today's storage arrays.\nThis course talks about different RAID technologies and possible configurations.",

Both these features are ubiquitously used in Networking/Embedded/Distributed System/Cloud Computing etc, and hence we decided to throw a course on explaining the internal design and implementation.\n\n\nWe shall be going to build a Library called mtrie library, which will form the foundation for implementing IPV4 Routing Table and Access Control List framework.  Trie is a popular standard data structure and its variant is used to solve different types of industry problems.\n\n\nWe shall be building Cisco like Access Control List which is used for Security, Controlling the traffic flow Or restricting the access & permissions to the user to certain resources over the network. Below is Cisco Example. We shall be going to re-invent the wheel.\naccess-list allow_traffic permit UDP 122.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 40.1.1.1 255.255.255.255\naccess-list allow_traffic permit UDP 122.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 40.1.1.0 255.255.255.0\naccess-list allow_traffic permit UDP 122.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 40.0.0.0 255.255.0.0\naccess-list allow_traffic deny any 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0\n\n\nThis Course is Data Structure and Algorithmic Intensive, and We shall be showing all demonstrations in C/C++. However, you are free to implement the explained concepts in the language of your choice.\n\n\nPre-requisite :\nIt's desirable you understand how Subnet Masks work, and a very basic Networking background is required. This Course is exclusively designed for Intermediate to advanced developers only. If you are still struggling with programming basics, pls excuse this course.  The complexity level of this course is intermediate, and not for beginners. You will need to do a lot of Bit-Level Programming in this course.\n\n\nEnd Product :\nThe end product of this course is that you will have fully working Routing Table and Access Control List Libraries which you can further integrate into your other projects readily or decorate your resume with these milestones.\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n1. What is Access Control List and how does it work?\n2. What is the Longest prefix Match?\n3. Trie Data Structure\n4. Optimizing Trie to construct Routing Table Data Structure ( called mtrie )\nRoute Insertion Algorithm\nRoute Deletion Algorithm\nRoute Search Algorithm\nLongest Prefix Match Algorithm\n<< Delivered Till here as on 22 Sept 2022 >>\n\n\n5. Building Routing Table CRUD APIs over Mtrie Data Structure\n6.

As a dad of a toddler, i know what it means to have to simplify things but even before all this i was already emerged in the world of training IT profiles in software test automation and performance testing, having gotten my neoload expert certification in Paris so i could teach that software in a 3 day course that would prepare staff for neoload certification. All this helped me when i gained some experience in bug bounties on Intigriti (You can find me as theamazingferret) in a short time, i decided to start up my youtube channel because people kept asking me the same questions and this was a way to help them better. People seemed to like my teaching and it blew to where we are today. You can find me on LinkedIn as Wesley Thijs or on youtube or twitter or even facebook as the XSS Rat.\nWhat does this course offer?\nDuring my time as a bug bounty hunter and pentester i found i liked the XXE vulnerability type quite a lot. In this course i explain to you where XXE stems from, what it entails, how to exploit it and even how to prevent it. Every video file has a full PDF covering the topics in detail. To finish off i will you show you how to exploit this vulnerability in a set of practical video's demonstrated on one of my old CTF machines and on the portswigger labs.\nNot only will you learn how to find and exploit this vulnerability but i will complete your skillset by giving you general guidance on preventing this issue type.",

      "description": "Welcome to this FREE course preview of the Cyber Security Threat Intelligence Researcher Certification.\nCyber-attacks have become so sophisticated over the years, that a new term has emerged - Advanced Persistent Threat, which we will refer to as APT. An APT is a group of individuals that have both the means and the intent to launch persistent attacks against specific targets. Understanding these groups and their behavior is important when evaluating threats against any organization.\nHackers have traditionally targeted large corporations, but today small to midsize businesses are being attacked with the same type of highly sophisticated malware. These new strains of advanced malware are often referred to as APTs\nModern malware uses Advanced techniques such as encrypted communication channels, kernel-level rootkits, and sophisticated evasion capabilities to get past a network’s defenses. More importantly, they often leverage zero day vulnerabilities – flaws for which no patch is available yet and no signature has been written.\nModern malware is often Persistent and designed to stick around. It’s stealthy and carefully hides its communications. It lives in a victim’s network for as long as possible, often cleaning up after itself by deleting logs, using strong encryption, and only reporting back to its controller in small, obfuscated bursts of communication.\nMany attacks are now blended combinations of different techniques. A common tactic for hackers is to initiate an APT with spear phishing. This involves sending a carefully crafted email that appears to be in the from of a known individual or business with a link to a malicious website or an infected download.\nOnce the initial breach is successful, attackers can further damage defenses by disabling security protocols, changing security settings or stealing passwords. Groups of highly skilled, motivated, and very well-funded attackers represent significant Threats because they have very specific targets and goals in mind – often financial gain from theft of credit cards and other valuable account information.\nHere are the topics that we will be covering in this course. We will begin by going over the APT Lifecycle and teach you a structured approach to analyze and assess inherent vulnerabilities. We will teach you mitigation and countermeasures that may prevent an attacker from gaining a foothold into an organization.\nNext, we will get you familiar with APT1 Group and some common ATPs we have seen in the last few years like Stuxnet, and two new ones, Adwind and Poseidon. Lastly, we will get you familiar with the Cyber World War.",

      "description": "An excellent starting point involves addressing the question, \"Why should one embrace automation?\" If you're already immersed in the cybersecurity realm, you're likely aware of the significant advantages automation brings. However, if you're new to the field, consider the challenge of safeguarding your less tech-savvy relatives or friends from malware installations on their phones or falling victim to phishing emails. Now, envision multiplying that struggle by hundreds or thousands of people. Factor in the reality that malicious actors are actively motivated to target your organization, and a single successful attack could result in millions of dollars in damages for the company. Managing cyber risk entails preventing malware infections, detecting and mitigating ongoing attacks, ensuring compliance with corporate security policies, and more. Automation serves as an ally by assisting in handling these tasks.Python boasts several features that make it a favorable choice, including the following:\nPopularity: There's a high likelihood that you are already familiar with Python to some extent. It's far easier to learn new ways to utilize a language you are already acquainted with than to start from scratch with a new language.\nSimplicity: Python is relatively quick and easy to grasp, even for those unfamiliar with it. This simplicity proves advantageous for both learning purposes and swiftly crafting programs.\nPower: Python boasts a plethora of robust libraries that can be effortlessly imported into your code. If you need to work with network traffic, utilizing libraries such as Scapy is much simpler than attempting to build the functionality from scratch.",

Imagine if you could host your websites, databases, email marketing tools, automation apps, and more — all under your full control — at a fraction of the cost.\nThis course empowers you with the skillset to take full control of your web hosting infrastructure using Coolify, a powerful open-source alternative to platforms like Heroku, Vercel, and cPanel.\nWhether you're an entrepreneur, freelancer, agency owner, developer, or digital marketer, this course will show you step-by-step how to set up and self-manage your own VPS (Virtual Private Server) — without needing advanced DevOps skills.\nHere’s the hard truth: relying on managed platforms or shared hosting limits your scalability, costs you hundreds of dollars annually, and exposes your assets to performance throttling and restrictive terms. By avoiding self-hosting, you're giving away control and paying for features you could own for free.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to build a fully self-managed infrastructure using Coolify on Contabo (or any VPS provider). You’ll master how to:\nDeploy and monitor your WordPress sites effortlessly\nInstall automation tools like n8n without any monthly cost\nHost your own email marketing system (Mautic) and SMTP server\nManage databases like MongoDB and Redis with ease\nFortify your setup with rock-solid security practices\nHost cloud apps like Minio and Firefox (VPN) with confidence\nBy the end of this course, you won’t just learn theory — you’ll have your own hosting stack live and running, ready to power multiple client websites, SaaS products, marketing systems, or personal apps.\nThis is more than hosting knowledge — it's digital independence.\nMost people avoid this route thinking it’s too technical. But we break every step into beginner-friendly, no-fluff lessons that you can follow even if you’ve never logged into a server before.\nYou’ll also understand why most people pay more than they need to, how agencies silently use this exact setup for huge profits, and how you can reclaim your tech freedom starting today.\nThis course doesn’t just save you money — it gives you skills that open up new revenue streams, speed up deployments, and eliminate dependence on over-complicated services.",

You won’t just use Spring Boot — you’ll learn how to extend its internal mechanisms to support dynamic proxy injection, custom annotation scanning, Bean lifecycle hooks, and more.\n\n\nYou’ll start by building a Netty-based communication core, defining your own protocol, encoder, and decoder. Then, you'll integrate high-performance serialization using Kryo to efficiently transmit objects across the network.\nWhere this course truly shines is in its Spring Boot integration:\nUse ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar to extract the startup class’s metadata and scan interfaces dynamically\nImplement SmartInitializingSingleton to scan all available RPC service methods at runtime\nUse BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor and FactoryBean to register and inject proxy objects automatically\nDesign custom annotations that trigger client creation and connection logic on application startup\nYou'll also implement service discovery, heartbeat detection, connection management, and fallback support — everything a production-grade RPC system needs.\n\n\nEvery single line of code is written from scratch — no black boxes, no magic.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have built a complete framework similar in architecture to Dubbo or OpenFeign — but every single line is handcrafted, explained, and deeply integrated with Spring Boot.",

Together, these courses provide a comprehensive foundation in networking, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on skills for analyzing, building, and defending networked systems. This series is designed for students who wish to develop a deep and practical understanding of how modern networks operate, how data flows across systems, and how vulnerabilities in these networks can be detected and mitigated.\nThis third course: Understanding Cyber Security part 3 - TCP/IP and beyond! provides a solid foundation and know-how across the most important protocols of the network - the Internet Protocol (IP), the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and various application-level protocols. It covers IP addressing and subnetting, message fragmentation and routing concepts, as well as ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) messages which support diagnostics and error reporting. It describes in detail both connection-oriented (TCP-based) and connectionless (UDP-based) application protocols, emphasizing their differences in reliability, flow control, congestion handling, and supporting use cases, including HTTP/HTTPS, DNS and DHCP, examining how they use symmetric and asymmetric encryption and operate over UDP and TCP to enable modern Internet communication.\nBuilding on the foundation from the first and second courses, students will use Wireshark extensively to capture and dissect IP,  TCP and application level packets, interpret sequence and acknowledgment numbers, analyze TCP’s three-way handshake, and understand connection teardown. Special attention will be given to TCP reliability mechanisms such as retransmissions, flow control, and congestion control, along with common TCP and IP-based attack vectors, including spoofing, scanning, and denial-of-service (DOS) techniques. Students will gain practical experience in capturing, filtering, and dissecting application-layer traffic, distinguishing normal application level usage patterns from anomalies, and understanding the role of each protocol in end-to-end communication. Through hands-on labs, students will understanding their underlying encryption framework, and learn how to reconstruct application-level exchanges, trace protocol handshakes, and evaluate performance or failure conditions.\nThe course builds a strong foundation for understanding encrypted transmission, recognizing attack signatures, as well as testing protocol resilience, and prepares for advanced topics in secure network design and intrusion prevention covered in the subsequent courses of the series.",

I talk about passwords and what secure passwords should be.\nWhile many people think this topic is too simple and unimportant, statistics show that over 75% of Americans use insecure passwords for their accounts and become vulnerable to attackers.\nIf you don't take passwords seriously, you're putting not only your life at risk, but the lives of your family, friends, coworkers, and even complete strangers.\nThat's why I believe it's impossible to keep yourself safe online without understanding the topic of passwords. And only after that can you consider and explore more complex online security topics. I will definitely touch on these topics in my next courses.\nThis course will give you a comprehensive basic knowledge of passwords so that you don't become an easy target for hackers. I want you to never get caught up in the horrifying statistics of people who have been hacked by internet criminals.\nWhen you go online, you are entering a very dangerous and aggressive world. There are certain safety rules that need to be followed. Otherwise, very big problems will be waiting for you. And the first rule you need to know is what your passwords should be!",

If you connect to the Internet, you must take a basic information security course. Failure to do so can have very serious negative consequences. Experience and practical studies of information security specialists clearly show that even experienced users sometimes make the stupidest mistakes that lead to tragedy. Therefore, I recommend taking this course to everyone who uses the Internet, and therefore automatically becomes potentially vulnerable to attacks by malicious users."

      "description": "What is Ethical Hacking?\nEthical hacking is an authorized practice of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization’s infrastructure and bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They can improve the security footprint to withstand attacks better or divert them.\n\n\nThe company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers to perform such activities in order to test the system’s defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more importantly, legal.\n\n\nEthical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the system/network/applications. By doing so, they can improve the security footprint so that it can better withstand attacks or divert them.\n\n\nEthical hackers are hired by organizations to look into the vulnerabilities of their systems and networks and develop solutions to prevent data breaches. Consider it a high-tech permutation of the old saying “It takes a thief to catch a thief.”\n\n\nThey check for key vulnerabilities include but are not limited to:\nInjection attacks\nChanges in security settings\nExposure of sensitive data\nBreach in authentication protocols\nComponents used in the system or network that may be used as access points",

That means that we will not improve it anymore after that day, even if someone finds a security problem in it. You should upgrade to Python 3 as soon as you can.\nWhy are you doing this?\nWe need to sunset Python 2 so we can help Python users by improving Python faster.\nWe released Python 2.0 in 2000. We realized a few years later that we needed to make big changes to improve Python. So in 2006, we started Python 3.0. Many people did not upgrade, and we did not want to hurt them. So, for many years, we have kept improving and publishing both Python 2 and Python 3.\nBut this makes it hard to improve Python. There are improvements Python 2 can't handle. And we have less time to work on making Python 3 better and faster.\nAnd if many people keep using Python 2, then that makes it hard for the volunteers who use Python to make software. They can't use the good new things in Python 3 to improve the tools they make.\nWe did not want to hurt the people using Python 2. So, in 2008, we announced that we would sunset Python 2 in 2015, and asked people to upgrade before then. Some did, but many did not. So, in 2014, we extended that sunset till 2020.\n===================================\nINSTRUCTIONS FROM THE AUTHOR\n===================================\nThanks for enrolling my Udemy course.\nI hope you will enjoy the Demo class for Network automation - Python3/Ansible and New CCNA 200-301.\nRegards\nAdmin, Author",

      "description": "When browsing the web, it is surprisingly easy to become a target for cybercriminals. For this reason, it is essential to be aware of potential threats and how to recognize possible attacks. The primary motivation behind a phishing attack is often financial gain—either by directly stealing money from victims or by obtaining sensitive personal data that can later be monetized.\nThe risks associated with these attacks are numerous and do not always affect just a single individual; often, they are aimed at larger targets, such as entire companies.\nThe first and most crucial step in preventing these attacks is knowledge. Awareness serves as the initial barrier against cybercriminals. However, attackers continuously refine their techniques, making it increasingly difficult for the average user to distinguish between legitimate and phishing emails. Relying solely on individual knowledge to ensure the security of a device, network, or organization is not sufficient. For this reason, security systems and protective software solutions are constantly analyzed and updated to provide additional layers of defense.\nWhat You Will Learn:\nWhat social engineering and phishing are.\nDifferent types of phishing attacks.\nThe consequences of an attack.\nHow to recognize a phishing email.\nEffective defense strategies.\nCourse Requirements or Prerequisites:\nBasic knowledge of communication tools.\nBasic understanding of business and infrastructure environments.\nWho This Course Is For:\nBeginners who want to better understand phishing attack dynamics and learn how to protect themselves.",

Each section of the exam takes four hours to complete, so the entire exam takes a total of 16 hours to complete.\nCandidates have the flexibility to take the four sections of the exam in any order they choose, as long as they pass all four sections within a three-year period.\nThe exam is computer-based, and candidates can review and change their answers during the four-hour time limit. However, it's important to note that the exam is designed to be challenging, and candidates are encouraged to prepare thoroughly before taking each section of the exam.\nWhat should you buy this Practice Test Course?\nI provide you with 150 High Quality Questions about Section 2 of the CFE exam. This section covers the topic of Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes and is designed to test a candidate's knowledge and understanding of the following areas:\nFinancial statement fraud: This involves intentional misrepresentation of financial information, such as revenue, expenses, and assets.\nAsset misappropriation: This refers to the theft or misuse of an organization's assets, such as cash, inventory, or equipment.\nBribery and corruption: This involves offering or receiving something of value in exchange for influence or an unfair advantage.\nCybercrime and digital forensics: This covers fraud and other criminal activities that are conducted using technology, as well as the methods used to investigate and prevent these crimes.\nMoney laundering: This refers to the process of concealing the proceeds of illegal activity by making them appear to be from a legitimate source.\nInvestigative interviewing: This covers the techniques used to gather information from witnesses, suspects, and other individuals involved in a fraud investigation.\nFraud risk assessment: This involves identifying and analyzing the potential fraud risks facing an organization and implementing measures to prevent or mitigate these risks.\nEthics and professional responsibility: This covers the ethical and legal standards that fraud examiners must adhere to in their work, as well as their professional responsibilities to clients, employers, and the public.\nThere are three types of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Section 2 of the CFE (Certified Fraud Examiner) exam: which I covered in this Mock course to be like the real exam:\nRecall-based: These questions test a candidate's ability to recall specific information related to fraud examination. They are straightforward and typically require the candidate to select the correct answer from a list of options. (50 Question; 60 Min)\nApplication-based: These questions test a candidate's ability to apply their knowledge of fraud examination to real-world scenarios. They require the candidate to analyze the information provided and select the best course of action. (50 Question; 60 Min)\nAnalysis-based: These questions test a candidate's ability to analyze complex information related to fraud examination. They require the candidate to evaluate multiple pieces of information and select the best course of action. (50 Question; 60 Min)\nAll questions and answers are unique and with NO repetition any previous questions or answers.\nWith the right preparation and dedication, many individuals have successfully passed the CFE exam and earned their CFE certification.\nI am so confident that you will love this practice test course, that we are offering a FULL money-back guarantee for 30 days!\nSo, what are you waiting for?

Also, did you know that IAM for AWS can provide service level access to users both inside and outside of your network?\nMy name is Alston Godbolt, and I’ll be your instructor. This course is important to me because it provides me an opportunity to share my knowledge and teaching approach with you, the student. I have over five years of teaching adult students, and mentoring instructors. In addition, I am both an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and a Certified Developer Associate. Finally, I am a Full Stack Developer working with a number of AWS Services daily. This combination of knowledge and experience makes me well suited to lead you through the wonderful world of Identity and Access Management.\nThis course is designed for both beginners to AWS and experienced developers. First, after a brief course introduction, we will dive into what AWS provides to its customers. Next, we will take a detailed look at the four major components of IAM: Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies. Each component will feature a definition, a short description, use cases, and a hands-on tutorial.\nBy the end of this course you’ll be able to identify the right component based on needs, define and discuss: Users, Roles, Groups, and Policies. And Create each of the four components in the AWS management console.\nThis course takes a no fluff, no filler approach to learning IAM. We will not spend any time discussing any other service outside of IAM.\nThank you, and I’ll see you in the course",

Linux is widely used for supercomputers, mainframe computers, and servers. Linux can also run on personal computers, mobile devices, tablet computers, routers, and other embedded systems. One of the most prominent examples of this is the Android mobile operating system, which is based on the Linux Kernel. Linux is capable of running many of the same applications and software as Windows and Mac OS X. Linux operating systems, software, and applications are commonly referred to as Linux distributions (distros for short).\n\n\nLinux is an extremely popular operating system for hackers. There are two main reasons behind this. First off, Linux’s source code is freely available because it is an open source operating system. This means that Linux is very easy to modify or customize. Second, there are countless Linux security distros available that can double as Linux hacking software.\nMalicious actors typically use tools such as password crackers, network and vulnerability scanners, and intrusion detection software. These Linux hacking tools all serve different purposes and are used for a wide range of attacks.\nPassword crackers are software developed for decoding passwords in a variety of formats, such as encrypted or hashed passwords. Many cracking distros offer additional functionality such as network detectors and wireless packet sniffing. Malicious actors use these Linux hacking tools because they offer a simple way to gain access to an organization’s network, databases, directories, and more. Password cracking distros are commonly used in Linux wifi hacking (Linux hacking that targets wireless networks).",

This course also gives a definition of context and objectives, risk assessment (divided into identification, estimation and evaluation of risks), risk treatment and control (monitoring).\n\n\nParticular emphasis is placed on:\n\n\n- The risk assessment phase, in particular the three risk assessment methods: qualitative, quantitative and semi-quantitative; the advantages and disadvantages of each method were analyzed and then common considerations were made about these methods.\n\n\n- The risk management phase, in which the four risk management methods (avoid, transfer, mitigate and accept) were defined. The most common method, risk mitigation, was identified and its objectives were defined.\n\n\nOther than analyzing the cyber risk and explaining the cyber risk management process and its phases, the last section of this course describes the two main cyber risk management frameworks: NIST and ISO.\n\n\nThis course uses real-world examples, images, and graphics to explain its content and make its definitions of cyber risk and the risk management process clearer and easier to understand.\n\n\nThe main objective of risk management is to minimize losses and maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of production processes; in particular, risk assessment is aimed at identifying and analyzing risks to understand what are the priorities for action and then produce strategic actions to contain or mitigate them.",

      "description": "According to a recent study conducted by a major Cyber Security firm, less than half the online population understands the term \"Firewalls\" - or know if they have one enabled on their PC.\nFirewalls are even more important in a corporate or work environment. It not only keeps the corporate network safe - but can also optimize traffic routing and provide a whole range of other benefits.\nIf you are connected to the Internet, you are a potential target to an array of cyber threats, such as hackers, keyloggers, and Trojans that attack through unpatched security holes. This means that if you, like most people shop and bank online, are vulnerable to identity theft and other malicious attacks.\nA firewall works as a barrier, or a shield, between your PC and cyberspace. When you are connected to the Internet, you are continually sending and receiving information in small units called packets. The firewall filters these packets to see if they meet certain criteria set by a series of rules, and after that blocks or allows the data. This way, hackers cannot get inside and steal information such as bank account numbers and passwords from you.\nBasic firewalls such as the one included in your operating systems, only monitor incoming traffic by default. This may give you a false sense of security. Keep in mind, outgoing traffic, with your credit card information, bank accounts, and social security number is not protected. A good firewall will monitor traffic in both directions. That is, both your incoming data and your outgoing data, keeping your private information safe. In addition to preventing unauthorized access to your PC, it also makes your PC invisible when you're online, helping prevent attempted intrusions in the first place.\nFirewalls are one of the most critical parts of a network. It’s the first line of defense that your system has against attacks or unwanted visitors, and it makes all the difference in ensuring your data is protected. pfSense is a highly versatile, open source routing and firewall software. With thousands of enterprises using pfSense software, it is fast the world's most trusted open source network security solution.\npfSense has all of the features you would find in a commercial firewall solution and more, and it is absolutely free! Better yet, you can customize pfSense based on your organization’s requirements and create a unique solution that is perfect for you.\nDo you know what it takes to install and configure a sophisticated firewall?\nHow do you scale your firewall from a small home office to a large corporation’s network?\nHow do you implement security features like VPN, remote access and corporate web proxy?\nThese are some of the fundamental problems IT engineers struggle with on a daily basis.\nIn this course, you’ll learn about pfSense, all of its key features, how you can install and deploy it, as well as the different tasks you can perform.\nYou’ll learn about pfSense.\nYou will gain an understanding of what pfSense is, its key features and advantages.\nYou will learn how to configure pfSense as a firewall and create and manage firewall rules.\npfSense is capable of working with multiple ISP connections and provide you this redundancy. You will learn to configure and test pfSense for failover and load balancing across multiple WAN connections.\nBesides that, secure remote connectivity is also a critical feature for many businesses and professionals. You will dive into configuring pfSense a free and robust remote connectivity solutions using OpenVPN and IPSec\nFinally, you’ll learn how to configure and integrate pfSense as a Squid proxy server.\nif you are serious about architecting, deploying and operating enterprise grade firewalls – then this course is for you.\nThese IT and security skills are in great demand, but there’s no easy way to acquire this knowledge. Rather than rely on hit and trial method, this course will provide you with all the information you need to get started with your interoperability requirements.\nStartups and technology companies pay big bucks for IT engineers and contractors with the talent to secure their infrastructure required for today's ever complex networks. They demand knowledge and experience in these technologies.\nWhen you become skilled at these technologies - you can demand top dollar for your abilities.\nDo you want the skills to be highly sought after?\nDo you want your career to touch cloud 9?\nDid you answer, “Absolutely” to that question? If so, then our new training program “Managing Network Security with pfSense Firewall\" is for you.\nLook, if you're serious about becoming an expert cloud engineer and generating a greater income for you and your family, it’s time to take action.\nLet’s do this together!",

      "description": "Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. It encompasses both the physical devices and the logical elements required to establish communication pathways between systems. At its core, networking involves the use of protocols—rules and conventions that enable devices to understand and exchange data with one another. The foundation of modern networking lies in the internet protocol (IP), which provides the addressing system that allows devices to locate and communicate with each other across vast distances. Networking can range from simple setups, like a home network connecting a few devices, to complex enterprise systems with thousands of interconnected devices and sophisticated infrastructure.\nA key component of networking is the various types of networks that can be established, each serving different needs. Local Area Networks (LANs) connect devices within a limited area, such as a home, school, or office building, facilitating fast data exchange and resource sharing. On a larger scale, Wide Area Networks (WANs) connect multiple LANs over greater distances, often using telecommunications links. The most prominent example of a WAN is the internet itself, which interconnects millions of networks globally. Additionally, networking encompasses wireless technologies, which have become increasingly vital with the proliferation of mobile devices and the need for flexible, untethered connectivity.\nThe evolution of networking has introduced advanced concepts like network security, virtualization, and cloud computing. Network security is paramount, given the increasing threats from cyberattacks, requiring robust measures such as firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems. Virtualization allows for the creation of virtual networks and devices, providing greater flexibility, scalability, and resource efficiency. Cloud computing leverages networking to deliver computing services over the internet, enabling on-demand access to resources and services without the need for local infrastructure. These advancements reflect the dynamic and critical nature of networking in supporting modern computing environments.\nIn addition to technological aspects, networking also involves significant planning, management, and troubleshooting. Network administrators must design networks to meet organizational needs, ensuring reliability, performance, and scalability. They monitor network traffic, address issues, and upgrade infrastructure to adapt to changing requirements. Effective networking strategies contribute to operational efficiency, business continuity, and the ability to leverage new technologies. As digital transformation continues to reshape industries, the importance of robust, secure, and efficient networking cannot be overstated, underpinning the connectivity that drives innovation and productivity in the digital age.",

      "description": "The Cybersecurity Mentorship Program offers a training curriculum designed to provide individuals with the necessary skills to secure employment in the cybersecurity industry and continuously excel. The program covers the following topics and includes:\n\n\nEssential Windows Skills for Cybersecurity, is meticulously designed to equip aspiring and current cybersecurity professionals with the crucial command-line proficiency necessary to navigate, analyze, and secure Windows environments effectively. Understanding and utilizing these fundamental Windows tools is paramount for tasks ranging from basic system administration and file manipulation to in-depth security analysis and troubleshooting.  This module takes you beyond the graphical user interface, delving into the power and flexibility of the Windows command prompt (CMD) and providing an initial introduction to PowerShell. You'll gain hands-on understanding of essential commands that form the bedrock of interacting with the Windows operating system at a fundamental level.\nBuilding upon your foundational understanding of the Windows command line, PowerShell Commands for Cybersecurity delves into the power and versatility of PowerShell, a critical scripting language and command-line shell for modern cybersecurity professionals. PowerShell offers a more robust and object-oriented approach to system administration, automation, and security-related tasks compared to the traditional CMD. Mastering these fundamental PowerShell cmdlets (pronounced \"command-lets\") will significantly enhance your ability to interact with and analyze Windows systems.\nFundamentals of Computer Networking, provides the essential building blocks for understanding how computers communicate and how networks function. A solid grasp of networking principles is absolutely paramount for any cybersecurity professional, as it forms the basis for understanding threats, vulnerabilities, and implementing effective security measures.\nEndpoint Security, provides you with the critical knowledge and practical skills to effectively implement, manage, and leverage EDR solutions. In today's sophisticated threat landscape, traditional antivirus often falls short in detecting and responding to advanced persistent threats (APTs), ransomware, and other complex attacks. EDR provides a crucial layer of security by continuously monitoring endpoints, collecting and analyzing activity data, and enabling rapid detection and response to threats that bypass traditional defenses.\nVulnerability Management and Remediation, equips you with the essential knowledge and practical skills to proactively identify, assess, treat, and track security weaknesses within an organization's IT infrastructure. In the ever-evolving threat landscape, a robust vulnerability management program is a cornerstone of any effective cybersecurity strategy.\nOur overarching goal is to empower individuals with a truly comprehensive and deeply ingrained set of practical skills, theoretical knowledge, and adaptive thinking capabilities that are absolutely essential to not only gain entry into the highly competitive cybersecurity industry but also to flourish, advance, and become influential leaders within it. We strive to cultivate a holistic understanding of the multifaceted cybersecurity landscape, going far beyond surface-level concepts to instill a profound appreciation for the interconnectedness of various security domains.",

When an enterprise extends its connectivity across multiple sites through a private or a public WAN connection, the service provider mandates that the enterprise use an additional routing protocol, typically the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), over the WAN links to ensure end-to-end routing.\nThe use of an additional protocol causes additional complexities for the enterprise, such as additional routing processes and sustained interaction between EIGRP and the routing protocol to ensure connectivity, for the enterprise. With the EIGRP Over the Top feature, routing is consolidated into a single protocol (EIGRP) across the WAN, which provides the following benefits:\n• There is no dependency on the type of WAN connection used.\n• There is no dependency on the service provider to transfer routes.\n• There is no security threat because the underlying WAN has no knowledge of enterprise routes.\n• This feature simplifies dual carrier deployments and designs by eliminating the need to configure and manage EIGRP-BGP route distribution and route filtering between customer sites.\n• This feature allows easy transition between different service providers. • This feature supports both IPv4 and IPv6 environments.",

The endpoints are the VMs (or even traditional servers with the OS running directly on the hardware). Because several endpoints have the same needs, you group them together into aptly named endpoint groups. Then policies can be defined about which endpoint groups can communicate with whom—for instance, a group of web servers may need to communicate with a group of application servers. The policy also defines other key parameters, like which endpoint groups can access each other (or not), as well as QoS parameters and other services.\n\n\nACI uses a centralized controller called the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC),It is the controller that creates application policies for the data center infrastructure…..this is your SDN controller for Data Center.\n\n\nACI uses a partially centralized control plane, RESTful and native APIs, and OpFlex as an SBI. The NBIs allow software control from outside the controller. The controller communicates with the switches connected to the endpoints, and asks those switches to then create the correct flows to be added to the switches. Interestingly.\n\n\nACI has three main components: Nexus 9000 switches, APIC and ecosystem\nTopics to be covered:\n\n\nABC of Cisco ACI 6.0\nSection 1:\nFundamentals of ACI\nLecture 1:\nIntroduction\nLecture 2:\nTopics covered in this training\nLecture 3:\nIntroduction to ACI\nLecture 4:\nACI Theory\nLecture 5:\nComponents of ACI\nSection 2:\nACI Bring-up Process\nLecture 6:\nGreat Job -- Now Start ACI bring up process\nLecture 7:\nACI Bring up process\nLecture 8:\nACI Bring up process part 02\nLecture 9:\nACI Fabric Membership old\nLecture 10:\nGreat Job - Do the Lab in ACI 6.0\nLecture 11:\nACI Fabric Membership\nLecture 12:\nACI - Rest of Basic configuration\nSection 3:\nACI Policy\nLecture 13:\nACI Policy -- Next 2 videos\nLecture 14:\nACI Understand ACI Security policy\nLecture 15:\nFabric access policy\nSection 4:\nVMM Integration\nLecture 16:\nACI VMM theory next 2 videos\nLecture 17:\nACI - VMM integration part 01\nLecture 18:\nACI - VMM integration part 02\nLecture 19:\nNext 20 minutes -- You will be master in VMM integration\nLecture 20:\nACI - VMM integration part 01\nLecture 21:\nACI - VMM integration part 02\nSection 5:\nEPG ESG Starts from Here..\nLecture 22:\nACI - Tenant BD EPG config part 01\nLecture 23:\nACI - Tenant _BD_EPG config part 02\nLecture 24:\nNext is what -- ESG the great\nLecture 25:\nNext is what -- ESG the great\nLecture 26:\nESG-Secure the Finance lab 1\nLecture 27:\nESG-Secure the Finance lab 2",

How software works on a deep level and what code is and does.\nThen we will move on to networks where you will learn what EXACTLY a network is and how the internet works. How do web applications work, what is happening with I go to google's website.\nAfter learning the hardest part (networking) we can get into what you came here for. I will skip 30% or so of the boring introductory cybersecurity material usually taught so that you can really understand what cybersecurity is and what professionals do.\nIn an introductory course like this, it is fairly difficult to have hands-on exercises, however, I have tried my best to ensure that when I teach you something, you can go and look at it yourself with a mouse and keyboard and interact with the concept.",

They use this process to prevent cyber attacks and security breaches by lawfully hacking into the systems and looking for weak points\n\n\nConfidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. The model is also sometimes referred to as the AIC triad (availability, integrity and confidentiality) to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency\nNetwork security is the protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. It involves creating a secure infrastructure for devices, applications, users, and applications to work in a secure manner\n\n\nWhat is Nmap ?\nNmap is a free and open-source network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection\n\n\nSome of this tool’s best features are that it’s open-source, free, multi-platform and receives constant updates each year. It also has a big plus: it’s one of the most complete host and network and port scanners available. It includes a large set of options to enhance your scanning and mapping tasks, and brings with it an incredible community and comprehensive documentation to help you understand this tool from the very start. Nmap can be used to:\nCreate a complete computer network map\nFind remote IP addresses of any hosts\nGet the OS system and software details\nDetect open ports on local and remote systems\nAudit server security standards\nFind vulnerabilities on remote and local hosts\nIt was mentioned in the Top 20 OSINT Tools article we published, and today we’ll explore a little bit more about this essential security tool with some practical terminal-based Nmap commands",

      "description": "This course is designed to give you a complete understanding of ethical hacking and cybersecurity concepts, explained in simple and practical language without overwhelming technical details or complex labs. If you are curious about how hackers think, how attacks happen, and how organizations defend themselves, this course is the perfect starting point. It is fully aligned with the CEH v12 certification framework and focuses on the theory and concepts that every aspiring ethical hacker or cybersecurity professional should know.\nYou will start by learning what ethical hacking is, why it matters, and how it differs from malicious hacking. You’ll explore the different types of hackers, their goals, and the role ethical hackers play in protecting organizations. From there, you’ll gain an understanding of the CEH v12 certification structure, its key domains, and the career opportunities it opens for you.\nThe course then introduces you to the five phases of ethical hacking: reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, and covering tracks. Each phase is explained with real-world examples, showing why it is an essential part of penetration testing and security assessments. You’ll learn about important techniques such as footprinting, network scanning, system hacking, enumeration, and password cracking, all explained in a clear and easy-to-digest manner without coding or tool demonstrations.\nMoving forward, you’ll discover how malware works, the impact it has, and the different types like viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware. You’ll also uncover the world of social engineering—how attackers manipulate people to gain access—and study examples such as phishing, baiting, and pretexting. Real-life cases are included to make the concepts more relatable and practical.\nThe course also explores common network attacks such as sniffing, denial-of-service (DoS), and session hijacking, helping you understand how attackers target network communication and how these threats can be mitigated. You’ll then dive into web application and database security, learning about vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection, and discover how secure coding practices and proper testing can prevent these attacks.\nIn addition, you will gain insight into wireless network threats, mobile device risks, and the challenges of securing Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These areas are more relevant than ever as the world becomes increasingly connected, and understanding the weaknesses of these technologies will help you stay ahead of potential attackers.\nFinally, the course explains the role of cryptography in cybersecurity, including encryption and hashing, and introduces you to defensive tools such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and honeypots. To help you prepare for the future, you’ll also receive guidance on the CEH exam process, common mistakes to avoid, study strategies, and the types of cybersecurity career paths you can pursue after certification.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a solid theoretical foundation in ethical hacking and cybersecurity. You will be able to clearly explain how different attacks work, recognize the vulnerabilities that hackers exploit, and understand the defense strategies used by organizations worldwide. Whether you are a student, an IT professional, or someone preparing for the CEH exam, this course will give you the knowledge and confidence to move forward in the exciting field of ethical hacking.",

It's new because the exams have been around for a long time, but the syllabus and the exam itself have undergone a significant change as of the 1st of May this year. I’m probably one of the first people to pass the new exam, which I have to tell you was a great relief because it really was a tough exam and it was tough preparing for it.\nIt was a big mountain to climb. I am very, very relieved to have passed. Now, I hope to share some lessons with you. When I mentioned that I passed on the cybersecurity groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, I got a huge response from people who appreciated how difficult it is to do this and also had lots of questions. And whilst I can't talk about the specifics of the exam, that's not allowed, I can share some really useful lessons learned from my journey.\nIntroduction. So I'm going to be talking about what I did:\n\n\n1. The Official Course, and the Student Guide;\n2. How I took stock at the start of the revision process;\n3. How I revised using the practice questions and the Study Guide;\n4. Something about the exam itself; and\n5. Lessons learned.\n\n\nSo those are the five topics that I'm going to be talking about.",

      "description": "Ethical hacking is a process of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization's infrastructure that an attacker can use to exploit an individual or organization. They use this process to prevent cyber attacks and security breaches by lawfully hacking into the systems and looking for weak points.\n\n\nConfidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. The model is also sometimes referred to as the AIC triad (availability, integrity and confidentiality) to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency.\nNetwork security is the protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. It involves creating a secure infrastructure for devices, applications, users, and applications to work in a secure manner.\n\n\nWhat is Wireshark ?\nWireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. Originally named Ethereal, the project was renamed Wireshark in May 2006 due to trademark issues.\n\n\nWireshark is cross-platform, using the Qt widget toolkit in current releases to implement its user interface, and using pcap to capture packets; it runs on Linux, macOS, BSD, Solaris, some other Unix-like operating systems, and Microsoft Windows. There is also a terminal-based (non-GUI) version called TShark. Wireshark, and the other programs distributed with it such as TShark, are free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version.",

We are here to help you level up your skills every step of the way. We've attached many resources and some development videos to this Udemy course in hopes that it will help provide you with a good starting point for learning.\nOnce you successfully setup your environment, we will start building several starter dApps on Polygon (all of this is located on Polygon Academy's Github organization as well for your forking). You can build either these, or follow the design principles in these videos to build on top of any dApp on Polygon's vibrant ecosystem.\nBuilding dApps on Polygon is (at the time of this writing) strongly preferable to building on ETH due to its low network gas costs and much faster block finality, which means better and more cycles of testing and iteration especially for products in development. Because Polygon is EVM compatible, you can expect to find almost all the resources you have access to on Ethereum to build off of (Truffle, Ganache, Solidity, Hardhat, Chainlink's data oracles, etc.), except in a much faster blockchain dev environment.\nThanks for joining our course, we hope you learn a ton.",

Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems, routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more.\nSNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring. SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems organized in a management information base (MIB) which describe the system status and configuration. These variables can then be remotely queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing applications.\nThree significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed. SNMPv1 is the original version of the protocol. More recent versions, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility and security.\nManaged Devices:\nA managed device or the network element is a part of the network that requires some form of monitoring and management e.g. routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, UPSs, etc...\nSNMP Agent:\nThe agent is a program that is packaged within the network element. Enabling the agent allows it to collect the management information database from the device locally and makes it available to the SNMP manager, when it is queried for. These agents could be standard (e.g. Net-SNMP) or specific to a vendor (e.g. HP insight agent)\nSNMP agent’s key functions\nCollects management information about its local environment\nStores and retrieves management information as defined in the MIB.\nSignals an event to the manager.\nActs as a proxy for some non–SNMP manageable network node.",

It is equipped with holes called ports. Computers and other devices are connected to a router using network cables. Now-a-days router comes in wireless modes using which computers can be connected without any physical cable.\n\n\nEthernet switching connects wired devices such as computers, laptops, servers, and printers to a local area network (LAN). Multiple Ethernet switch ports allow for faster connectivity and smoother access across many devices at once. First introduced in 1990 and having since dramatically evolved, ethernet switches are the most common form of network switches.\n\n\nFirewalls have existed since the late 1980’s and started out as packet filters, which were networks set up to examine packets, or bytes, transferred between computers. Though packet filtering firewalls are still in use today, firewalls have come a long way as technology has developed throughout the decades.\n\n\nNext Generation Firewalls inspect packets at the application level of the TCP/IP stack and are able to identify applications such as Skype, or Facebook and enforce security policy based upon the type of application.",

Six years later, the Tor Project released the Tor Browser, designed to make the dark web somewhat easier to navigate – though, as CSO Magazine noted recently, it can still be “unpredictable, unreliable and maddeningly slow.” Tor says its network now includes several thousand servers and millions of users, though it’s hard to tell whether its user base is continuing to grow.\n\n\nIn this course, you'll learn to get started with Dark Web, Tor Browser and Cryptocurrency.\nSection 1.

      "description": "From infiltrations on infrastructure and data breaches to spear phishing and brute force. Online threats are varied and they don’t discriminate organizations from individuals when looking for a target. Cyber threats are a big deal. Cyber attacks can cause electrical blackouts, failure of military equipment, and breaches of national security secrets. They can result in the theft of valuable, sensitive data like medical records. They can disrupt phone and computer networks or paralyze systems, making data unavailable. It’s not an exaggeration to say that cyber threats may affect the functioning of life as we know it.\nWorld Economic Forum’s “Global Risks Report 2020” states that the chances of catching and prosecuting a cybercriminal are almost nil (0.05%). Given the circumstances, business awareness and resilience is key to securing sensitive data and avoiding breaches.\nCyber threats are getting more sophisticated and intense amid the increasing levels of remote work and dependence on digital devices. Especially since the beginning of the pandemic covid-19, the FBI has seen a fourfold increase in cybersecurity complaints, whereas the global losses from cybercrime exceeded $1 trillion in 2020.\nCybersecurity risks pervade every organization and aren’t always under IT’s direct control. Business leaders are forging ahead with their digital business initiatives, and those leaders are making technology-related risk choices every day. Increased cyber risk is real — but so are the data security solutions\n\n\nBUT DON’T BE AFRAID\nEven if a company is targeted by a powerful nation-state, it is still possible to protect critical digital assets. It takes planning and commitment of resources, but a good security operations team or a good awareness training can stay on top of most of the most serious cyber threats.\n\n\nThis course is a comprehensive friendly-introduction guide to help you understand better about information security management around the world.\nIn this course, I will help you to be able to understand :\n\n\n- Fundamental principles of cyber security, Explain the importance of cyber security, Identify cyber security threats and what stuff needs protection\n- Internet threats, Be aware of phishing, Identify best practices when browsing the Internet.\n- Email threats;Describe best practices to ensure email security.\n- Aware of how social engineering works; Identify best practices to prevent social engineering.\n- Aware of threats to your computer; Identify best practices to protect your computer;Identify security measures initiated by the IT Division of the organization.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nEveryone with no background in IT or computer science wanting to learn about Information Security\nBusiness & IT Managers Needing a Working Knowledge of Information Security\nAspiring & Inexperienced IT Professionals\nThis Course Is NOT for Seasoned & Experienced IT & Cyber Security Professionals",

Here are the key benefits of using a LAN:\nFast Data Sharing: LANs allow connected devices, like computers and printers, to share files and resources quickly. Whether you're sending documents, streaming videos, or accessing shared drives, LAN speeds make everything faster and more efficient.\nCost-Effective: Once set up, a LAN reduces the need for extra devices or duplicate resources. For example, multiple computers can share a single printer or internet connection, saving both money and space.\nImproved Communication: With LANs, devices can communicate directly with each other. This is useful for tasks like file transfers, video calls, or collaborative work, making teamwork easier and more productive.\nCentralized Data Management: LANs enable centralized storage, where files can be saved in one location and accessed by everyone in the network. This helps with data organization and ensures easier backups.\nEnhanced Security: Since a LAN is a private network, it’s easier to control access and keep unauthorized users out. You can implement security measures like firewalls and passwords to protect sensitive data.\nReliable and Stable: Wired LANs, in particular, are known for their stability and reliability. They are less likely to experience interference, making them ideal for environments where uninterrupted connectivity is crucial.",

If you don’t secure it properly, attackers will find the gaps — and it only takes one misconfigured permission to expose everything.\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) is the #1 line of defense in AWS. It decides who can log in, what they can access, and how far a breach can spread. Get IAM wrong, and you’re leaving the front door wide open.\nThis course, AWS Identity and Access Management Fundamentals, gives you the knowledge and hands-on skills to lock down your AWS environment before it’s too late.\nInside, you’ll learn how to:\nBuild and manage users, groups, and roles the right way\nWrite and apply policies that enforce least-privilege access\nAvoid the most common IAM misconfigurations that lead to breaches\nSecure root accounts, multi-factor authentication, and cross-account access\nApply IAM best practices that real AWS security pros use every day\nBy the end, you won’t just “know” IAM — you’ll be able to bulletproof your AWS account against the most common attacks and mistakes.\nWhy Take This Course?\nUrgency: Most AWS breaches start with identity mistakes. Don’t wait until yours is exploited.\nClarity: IAM is complex, but this course breaks it down step by step with real-world examples.\nConfidence: Walk away knowing you can protect your AWS environment — even if you’re new to security.\nAWS security starts here.

The focus of this course is on MPLS technology issues as those issues apply to service providers and on how to configure new features and functions in an existing routed environment.\nMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a high-performance method for forwarding packets through a network. MPLS enables routers at the edge of a network to apply simple labels to packets. This practice allows the edge devices - ATM switches or existing routers in the center of the service provider core to switch packets according to labels, with minimal lookup overhead. MPLS integrates the performance and traffic-management capabilities of data link Layer 2 with the scalability and flexibility of network Layer 3 routing. When used in conjunction with other standard technologies, MPLS allows service providers the ability to support value-added features that are critical for their networks.\n\n\nPart-02\nSegment Rouging training covers the fundamental concepts of Segment Routing (SR), how to configure and verify segment routing within an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), and the interworking of Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) with segment routing. You will learn how to implement Topology-Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA) using segment routing, and how to instantiate and verify segment routing traffic engineering policies. You will also learn how to implement segment routing within Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).",

      "description": "Welcome to this FREE course preview of the Cyber Security Threat Intelligence Researcher Certification.\nThe Cyber Security Threat Intelligence Researcher Certification will help you acquire the skills needed to find out who is behind an attack, what the specific threat group is, the nation from which the attack is being launched, as well as techniques being used to launch this attack.\nYou will know how to take a small piece of malware, find out who is responsible for launching it, the threat actor location and also how to take down that threat actor, with the support of your local law enforcement.\nIn today’s cyber security landscape, it isn't possible to prevent every attacks. Today’s attackers have significant funding, are patient, sophisticated, and target vulnerabilities in people and processes as well as technologies. With organizations increasingly relying on digitized information and sharing vast amounts of data across the globe, they have become easier targets for many different forms of attack. As a result, every company’s day-to-day operations, data and intellectual property are seriously at risk. In a corporate context, a cyber attack can not only damage your brand and reputation, it can also result in loss of competitive advantage, create legal/regulatory noncompliance and cause steep financial damage.\nToday’s secure environment will have vulnerabilities in it tomorrow, so an organization cannot allow itself to become complacent. There is only so much an organization can do by defending itself against threats that have already occurred. If an organization only reacts to new threats as they come up, are likely acting too late. It is important to understand and prioritize cyber threat intelligence processes, and how they can be integrated into an organization’s security operations in a way that adds value.\nCyber threat intelligence (CTI) is an advanced process enabling organizations to gather valuable insights based on analysis of contextual and situational risks. These processes can be tailored to the organization’s specific threat landscape, industry and market. This intelligence can make a significant difference to organizations' abilities to anticipate breaches before they occur. Giving organizations the ability to respond quickly, decisively and effectively to confirmed breaches allows them to proactively maneuver defense mechanisms into place, prior to and during the attack.\nIn this course, we’ll introduce you to the 8 phases of threat intelligence:\nHunting - The goal of hunting is to establish techniques to collect samples from different sources that help to start profiling malicious threat actors.\nFeatures Extraction - The goal of Features Extraction is to identify unique Static features in the binaries that help to classify them into a specific malicious group.\nBehavior Extraction - The goal of Behavior Extraction is to identify unique Dynamic features in the binaries that help to classify them into a specific malicious group.\nClustering and Correlation -  The goal of Clustering and Correlation is to classify malware based on Features and Behavior extracted and correlate the information to understand the attack flow.\nThreat Actor Attribution - The goal of Threat Actors is to locate the threat actors behind the malicious clusters identified.\nTracking - The goal of tracking is to anticipate new attacks and identify new variants proactively.\nTaking Down - The goal of Taking down is to Dismantled Organized Crime Operations.",

It holds a repository of multiple tools for security-related engineers including hacking wireless networks, web applications, databases, Reverse engineering, password crackers, and much more! As you can see, Kali is a versatile and powerful tool for anyone looking to do any cybersecurity-related work.\n\n\nKeep in mind this is a basics course, which means this course is a beginner’s guide to getting started in Kali…to get your feet wet. The course is broken down into several sections focusing on certain aspects of the ethical hacking process. Starting off with an overview of Kali and its use cases then offer a step-by-step walkthrough of installing Kali using VMware. Next, we teach you some important configuration settings in the distribution including configuring your network and managing services in Kali. Knowing these procedures will help you set up the proper environments when using Kali and its tools.\n\n\nWe will cover the five phases and the tools used in each phase, again this is an introduction so we may not go super in-depth but you will leave with a basic understanding of how to do things and why they are done in each phase. Because of issues with Udemy free courses being less than two hours I am not able to add additional content. However, I will be publishing more free courses. I will be publishing a more focused Course on each of the phases.\n\n\nThe goal is to provide you with basic knowledge to get you started so you can take it from there. Remember this is not a field that you have can walkthrough. You will have to grow and adapt as the environment changes.",

They are the ones who set up the spaces and port connections for every network-connected device within your building.\nIn other words, we are looking at networks from a connectivity point of view -- the viewpoint of the copper and optical fiber cabling and wireless infrastructures that are essential for communications between network devices.\nStructured cabling design is the norm for all types of commercial buildings, multi-building campuses, data centers, hospitals, universities, airports, and sports venues. Network design should be the same … structured.\nThis is an introductory course, so the network cabling infrastructure plays only a small part. Future courses will place a greater emphasis on telecommunications distribution design guidelines for commercial and data center networks. These include not only the cabling, but also the powering and cooling for network devices.\nWe know that your time is valuable. Our objective is to provide you with the maximum amount of information in a minimum amount of time, so we have tightly scripted each of the lessons.

I would introduce the program first, and explain how it works before getting into the networking labs, but the students who'd miss that first lesson always struggled to catch up.

They use this process to prevent cyber attacks and security breaches by lawfully hacking into the systems and looking for weak points.\n\n\nConfidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. The model is also sometimes referred to as the AIC triad (availability, integrity and confidentiality) to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency.\nNetwork security is the protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. It involves creating a secure infrastructure for devices, applications, users, and applications to work in a secure manner.\n\n\nWhat is Wireshark ?\nWireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. Originally named Ethereal, the project was renamed Wireshark in May 2006 due to trademark issues.\n\n\nWireshark is cross-platform, using the Qt widget toolkit in current releases to implement its user interface, and using pcap to capture packets; it runs on Linux, macOS, BSD, Solaris, some other Unix-like operating systems, and Microsoft Windows.

PRIMO PASSO: Preparati all'Attacco!\n2. SECONDO PASSO: Raccogli le Informazioni!\n3. TERZO PASSO: Scansiona la Rete!\n4. QUARTO PASSO: Enumera le Risorse!\n5. QUINTO PASSO: Identifica le Vulnerabilità!\n6. SESTO PASSO: Attacca il Sistema!\n7. SETTIMO PASSO: Attacca la Web Application!\n8. OTTAVO PASSO: Attacca la Rete Locale!\n9. NONO PASSO: Mettiamo Insieme il Tutto!\n10. DECIMO PASSO: E Adesso Cosa Faccio?\nPer ognuna di queste fasi ci appoggeremo ad un LABORATORIO che ci servirà per svolgere tutti i nostri testi in un ambiente sicuro e protetto.\nLo scopo di questo corso è quello di farti appassionare a questa materia e di spronarti successivamente ad approfondire lo studio sempre più!\nSeguendo questo corso NON diventerai un Ethical Hacker ma avrai tutti i requisiti per esserlo in un futuro molto prossimo!\nChe altro dire? In Bocca al Lupo e Buono Studio!\nAlla Prossima!",

In this particular fraud, malicious actors are using e-commerce websites which have been set up to create the false appearance of a legitimate business seeking to hire employees. Also, the fraud incorporates a popular check bouncing scam to then defraud their victims by asking that candidates deposit a fake check into their bank account, and then withdraw a portion of the deposit which candidates are then instructed to send back to the employer.\n\n\nHere students will learn how to counter Cybercrime by conducting reconnaissance on the attackers, which will familiarize students with certain tools and scripts designed for Geo-locating and GPS tracking, and social engineering techniques that are designed to gather further intelligence on our subject. Additionally, students will learn about the banking system, fake invoicing, social media, and the intelligence cycle that is used to analyze and corroborate information and data. The course will also teach students about User-Agent spoofing, ISP IP address locating, financial services and the banking system as such pertains to fake check scams, and the how attackers target their victims.",
