In this course, I will show you how to measure yourself and your horse for a saddle, what to look for in a used and new saddle, and how to care for your leather and synthetic tack (and bring an old saddle back to life). You will also learn how to adjust the fit as a young horse grows and changes shape, a rescue horse gains weight and comes into shape, as well as the changes every horse goes through as they age.\n\n\nOne of the main challenges that riders face when fitting the right saddle is finding one that suits their body type as well as their horse's. There is no gold standard when it comes to saddle sizing—every company has their own definition of gullet sizes, making it all the more difficult to find a saddle that won't pinch or rub their back and withers. In this course, you'll be sure to find a saddle that fits your horse comfortably, won't be too long for their back, and will fit you as well.\n\n\nFinally, you'll learn the red flags of buying a used saddle in person and how to revive an old saddle that fits perfectly but needs a little love. To accomplish that perfect fit, you will gain insight into the purposes of different saddle pads and how they will help you accomplish the perfect fit, especially if your horse is in training or recovering from being rescued.\n\n\nThe tools that you will learn in this course will equip you for a lifetime as an equestrian.",

Don’t spoil the fun — go hunting together!\nDo you wish your dog would listen to you on walks, rather than running after squirrels?\nTired of getting left in the dust if a cat shows up nearby?\nConcerned that your dog’s prey drive is coming between the two of you?\n\n\nConventional training protocols stifle your dog’s natural predatory behaviours through punishing or constantly forcing them to return. These restrictive protocols work against your dog’s nature and against what they want most: to go for a hunt!\nPredation is an inner need that makes your dog happy. Suppressing those natural urges is like putting an airtight lid on a boiling pot. Eventually, that pressure needs to escape, and without a proper outlet, it’s probably going to get messy.\nWouldn’t you rather use your dog’s predation motivation to improve your training and even grow your relationship with your dog?\nPredation Substitute Training (PST) is a motivation-based and need-oriented training program, designed to stop uncontrolled predatory chasing and to provide safe outlets for your dog’s natural drive.\n\n\nTo stop your dog’s predatory chasing and see real-life results, just follow the step-by-step instructions:\n· Prevention: Structure your walks to set your dog up for success\n· Predation Substitute Tools: Help your dog control their urge to chase in a healthy way.\n· Predation Substitute Games: Discover new ways to express predatory energy in a safe, controlled environment\n· Safety net: Build a strong “emergency cue” to immediately interrupt predatory chasing.\nInstead of making discipline the nagging factor that spoils the fun, this training system will help you grow as a team and go hunting together!",

The video lectures show you how to use these games to engage your dog's nose and utilise their natural sense of smell to find food, toys or other items by recognising their specific scent or odour. These fun activities will give your dog mental stimulation and satisfy their natural instincts to hunt and scavenge, by providing a safe and structured alternative.\nThe training techniques use praise (verbal encouragement) as well as food rewards or toy rewards to encourage your dog, and to motivate them so that they want to participate. The games and activities are designed to be fun and achievable for both you and your dog, and the course is perfect for beginners with no experience in dog training or scent detection training.\nThis is a clicker-free course, meaning that you don't need a clicker, or any specific knowledge of shaping techniques. Of course if you already use a clicker to mark behaviours, you can incorporate the use of your clicker into these games  :-)\nThe ten games are:\nFind Hidden Food\nFind And Fetch\nWhere's Mousie?\nOops! I Dropped It\nShell Game\nStinky Sock Trail\nHide and Seek\nFind My Keys\nShow Me The Money!\nDetector Dog\nThe course also includes a fun explanation of how odour (scent) moves in the air, and what body language your dog will show while following the odour to find the hidden food, toy or other item.\nSome of the games involve the dog fetching an item, but if your dog doesn't fetch that's fine, you can still play the games and use a Food Pod instead. There is a lecture explaining what a Food Pod is, how to teach your dog to use a Pod, and how you can use a Pod in place of getting your dog to fetch the item.",

Instead, parkour is a way to build the communication between you and your dog through fun activities. And you can win titles and ribbons along the way!

No! This course will teach you how to provide your dog with an alternative activity, that uses some of the skills and training that herding dogs require. But before commencing training for Herding, a dog needs to be able to Stay, Come When Called, and be respectful and attentive to the handler.

Why your pets sometimes seem to sense what you want? How they often appear to understand you? Wondering how you can learn to decipher all of this? How you can learn to send information to animals and also to receive information from them? Well, my friend, I’ve got you covered in this course.\nYou're in luck, my friend, because I'm going to teach you a simple step-by-step process that you can use daily to accomplish all of this. Simple, and ultimately easy enough providing that you practice regularly to develop the skills.\nHow? Well, fear not, it's a simple process. How does it work? By accessing and using energy! We look at the universal, human and animal energy fields, and at how they can work together to achieve a smooth flow of information between you and your pet. This course will show you how you can get a kick-start on this! To simplify, this course will use an image of a dog, but please know that these communication skills are applicable also to other animals, whether living on this earth or passed into spirit.\nAnd talk about flow! ... This course, designed for beginners and others who wish to review some basics around energy flow, lays out a step-by-step path for students who wish to learn to communicate with their pets and other animals and birds. How? It builds on some of the received wisdom that has been passed down from antiquity through the centuries to us, and that is related to these energy fields. The universal energy field articulates with the human and animal energy fields. The human energy field encompasses your aura and your seven major chakras that are often identified as being at the core of the human energy system. While ultimately all the chakras work together, we consider primarily the first, fourth and sixth chakras in this course. These chakras are similar in animals; in fact, it was my holistic veterinarian who first balanced my dog’s chakras. The chakras, human and animal, are considered to be the spinning wheels of energy that house our energy, receiving it into the body and sending it out. Many parts of the bodymind are often associated with the various chakras. Most of these are beyond the scope of this course, though there will be some mention of this within the course. The various energy fields are, individually and collectively, very rich resources for this course – a mother-lode!\nWant some resources for your journey? They're here for you. There are, in fact, a number of other resources also included in this course. I give you some citations for references, as I expect that some of you may wish to consult as you move through the course. This is a journey, and now it’s here for you! From initial introduction, through essentials (such as breathing techniques, grounding and heart-centeredness), to learning various communication exercises and then refining the whole process as you pull it all together in the end, this course is all about teaching students how to develop their abilities to access these wonders of the various energy fields in service of communicating with their pets and other animals. A bonus section teaches students a more advanced method of further developing their animal communication skills.\nSooo, what specifically will you be taught in this course? Well, to start, you will get an overview of the process so that you can begin to identify some areas of focus in the course. You will be encouraged to practice, with your pet or another animal if at all possible, in order to develop your skills – very easy to do, since you will have life-time access to this course.\nWant a glimpse?

      "description": "Nose work (or scent training) is such a wonderful activity to be able to do with your dog. Dogs naturally love to use their nose and it’s a fun activity.  The benefits in training your dog in nose work are HUGE!  Locating scent requires calm concentration and it also stimulates a number of your dog’s innate abilities.  It is a thoughtful activity for your dog and is mentally tiring.  A few minutes scent training and you can have a tired and calm dog without having to hit the pavements walking and exercising your dog during those cold and wet winter months.  For less confident dogs it is an avenue for them to become more confident with their surroundings, as they focus on locating the scent rather than the surroundings.  It also helps them to learn to be more independent.  For dogs that are full of energy, it is an activity to focus their energy and engage the mind.  Dogs who do not enjoy the company of other dogs can delight in participating in nose work without being concerned about interacting with another dog.  Nose work is also a great way to build teamwork and connection with your dog.  I know it is something that is going to inspire you to find more enjoyment with your dog.\nThe following is a basic run down of the steps involved in turning your dog into a sniffing super star….\na) Handler learning safe handling techniques of the scent items\nb) Teaching an alert behaviour to your dog\nc) Introducing the specific scent to your dog\nd) The nose knows – encouraging your dog to use its nose to locate scent rather than its eyes\ne) Scent searching games\nThe course uses an essential oil for the scent material, however if you do not intend to progress onto Nosework/Scent trails then you can substitute the essential oil for a different scent material.  Please ensure that whatever scent material you use is not regularly present in your dog's everyday life and you can purchase more of that specific scent material.\nDuring this course we use positive reinforcement training methods and I prefer to use food to reward your dog.  Using a toy to reward your dog builds drive or speed.  Using food as a reward builds behaviour, which is what we really want to help your dog learn the behaviours initially. This course has 20 lessons (video plus notes.)\nEnrol today to turn your dog into a super scent detective!",

It covers everything you need to know and do to keep a happy, healthy, productive flock of laying hens to produce fresh, wholesome and ethically-raised eggs. But chickens need housing too, and that's why the course also includes print-quality plans for building a portable four-season chicken coop, with step-by-step construction steps and videos for people who've never built anything much before. The design is easy and inexpensive to build, and it works in all climates. The house is small and portable, and works well with a free-range approach that gives the birds access to sunshine, fresh grass and the chance for chickens to scratch the grow and enjoy their lives. The course also delivers reliable advice on choosing, raising and caring for a backyard flock based on 20+ years experience. 9 teaching videos show critical chicken coop construction details. Whether you live in the country or have got a backyard in a town or city, keeping backyard chickens is a great way to produce food for yourself while also having a lot of fun. There’s a reason keeping backyard chickens is something more and more people are doing.",

Too much information in fact, and some of it is conflicting, and some of it is more important to understand than others.\nBecause I spent a lot of time, researching, purchasing and trying various products and methods, I came to the conclusion that one reason fleas are so difficult to get rid of is because you need to look at the problem as if it's an invasion, like a war. There are multiple battle fronts to be fought, and if you fight one while ignoring another, that one will sneak up and attack your flank.\nI want to help others learn in a few minutes what very painfully took me months. I created a cleaning system that addresses these issues. I have put into this class a short but necessary description of the individual battles you are facing in a way to help you understand the important facts and act accordingly. I have participated in animal rescue for over 30 years and never had a flea infestation because when you rescue an animal you know that fleas and ticks must be addressed before introducing that animal into another environment. That is part of the process. The fleas on my dogs were a surprise attack.",

However, it doesn’t have to be that way, as in-home nail trimming really is feasible and even preferable for the majority of dogs.\nIn this course, you will learn how to trim your own dog's nails, regardless of whether you are starting with a new puppy or an adult dog who is already uncomfortable. This course will ask you to reframe nail trimming as a process and then show you each step of the process. Modules include safety, choosing tools, positioning your dog for success, training steps, nail anatomy (including unique nail anatomy), and how to actually trim nails, all in the context of a happy and relaxed dog. We have also included bonus material about how to train your dog to \"tell\" you they are comfortable. By learning to trim your own dog's nails, you can ensure the comfort and safety of your dog as they age while also saving a ton of money (and stress) from going to the groomer.",

      "description": "This online seminar consists of six hours of video lecture by renowned animal behaviorist and dog trainer, Dr. Ian Dunbar. It has been approved for 6 continued education credits by the CCPDT, IAABC & NADOI.\n\nThis seminar will offer simple solutions for the most common dog behavior and training problems, including: housesoiling, destructive chewing, excessive barking, digging, home-alone problems (and separation anxiety), leash reactivity to other dogs, hyperactivity, jumping-up, not coming when called, pulling on leash, plus lack of attention and compliance.\nObviously, preventing predictable doggy problems is the way to go but what do we do when adolescence exuberance, distraction and the development of fears and phobias override socialization and training? How can we retrain dogs in shelters to make them more adoptable? And how do we retrain newly adopted adolescent and adult dogs?\nWhereas rehabilitating adult dogs with temperament problems (fearfulness, fighting and biting) can be extremely time consuming, especially the older the dog, behavior and training problems may be resolved at any time in a dog’s life. When training begins, good habits begin to replace bad habits. We may need different training techniques (All-or None Reward Training) to get started but otherwise, by and large, treatment protocols are virtually identical to prevention protocols. Moreover, retraining an adult dog is often much quicker than training a young puppy.\nThis is a full agenda and whereas we’ll discuss fearfulness and reactivity to other dogs unfortunately, there will not be sufficient time to discuss dogs that have serious aggression problems and have injured a dog person or another dog.\nThe seminar is suitable for both dog owners and dog professionals.",

      "description": "Have you ever wondered if your dog has what it takes to be a therapy dog?\n\n\nYou know, the dogs that go out and visit with patients in hospitals, the elderly in nursing homes, or have kids read to them at the library?\n\n\nThis course is all about helping you understand if pet therapy is a good volunteer opportunity for you and your dog.\n\n\nHi, my name is Debbie LaChusa, and I’ve been certified as a pet therapy volunteer since 2014. I’m currently certified with both of my dogs, Hope and Faith, through Alliance of Therapy Dogs. We were previously certified with Love on a Leash where I was a Visit Captain, responsible for supervising pet therapy teams-in-training, and doing training visit evaluations. I also spent three years as a member of the Love on a Leash national board of directors.\n\n\nI’ve done more than 500 pet therapy visits in a wide variety of venues, including the VA Hospital, libraries, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, health and rehab centers, memory care units, special needs classrooms, high schools, universities and colleges, and even an addiction support group.\n\n\nSo, I have a lot of experience in the pet therapy world!\n\n\nThis course will help you understand:\nWhat a Therapy Dog is, and does\nHow a Therapy Dog is different from a Service Animal and an Emotional Support Animal\nWhat traits and characteristics a therapy dog needs to have\nIf pet therapy is a good fit for your dog\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll also learn:\nThe basic dog training commands necessary to become a certified pet therapy team through a nationally recognized pet therapy organization\nAdditional dog training commands and behaviors that, while not required for certification, are helpful while doing pet therapy, to keep your dog safe and make your pet therapy visits more enjoyable for you, and the people you’re visiting\nWhat you can expect as a newly certified pet therapy volunteer\nWhat cues to watch for in your dog once you begin doing volunteer pet therapy work\nWhat to do if you discover your dog doesn’t like certain pet therapy visits\nThe answers to 16 Frequently Asked Questions about doing pet therapy\n\n\nWhile this is NOT a dog training course, every behavior and command covered is DEMONSTRATED so you can see what the behavior or command is, and how it is successfully performed.\n\n\nVolunteer pet therapy is one of the most rewarding activities you can do with your dog.\nIt’s a wonderful volunteer service to share with the people in your community. It takes your relationship with your dog to an entirely new level: you become partners and your bond deepens. You'll meet interesting people you might never otherwise meet. And, you'll experience the rewards and joy of watching the difference your dog can make, simply by spending time with those in need.\n\n\nPet Therapy Teams are In Demand\nI’ve done pet therapy in both a large city on the West Coast, and a small town in the East, and in both cases certified therapy dog teams have been in high demand. There are always more facilities wanting to schedule therapy dog visits than there are qualified therapy dog teams to fill those requests. You and your dog can help fill that demand when you become a qualified therapy dog team.\n\n\nSo, if you’ve been thinking about doing pet therapy, or even if you’re just interested in learning more about what pet therapy is, and what it entails, I encourage you to enroll.\nIt's the first step to getting your dog ready to go out and start spreading joy, love, and smiles, the way only a dog can!",

In the sport of Rally, the dog and handler move around a numbered course as a team, and perform exercises displayed on signs laid out in a specific sequence. This course covers the entry level exercises (Novice), as well as how to teach your dog to walk in the required Heel position at the handlers left side.\nAll training demonstrated uses positive reinforcement, so the activity is fun and rewarding for both handler and dog. Simple lure, praise and reward training methods are used. This course is suitable for beginners with no previous experience in dog sports. Training methods shown are clicker free and suitable for beginners - but of course you can use a clicker should you wish.\nThe course is based around the official Australian (ANKC) Rules, but the sport of Rally is broadly similar worldwide, so the techniques are applicable to anyone wanting to learn how to get started in training their dog for Rally.\nThe course covers the equipment you will need, and how to teach your dog some basic foundation skills, including rear-end awareness for neat heel positioning and accurate performance of the Rally exercises. Lectures demonstrate how to correctly use a food lure and/or a target stick to help the dog learn the positions and moves for the required exercises.  All the Australian Rally Novice Level signs are explained with full instructions on teaching the dog the exercises. Some extra exercises used outside Australia are also detailed. Lectures include how to transition the dog to work happily for longer periods of time, how to prepare the dog for entering an official Trial, and examples of Rally courses for practice purposes.",

Whether you are thinking about getting a puppy or a rescue dog, you just got one or you have an older dog and would like to train them properly then this course is for you!\nThe course \"From Puppy To Dog Training\" follows the natural process from when you first think about getting a dog all the way to a fully trained well behaved dog. This course will help you avoid a lot of the common mistakes, help you understand why your dog behaves the way it does and how to achieve the most out of life with your dog.\nPLEASE NOTE: This course does NOT include the Classic Beginner Dog Training classes. It does however go much deeper than that: it is FOUNDATIONAL, the core training of everyday life. Just like with children you can teach them how to take their first steps or tie their shoes, but without proper foundational training your child will still misbehave, not listen and even disrespect you. It's nice to make your dog sit, stay, come, heel etc. But outside of that, how would you get your dog to actually behave? This course goes over that.\n\nHere are some of the things you will learn in this course:\n5 Crucial things to consider before getting a dog or puppy.\nHow to choose the right dog or puppy for you and your family.\nWhat to expect when bringing your puppy home and 3 things you absolutely cannot do in the first few weeks.\nThe one trick that will supercharge the potty training process for your dog.\nWhen NOT to get a rescue dog.\nThe 7 Principles to Success in Training Your Dog.\nHow to introduce a puppy to your other pet(s).\nThe one crucial issue that can break the fundamentals.\nHow to train your puppy in an apartment or condo.\nThe best ways to care for your dog.\nBy following this video course step-by-step you will encounter the most effective ways to training your dog through practical application that is based on real life solutions for the every day person.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Treibball course, where I will help you learn the basics of Treibball, which will be all the keys in your hands. The essence of the sport is for the dog to get eight balls into a goal. The eight balls are set up in a triangle similar to billiards, with the dog handler staying in one place near the goal. The handler only needs to communicate with the dog by whistle, verbal commands or hand signals to push the balls into the goal. The balls must be put into the goal in a specific order and there is a time limit. Treibball is loosely based on herding trials, so herding dogs have a natural advantage in mastering the sport. However, with animal training, any breed of dog can learn and play Treibball effectively. Treibballs are 45-75 centimeters in diameter and are known as \"rolling sheep\". The playing field is 30-50 meters long and 15-25 meters wide. The right foundation is the most important thing, as in any sport. I hope you like it soon. The goal is for everyone to have the knowledge to effectively master what they see at home. You can get expert advice and learn practical techniques. New online course – without having to pay a fortune for professional help. With the right guidance and knowledge, anyone can learn. I wish you success and good learning. Giselle",
      "target_audience": [
        "The dog sport of Treibball is particularly suitable for sheepdogs and herding dog breeds, although it is equally recommended for all dog breeds. It is also suitable for older, slower-moving dogs, because it is joint-friendly. A playful sport that brings joy to all types of dogs."

There are hundreds of thousands of homeless pets. If you save even one of them, you have done something! But you don’t have to stop there if you don’t want to.\nThis book will help teach you\n• How to identify your rescue abilities and goals\n• How to start your rescuing efforts\n• Where the animals who need your help are\n• How to locate and manage a feral cat colony\n• The importance of spaying and neutering\n• What to expect if you rescue a pregnant cat\n• Feline gestation periods\n• How to handle the delivery of kittens\n• How to care for kittens in the first 8 weeks\n• How to meet and network with other cat rescuers\n• How to expand and set up a corporation for your rescue\n• The benefits of applying for 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation status for your organization\n• Tips on recruiting volunteers\n• How to request donations for your rescue\nAbout the Expert\nJust like the people I wrote this book for, my husband and I started our pet rescue efforts on a very small scale. We responded to a craigslist ad by a local rescue organization that was trying to rehome an abandoned dog. We contacted the administrator and adopted the dog. As we spoke, she gave us some back-ground on her charity and explained how many dogs and cats are abandoned and homeless, and end up being euthanized at the local shelter.\nThrough her and social media, we became more and more interested in doing our part, and basically went through the same steps I have outlined in this book. You can visit us on Facebook at PlanetNub (Nubbins was our beloved rescue cat who died at only two years of age of a severe seizure disorder). I would love to hear from you and hope you find the information in this book helpful. Thanks so much for reading it!",

In this easy and simple course you will discover a natural recipe for an at home remedy you can do once a week for your horse to help maintain a healthy gut and a shiny coat. This course features step by step instruction as well as a recipe checklist so you can help prevent colic in your horse.\n\n\nHow does this recipe help prevent colic?\nThis recipe was given to us by our trusted veterinarian in Italy a year ago after a colic scare of our own with our sensitive OTTB mare. This recipe works because it helps lubricate the gut. That way, even if your horse doesn't drink as much as they should or eat something they shouldn't, it keeps the intestines nice and lubricated to keep things moving as they should.\nIt also has an added benefit of keeping their coats nice and shiny!\n\n\nAre the ingredients expensive?\nNo! In fact you can find the ingredients from your local feed store and even grocery store.\n\n\nWhat's in this course?\nAn easy to follow recipe with step by step demonstrations as to how we prepare the meal for our horses. We do this once a week for our horses for the past 1 year and haven't had any colic scares since!\n\n\nEnroll now and get the exact recipe we use as a natural at home remedy for our horses to prevent colic.",

Starting from the basics of standard obedience training, instructor Alex Starr will teach you how to take nearly any dog and mold them into a capable and well mannered service dog in what may seem like the blink of an eye.\nUsing a tool called positive reinforcement, Alex will walk with you through the process one step at a time. You'll be surprised how quickly they'll learn! Absolutely no punishment necessary. Alex's method is human, fun for the dog, and most importantly, never uses punishment as a tactic. As it turns out, the use of rewards can dramatically transform the behavior of any functioning canine. All dogs love treats, after all. But even more than treats, their primary motivation is to please their humans. That's their real reward.\nSo if you love dogs and want to know how to unleash a dog's potential to its fullest extent, you're right where you need to be. Check it out and enroll today!",

      "description": "During this course you will learn how to get your dog started in the sport of Nose Work/ Scent Work, find out what motivates your dog, and get him or her excited to use their natural hunting instincts to find the hidden odor.\nThis Sport is great for all kinds of dogs, it builds confidence and trust and will strengthen the bond you have with your dog.\nThis course is great for newly adopted dogs and helps them become more confident in new environments, it is also a great course for dogs that need a lot of mental and physical stimulation, but have a hard time in classes with other dogs and it is perfect for dogs retiring from active sports.\nThe dogs will experience the opportunity to work without the stress of interaction with other dogs, Nose Work brings out and uses your dog's natural hunting instincts.\nWe start training by getting our dogs excited about hunting for hidden treats or a favorite toy, the dog is immediately rewarded when he/ she finds the treat or toy building even more excitement for the game. As training advanced the searches for the treats/ toys get more difficult and we add more complex problems for them to solve. In higher levels of training we take the searches outside ( Exterior Searches ) while we increase the complexity of searching inside ( Interior Searches).\nContinuing and strengthening our Foundation we add Vehicle Searches to our Routine,  the American Kennel Club even has buried Hide Searches. In these advanced searches, we start building endurance as well as discrimination between the odor \"source\" and other environmental distractions. In such searches, dogs seek specific odors ( National Association of Canine Scent Work uses sweet Birch, Anise, and Clove- the American Kennel Club also has Cypress as one of the Odors). The odors are infused on cotton swabs and hidden inside tins, straws, or other objects. Once the dog has found the object the must signal this to the handler and the handler must be trained to recognize the dogs signal.\nWith this Introduction to Nose Work course I would like to give you an inside on how to start your dog in this sport.",

They more prefer the attention or treats. But being an important grooming requirement it is up to us to provide what is needed for our dogs to have a healthy and happy life.\nTeaching our dogs to cope in inevitable stressful situations (I discuss this in episode one on my podcast \"Canine Transformation\") teaching our dogs to deal with situations that have to be done where they may object and would rather do something else. Similar to us going to the dentist or doctor. We aren't super pumped visiting them. I know I am always a bit anxious going to the dentist. How ever I benefit if I do go. I work on developing the coping methods to deal with situations like that. I believe we should teach our dogs the same kind of coping skills when dealing with situations they may not want done but will benefit them in the long run.",

      "description": "Dr. Dunbar taught the world's very first off-leash puppy socialization and training classes and he has been perfecting the SIRIUS Dog Training business model for the past 30 years. If you are a dog training professional, or you're thinking of becoming one, this is the course you simply must take.\nThe SIRIUS Academy is a structured and comprehensive course on how to run a successful dog training business. This course cuts to the chase and focuses on the essential information that you absolutely need to know in order to effectively teach people to train dogs as quickly, easily and enjoyably as possible.The full Academy consists of all 4 days of lecture, 6+ hours each, as well as substantial notes, including notes for the lectures, a Behavior Problem Solving Matrix, and the complete SIRIUS Syllabi for Puppy 1, Puppy 2, and Adult 1 classes, with week-by-week-schedules and minute-by-minute class notes. You will also get two free eBooks and 16 Behavior Blueprints which you can customize with your business information and distribute freely to clients and colleagues to aid in training and promotion.\nDay 1: Business, Promotion, People Training & GamesDay 2: Behavior CounselingDay 3: Adult Dog Classes & Home TrainingDay 4: Puppy Classes & Home Training“Whether you're new to dog training and wondering how to get started in the business, or you've been doing it for ages (like me) and you're looking for some fresh ideas to super-charge your business, this is the very best place to get what you need. I found myself taking detailed notes for some long-term changes, and then also jotting down little nuggets of gold to go home and immediately implement into my classes or business practices…This four-day event, and yes, you MUST attend all four days, offers the attendee who already has some hands-on experience with dogs everything they need to start up their own classes. Those of us who've already been running our own classes come away with many new ideas for classroom games and exercises for both puppies and adult dogs, PLUS a comprehensive, tested plan to measure and increase our success, and to market ourselves (which we could all use help with).I am so excited to make some changes! Thanks so much for everything!\"- Michelle Douglas, CPDT-KA, CDBC – Past President of the APDT",

The progress I see every day is beyond my expectations and I went into this Challenge with the bar set high. To me, this is better than a three day clinic cause I can go back and view the video again and again. What I have achieved in three weeks would normally take me a 1 1/2 year to accomplish and I'd still be running a deficit. I hummed and hawed before signing up but so very glad I did, plus I don't have to buy a $10,000+ horse to meet my needs. Thank You Steve! I'm pumped .... - Geraldine V.\nI really enjoyed how both of us had a-ha moments. She really is starting to understand how to react with pressure. With her being so sensitive I really have to be aware of what parts of me are touching her, where, how and why. It was good to have it really broken down. Thank you thank you thank you! - Jordan C.\nI think these exercises are as good for me (developing my skills) as they are for my horse! - Susan H.\nI fully enjoyed every aspect of this challenge! The detailed, daily, progressive exercises (in video as an example to follow) were motivating and helped keep me on task.

By learning what modern behavioral and cognitive science is uncovering to help better our understanding of how man’s best friend learns, adapts and communicates, you can discover how to use this knowledge to more effectively promote learning and guide your dogs into making choices that are more compatible with the world you share with them.\nInside Your Dog’s Mind explores the following:\nWhat is canine cognition?\nBreakthroughs in canine cognitive science\nCanine ethology & the canine brain\nMeasuring your dog’s intelligence\nHarnessing the power of the five cognitive dimensions\nDogs & emotions\nHow dogs learn\nCognition games & exercises for your dog\nThis course is designed for dog owners and enthusiasts of all skill levels, and while you are encouraged to at least have access to a dog so that you can participate in the many games and exercises led by Victoria, it is not required. Inside Your Dog's Mind is designed to take you beyond the world of dog training, providing you with the information, tools, and activities you need to not only help your dog more effectively learn from you, but also for you to learn from your dog.\nBy exploring how to develop the strongest possible communication system with your dog based on his/her unique traits, characteristics and learning styles, Victoria will guide you through the canine mind and help you get the most out of your relationship with your dog(s).\n\"We live in an exciting time of scientific research and discovery. The last ten years have seen an explosion in the study of canine behavior and cognition, thanks to universities and research centers around the world. The minds of dogs are being explored like never before, and the findings are proving once and for all just how intelligent, emotional, and complex dogs are. Dogs have coexisted with humans for thousands of years, and as they have adapted, so has their ability to communicate with us. By paying close attention to our vocal and physical language, dogs have evolved a rich social intelligence and a physical and vocal language as complex and subtle as our own. Like humans, dogs communicate consciously and unconsciously, using a complex language of body and vocal signals that reflect what they are thinking and feeling. These signals communicate intent and ensure dogs’ personal safety by affecting behavior in others. Understanding what dogs are saying as well as how they perceive the world will make it easier for you to understand their needs.\"\n-- Victoria Stilwell",

      "description": "If you are feeling frustrated when your dog ignores you and fear your pup can get lost or hurt if they don't come back when called... You are in the right place!\nMaybe you left the front door open by accident, and your dog ran outside. They made a mad dash straight into the street. Thankfully, you got lucky, and no cars were around. You grabbed the treat bag, called his name 100 times, and after 30 minutes, finally managed to corner them in the bushes and drag them back home.\nOr you took your pup to a dog park and became “that owner,” chasing them around the park for half an hour, looking like a fool when it was time to go home.\nThe recall is the most important aspect of dog training and you need to get it right to keep your dog safe and avoid all the worries of taking your pup places.\n\nIt's Not Your Fault\nYour struggles and challenges with a dog that ignores you are directly due to misinformation, which is why it's not your fault.\nMany dog owners go by the mantra of if at first, you don’t succeed, try, try again… and with recall that translates to calling their dog’s name several… or many… times before they come to you.\nThe truth and fact of the matter are: people don't understand how to teach something new and have your dog respond to YOU and not the treat in your hand.\nIt's a lot easier to shake the treat bag or wave a tasty piece of cheese. Isn't it?\nBut every time you call your dog, they glance at you, notice you don’t have food, and simply ignore you and go about their business, they are more likely to ignore you the next time you call them\nOr even worse, because you are in a rush to get to work... or to go back inside because it's raining, you end up running after the dog, and they learn to escape you every single time. That's a fun game of \"keep away\" that teaches your dog exactly the opposite of a recall.\nIf you need to call your dog more than twice, you’ve failed with your recall.\nBut what can you do instead?\nThe secret is to teach your dog that a verbal command actually MEANS something and it's got nothing to do with whether or not you have food in your hands.\nSo shouting your dog's name non-stop when they rush out the door or ignore you in the park with all the exciting activity going around them… it simply won't work. And will definitely create what I call \"Recall Burnout\".\n\nWhat you need is the quickest, simplest, and smartest way to get the dog of your dreams that listens and comes when called in any situation.\n\n\nI've laid out your EXACT Step-by-Step Blueprint Already!\nIt's a program that I've perfected and tested for years on thousands of dog lovers just like you, and it works virtually every single time.\nAnd I call this one-of-a-kind Program...\nThe 30-Day Recall Challenge\nIt’s the only dog training plan that allows you to have a dog that comes when called every time, no matter the distractions, all in a convenient 30-day framework.",

With all cases of aggression (regardless of cause), the first step is to determine whether or not the dog is actually dangerous. Being reactive is not the issue; all animals “react”, humans included.\nThe essential question is: Do they cause physical harm? Dog bite incidents are objectively assessed on a 1–6 scale based on wound pathology. Dog fights are assessed by calculating the Fight:Bite Ratio. Most dog bites and dog fights cause little, if any, damage and so, the prognosis is excellent for a hasty resolution via speedy classical conditioning techniques and basic lure/reward training for control and focus.\nWith severe damage though, the dog is dangerous, the prognosis for resolution is extremely poor and so rehabilitation should not be undertaken cavalierly, if at all.",

      "description": "The world of dog husbandry and training is in dire need for another quantum leap! The time is long overdue for all dog professions (breeders, veterinarians, pet store retailers, trainers and shelters/rescues) to utterly reevaluate and refocus their practices and to champion a combined focus on educating prospective and new puppy owners vis a vis puppy raising, so that puppies stay in their original homes instead of being surrendered to shelters as adolescents.\nJust as we have great owners and not so great owners, it is truly a sobering thought that, by definition, in any profession, when assessed according to any criterion, 50% of professionals fall below median. Dog owners have had an enormous impact on the improved selection of quality products offered in pet stores. As educated consumers, prospective owners can have and probably, will have, similar expectations and effects on breeders, shelters and trainers. From breeders, owners will be looking for puppies that at the very least have been housetrained, chewtoy-trained, manners trained and socialised to people. Similarly, from shelters/rescues, adopters will be searching for dogs that have been housetrained, chewtoy-trained and manners trained during their stay and are now friendlier and more confident. From trainers, puppy and dog owners will be looking for the easiest, quickest, most effective and most enjoyable training techniques that offer immediate and enormous benefits.\nWe really can’t keep blaming irresponsible pet owners if no one tells them what to do (before they make predictable and preventable mistakes). The requisite puppy-raising educational materials are readily available but they need to be universally distributed (via email) by all dog professions to all other dog professions and eventually, to all dog owners. Some dog owners might get another puppy. More likely though they will know a friend or neighbor who is searching for one and so, pass along the information. Additionally, put the materials on your company website for free download.\nThe educational materials may be customized with your business name and contact information and so, you may brand your dog business in the community as the one trying to make a difference. Remember, it only takes just one dedicated and persistent person to cause a change. Disseminating information is so doable these days given the technological advances in social media.\nDr. Dunbar has created a number of Behaviour Programs for Dog Professionals to evaluate practices and to coordinate and accelerate the distribution of educational materials to prospective and new puppy owners.\n1. To encourage Breeders to at least housetrain, chewtoy-train, teach basic manners and socialise their litters and especially, to preferentially breed for longevity. Longevity is the best indicator of physical and behavioural health. It is simply not right that so many pure-bred dogs predictably die so young.\n“A live dog is better than a dead lion.” Ecclesiastes 9\n2. To encourage Veterinary Practitioners to take full advantage of their most unique and enviable position of seeing every breeder, most prospective puppy owners (existing clients) and nearly every new puppy owner on several occasions when puppies are brought in for immunization shots. This is the optimal time for puppies and their owners to receive an educational vaccine. Of all the dog professions, veterinarians have by far the best opportunity to prevent the development of utterly predictable and easily preventable dog behavior and temperament problems. “It is easier to build strong puppies than to repair broken dogs.” (With apologies to Frederick Douglas.)\n3. To encourage Pet Store Retailers to disseminate the same educational materials (i.e., instructions for use of dog products) to prospective or new puppy owners that come to purchase food and supplies. For example, puppy owners need to know why they are buying a dog crate — to prevent mistakes around the house, to autoshape chewtoy chewing and to predict when the puppy needs “to go” so that it can be taken to a toilet area and trained to eliminate on cue.\n4. To encourage all Shelters/Rescues to adopt an in-house, behavior and training programme, such as Open Paw — at the very least including, housetraining, chewtoy-training, basic manners and ongoing socialization with people and other dogs. Simply housing dogs in cages is not sufficient. For example, without regular toilet breaks, a previously housetrained dog will be forced to soil its living area. Sheltering is supposed to make homeless dogs more adoptable, not less adoptable. But even more important, shelters/rescues must strive to stop the problem at the cause and so, reduce shelter input. Of all the dog professions, with their enormous mailing lists, animal charities have the best opportunity to disseminate puppy-raising materials to dog people.\n5. To encourage Dog Trainers to be the people that catalyse the change in their communities by being more proactive in promoting their businesses and at the same time, educating prospective and new puppy owners by emailing the educational materials to all clients, all other dog professionals, all local media and to anyone and everyone.",

In 14 years I handled more than 1000 cats. For all these rescued cats I found homes with loving families and I solved various behavior problems.\n\n\nIn my rescue activity I always have to deal with a few cats at once and I always have to find solutions for cat behavior and temperament problems. Like humans, cats have emotions that may affect their behavior.\n\n\nThe good news is that cat behavioral problems can be managed with a little help. In these 14 years of experience with cats and kittens I have learned how to handle cat behavior problems and I have some secrets that I have discovered and I want to share them with you.",

      "description": "Have you recently adopted a cat or a kitten? Congratulations! In this course, you can learn how to keep your cat happy and healthy and how to understand your cat’s behavior. Cats are affectionate and playful pets and they develop best when their health, environmental and dietary needs are carefully considered. Whether you’ve just adopted a new pet or you’ve had animals your whole life, there are surely care tips that you didn't know - but should. Have a calm area in your home with your pet’s bed or blanket, some toys, and a water bowl, where your pet can feel safe and can easily take naps during the day. This can help your pet to self-soothe during stressful situations, like parties, a baby crying, or thunderstorms. If your pet was crate trained as a rescue pet or when joining your family, keeping their crate open and available even after they no longer need it for training may provide them with a perfect place just for them that they’ll love to have. Don’t feed your pet human foods on purpose unless recommended by your veterinarian. Some human foods may be recommended intentionally by your vet for specific reasons such as digestive upset, as highly motivating training treats, or diarrhea, in small quantities. In this course, you will learn more about the domestication and evolution of cat breeds. You will understand when and why cats were domesticated by humans and how they were selected to create the beautiful breeds that exist today. You will understand the characteristics of the main cat breeds and be able to decide which of them would fit your personality best. Since cats are independent animals, they also need a degree of freedom. Some cats are used to roaming around outside, while others are used to living inside a house or a flat. As an owner, you will learn how to offer your cat the maximum amount of freedom according to the situation. Before bringing a cat home, the house should be prepared, so that it is properly furnished to receive the new pet. You will learn what furnishings cats need and how to turn your home into a place your cat will love. Although training is traditionally reserved for dogs, and most people consider cats to be too stubborn and independent to accept training, yet, a basic training, concerning feeding times, behavior, and toilet is necessary and cats do learn specific behaviors if properly trained to do so. Feeding the cat is also a very important aspect any owner should consider. Since the anatomy of a cat differs from that of a human, it is not recommended to feed a cat human food, since it might not get the proper nutrients from human food. This course will give you tips on the care of cats at all ages. Kittens, adult cats and old cats have different needs and should therefore be taken care of differently. Another important aspect to be discussed is the health of your cat. There are some common cat diseases and it is important to understand what the most common cat health issues are and how to treat them. Cats are and will remain fascinating creatures and humans will always offer them a warm home and a lot of love.",

      "description": "Why is growing your dog’s self-confidence so important? Well, it allows your dog to live its best life. Replacing stress and anxiety by growing your dog’s confidence brings out the true personality of your dog. When we grow a dog’s self-confidence in one area, through fun training, activities and games, it has a flow over effect into other areas of the dog’s life.\nThe course is based on the principle of 'training for the situation, not in the situation', starting the activities at home, then building up layers of success. One of the most important aspects to growing your dog’s confidence is training and playing games in an environment that is fun and relaxing (ie not stressful) for you and your dog.  When your dog experiences a new/novel object or activity in a familiar safe home environment, it is much easier to grow his/her confidence compared with being in the stress and anxiety of the unpredictable outside world.  At the end of the course we discuss how to build up the layers of success and growing your dog's confidence in the wider world.\nDuring the course we use positive reinforcement training methods and I prefer to use food to reward your dog.  Using a toy to reward your dog builds drive or speed.  Using food as a reward builds behaviour, which is what we really want to help grow your dog's confidence.\nYou don't need to purchase any special equipment for the activities.  I have tried to give you alternative and household items that can be used.  The activities covered don't require a lot of space, can be done inside or outside and are in fun, short and effective sessions.\nThe course is divided up into 6 weeks and each week has 4 sessions.  Each session contains a video and downloadable written notes.",

      "description": "“Pit Bull 101” traces the loveable Pitbull from its historic ancestry to today. The dog’s pedigree, genealogy, and temperament are illustrated. Pitbulls have been the subject of adverse legislation illegal operations, and public disquiet. By learning about the Pitbull, you will find that they are not dangerous, vicious, or difficult to train.\nPitbulls have a varied history. They are not fighting dogs but rescue dogs, police dogs, dogs used for care, and support dogs. They will love you, unconditionally and be your most loyal friend.\nAt one time in America’s history, Pitbulls were known as America’s dog. They were on war posters for WWI and WWII, the face of Buster Brown shoes, and known as nanny dogs. You have seen the Pitbull running with the Little Rascals and as a part of Rachael Ray’s dog food commercial.\nThe Pitbulls reputation was horribly damaged by magazine articles, media prejudice, and the story of Michael Vick and his dogfighting project. Yet, these dogs that were horribly abused and tortured became happy and loving family pets and mascots. The Michael Vick tragedy changed the face of dog rescue. Fighting dogs are no longer indiscriminately “put down.”\nThe care and feeding of a Pitbull are outlined in the book. These same training techniques, feeding, and scheduling tips can be used for any dog, and if you are diligent and consistent, these tips will provide you with a Pitbull who will outlive any other breed.\nNow there are rescue societies and groups who understand what a Pitbull is, and they are working diligently to repair this breed’s reputation. Own a Pitbull, and you will find that they are awesome dogs.",

I recommend this course to all dog owners.\" — Susan Bertram, DVM\n\"One of the 10 Coolest Online Courses of 2019\" — Mental Floss magazine\n\n\nThis unique course is modeled on The Safe Dog Handbook  to arm you with the skills, resources and knowledge to protect your pups in the real world; react confidently and intelligently in a life-threatening emergency; and enhance your profile credentials to help you stand out in the highly competitive marketplace of pet care providers.\nMy approach to dog safety has been praised by top veterinarians, pet insurance companies, national humane organizations and countless dog parents. You'll learn the same skills I cover in my hands-on workshops and more — because here on Udemy, I'm also able to incorporate  amazing teaching tools such as video clips of real emergencies, guest experts and a bonus e-book download. Plus plenty of adorable dog action!\nYou'll learn:\nHow to perform pet CPR, plus life-saving first aid skills for  choking, heatstroke, bleeding, car accidents, accidental poisonings and more\nHow to read a dog's vital signs\nHow to handle encounters with aggressive dogs while out walking\nHow to spot a bloating dog\nWhich car restraints provide the best protection\nWhat apps and numbers to have on your smartphone\nHow to create a dog-safe home and outdoor environment\nHow to prevent accidents and prepare for a successful outcome BEFORE an emergency happens\nExtra precautions for puppies\n\n\nThe course is broken up into concise, single-topic lessons, so you can go at your own pace. The format includes video demonstrations with my beautiful senior Labrador Taiga, lectures, hands-on practice exercises, and printable handouts. When appropriate,  I provide deeper explantations about various emergencies so you'll not only learn how to spot the signs and what actions to take, but also WHY you're doing it — to help you better retain the knowledge and skills to react in a stressful situation. I worked closely with leading vets throughout the development of this course to ensure that each lesson, demonstration and handout is accurate, up-to-date and veterinarian-approved.\n\n\nPlease note that each student will receive a certificate of completion issued by Udemy upon completion of the course.\nI am no longer able to issue personal certificates from The Safe Dog on this platform — they are only available when the course is purchased through my training website.\n\n\n*Group discount rates available for pet businesses — contact melanie@thesafedog.com for details!\n\n\n**This course is not intended to replace veterinary advice. Always seek prompt veterinary care in an emergency. While every caution was taken to provide safe recommendations based on the standard accepted methods of pet first aid, it is impossible to predict the outcome of their use. Melanie Monteiro assumes no liability for any harm arising from the use of these techniques, and students should exercise personal judgement when applying them. Woof!",

It also makes him more versatile, agile, adjustable, and comfortable to sit upon.\nWhen we train with the carrying idea in HIS mind....namely his own discipline...his own \"desire to advance the load\"*...we end up with a really useful, rideable horse -- and also a really happy one.\nWe train 100% 'by the book'.  To that end, an horseman's reading list and Bibliography is provided.  The reason we adhere to this policy is because there is a lot of watered-down and merely- partially-right riding and training in the horseworld.  All on-line students and on-site riders are taught to verify items we discuss.  Riders check every doctrine that's trained;   and they themselves enforce the policy to ride 'by the book'.   The horses deserve this.\nOff we go!\n\n\n*quote from GYMNASIUM of the HORSE by Gustav Steinbrecht p. 71....which is the page that cites the renowned and beloved 2 Golden Rules of Riding:  \"...Ride your horse forward and set him straight...\"\n\n\n1.  Carry GO Forward; 2.  Carry-On; 3.  The TURN and Curved-Lines; 4.  HALT & Half-Halt (i.e. Stop-Slow)",

      "description": "Introduction\nAre you a city dweller who wants to adopt a dog and not sure where to start?  Or have you recently adopted a dog and would like a simple plan to help your dog adjust to city life?  Perhaps you're moving to a city with your dog and are not sure what to expect? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, you’ve come to the right place!\n\n\nI’m Christina - a dog lover and urban pet parent. In the Spring of 2024, I adopted my rescue pup Thor and brought him home to live with me here in New York City. Even though I grew up with dogs in the suburbs, I quickly learned that having a dog in a big city is a different animal! This is mainly because we live in a small apartment in a densely populated neighborhood that’s constantly buzzing with activity.\n\n\nIn my experience, being an urban pet parent requires a slightly different approach than having a dog in the ‘burbs. There are resources and practices around having a city dog that I was not aware of until I had one! Things I wish I had known about and planned for before I brought Thor home.\n\n\nI’m a small business owner with a busy schedule. Due to Thor’s unique situation, I rushed to adopt him and did not do a lot of homework or planning ahead of time. I ended up having to figure a lot of things out “on the fly” after I brought Thor home. This made the acclimation period more work than it needed to be because I was doing the prep work and acclimating him at the same time.\n\n\nI needed a way to integrate Thor into my life that was practical and easy. Initially, I sought some professional advice and adapted it into an overall plan that keeps Thor happy and healthy while also meshing well with my lifestyle.\n\n\nThe end result is that I developed an acclimation plan and routine that gradually introduced Thor to an urban environment while giving him what he needs to be happy and healthy. It worked better than I imagined it would! Thor loves city life and has adjusted beautifully. We regularly receive compliments from people on the street about how well behaved he is while out on our walks. The point here is if I can do it, so can you.\n\n\nWhat you’ll learn\nThis course is perfect for first-time urban dog parents because it’s taught by one. I created it so that I can share what worked for me so you don’t have to figure it out all on your own. I’ll give you tips and simple steps that you can use to integrate your new dog into your life that are easy to put into practice and really work. Many of these practices you can continue to do for the lifespan of your dog.\n\n\nI will cover some of the less frequently discussed yet important topics that are key to plan for when bringing a new dog into your urban lifestyle. Things that I had never thought about before I had a dog in the city - the practical, day-to-day aspects of urban dog ownership including how to:\n· Research the dog policies in your area and resources that can help you comply\n· Navigate the common spaces where you live with your dog\n· Set up a simple routine that minimizes urban stressors and helps your dog adapt\n· Identify and screen companies that can provide urban dog care when you need it\n· Develop a plan for socializing, exercising and transporting your dog in the city, and\n· Find dog-friendly types of transportation in your city\n\n\nA lot of these practices can also be used outside of your city; I’ve just found they work particularly well in an urban environment.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to…\n· Find resources to help you comply with local dog rules and regulations\n· Navigate through tight public spaces in your apartment building with your dog with ease\n· Build your own network of urban dog care professionals\n· Apply different strategies to help your new dog acclimate to city life\n· Develop a plan for socializing, exercising and transporting your dog in the city\n\n\nHow this course is taught\nI designed this course for busy city dwellers like you – I kept it short (under an hour) and simple (covers the essentials). Each course module is 5 minutes or less. I use one highly visual PowerPoint slide to cover the key points in each module and also provide real-life examples of things I do regularly with Thor that really work.\n\n\nFor example, in the course overview, I demonstrate how I use a “homemade“ slow feeder with Thor. I explain what a slow feeder is, where I heard about it, what the purpose of it is, show you how I use it with Thor and the results. It could not be easier to set up and use and it works consistently well. I’ll also talk more in-depth about our off-peak routine and how we navigate the common spaces within our apartment building as well as lots of other topics.\n\n\nAt the end of each segment, I also provide optional readings that you can find online to further enhance your learning. I’ve also included a few checklists to help you stay organized as you go through some of the initial stages of dog adoption and acclimation.\n\n\nBenefits\nMy goal is to help make having a dog in the city feel within reach for those who have not yet adopted a furry friend and enjoyable for those who are still finding their footing with their new city pup.\n\n\nIf you’re a busy urban professional like me you’ll appreciate the simplicity of my approach. Each course segment breaks concepts down into manageable steps that are easy to follow. You’ll gain knowledge and practical tips that are simple to put into place from day one that work. Things that will make the acclimation process easier and set the foundation for some practices that you can use over the long-term.\n\n\nWe’ll learn how to go from a tentative city dweller who is thinking about adopting a dog into a confident urban dog parent who’s got a gameplan and resources lined up for their new dog.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be more prepared for your new dog. Every dog and dog-parent relationship is a little different- the idea is that you can take my process and adapt it for your own new pup. I’ll help you plan and provide guidance on things to put into motion in advance that will help make your life easier. You’ll also have an action plan that is easy to follow because it was developed by someone who was in a similar situation recently.\n\n\nFrom my perspective, if you prepare ahead and have a plan from the start, things will fall into place more easily. You’ll have more peace of mind knowing that you’ve got it covered.\n\n\nI’ll also make myself regularly available to answer your questions about the course and other urban dog parenting questions you have. I may also provide additional resources depending on your questions.\n\n\nSo please sample the free previews to get a sense for the practical tips you’ll learn in this course and join us as we help you embark on your city dog journey.",

      "description": "Dr. Dunbar's Off-Leash Reliability & Games Workshops have brought back some sparkle, some excitement, and some razzle-dazzle to pet dog training, all while helping owners achieve huge improvements in reliability with their dogs. Training your dog while off-leash in an exciting and distracting environment makes it much more likely that they will follow your instructions in other distracting situations as well.\nGames are extremely enjoyable for dogs and they often bring out the best performances. Dogs are highly motivated because their owners are highly motivated, excited and animated.\n\nAll of Dr. Dunbar's games are designed to improve the quality of the relationship between dogs and their people and each individual exercise or game is specifically designed to fine-tune essential ingredients of your dog's training repertoire. The prospect of playing games motivates owners to practice. For some owners, heeling and sit-stay homework is not very exciting, but many will stay up to the wee hours to practice for Doggy Dancing or Musical Chairs.\nIn addition, playing games is an enjoyable and non-threatening way to objectively quantify performance and fine-tune all basic obedience skills, including attention, position changes, stays, following, heeling, and precision work.\nTurning training into games and quantifying responses with a stopwatch or tape measure, enables pet dog trainers to remind owners to celebrate with the dog each time they surpass a personal best. Nothing motivates owners more than when they see that they are improving, even with baby steps, and nothing advertises that you're a great pet dog trainer than the dog's progressive improvement.\nGames make it easy and fun to quantify behavior and training, and quantifying your dog's responses allows you to prove whether or not your training methods are working, exactly how well they are working and when you surpass a personal best performance.",

Within the second lecture, I shall introduce you to unsafe foods and provide you and your piggy with three menus containing nearly 100 foods with guidelines on recommended quantities. Next, I’ll share essential advice on hay, pellets, supplements and furthermore, which commonly-used ingredients to beware of in shop-purchased treats. From this series, you can take away, my own multiple food lists, guidance notes and a bonus Guinea Pig Weight tracker sheet for you to download and print at home.\n\n\nLecture Series 2: A Beginner's Guide to Guinea Pig Grooming\nLecture 1: How to Bathe a Guinea Pig\nLecture 2: How to Trim Guinea Pig Nails\nLecture 3: The Essential Brushing & Trimming Guide\n\n\nWe all know they are worth it but, how do we groom them best and with care? Should we even bathe our piggies at all? Let this step-by-step course help you learn how to become a pro at bathing, drying, cutting hair and even, the sometimes tricky, perfect manicure.\n\n\nLecture Series 3: Safe & Unsafe Toys for Guinea Pigs\nLecture 1: Why are Toys Necessary for Guinea Pigs?\nLecture 2: Unsafe Toys for Guinea Pigs\nLecture 3: A Guide to Safer Toys for Your Guinea Pigs\n\n\nPerhaps surprisingly for some, this lecture series is to me, absolutely crucial and offers some possibly life-saving tips when it comes to piggy toys. I shall provide essential information on which ones are best to avoid or adopt and we shall study why toys are so important to a piggies overall well-being.\n\n\nAn Essential Guide on Cognition & Piggy Behaviour: From Wheeks to Preventing Fights\nLecture 1: Decoding Your Piggy: Cognition, Body Language & Vocal Expressions\nLecture 2: Decoding Your Piggy: Further Insights into Key Body Language\nLecture 3: Decoding Your Piggy: How to Spot & Prevent Fights\n\n\nHere you will discover the essentials of piggy cognition, behaviours, vocalisations and what specific body language can communicate to yourself and other piggies. This information will eventually lead you to a third, longer lecture on understanding when and why piggies are at war and tips and tricks on what to do next.\n\n\nLecture Series 5: From Homes to Healthcare: A Piggy Guide\nLecture 1: Home Sweet Home: An Essential Guide on Piggy Enclosures\nLecture 2: Home Sweet Home: An Essential Guide on Piggy Bedding\nLecture 3: The Essential Guide to Piggy Healthcare\n\n\nFinally, before you purchase that enclosure or bedding delve into these lectures to know which ones to avoid, especially for your piggies' health, and which ones are much better options for a home sweet home life. Afterwards, let me teach you the importance of daily health checks and common ailments and many practical preventive measures you can adopt at home. From recognising signs of diabetes, skin issues, stones, heart disease, pneumonia, ear infections, and much more, this lecture serves as an essential guide for piggy healthcare. I will also introduce you to a printable resource I have created titled the Guinea Pig Care Checklist, which will honestly, help make your daily tasks much more manageable.\n\n\nI do so hope you decide to join me on this course, and if you already have piggies – tell them they are welcome to join.\n\n\nI’ll see you there!",

And of course, training should be fun — for dogs, owners and the trainer. Why not?",

      "description": "Are you an animal lover who feels a deep connection to your furry, feathered, or scaled companions?\nDo you want to learn a gentle, loving way to support their well-being through energy healing?\n\"Reiki for Animals: Because Their Spirit Deserves Balance Too\" is a heart-centered course designed to teach you how to offer Reiki to animals with respect, compassion, and skill. Whether you’re a Reiki practitioner, a pet owner, or simply someone who feels called to help animals heal, this course will guide you every step of the way.\nIn this course, you’ll learn:\nHow Reiki works with animal energy systems\nHow to offer hands-on and distance Reiki safely and effectively\nHow to recognize when an animal is open to receiving Reiki\nHow to support animals with stress, anxiety, physical pain, and emotional trauma\nWays to help animals during life transitions, including end-of-life care\nEthical practices to honor animal autonomy and consent\nYou’ll also deepen your intuitive connection with animals, learning to listen beyond words and build trust through energy.\nThis course is designed for all experience levels. You don’t need to have formal Reiki certification to begin — just an open heart and a love for animals.\nThrough a blend of teachings, practical exercises, and compassionate guidance, you’ll gain the confidence to offer healing energy to animals in a way that is safe, respectful, and truly meaningful.\n\n\nReiki for Animals – Beginner Q&A\n\n\nQ: What if I don’t feel like Reiki is “working” when offering it to an animal?\n\nA: It's totally normal to feel unsure at first—especially if you don’t feel strong sensations. But remember: Reiki always flows where it’s needed, even if it feels subtle or invisible. Animals are incredibly sensitive to energy, and even when they seem calm or unaffected, they may be deeply receiving and processing. Trust the process, stay present, and know that with time and consistency, both you and the animal will begin to notice shifts in energy, behavior, or emotional state.\n\n\nQ: Why does an animal walk away during a Reiki session—am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: Not at all! Animals are intuitive and know what they need. Walking away is often a sign that they've received enough energy for the moment. Respecting their boundaries is a key part of ethical Animal Reiki practice. They may come back later or simply process the healing from a distance. Always honor their consent and let them lead.\n\n\nQ: Can Reiki cause an animal to behave differently afterward?\n\nA: Yes, and that’s often a good thing! After a session, animals may become more relaxed, sleepy, playful, or even temporarily emotional. These are natural signs of energetic release or rebalancing. Be gentle, give them space, and observe. These shifts usually settle into a greater sense of peace and ease.\n\n\nQ: What if I feel overwhelmed by sensations while offering Reiki to animals?\n\nA: It's common to feel warmth, tingling, or emotional sensitivity during a session. If the energy feels intense, take a few deep breaths, ground yourself (visualize roots growing from your feet into the Earth), and set the intention to release any excess energy afterward. Remember, you’re a channel—not the source—and you can adjust your energy flow anytime.\n\n\nQ: How does learning Animal Reiki benefit me long-term?\n\nA: Animal Reiki isn’t just for the animals—it transforms you, too. You’ll develop greater empathy, patience, intuitive awareness, and a deeper connection with all living beings. This course gives you tools to support animals with love and intention, whether they're your pets, rescues, or animals in your care. It’s a lifelong gift that keeps giving.\n\n\nQ: I’ve never worked with animal energy before—can I still take this course?\n\nA: Absolutely! This course is designed for beginners and animal lovers at all levels. If you’re open-hearted and willing to learn, you already have what it takes. Everything you need will be explained in a clear, step-by-step way, and you’ll be guided gently through the process.\n\n\nQ: How is this Animal Reiki course different from others?\n\nA: This course blends traditional Reiki principles with a modern, intuitive approach to working with animals. It goes beyond technique—offering real-world examples, ethical guidance, and emotional depth. You’ll learn how to honor animal autonomy, support them through stress or illness, and become a calm, healing presence in their lives.\n\n\nQ: What makes now the right time to begin learning Reiki for animals?\n\nA: Animals need healing energy more than ever—whether they're dealing with anxiety, trauma, aging, or simply needing comfort. By starting now, you’ll gain skills to support animals in your life with love and confidence. You’ll also deepen your own spiritual growth and connection to the natural world.\n\n\n\n\nJoin us and discover how you can be a source of comfort, peace, and healing for the beautiful animals who share our world.\n\n\nEnroll today and begin your journey as an Animal Reiki practitioner!",

Now they get to chase rabbits and sprint down streams while going outdoors. They will come when called and behave for their safety. In return, our relationships with them improve.

'science in eMOTION', and outlines the pathway that having the mindset of a dog GUARDIAN has; not just on a local level within our own communities, but also on a global scale.\nDr Lisa uncovers her groundbreaking theory 'science in eMOTION' and explains how your human emotional state affects your ability to reconnect with your dog which ultimately affects your dog's mental and physical health and welfare.  This is especially critical when we consider the two 'types' of dog 'trainers' - those that use CURRENT BEST PRACTICE science based methods like positive reinforcement and reward based training... and those who use old science based on methods like punishment and aversive methods like shock collars or 'e' collars, prong collars, choke chains and other intimidating methods that inflict pain, anxiety, and fear in dogs.\nDr Lisa reminds us that whilst science may help us in many ways, science provides only techniques and methods or ways of doing things... science is not designed to provide scientists or humans with the ability to align our 'knowledge' with a higher intelligence so we can gain wisdom.   Dr Lisa's unique theory 'science in eMOTION' uncovers the simple way of gaining this wisdom through the universal concept of GUARDIANSHIP.  Dr Lisa also reveals how this simple yet effectual concept provides a UNIVERSAL WAY FORWARD for the veterinary industry, the dog training industry, the dog breeding industry, and for every human that has a dog in their life... this universal way forward ultimately raises our human collective consciousness simply by living the mindset of a dog GUARDIAN.",

Better communication builds trust, improves the quality of life, encourages innovation, increases engagement, and reduces conflict.\nLearn effective exercises to quickly quiet mind-chatter so you can hear what horses are saying. Approach your animal in a certain way and they can help you find an expanded awareness. Learn how to open doorways to peace, harmony, compassion, and understanding.\nWhen we are in this realm of expanded awareness, we understand animals and humans expressing their own innate beauty without needing to manipulate them to make them different from what they are. In this state of present self-acceptance, we are able to accept ourselves and others as the unique creations we are in this moment. This is where true communication lives, in harmony with our authentic selves as we exist as an essential part of nature.\nThis course will get you on the path to creating a relationship based on authenticity, empathy, trust, and love with your horse, dog, cat, or any loved one.\n\nThe course includes nearly 6 hours of video and audio exercises contained within 77 lectures.

      "description": "Many might be wondering how it is possible for me to work in so many foreign countries and strange lands as an equine professional. I have traveled my fair share, having worked Internationally with horses for the past eleven years in nearly a dozen countries and covering countless states from east to west. Every time I travel to a new country I am thrown into a new mix of languages, cultures, and native dialects. In Italy they speak Italian, in Romania they speak Romanian, Egypt they speak Arabic…you get the point.\nAlthough the humans may speak different languages and practice different religions and customs, there is one thing I’ve learned never changes: The language of the horse. No matter how far my travels have taken me, from the Pyramids to the Taj Mahal, horses speak horse.\nLearn the language of the horse, and with it you can travel to the farthest corners of the planet and be able to communicate fluently with all walks of horses. From the Akhal-Teke’s in Turkey to the Marwari’s in India or the Icelandic ponies from Iceland. Communicating with horses is about body language and energy. Once you master the art of understanding your equine friend with your energy and breath, you will find that no matter the type of saddle you ride in or the discipline, you will be able to bond with horses on an energetic and subconscious level. You will hear them whisper.You will feel their movements and body through you. You will know their emotions, their spirit and their voice. You will be able to earn their trust and loyalty even when you are new and unfamiliar to them.\nIn this course you will master the art of communicating in YOUR HORSE'S LANGUAGE.\nIn This Course You Will Learn:\nHow to Do Groundwork exercises\nLearn the theory behind horse's \"energy\"\nPractical exercises to practice with your horse\nHave riding lessons on how to carry over your communication skills in the saddle\nPlay games with your horse to get them engaged and more confident\nMaster your body language and energy\nBuild confidence\nHave fun with your horses and earn their trust!\nMaster leading, lunging to a more advanced level\nBe able to work with young or spooky horses confidently\nProblem solve\nHorse training and the difference between \"riding\" and \"sitting\"\nBreathing exercises to help train the trainer\nAwareness and mindfulness with horses\nPsychotherapy - which many might think your able to \"read horses minds\" and do horse telepathy! But there's no magic tricks here, you will learn the tools to simply know what your horse is thinking!\nAnd more!\nLearn from your trainer: Krystal Kelly - International FEI II Showjumping and Dressage Coach. Krystal is the ONLY FEI certified coach from the USA and has worked internationally in over 20+ countries and THOUSANDS of students and horses around the globe!

Welcome to Classical In-Hand Work for Horse Strength & Mobility, a step-by-step introduction to the time-honored art of classical groundwork.\nThis course is designed for horse lovers, riders, and trainers who want to understand how to support their horse’s physical and mental development through thoughtful, biomechanically sound exercises done from the ground. You’ll learn how to guide your horse with precision and softness, using clear body language, proper positioning, and a focus on correct movement.\nBut this course goes beyond technique.\nYou’ll discover how the horse’s body and spirit are deeply connected, and why we take the nature of the horse as the foundation of all training. Understanding your horse’s emotional state, rhythm, and individual structure is key to building a sound, willing partner—one who feels safe, proud, and free in their body.\nWe’ll introduce flexibility and softening exercises first taught by masters like Baucher over a century ago, which are still used today to help horses release tension and develop a supple neck and spine. These exercises are gentle but powerful tools to improve your horse’s mobility—and with it, their overall well-being.\nThroughout this course, you will:\nLearn what correct posture and movement really look like in the horse\nUnderstand how the front and hind legs function differently—and why it matters\nPractice classical exercises that support suppleness, straightness, and engagement\nDevelop your timing, feel, and awareness on the ground\nSupport your horse’s long-term soundness, confidence, and pride\nWhether your horse is young, older, in training, or in rehab—this course will give you a calm, effective way to support their body and mind without the need for advanced equipment or a fancy arena.\nLet’s begin this journey toward a healthier, stronger horse—one thoughtful step at a time.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This course is for educational purposes only.

      "description": "If you have just adopted a cat or kitten, or if you have had cats for many years, you probably have a lot of questions about all the traits that make a cat such a wonderful companion. Cats are relatively low maintenance and they are also easy pets to care for. People love cats for many reasons, they are fun, playful, cute, amusing, loving, smart, curious and the list goes on. You’re probably familiar with the basics of grooming, feeding, litter boxes, general health, and safety. When you look at your kitten or cat, you are probably wondering about the role of the whiskers, of the small pouch on the back of their ears, about their wonderful balance, their agility, their capability of seeing so well in the dark or of being such fierce predators. A cat’s ears and tail are a great indicator of how a cat is feeling. But besides communication, they also play an important role in maintaining the cat’s balance. The sandpaper-like texture of their tongue is scratchy due to some small barbs that cover its surface, called papillae. They are designed to gather the fur and dirt from their coats, and also help them drink water and rip the flesh off the bones of the prey. This and many other interesting cat anatomy facts will be discussed in this course, which is meant to give you a better understanding of your beloved cat.\nIn this course, we will dive deeper into understanding your cat’s unique anatomy, which plays a key role in their behavior, health, and overall well-being. From their finely tuned senses to the powerful muscles that allow them to leap and climb, we’ll explore how every part of your cat's body contributes to their incredible abilities.\nYou’ll learn how their keen sense of sight, hearing, and smell work together to help them navigate their environment and interact with you. We will also cover the structure of their paws and claws, which play an essential role in both their physical prowess and their communication methods.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how your cat’s anatomy shapes their behavior, allowing you to bond more closely with your pet while keeping them happy and healthy. Whether you're a first-time cat owner or a seasoned enthusiast, this knowledge will deepen your appreciation for your feline friend.",

      "description": "Welcome to Agility for Newcomers course, I hope you enjoy it and it sets you and your dog on the right paw with your agility venture. Whether its for fun or you'd like to compete, safety is paramount.\nWith agility becoming more and more popular, lots of shops are now starting to sell equipment cheaply and with no instructions on how to set up and train your dog. So this is where this course comes in. I will show you how to set your equipment up, with the correct spacing between each obstacle. How high your dog should be jumping, when they are old enough too. No dog should be jumping full height agility jumps until they are at least a year old.\nI will also show you how to train your dog to use the contact equipment (dog walk, see-saw, A-Frame) and discuss the different methods of training weaves. I will also show you how to use channel weaves so your dog will be able to do them independently.\nAlso there is the all important gridwork that they must start off with when learning agility and wen we practice our contacts we only need to use a contact trainer, which I also show you how to make.",

Prehab is diverse and includes not only an exercise plan to reduce muscle loss, but also other aspects of the life, like ensuring the owner knows how to prepare the home for the post op care and make sure they are ready for what they may have to go through.\n\n\nAs an animal lover and career or worker in the veterinary and rehabilitation industry, its important to see how we can support owners more, and in turn increase the successful outcome for the patients going through surgery\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn what prehab is and why it is so important.\nYou will learn the diverse nature of this phase of preparation and how it supports not only the patient but also the owner. Supporting the owner means less stress and better understanding for everyone.\nYou will learn the questions to ask so you can formulate a prehab plan that is bespoke for your patient.\nWe then move onto how we implement the plan and what aspects of the body and its healing process, we take into account and support, to ensure it is healing at its optimum rate.\nWe will touch on a variety of subjects within this topic and see how we can implement each area to set everyone up for success.",

      "description": "I was walking down the street with my dog when I saw it. A squirrel. I crossed my fingers, hoping that she would not see it. I tried to get her attention so I called her name. But it was too late, she saw it! ?. She started to whine and lunge on her leash. I called her again and tried to entice her to come back to me, but there was simply no way to get through to her. There we were, standing, both upset and frustrated, her because she could not get to her squirrel, me because my dog was completely ignoring me. I’ve rarely felt so powerless, with my lunging dog, my cookies and my ridiculous attempt to calm my girl and get her attention back.\n\n\nThat was a few years ago. Last season, I was walking one of my dogs at sunset. Because it was late in winter and it was twilight out, hungry deer were also present looking for food. My high prey drive border collie wanted only one thing, to let her inner-wolf out. Suddenly, my leash broke! My dog was free and there were deer a couple of meters away from us. We had both seen them a second ago. And what did my dog do? She instantly looked at me! I did not have to ask her anything, I calmly told her to sit and she instantly obeyed. I walked the meter and a half that was separating us, gently grabbed her collar and made a make-shift leash with the two broken pieces. We continued our walk as if nothing had happened. Her eyes were still on me and she pranced around a bit, trying to get me to play with her. I smiled and decided to indulge her, afterall, wasn’t she the best girl?!\n\n\nBoth these stories happened. They are both true. So what changed? It’s simple! I started to play attention games with my dogs! Today, when I walk down the street, my four dogs, two border collies, one shiba inu and one pembroke welsh corgi ranging from 11 months to 6 years old, all have their eyes on me. They want to engage, and ask me to play with them. If they are sniffing and doing their doggy things, I know I’m always in the corner of their eyes. They wait for one thing, that I call them. If I do, instantly they are at my feet, wondering what I want and what fantastic games we are going to play.\n\n\nAttention Games for Dogs: In the Street is the class for you if you want your dog to beg you to engage with them, if you want to transform your dog from a squirrel-obsessed tractor to the calm and behaved pooch you always dreamt about, or if you want to have fun with your dog and see that sparkle in her eyes each time you ask for her attention. The games are so easy and simple that you won’t even realize that you are training. Whether you are a beginner who just wants to have fun with your dog, or if you’re a savvy dog trainer looking for new ideas, you’ll have a blast playing these games!\n\n\nDon’t beg, just play!\n\n\n“Having a shiba inu, you know you're going to have to work hard to have it's attention. Eve's lessons really helped me and my young shiba to bound closer and I can now have much of her attention outside, with still some work to do.” - Aude Provost and Ahsoka, 1 year old shiba inu\n\n\n“My dog used to look at everything except me. With Eve's attention games, I achieved to get a terrier who looks at me, listens to me and has a good focus, while having fun!” - Eve Goulet and Peanut, 8 month old welsh terrier\n\n\n“Eve's class really helped me with my high prey drive dog. I worked hard on her lessons with my dog and it paid off. He is now more focused and more engaged with me !” - Léane Bossé and Chekov, borzoi, and Loki, greyhound.",

      "description": "Augmentative interspecies communication button training is an innovative method designed to enhance the way humans and their pets communicate. This approach utilizes buttons that produce pre-recorded words or phrases when pressed, allowing pets to express their needs, desires, and emotions more clearly.\nIn this course, I will walk you through how to get started with AIC training, the best techniques I have learned by working with Flounder, and some helpful tips to assist you along your journey. Consistency is key. It’s important for the pet owner to always use the designated button before fulfilling the pet’s request.\nOver time, the pet learns to associate pressing a particular button with the desired outcome. Positive reinforcement, such as treats or praise, is crucial to encourage and reward the pet’s successful use of paw targeting. Gradually, more buttons can be introduced, expanding the range of communication.\nThe ultimate goal is for the pet to independently use the buttons to make specific requests or convey feelings, fostering a deeper understanding and stronger bond between the pet and its owner. This method of communication not only stimulates the pet’s cognitive abilities but also enhances their quality of life by reducing frustration and increasing their ability to interact meaningfully with their human companions.",

      "description": "Dogs and cats represent the vast majority of the pets in the United States. While they can behave very differently at times, there’s actually a lot of similarities when it comes to training these animals to behave appropriately within a human family.\nThere are just a handful of issues that make up nearly all of the problems that people have with their pet dogs and cats. This means that these problems are very predictable, and fortunately, they’re also very preventable. And that’s probably the biggest similarity of all. When it comes to behavior problems, whether the pet is a cat or a dog, the easiest, most effective and most efficient approach is prevention. The key is to do as much training as possible, as early as possible.\nWe know what the problems are going to be, we know how to prevent them, and if we prevent the problems, they never form into bad habits. Once a problem has become a habit, it's significantly harder to fix. The treatment is going to use nearly identical methods, it’s just going to take much longer than prevention would have.\nSo, what are the problems? Mostly they are behaviors which are natural and necessary for these animals to do, and it’s up to us to teach them when, how, and where we would like them to perform these behaviors.\nToilet training is the most common issue, especially litterbox training for cats. Destructive chewing and scratching is also common, as are issues of aggression, reactivity, or unwillingness to be handled or restrained.\nLearn how to prevent all of these problems, and more, using easy and effective methods that are pleasant for you and your pet.",

      "description": "These days many people understand the importance of early puppyhood socialization. They take their puppy to group training classes, they introduce their puppies to lots of friends and neighbors and they may even host a puppy party or two. This is a wonderful development and it has done a lot to improve the temperament of countless dogs.\nUnfortunately, after this intensive period of early socialization period many owners slack off. They see that their hard work has paid off and that their puppy is friendly and sociable in every situation they find themselves in. What they don't realize is that dogs naturally become more shy and standoffish as they get older. Adolescent and adult dogs develop fears and phobias to stimuli that they aren't continually exposed to.\nKeeping your dog well-socialized to other dogs is not so easy, and often this area of their socialization deteriorates the most rapidly. At some point most dogs will get into at least one fight with another dog. Sadly, this often marks the beginning of the end when it comes to their socialization with other dogs. The owners want to avoid future fights so they avoid future opportunities to socialize. The dogs socialization deteriorates further and the likelihood of them fighting when they see another dog increases.\nResolving this problem in the course of everyday life is very difficult. Dr. Dunbar demonstrates how to use a Growl Class to classically condition dogs and rehabilitate and re-socialize them to once again enjoy the company of other dogs.",

The course will take you from the beginning steps, through to teaching your dog to come straight to you, even when distracted by something else.\nThis course is suitable for anyone wanting to get started with a young puppy, or to train an older dog that missed out on early training. It will aid in re-training an older dog that has developed a habit of refusing to come when called, however it can take more persistence to overcome old habits!\nThis course uses motivational reward-based training methods, combined with management techniques (long lines). The training methods do not involve the use of remote collars, so this course is suitable for people who are not permitted to use such tools due to local laws.\nThe course includes lectures and demonstrations using a variety of different dogs, from puppies to older dogs, and small breeds to large breeds.\nThe aim of the training is to aid you in being able to provide your dog with off-leash freedom, in safe and suitable environments. Where it is not safe, or not permitted to have your dog off leash, you can give your dog the \"sensation\" of freedom using a long line.",

This comprehensive course helps you understand your dog's behavior on leash, and gives you a step-by-step program to address leash reactivity without using force, fear, or pain. It is appropriate for dogs that act aggressively on walks due to fear, anxiety, frustration, or overexcitement.\nOften, when a dog acts aggressively, he/she is saying, \"I'm stressed out right now. Help!\" This course will give you the tools to help your dog become more comfortable on walks, by looking to you for guidance and support, rather than feeling the need to act in an aggressive way. You will be put in the role of your dog's \"coach,\" learning how to understand your dog's emotional needs, read his/her body language, and communicate effectively to help your dog focus on you and relax during times of stress.\nThe course is divided into six main sections. Each section provides one or more training protocols, with detailed steps and tons of videos to help your achieve your leash walking goals. The training activities include:\nThree levels of a counterconditioning and desensitization protocol to change your dog's emotional response to triggers\nManagement techniques to make your training more effective\nLeash manners training to build clear communication between you and your dog\nKate Naito is a certified dog behavior consultant (CDBC) and certified trainer (CPDT-KA) who specializes in behavior issues. She uses force-free methods to build clear communication and trust between you and your dog. When behavior modification is done humanely and safely, there are no quick fixes or miracle cures.

NO Experience, Gadgets & Doodads, OR Painful \"No Stirrup Work\" Required!\"\nIn this 5 Day Challenge you will get IN-CLASS TRAINING (Just like a 5-Day Clinic but done virtually from home) with practical exercises for you and your horse! Print out the workbooks, do your homework assignments in the saddle and practice these simple and effective exercises again and again.\n\n\nTell me if any of these sound familiar...\n\nYou lose your stirrups...\nYour Leg involuntarily pushes forward into \"Chair Seat...\"\nYou can't feel if you're doing it right or not...\nYou \"bounce\" in the saddle and don't feel in control of your body...\nYou feel unstable and want more connection with your horse...\nYour horse gets bored, spooky, or nervous when you ride & you feel overwhelmed, frustrated and not completely confident in your abilities...\nMy Name is Coach Krystal Kelly\nThis is my personal invite for you to join something I call The Steady Leg Challenge...\nBecause you answered \"YES\" to any of the questions above, then I know something about you...\nYou have the desire to do BIG THINGS...\nYou don't want to settle with just being \"average\"...\nAnd you know the right way to do that is with mastering the fundamentals and getting more balance in the saddle!\n\n\nHere's the TRUTH:\nWhat do all the professional riders have in common?\nThey all mastered the fundamentals.\nNot just that, they have steady legs which remain centered underneath them.\nFrom professional show jumpers… to grand prix dressage riders.\nMe, personally? I have jumped over 1.40m jumps…and have also been launched & thrown from my horse--not always gracefully--more times then I can count.\nIt took me a long, long time to figure this out.\nI used to fall off time and time again…and found myself going to the hospital YET AGAIN or trying to get my swollen, injured leg to fit inside my boots!\nIt wasn’t until I stopped trying to look pretty in the saddle…and really focused on correct rider and horse biomechanics that things started to really change for me.\nSuddenly, I had a sticky butt in the saddle and could jump bigger fences and ride higher level horses… in fact, no matter what horse I rode, these methods worked.\nHigh-level equestrians pay me $10,000's or more for me to privately expose some of my secrets.\nBest Part?\nMy steady leg has given me the balance I needed to move up in levels at rapid speed. Every single time.\nNow, I want to help you do the same...\nIn 5 Days you'll be on your way towards a Steady Leg & more balance in the saddle...\nStep 1: Join the Challenge\nAre you ready to take your riding to new levels and FINALLY get the steady leg you need to jump bigger jumps, ride better horses and do more complicated patterns and movements? Join the Steady Leg Challenge!\nStep 2: Commit for 5 Days\nSpend 45-minutes to 1 full hour with me every day for 5 days and see the exact strategies behind getting a steady leg - from rider position, confidence, and feeling your horse like you never have before!\nStep 3: Do the Exercises on Your Horse\nEvery day I'll show you the step-by-step exercise plan for you to take to the barn and try it out on your horse! You'll leave each day feeling more confident and secure in the saddle with an easy-to-follow blueprint that has helped 10,000+ students!\nStep 4: Get Results Daily\nBe fully immersed in the process! By the end of class, you'll have a better feel for your horse, more connection, better balance and a stable and secure leg! Plus, keep the momentum going even after our time together.\nHORSE & RIDER BIOMECHANICS EXERCISE BOOK is included. This makes understanding you and your horse's bodies in motion in an easy, fun way!\nThis challenge was part of a LIVE training done with my students. You can see more of our online programs on my website.\nWe've Helped 10,000+ Students In Over 146 Countries!!!\n\n\nYour Frequently Asked Questions:\nWhat riding level do I need to be?\nThat's the beauty of this challenge! If you are a beginner rider... you need a quiet leg! If you are an intermediate rider... you need a quiet leg! And if your an experienced rider... YOU NEED A QUIET LEG! We go in depth about rider and horse biomechanics so there is something to learn no matter your discipline or experience level.\nIs this training only for Jumpers?\nNo! We focus on horse and rider biomechanics and science-backed, proven techniques. Correct riding is correct riding, regardless of what tack you use or discipline you ride. We will discuss how the Quiet Leg can be achieved in all styles of riding.\nWhat if my horse is green? Can I still do this challenge?\nAbsolutely! In fact, it's essential to training a younger, inexperienced horse how to balance themselves correctly... by being balanced riders ourselves! We cannot expect our horses to be balanced and centered if we are lacking.\nWhat if I have old knee / leg / hip / joint injuries or aches and pain?\nWhen you learn how to ride correctly, you will often notice a huge relief in your joints and abilities. In fact, many rider's who are tense, stiff or having aches and pains will find that learning these techniques can release tension! That is because when you ride out of alignment or stiff, bracing, gripping or locking of the joints, you can cause more damage and tension to your body unnecessarily. Riding, when done correctly, is actually an excellent sport for people with old joint issues as it doesn't cause a lot of strain compared to other sports!\n\n\nEnroll Today & Discover how you can finally work towards getting a steady leg without hanging on your horse for balance, losing your stirrups or bouncing in the saddle!",

      "description": "Punishing cats - training, behaviour, sense & alternatives\nLecture by the SmartPet Academy\n\n\nThe topic of ‘punishing cats’ is one of the most controversial in cat ownership. Many cat owners are unsure whether and how punishments can be used sensibly at all, or whether they damage the relationship with the cat. In this 30-minute lecture, we will look at what forms of consequences cats actually understand, what misconceptions there are about punishment and what methods have proved successful in practice.\n\n\nContent:\nThe basics of punishment: What does punishment mean from a behavioural biology perspective? Why are punishments not fundamentally bad, but often problematic?\nPunishment in nature: How do cats set boundaries between themselves? What can we learn from their natural behaviour?\nLearning through consequences: Why cats cannot be punished retrospectively for their behaviour and what mistakes often happen.\nFear and stress as side effects: Why inappropriate punishments can permanently damage trust in cats.\nCharacteristics of a ‘fair’ punishment: What conditions must be met for a consequence to be understandable for the cat?\nAlternatives to punishment: How to achieve better results with positive reinforcement, redirection and consistent rules.\nExamples in everyday life\nRecommended reading\n\n\nThis lecture is aimed at all cat owners who want to better understand their cat's behaviour and ensure a harmonious human-cat relationship. Practical, well-founded and directly realisable.\n\n\n* The lecture can either be listened to chapter by chapter or in one go without breaks (both versions are included).\n\n\n* This lecture has been prepared especially for online use outside the Academy. To ensure a clear and consistent listening experience and thus facilitate learning, the audio track has been optimised and the visual presentation has been specifically revised. For easier understanding, the lecture manuscript is available to download as a PDF - for reading along, marking and taking notes.\n\n\n\n\nBONUS: AI ChatGPT Quickstart 23 for Business Owners\nAt the Smart Pet Academy, we are committed not only to supporting you with professional knowledge about animals but also to helping you build and grow your own business.

Sometimes diet can vary between different breeds or species of the same animal.  our pet's dietary needs may change as it ages. Talk to your vet about your pets different life stages and what food is most appropriate for each one. kindly look for pet food that contains healthy ingredients you recognize. Be sure to follow the guidelines for how much your pet needs to eat each day. Overfeeding leads to obesity, which can cause other problems.

Encoded within it are healing intentions and specific frequencies designed to bring relaxation and peace in order to optimise and enhance the effects of the healing treatments for your pets and animal friends.\nThe motivation behind this course came about after my beloved dog Buddy had a near death experience during his battle with liver cancer. I was so inspired by the positive effects that Sound and Energy Healing had on Buddy, both during his illness and his recovery, that I knew I had to share this knowledge with others. Knowing how to use Sound and Energy healing helped me cope with his illness too and I see it as a vital part of self care at stressful times.\nI am so happy to share this course with others who may be dealing with similar situations and with those who would like to learn these simple techniques to support their animal's happiness and health as part of their regular routine pet care.\nPlease join me as we explore ways to share these beautiful, bonding, healing experiences with our beloved pets and animal friends.

(P.S. you can also preview Anna talking about her experienced in the trailer and testimonial section before purchasing the course).\n\nKobe was barking and jumping at strangers.\n\n“It has come to a point where the kids are not comfortable with having friends over.\n\n\nWe are limiting our social life.\n\n\nWe’ve always wanted this to be an open house where everyone is welcome. Where the children can hang out with their friends.\n\n\nIt’s only going one way and yesterday Kobe was very aggressive towards a dad and his 7 year old girl…”\n\nDogs are territorial and protective towards their family by nature.\n\nIf they do not feel that the leadership of their owners provides safety, they do not want to let ‘strangers’ into the home.\n\nThis is a classic misunderstanding between humans and dogs.\n\nAnd it happens to all of us.\n\nWhat Kobe really was trying to say is that he loves his family and he wants to protect them.\n\nWe coached Anna and Kobe to understand each other with Dog Talk.\n\nAfter a session with Anna and Kobe, they sent us this heartwarming message:\n\n\n“Hi Noelle,\n\nHope all is well with you.\n\n\nTime is flying by and I thought I would give you a brief update on how we are doing…\n\n\nAMAZING. Kobe is a different dog.\n\n\nStill with challenges of course, but he is doing so much better. And I believe, so are we.. as we discussed, it’s us, not really him.\n\n\nHe is just trying to figure out how to be a good dog. After the walk with you, we got great pointers and information that we completely absorbed and started to talk and practice.\n\n\nKobe started at CityDogs on Fridays and is doing really well. Closely after our walk we then also met Eric.\n\n\nHe’s walking a friend's dogs once a week and we signed up with him twice a week, Mondays and Wednesdays. Kobe absolutely loves Eric.\n\n\nSo three days a week, he is socializing with other dogs and is outside more or less the whole day. He is so happy. Weekends of course, we are activating him a lot as well.\n\n\nAs we’ve started to trust him (you said that… trust yourselves… which we are) he is also trusting us. The trick on running away to make him come to you works very well. And after a few times, you trust more and more.\n\n\nYour tip about always being in movement is also key. Kobe is 80% off the leash now and he is such a good dog. He doesn’t run away and he likes to know where you are. He’s having so much more fun and is a happier dog being able to play with other dog.\n\n\nMartin had a vision before we got a dog, and it was for him to be able to go out running with the dog. Last week, he did, and Kobe was SO SO SO good, kept running, stayed with Martin even though other dogs were around, listen and followed. Martin came home and almost cried of joy as this was a big thing for him.\n\n\nWe’d love to continue to work with you. The walk with you was so extremely useful for us both and taught us a lot – just in 1 hour.\n\n\nThere is a lot to work on but the priority now is that we get the house sorted out. Having people and guest coming and going, especially friends of our children. Doorbell ringing etc.\n\n\nCan we schedule a time where you come to us and we do a session on this?\n\n\nWe need your help.\n\n\nThank you so much and enjoy the weekend.”\n\n\nThe Dog Talk animal communication course will take you through 3 core modules:\n\n\nBelieving in Yourself — where we will adjust your mindset from controller to lover.\nKnowing Your Dog — where we teach you to discover your dogs specific needs, likes and fears.\nAnimal Communication Meditation — where we practice deepening our connection with our dog, soul to soul.\n\n\nTo get the most out of this course, you must be ready to begin the work. You must be fearless.\n\n\nIf you want to control your dog and bend them to your will, this journey is not for you.\n\n\nIf you are still intent on blaming your dog and the world around you, this journey is not for you.\n\n\nIf you are not ready to take responsibility for every dimension of your life, this journey is not for you.\n\n\nBut if you are ready to look within to solve your outer problems then please begin. Your dog will recognise your transformation and will be grateful for your courage.",

Effectively laying this foundation increases the speed at which a dog learns, as they are more in tune with their handler/leader.\nThis course will demonstrate to students the appropriate way to use positive dog training techniques to begin training a dog.  Students can expect to learn how to be positive, confident and effective leaders, and will learn how to teach dogs problem-solving skills and self-control, which will in turn build the dog’s confidence and help him to work through distractions in the real world.  Students will also learn how to appropriately reward a dog, and how to use consequences that do not cause fear or harm to a dog in any way.\nNo materials are required for this class, though students may want to practice the techniques they learn with their own dog(s).\nThis course can be completed in less than 2 weeks.  Ideal students will have an open mind about positive training, and are those who own, foster or work with dogs in any way.  Lessons taught in the course can be used in home or professional environments, and techniques can be used with most dogs.",

      "description": "This online seminar consists of six hours of video lecture by renowned animal behaviorist and dog trainer, Dr. Ian Dunbar. It has been approved for 6 continued education credits by the IAABC & NADOI (CCPDT credits have been applied for).\nThis course contains a collection of concepts that range from common sense to cutting edge. The one thing they have in common is that they are all crucial for developing a solid understanding of dog training and behavior. This course is perfect for anyone that wants to understand how to raise a well-trained companion dog, or anyone that is interested in learning more about how to better train their current dog.\nMuch of the seminar deals with motivating your dog by making training into an enjoyable activity that functions as it's own reward, thereby eliminating the continued reliance on training tools and food lures.\nOf course, dogs don't always do what we want, so much of this seminar also focuses on how to correct misbehavior. By redirecting our dogs to appropriate behaviors we not only stop them from misbehaving, we also ensure that they are doing the right thing, all without pain or fear.\nAlmost every dog will, at some point, develop a phobia or reactivity problem so it's also crucial that dog owners and trainers understand how to quickly and easily address these issues. Differential Classical Conditioning, the Jolly Routine and the use of Secondary Reinforcers can quickly resolve these problems.\nFinally, Dr. Dunbar will explain an idea that should be common sense, but is becoming increasingly cutting edge in today's world of overly clinical and mechanical dog training. He will show you how to turn your voice into the most powerful tool in dog training.",

      "description": "If you're starting or re-starting a horse - any horse - round pen training is the very first step.\nRegardless of your experience level - or how your horse will later be ridden - this video course, \"Round Penning: First Steps to Starting a Horse,\" shows you exactly what to do, when to do it, and even why to do it.\nBeyond desire and persistence, all you need is a horse, a round pen, and a pair of gym shoes... 'cause you are gonna get some exercise.\nSimply put, \"round penning\" is the necessary first step for horses destined for any riding discipline! Whether you ride western or English - basics are basics and they are first introduced in the round pen! (Can you skip this training and still get your horse \"broke\"? Sure! But it's a heck of a lot harder to saddle-train a skittish horse that hasn't learned to be comfortable with you, or to respect your presence, your pressure - and your role as \"boss,\" three things your horse will learn here in this video series... So, seriously, you don't want to skip proper round pen training. Starting here is highly, highly recommended! The short period of time you invest here in the beginning will later pay off in a big way.)\n\"Round penning\" is not the same as lungeing. \"Lungeing\" is a single, stand-alone \"thing\" you have your horse do. By contrast, \"Round penning\" is an entire series of exercises that combine to begin teaching the horse respect for its human and to later carry a rider. Yes, along the way, ground manners will be greatly improved, (you'll teach the horse to turn toward you for easy catching in the field, to have its feet handled - and even teach it to \"come to you\" at any gait, for instance) but the entire point of \"round penning\" is for you to begin training a horse to be ridden. There are goals to be met and specific steps to be taken. But you can do this! Anybody who can follow simple directions can do this!\nRound penning is easy once you know how - but the changes you can make are amazing. Whether you're starting a youngster to ride or retraining a hard luck case, this step-by-step video guide shows you exactly what to do, in which specific order - and why.  Train your horse to:\nbecome a willing partner\ndeal with its fear\nturn and face you, to come to you, to respect a person's space\nstand politely for the farrier, to have its feet handled\nbe much safer for you and your family to be around\nAnd, above all, with this video course, you will learn exactly what it takes to build a strong foundation for any horse that you'd someday like to ride. (Note: While this video course does not address first saddling, it brings you right up to that point. Sacking out, bridle work from the ground, and then saddle-training would be your next steps!)\nFree bonus included with this course for a limited time: I've included a free chapter, \"Sacking Out\" as excerpted from my book \"Round Penning: First Steps to Starting a Horse.\" Why? Because it's the next thing you're going to want to do with your horse after round pen training. If you want to make your horse safer to ride, then the day after completing your training in the round pen, you need to \"sack it out\" (that is, get your horse \"used to\" common, everyday objects that it might come into contact with -- either on purpose or by accident., objects like your hands, water bucket, saddle blanket and so on. This excerpted (text version, not video) chapter will show you exactly what to do. I'd suggest you print it out, take it to the barn.\n\nNote: Pick up my book \"Round Penning: First Steps to Starting a Horse\" for additional guidance. The book goes on to offer even more how-to training, covering the following topics in detail:\nSpook in Place (Desensitize your horse to scary objects)\nPicking Up Feet\nHow to Halter Train a Horse\nTeaching Your Horse to Lead\nLeading a Stubborn Horse\nLungeing a Horse\nHorses That Bite\nThe Intimidating Horse\nHow to Get Respect\nTrailer-Training Your Horse Using a Round Pen\nTeach a Horse to Sidepass to You On the Ground [A popular trick]\nIs My Horse Hard to Train... Because of His Feet?",

By identifying natural foods that promote optimal health and eliminating the ones that trigger the onset of disease.\nThis course will enable any owner to create a tailored nutrition plan for their dog, no matter what stage of life it's at.\n1000s of dog owners have switched from highly processed commercial dog food and embraced natural feeding - and with amazing results and success stories.\nEnrol now and start your dog's journey to a healthier, happier life!\nBut don't just take our word for it, here is what some of our happy dog owners have said about the course:\n'Thank you so much, we are amazed at the difference, not only in Bling's health and condition, but also her temperament. She has so much more energy for walks and is much calmer around other dogs too - we can only assume she is less cranky now that she feels better. The course was easy to follow and apply and we could not be happier as a result...and nor could Bling!' Ramona Carraro & Dog Lady Bling - Frome, Somerset\n'Look after your dog from the inside out. Often over looked, diet can play a part in behaviour and we should be looking at diet when assessing a dog's behaviour and implementing a training program. Do Good Pet Co. offer a course for dog owners that is simple to follow and gives you a clear understanding of what's best to feed your dog as well as an insight to some of the nasties hidden in some packaged foods sold in supermarkets and pet shops.  A recommended read for all pet dog owners.' Emma Cummings, Force Free Dog Trainers, Surrey\n'The course helped me learn how much rubbish really is in a lot of dry dog food!!! Also, I didn't realise how much more healthy natural food dogs can actually have!!! Every dog owner should have to read this course when buying a dog...by law!!!' Dan Jenneson with Dogs Betty & Fred - Bournemouth\n'This is a brilliant course for all those folks who what to feed their dogs good food but want to make sure that it's balanced and healthy. I loved the bright and informative literature that make the subject easy to understand and less daunting. I would thoroughly recommend it to all dog owners.' Charlotte Russell & Dog Robert - Gillingham, Dorset\n\n'I really enjoyed the videos and the brilliant and pretty informational PDF’s that accompany them. My Chihuahua loves his new species appropriate diet  which includes foods I would never have thought of giving him. Thank you Do Good!!!' Mimi Elias & Dog Jehst - Acton, London\n\n'After finishing the Do Good course I feel in charge of giving my new puppy Royston, the best start in life.  I was shocked to learn the damaging ingredients in standard dog food & how it can lead to so many diseases, but now I have peace of mind that I know exactly what I’m giving my puppy & why it’s the right food for his species, plus I’ve got some recipes to make treats for him too. Thank you for a wonderfully put together course that both me & Royston are very grateful for! Kelly Dunworth & Dog Royston - Weybridge, Surrey\n'I found the course very good and very informative.  A lot of the stuff I know now, but 6 months ago it was a nightmare to find out what to do for Amber due to her compromised immune system. Since changing her diet and the amount I feed her she has lost weight and has loads more energy too. I think everyone should do this course before they get a puppy.' Susan Brooker & Dog Amber - Wiggywags Dog Walker\n\n'After doing the course, we were shocked by how many nasties are in common dog foods!!! Scooby was getting scabs at the edges of his ears and after doing the course and switching him to a natural diet we have noticed such a difference in him. He is in much better condition and his ears have completely cleared up. Thank you Do Good.' Fi Balkwill & Dog Scooby - Wandsworth, London\n\n'Thank you for providing a great course.

Whether you want to learn to listen better to the horses that you own, ensure that the horses you work or volunteer with have the happiest lives possible or speak up for the welfare of horses on a wider scale, this course is for you! Learn about ethical care and training, equine behaviour and communication, how to create an enriching environment and much more!\nEquine advocates ensure that the horse's safety, welfare, basic needs and particular preferences are honoured. They advocate for the voiceless equine by interpreting their behaviour and paying attention to subtle equine communication signals. A skilled equine advocate can make the difference between an interaction that is based on partnership, mutual trust and clear communication or one that is unfulfilling and or even harmful to both parties.\nProfessional equine advocates have a thorough understanding of equine behaviour, communication and welfare. They are experienced horse handlers who can work effectively in a variety of equine settings including equine assisted learning, equine assisted psychotherapy, therapeutic riding and therapeutic horsemanship. Where the facilitator’s role is more person-focused, the equine advocate focuses on the horse, ensuring their welfare and ethical treatment in the session. They look for minute changes in the horse’s posture and body language or tell-tale signs of tension. They help to give feedback to the participant about how they are interacting with the horse, including anything that could make the experience more positive for both parties.",

      "description": "This three-day seminar by world-renowned dog training expert Dr. Ian Dunbar is the product of a lifetime of studying dogs. This course brings together a wide variety of lessons learned from Dr. Dunbar's training as a veterinarian, a scientific researcher, an animal behaviorist, a professional dog trainer and a young boy growing up on an English farm. This seminar will focus on many principles and methods that have been scientifically proven in the research lab, and then adapted for the real-world environment and the many constraints that exist when a family of novices trains a pet dog in their home. And just because his methods are supported by science doesn't mean that they have no heart. In fact, Dr. Dunbar is quick to criticize techniques that ask trainers to behave like dispassionate laboratory robots. Instead, he believes that we as trainers need to utilize our strengths as humans: our intuition, our voice and our relationship with our dogs, in order to be the best trainers we can be. Then we can dispassionately measure and evaluate the results of our training, so we can scientifically determine whether or not our methods are effective. Whether you are a professional dog trainer, veterinary clinician, shelter worker, groomer, dog walker, or simply a pet owner who is interested in the science of dog training and behavior modification, this course will provide you with a wealth of exciting new ideas that you can immediately use to bring about positive change in your life with your dog. Dr. Dunbar was instrumental in the popularization of dog friendly training methods that are enjoyable for dogs and their owners, but also efficient and effective. You'll learn techniques that are perfectly appropriate for the whole family, and designed to produce well-behaved canine companions that are friendly and reliable. This course consists of 18+ hours worth of video lecture by Dr. Ian Dunbar, a set of accompanying notes and 2 eBooks: BEFORE You Get Your Puppy & AFTER You Get Your Puppy\nFriday – We Continue to Waste Puppyhood\nSaturday – Transcending Reinforcement Schedules, Going Way Beyond “Dominance\" and Punishment and Rekindling the Relationship\nSunday – Off-leash Verbal Control with Distance and Distractions; Phasing out Food Lures and Rewards and Naturally Motivating your Dog to Perform Quickly, Reliably and Willingly",

It is rather full value, very interesting and varicolored life, comparing to other dogs that usually go for a walk with their owners just to go to the toilet!\nEtc...\nI want as many people as possible to get their dogs involved into a wonderful world of TreT-Style! I would like TreT to have worthy followers and I will be very happy if exactly YOUR Dog will become the next hero of dog’s parkour!\nThe information in the course if presented in a very conservative form\n!\nThere is no \"water\" in the course! Despite the small size of the video (~1,5 hour), there is a great amount of useful material in it!\nYou will not have to spend a lot of time for mastering the video-course – you will be able to learn all the material and to start doing practical classes just afterward, which is very important!\nBesides it is very interesting to watch the course because it has a plenty of wonderful tricks in TreT performance!

The accumulation of confusion and badly-put rules with your dog can make him an insecure or hyperactive dog which usually results in some form of undesired behavior.\n\n\nWhile your dog might try to misbehave in one way or another, he should be able to calm down when you want him to.

      "description": "DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE MISSING PIECE IN DOG TRAINING THAT CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING?\nYou may have experience training dogs and still encounter problems in your training. You may have visited or hired many other trainers and still facing the same problems. Or, if you’re new at dog training you most certainly will find yourself up against a few obstacles before you are able to fully train your dog. Or if you are just someone who is interested in the world of Animal Behavior you have come to the right place.\nThere are lots of courses out there, and a number of basic techniques to assumingely teach your dog “commands” and to follow your lead. Or courses that rely on tools like e-collars etc. But they don’t cover one of the most important things that can help you unlock a whole new perspective and a way to relate to your dog to get the most out of your relationship with your dog.\nI’m Cynologist Bart de Gols, who has been working with canines for over 30 years. I developed my own highly-regarded relationship based training program to help humans create the best possible relationship with their dog. I also develop highly-skilled protection and working canines for Tactical K9 Solutions. My years of extensive experience have taught me that dog training isn’t just clicking with a clicker, presenting food or giving a correction or using tools like E-Collars and pinch collars. Dog training is a science, and we need to understand how dogs learn. Now, I’m ready to take my expertise and share the one thing that will make all the difference in your own dog training and your relationship with your dog!\nSO…ARE YOU WONDERING JUST WHAT THAT ONE MISSING PIECE IN DOG TRAINING IS?\nThe answer is understanding animal behavior and the process of how dogs learn. It may sound simple enough, but it is the most overlooked aspect of training. To get the results you want, you can’t train an animal how you as a human want to train them, but you need to understand how they learn and communicate. It is crucial to meet the animal where they are versus where you want them to be.\nIn my ground-breaking Udemy Course, From Tyrant to Teacher, - Foundation of Animal Behavior, I am uncovering the secrets of science-based knowledge on how animals truly learn. This is the key to unlocking that final missing piece to help make dog training easy.\nIn From Tyrant to Teacher Foundation of Animal Behavior , you’ll learn:\n\n\nThe Domestication Process of the Canis lupus Familiaris or Modern Dog\nHow animals Learn\nThe difference between Innate and Learned Behaviors\nIn depth information about behaviorism\nA deep dive into Classical and Operant Conditioning\nAdvanced concepts of operant conditioning (made easy!)\nStimuli and Stimuli Control\nAdvanced concepts of Schedules of Reinforcement\nStress and how it affects learning\nSetting up a training plan correctly\nAnd much, much more!\n\n\nThis course stands out because it goes beyond the surface level of dog training, offering no quick how-to’s or practical tips. Instead, it delves into the scientific understanding of how dogs learn, providing a rich foundation of knowledge that empowers you to build a stronger, more responsive relationship with your dog. Designed for both seasoned trainers facing challenges and novices intrigued by animal behavior, \"From Tyrant to Teacher\" is a profound testament to the power of education and understanding in transforming human-canine relations.\n\"From Tyrant to Teacher: The Foundation of Animal Behavior\" is designed explicitly to educate the human, shifting the paradigm from a dominator to an enlightened guide. This course underscores the importance of scientific knowledge in understanding how our dogs learn, paving the way for a relationship rooted in mutual respect and profound connection.\nAre you ready to lead with compassion, to transform your approach from commands to communication, and to unlock the true potential of your bond with your dog? \"From Tyrant to Teacher\" is your gateway to becoming the informed, empathetic leader your dog needs and deserves.\nTransform your dog training journey today. Embrace the opportunity to educate yourself, to move beyond quick fixes and step into a world of understanding and empathy. Enroll in \"From Tyrant to Teacher: The Foundation of Animal Behavior\" now, and embark on a transformative journey that will elevate your relationship with your dog to unprecedented heights.\n\nARE YOU READY TO FINALLY BE THE TEACHER YOUR DOGS NEEDS?",

When you arrived back home your dog was still barking and it took him 45 minutes to calm down.\nOr worse, maybe your dog destroys things when you leave, or even defecates on themself in their panic.\nOr perhaps you can’t even leave your dog with your partner or a family member, because they still panic when you leave… you’re not the only one!\nYou have probably tried books, videos, CBD oil, turned on Dog TV for 24 hours, got meds prescribed by the vet or even spent a fortune on private dog training, with little or no real results.\nEven after everything you’ve tried, your dog can never be left alone.\n\n\nMost Dog Training Advice Ignore Signs of Stress\nMost trainers and dog training advice ignore the key signs of stress your dog may be experiencing and that the owner may be accidentally reinforcing the dog’s anxiety.\nEach time your dog panics and the correct response is not given, the situation becomes worse. In order to reduce your dog’s anxiety you need to stop this repetition of panic and teach your dog better coping methods.\nAnd that’s just one of the many common mistakes people make with anxious dogs that can sabotage the results from their training. Not to mention the plethora of smaller details that can make or break your dog’s progress!\nSeparation anxiety is serious, but it’s not rocket science and it doesn’t need to drive everyone crazy.\nWhat if I told you that by using an unconventional and simple approach, you can quickly remove the main cause of separation anxiety and both you and your dog can finally relax.\nDogs with separation anxiety have a reaction similar to a panic or anxiety attack.\nThey cannot physically control this reaction, and do not do it on purpose. In order for your dog to feel comfortable alone you need to teach them how to cope appropriately.\nBy providing your dog with specific activities that reduce anxiety, and by building your dog’s coping schedule carefully, you can help stop the repetition of those panic-inducing episodes, and replace them with calm interactions where your dog can learn to settle down and relax even though you aren’t there!\n\n\nUnconventional Technique Calms Even the Most Anxious Dogs\nThis is a unique step-by-step methodology that focuses on your relationship with your dog along with improving their mental health, happiness, and confidence. It creates what we call “team dog”.\nThe 30 Day Separation Anxiety Challenge helps you quickly take control of your pup and start fully enjoying the experience of having a dog.\nEverything is laid out for you.

      "description": "All dogs will display some level of aggression or reactivity at some point in their life, so learning how to address this type of behavior is critical for any dog owner or dog trainer.\nWith a little knowledge and preparation it is easy to prevent almost all aggression, and to quickly address any aggression issues as they begin to emerge, before they develop into problems that can quickly decrease the quality of life for dog and owner alike.\nThese days, I'm pleased to say that many owners understand the importance of early puppyhood socialization. Unfortunately, far fewer owners understand the important of maintaining that socialization through adolescence and adulthood, when dogs naturally become more shy and stand-offish.\nAll too often, a dog will get into a single dog fight that will scare their owners into avoiding other dogs, depriving their own dog of the social interaction they need for rehabilitation. Without ongoing positive social experiences, the dog's sociability only deteriorates further, resulting in self-reinforcing, downward spiral of de-socialization.\nAs soon as you recognize any developing reactivity or aggression you should treat it. The sooner you do, the easier it will be. And the methods used in the treatment of dog aggression are remarkably similar to those used for prevention, except that treatment usually takes dramatically longer.\nRecently though, new techniques have been developed to accelerate and maximize classical conditioning, progressive desensitization and ultimately, re-socialization. These methods make it possible to rehabilitate dogs as quickly and thoroughly as possible.",

      "description": "In the Scent Work method that I teach in this Course, your dog will not be searching for food treats. Instead, your dog will be introduced to your chosen scent or odour right from the start, and rewarded with food and/or toys for locating the source of that odour.\nAfter completing a few preparatory steps, and ensuring your dog is suitably motivated, we will use a back chaining process – meaning that we first teach the dog what to do when it smells the odour (sit, down, freeze or other trained behaviour of your choosing), before getting the dog to search for the odour. A reward signal (a clicker, or a verbal marker such as \"Yes\") is used to communicate to the dog the specific behaviours that are being rewarded. This method is similar to the way in which Police and Military Dogs are trained to find Narcotics or Explosives, or Conservation Detection Dogs locate Rare or Threatened animal or plant species. The Course will show you how you can easily achieve this with your own dog at home.\nThis training method is fast, leads to enthusiastic searching, and can prevent or resolve problems such as excessive scratching or biting at hides (places where odour is hidden), or having difficulty \"reading\" when your dog has located the source of the odour.\nTo help in the process of training your dog, we will explore the use of a variety of food delivery procedures and utilise everyday equipment such as kitchen colanders, pvc pipe, bricks, cardboard boxes and plastic storage containers to fully develop the chosen indication (alert behaviour).\nMy scent training method is geared towards owners aiming to enter Scent Work or Nose Work competitions (Trials), but you can use this training method for any other scent related activities such as finding truffles on your property, or locating items you habitually lose!\nThis Course will take you through the entire initial Scent Work training process, and introduce you to some Novice/Starter Level searches, including Container Searches (cardboard boxes), Interior Searches, Exterior Searches and Vehicle Searches.",

You will also be shown how to teach channel/swivel weaves, to help your dog be weave independent.\nThe course explains each skill, shows you how to teach it and then we have included videos of teaching the skill to my clients which shows some trouble shooting we had with running contacts.\nAlso included at the end of the course is a short video of some exercises you can practice with just 2 jumps or 1 jump and a cone.\nAll training is taught in a positive reward-based way.",

This is excellent news.\nIn this class, riders will explore the foundational principles of military riding—the start of the horse's education—as outlined in French and USA Cavalry instructions—methods that have been refined by reason and experience.\nRiders who adhere to these instructions with precision will stand apart from the general horse community, most of whom rely on guesswork and lack structured training. By following these exact directives, you will ride with confidence and mastery, ensuring clear, purposeful communication with your horse—and all horses crave this and flourish when they get it.\nThe education of a horse begins with the proper understanding and execution of the Opening Rein—a one-sided, leading-rein action… the TURN.\nFollowing this, the Bearing Rein is introduced—the corresponding outer rein. This corresponding outer rein perfects the forehand's lightness and agility.  By first uniting the forehand, the rider/trainer can continue to make it more instantly 'displaceable'. These rein actions work in harmony and must align precisely to achieve effective communication.\nUnfortunately, the misuse of these concepts so often preached by the fake cowboy clinicians and their 'neck rein' misleads many horsepeople into being hoodwinked. This limited, superficial approach fails to capture the true depth and effectiveness of these rein actions in activating the horse’s ideal way-of-going.\nWith this class, you'll gain a clear understanding that helps distinguish between accurate techniques and misconceptions, guiding you toward a more effective approach to horse training.\nWhich way do you want to ride?",

I signed up for this course as part of Sharon's Dog Trainer course as I am just starting my own dog training business, I now feel much more confident dealing with dog aggression after watching this. Another brilliant course Sharon - thank you.\"\nThis course is taught by Sharon Bolt who has been featured in over 50 different local and national newspapers, magazines, television and radio stations. She was featured in the BBC Documentary “Britain’s Most Embarrassing Pets.” and has a monthly slot on BBC Radio, which she's had since 2008, where she answers the listeners’ doggy dilemmas.\n\nSharon answers student questions in all her Udemy courses daily.\nIn this dog training - stop dog attacks course you'll learn simple dog training methods that integrate dogs who are aggressive with other dogs, be able to recognize dominant and submissive signals and prevent attacks from happening.\nLearn the Simple, Clear, Concise Communication And Dog Training Methods Which Dogs Love that Stops:\nDog aggression with other dogs.\nDominant and challenging behaviour.\nLunging, growling and barking.\nDog attacks.\nYou CAN Teach Old Dogs New tricks, And Young Ones Too With These Dog Training Methods.\nDogs live in the present moment which means when given the right dog training information their behaviour changes fast, even if they've been behaving a certain way for a long time.\nOnce you've learned what dogs are looking for and know what dog training methods work you'll know what to do for life. Dogs speak the same language regardless of age or breed. The dog training methods you'll learn will work with your dog, your friend's and family's dogs and any other future dogs you may get.\nDogs are not like computers they do not require constant updates or need to have new dog training programs developed, once you know what to do you've got it!\nWhat You'll Get From This Dog Training Course.\nThis dog training course is designed for any dog owner, regardless of their experience, who would like help with their dog's aggressive behaviour towards other dogs. This could be 'dominant aggression' where dogs charge at other dogs with intent to harm, 'fearful aggression' where dogs lunge, bark and show teeth but then go backwards and try to avoid conflict, or dogs who simply snap as if to say 'get out of my personal space.'\nThis dog training course focuses on empowering you, the dog owner. You're given the tools, knowledge and dog training methods in order to get your dog to listen to you and respond favourably to what you say. You're shown exactly how to do this through step-by-step video demonstrations using the pack leader theory combined with positive reinforcement techniques.\nYou'll learn how to recognize dominant and submissive signals so that you can avoid a potential dog attack from happening, dog training techniques that integrate aggressive dogs with other dogs as well as the crucial part you play in your dog's aggressive behaviour - when you are nervous and fearful of what might happen you are transferring that anxiety to your dog and setting yourself up for what you don't want to happen! I show you how to create good expectations instead.\nYou'll also find out why getting your dog to walk by your side first is vital to your success and step-by-step video demonstrations of how to do this.\nYou'll also learn dog training methods that will convince your dog, in a kind and confident way, that you are in charge, the one that is making all the decisions and that it is not their job to protect you.\nDuring this course you'll discover why dogs attack some dogs and are fine with others, why some dogs are 'picked on' and why some dogs don't like black dogs. As well as why some dogs don't like certain breeds, why some dogs don't like dogs that have not been neutered and why some dogs are aggressive on the leash and are good natured when off the leash.\nBy the end of this dog training course you'll have the knowledge and confidence you need to make a positive difference to your dog's aggressive behaviour. You'll also know how you can become your dog's Pack Leader without shouting, hitting or using force in this area. As well as confirmation of where you are already doing things right and suggestions where some dog training 'fine tuning' may be beneficial.\nImagine going on a walk feeling calm and confident with your dog responding favourably to you, following your lead and being focused on you rather than another dog. That's what you can look forward to after completing this dog training course.\nCan it really be that easy? Absolutely!

You’ll get direct coaching and feedback from us via questions you post in our discussion forum. We are committed to your success! You are not just buying access to view a course, but instead, interact with two professional dog trainers.\nWhat's Not Included\nPlease note, that the scope of the course is limited to the syllabus. We will answer questions related to the exercises that are covered in this program, not every possible dog training question that might be out there.\nAbout Treatpouch.com's Trainers\nJulie Posluns\nAfter graduating from a correction-style dog training program in 2003, Julie got a new puppy – a Pug Beagle X (Puggle) named Tyson. At 8 months Tyson started barking and lunging at people, at 10 months he became leash reactive towards dogs, by 1 year he had full out aggression towards puppies. When Julie realized that she had not learned proper techniques to deal with aggression – punishing Tyson for his behaviour made him lash out with greater intensity, she started looking for new ways to help her dog. Clicker training brought a new light to Tyson’s aggression and gave Julie a skill-set to manage his behaviour. This inspired Julie to learn about positive reinforcement training and set her on the path to becoming a professional positive reinforcement dog trainer.\nJulie is a Certified Pet Dog Trainer, Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA) through the Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers (CCPDT). As the owner of a successful dog walking company in Toronto, Julie sharpens her training skills daily when she is out on her group walks. When she’s not dog walking you can find her teaching tricks to her own dogs.\nBoth her dogs have titles in Rally Obedience and Freestyle but her greatest accomplishment is being able to bring her Puggle out with her on group walks. Treatpouch.com is her way of sharing with the world both the power of positive reinforcement training and the joy that comes from working with your dog.\nJulie is currently pursuing her Master's degree in Animal Behavior, at Memorial University, in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.\nAndre Yeu\nAndre’s passion for dog training began when he rescued his beagle, Duke, who suffered from on-leash reactivity and dog-aggression. Andre quickly discovered clicker training and the power of positive reinforcement, and through patience and care was able to help Duke overcome his fear and dislike of other dogs.\nDuke’s success gave Andre the confidence to volunteer and foster with a number of animal rescue organizations in the city. While each foster dog presented new challenges every dog could be helped through clicker training.\nIn 2009, Andre decided to open When Hounds Fly! in Downtown Toronto, to make positive reinforcement training convenient and accessible to members of the community, and to improve the quality of life for dogs and dog owners in the downtown core. With the success of his school and the transformation he’s seen in the neighbourhood dogs, Andre decided that it would be a worthy cause to offer people the benefits of positive reinforcement based training regardless of where they live. Through Treatpouch.com Andre hopes to improve the lives of dogs and their people all over the world.\nAndre is a Karen Pryor Academy Certified Training Partner (KPA CTP), a Certified Pet Dog Trainer, Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA), and a Truly Dog-Friendly Trainer. He grew up in Vancouver, has a bachelor’s degree in commerce, with honors, from the University of British Columbia, and lives in Toronto with his partner, Hyedie Hashimoto, and their rescue beagles, Duke and Petey.",

      "description": "Your dog can love you but not respect you.\nWhen the average person gets a new dog, they think that taking that dog to an 8 week obedience class is going to teach their dog to be a calm, friendly, submissive member of their family.  With many dogs, nothing could be further from the truth.\nWhat new owners need to learn, is how to teach their dogs the rules they are expected to follow in our home. That’s what this course is all about.\nEd Frawley and his wife, Cindy, live with 5 house dogs. Two little dogs (a Shitzu and Border Terrier) and three large breed dogs (an Australian Cattle Dog and 2 Belgium Malinoise). Two of those dogs can never be loose along in the house, two can never be loose with the smaller dogs.\nThe fact is when dog’s are managed properly they need very little formal obedience training. In fact dog’s that go through a sound management program learn to respect their new owners, not because they were corrected into submission, but because they learn their owners control every aspect of their life and that there are consequences to bad behavior. Those consequences only need to be a loss of certain freedoms they have earned.\nIn 2017 Ed turned 70 years old. He has spent his life training dogs. Ed has been producing dog training videos since 1982. Ed was a Police K9 handler for 10 years, he bred working bloodline German Shepherds for 35 years. It’s safe to say that very few people in this country have the dog experiences Ed has.\nThe goal of this course is to teach new dog owners how to live with their dog. Ed explains how he and Cindy set up their home to safely  manage their dogs in a logical safe manner. You can do the same.\nYou will learn hows to manage your dog dogs on walks, in the car and in the home. You will learn how to safely introduce a new dog (or cat or person) into your home.\nIf you have a new dog or a dog with behavioral problems, you need the information in this course. Its not the only training you will ever need, but if you do what Ed says you will establish a foundation for all further dog training.",

Most of the parkour behaviours require an object for your dog to interact with and I have tried to use items that are easily obtained or that you will already have in or around your home.  Dog Parkour does require some physical fitness on the part of your dog. Please consult your Vet before starting parkour or any exercise/fitness program, to ensure that your dog has no physical limitations, pain or injury."

      "description": "Parkour for dogs (or Urban Agility as it is sometimes called) is based on the elements of human parkour blended with dog obedience and dog agility.  This includes going over, under, through, between, around, back up and along objects. It is a fun and relatively new dog sport that is quickly growing in popularity. Participating in dog parkour is a great way to get dogs and owners out of the house and exploring their environments with a new focus. Once you start in the sport of parkour with your dog, you will be amazed at how many unique obstacles you’ll discover in your everyday environment. Your dog walks will never be the same!\nTraining the parkour interactions in this course strengthens your mutual teamwork with your dog. It also helps your dog to trust you more in different situations. Your dog will come to realise that you are a great source of fun and stimulation and rely less and less on environmental distractions, like smells, other dogs, birds and bunnies, to provide entertainment. This training also provides a great source of physical and mental stimulation that can be performed at home or inside when the weather restricts outside exercise or you are short on time.\nDuring this course we use positive reinforcement training methods and I prefer to use food to reward your dog. Using a toy to reward your dog builds drive or speed. Using food as a reward builds behaviour, which is what we really want to help your dog learn the behaviours correctly and safely.\nYou don't need to purchase any special equipment for the activities. I have tried to give you alternatives and household items that can be used. The activities covered don't require a lot of space, can be done inside or outside and are in fun, short and effective sessions.\nThe course is divided up into 7 weeks and each week has 4 parkour lessons, plus a fit trick and a fun focus game. Each session contains a video and written note.",

The chestnut nightmare that was then hers was the most imperfect horse a beginner could ask for in life, but the mare was hers. Together they learned from very difficult lessons in respect, riding, showing, and life. Amanda credits the mare, named Molly, with getting her through some very difficult teenage years. Molly stayed with her until she died at the age of 26. Throughout the years, Amanda had several other horses, rode for others, and even worked as a groom. The numerous people she had the blessed opportunity to get to know have offered words of caution and wisdom over the years. Most of these words were from highly experienced horse men and women and have been shared in the pages of this course. Hopefully you will gain and knowledge and inspiration from what is shared.",
