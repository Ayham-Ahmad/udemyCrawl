      "description": "These mock papers cover all the fundamentals to enable you to test your knowledge in preparation for the foundation exam.\nAgile project management is an approach that emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, incremental progress, and customer-centricity. Unlike traditional methodologies, which often follow a linear path, Agile breaks down projects into smaller, manageable units called iterations. Each iteration is essentially a project in miniature, involving design, development, testing, and review.\nCustomer feedback is integral to Agile. After each iteration, the project team can assess and adjust the product based on feedback, ensuring that the end product meets customer needs and expectations. This iterative process helps in accommodating changes without significant disruptions.\nAgile fosters a collaborative environment where cross-functional teams work together to achieve common goals. Daily stand-ups are a hallmark, ensuring open communication and keeping the team aligned on objectives.\nAgile also emphasizes value-driven delivery, focusing on delivering the most valuable features first. Techniques like backlog prioritization help in determining what features are most crucial.\nFurthermore, Agile encourages sustainable development, meaning teams should work at a pace that is sustainable in the long term. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design is also stressed.\nOverall, Agile project management is highly responsive to change, aimed at delivering maximum value through collaboration, continuous improvement, and a flexible approach to project execution.",

In this course, learners will examine how to analyze process components and stakeholders in an organization. They will also learn about concepts and tools for collecting and analyzing customer information and feedback. The next step after the Green Belt will be the Six Sigma Black Belt.\n\n\nA process is a means of creating and delivering products and services needed by customers. According to Takashi Osada, Japanese author and quality pioneer, if the process is right, the results will take care of themselves. By Six Sigma standards, a right process is one that creates and delivers precisely what the customer needs. By this logic, no Six Sigma effort can start without having a high-level picture of an organization's customers and other stakeholders, their needs, and the business processes meant to fulfill those needs.\n\n\nA thorough analysis of the existing business processes and the products and services they churn out is the first step in Six Sigma projects. You need to listen to the voice of the customer to find out what customers need, identify opportunities for change and improvement, and translate customer needs into goals and customer deliverables.",

That means projects are skillfully planned before kickoff; each stage is structured throughout and closes when the project concludes. Prince 2 belongs to a family of waterfall methodologies such as APMP and PMP, which focuses on a sequential way of planning a project.\n\n\nThe PRINCE methodology was initially developed in the late 1980s as a way for the U.K. government to manage IT projects. In 1996, a team of project management specialists and public and private organizations reviewed and updated the approach to make it more widely applicable to various industries.

      "description": "Engineering, a discipline anchored in precision and reliability, operates within a framework defined by codes, standards, and specifications. This course, 'Mastering Engineering Codes and Standards', is designed to introduce engineers and other professionals to the fundamental principles, the importance, and the application of these guiding documents. With the rapid advancement of technology and the demands of global infrastructure, understanding the essence of these standards becomes pivotal in ensuring safety, uniformity, and quality in engineering practices.\nBefore diving into specific codes or standards, one must first understand the basic definitions and differences among them. 'Codes' are sets of rules that detail the minimum requirements needed to ensure safety, health, and welfare of the public. They can be legally binding. 'Standards' are established norms or requirements about technical systems. They ensure uniformity and reliability in products and processes. 'Specifications', on the other hand, are explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service. This segment will offer clarity on the distinction and the relationship between these terms.\nThe course delves deeper into the crucial role of these guidelines in various engineering disciplines. From chemical, civil to mechanical engineering, these documents ensure that structures, systems, processes, and products are both safe and effective. They pave the way for international collaboration, allowing engineers and industry professionals across the globe to speak a unified language of innovation. In the course, learners will explore case studies that demonstrate how adherence to (or deviation from) these standards can have profound real-world implications.\nFinally, given the dynamic nature of engineering challenges and solutions, these standards are not static. They evolve with time and technological advancement. The course will provide insights on how to navigate the vast array of codes, standards, and specifications, as well as the processes behind their regular updates and revisions. Learners will also learn about the roles of various international bodies and organizations responsible for setting and updating these benchmarks.\nBy the end of this course, learners will have gained a solid foundational understanding of the relevance, application, and navigation of engineering codes, standards, and specifications, equipping them with the knowledge to uphold the highest standards of engineering practice.",

      "description": "LIMITED OFFER - APPLY CODE >> PMPDISCOUNT << TO GET A DISCOUNT!\n\nThis comprehensive mock exam is designed to simulate the actual Project Management Professional (PMP®) certification exam offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI). It will assess your advanced knowledge and understanding of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Seventh Edition. Become familiar with the wording, sample content and the question format. You'll be prepared for success by knowing what to expect.\n\n\nMain Features\n360 Multiple-Choice Questions in Two Mock Exams:  The exams A and B are split into 3 parts each (with 60 challenging questions per part). All questions are unique to present you with distinct scenarios and challenges. Apply your knowledge and problem-solving skills across various contexts and scenarios!\nBalanced Approach: The exams incorporate questions on predictive, agile, and hybrid project management methodologies, reflecting the current project management landscape. All questions are aligned with the five process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing) and cover the PMP® exam domains, as per PMI Exam Content Outline (ECO):\nDomain I: People\nDomain II: Process\nDomain III: Business Environment\nDetailed Explanations: Each question provides a clear explanation of the correct answer to allow you to reinforce your understanding of key concepts!\nTimed Setting: Set a timer for 230 minutes (3 hours and 50 minutes) to mirror the actual exam duration. Learn to manage your time effectively and develop exam stamina!\n\n\nMock Exam Simulation\nYou can expect the below exam structure when writing the real thing (please refer to the latest PMI ECO). The earlier you get familiar with it, the better:\n> Start <\nMock exam part 1/3: 60 questions in 70 minutes (incl. time for review/flagged questions)\nBreak 1/2: 10 minutes (mandatory after 60 questions)\nMock exam part 2/3: 60 questions in 70 minutes (incl. time for review/flagged questions)\nBreak 2/2: 10 minutes (mandatory after 60 questions)\nMock exam part 3/3: 60 questions in 70 minutes (incl. time for review/flagged questions)\n> End <\n\n\nSample Preview\nSample 1\nQuestion: A highly complex IT project has been in execution for nine months. The team has been struggling to get customer feedback. The project manager has calculated the Cost Performance Index (CPI) to be 0.83 and a trend analysis indicates that the CPI has a downward trend.\nWhat should the project manager's next step be?\nOptions:\nRework the cost baseline.\nCrash the project schedule.\nRequest additional resources.\nUse the management reserve.\nAnswer: Rework the cost baseline.\nExplanation: The CPI < 1 indicates that the project is over budget. The trend analysis shows that this will likely continue. Hence, the best course of action is to redo the cost baseline of the project to have a more realistic outlook. Requesting additional resources does directly address the underlying cost performance issues and could exacerbate budgetary concerns. Similarly, crashing the project schedule might not resolve the cost-related challenges and could add further pressure without addressing the CPI decline. Using the management reserve is not applicable in this context as it typically applies to unforeseen risks or changes, rather than addressing ongoing cost performance issues.\n\n\nSample 2\nQuestion:  The project manager is tasked with estimating the duration of a coding task. The team provides the following estimates: worst-case scenario of 20 days, best-case scenario of 10 days, and most likely scenario of 15 days. The project manager needs to determine the most appropriate estimate to use for project planning and resource allocation.\nWhat is the PERT estimate for the duration of the coding task?\nOptions:\n20 days\n12 days\n15 days\n10 days\nAnswer: 15 days\nExplanation: The PERT estimate is calculated as (Worst Case + 4 x Most Likely + Best Case) / 6. Substituting the given values, we get (20 + 4 x 15 + 10) / 6 = (20 + 60 + 10) / 6 = 90 / 6 = 15. This represents the weighted average of the estimates and provides a balanced estimate considering the range of possibilities.\n\n\nPerformance Analysis\nReview your results to identify your strengths and weaknesses across different process groups and knowledge areas. This targeted approach allows you to focus your future studies. While PMI does not publish an official grade required to pass, various sources suggest to get a minimum of 65-75% of the questions correct.\nExcellent if grade > 75%\nAverage if grade 60 - 75%\nImprovement required if grade < 60%\n\n\nStrategies for the PMP® Exam Questions\nAnalyze the Question: Carefully read the question and identify the key information it provides.\nEliminate Incorrect Options: Quickly eliminate obviously incorrect answer choices.\nLook for Clues: Pay attention to any clues or hints within the question stem or other answer options that can help you narrow down the correct answer.\nProcess of Elimination: Use the process of elimination to narrow down your choices by ruling out unlikely options.\nConsider Project Management Principles: Think about the relevant project management principles and concepts related to the question.\nCheck Calculations: If the question involves calculations, double-check your work and ensure that your answer makes sense.\nTime Management: Don’t spend too much time on a single question; move on if you’re unsure and come back later.\nTrust Your Instincts: If you’re unsure, make an educated guess.\n\n\nFinal Words\nRemember, do not just rely on the theory in the book. The PMP® exam questions are mostly situational/scenario-based. This means that you need to understand and apply the theory in particular situations. Assumptions may need to be made. This simulation will prepare you (for the exam and real life). Good luck, you've got this!",

      "description": "Welcome to “The Agile User Story Playbook” The Most Powerful Communication Mechanism For Agile Product Creation\nATTENTION PRODUCT CREATORS: Learn, Understand & Experience The Creation of Agile User Stories, And Success Is YOURS!\nThe User Story!\nThere is a “Tidal Wave” today that is sweeping our Globe. It began as a ripple in the late 1980s and has progressed into this enormous wave that is sweeping over the “Product Development Arena.” Products all the way from Automobiles to Government Policy creation to the delivery of massive Software Systems. To many of us who have been involved in this arena for over 20 years, we label it as the “Agile Revolution!”\nAnd the key framework, the most used framework, and the most successful framework in the Agile “space,” is Scrum. Scrum, is the framework that came from the work of the co-founders, Jeff Sutherland (senior) and Ken Schwaber (Scrum org).\nAnd the key method of understanding the needs of our stakeholders within an Agile Framework such as Scrum, and creating a product to fulfill those needs, is a tool that we call “User Stories.” This course is all about how to successfully create those User Stories.\nWhy You Should Take This Masterclass!\nRecently, one of the top Global Information Technology oversight organizations, Forrester, said this:\n“The organizational structures that got us to where we are today, are failing us — they are not the structures that will take us forward. Times have changed, and our organizations must adapt to catch up and begin to keep pace with business change”\nTo be at the forefront of working with our organizations to adapt and catch up and begin to keep pace with the changing world around us in the area of product development, you need to know what we are teaching in this course. You then need to take that knowledge and understanding and move it through your Agile teams, no matter what area of the organization they are located and working within.\nOur intent here is that when you finish our course, you will be an “expert” or SME (Subject Matter Expert) in the development of User Stories.\nFor you to achieve this, in this course we teach you:\n\n\nWhat Scrum is (short high-level refresher)\nWhy User Stories came into existence.\nWhat User Stories Are.\nUser Story Theory.\nThe User Story Structure.\nTechniques in arriving at and developing User Stories.\nUser Story Mapping\nUser Story Splitting.\nHow to use User Stories in your project burndowns.\nThe difference between User Stories and traditional requirements.\nThe difference between User Stories and Use Cases.\nHow to use “Spikes” to determine User Stories.\nDefect handling with User Stories.\nAnd So Much More ..........\nAll of this is based on where Agile Development is in early 2023.\nTo sum this all up, at the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge and understanding to not only work with teams using User Stories but also teach and mentor others on the successful use of User Stories.\nTherefore, make sure you take the step and click on purchasing this course. You will not be disappointed.\nYOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, BUT EVERYTHING TO GAIN!\nProfessor Ed …. “We Are Agile!”",

Students will learn to enhance project performance, increase profitability, and maximize business value by leveraging critical path drag and cost analysis.\nCritical Path and Drag\nA critical path is a sequence of activities directly impacting the project's overall duration. Drag, an essential concept for project scheduling, quantifies the delay caused by a critical path activity or the potential time savings from accelerating such activities. (Stephen Devaux)\nBeyond Traditional Project Management\nWhile traditional project management, as outlined in the PMBOK Guide, emphasizes project execution and timely delivery within budget, this course delves deeper into strategic project management. Key objectives include:\nMaximizing Business Value: Identifying and capitalizing on opportunities to increase the overall value derived from projects and investments.\nEnhancing Profitability: Implementing strategies to improve project margins and overall financial performance.\nRealizing Broader Benefits: Recognizing and addressing the wider societal and environmental implications of projects, such as reduced traffic congestion, accelerated drug development, and improved public health outcomes.\nBy mastering these advanced techniques, students will be empowered to drive significant improvements in project outcomes and contribute to organizational success.",

      "description": "If you're someone working in construction whether you're a Project Manager, Contract Administrator, Quantity Surveyor, Engineer, or just someone who deals with contracts and wants to get a grip on FIDIC then this course is for you.\nThis isn’t a summary-style, rush-through course. I’ve been working on this course since 2017, building it while handling real-life projects across different countries, timelines, and contract setups. Each clause in the FIDIC Red Book is explained in full detail with context, practical interpretation, and examples from actual project situations. My aim was simple, build a course that’s not just to “complete,” but one that becomes your reference point throughout your career.\nWe’ll go clause by clause, breaking things down in a clear, no-fluff way. I’ll share how each clause is actually used on site, what to look out for, and how to interpret it when things go south or when you need clarity during contract administration. You’ll also find insights on contractor and employer obligations, variations, delays, payment terms, and claim management -  all from a practitioner’s point of view.\n\n\nThis course is designed for:\nProject Managers and Engineers\nContract Administrators and QS professionals\nDevelopers, Employers, and Consultants\nAnyone who wants to master the FIDIC Red Book with real-world understanding\n\n\nWhat you’ll learn:\nDetailed clause-by-clause explanation of FIDIC Red Book.\nPractical contract interpretation and site-based applications\nRights and obligations of the Contractor, Employer, and Engineer\nHow to handle variations, delays, claims, and disputes\nReal examples and field-tested advice based on years of experience\n\n\nWhy this course is different:\nThis is not just theory. It’s based on actual experience from projects and you’ll hear my raw perspective, not textbook definitions.\n\n\nImportant Note:\nThis course is deep and detailed. Take your time and do not rush it. Come back to it when you’re handling a dispute, drafting a letter, or interpreting a clause. Use it like a working manual.\n\n\nLet’s get started and let’s make FIDIC your strongest tool on any project.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Agile Project Management fundamentals for IT Outsource course!\n\n\nProject management in IT currently looks like a promising entry point for those who want to start their journey in the IT industry.\n\n\nA few hard skills, good English and stress resistance open up this opportunity for you. However, interviewing a large number of graduates of offline IT project management courses, I see that most candidates are overwhelmed by the theoretical aspects of project management, and trained to solve problems that they are unlikely to meet in real life. They lack understanding of their immediate tasks in the specifics of IT Outsource, and they do not have the skills to perform them.\n\n\nCandidates who understand the realities of this profession require less attention and understand the expectations from their work - they immediately stand out among competitors and, as a rule, receive a job offer. To prepare such candidates, to give everything you need - the goal of this course!\n\n\nThis course is designed to give students all the information they need to:\n\n\n- Understanding the essence of the tasks performed and expectations from the work of Project Manager in IT Outsource\n\n\n- Understanding the essence of work on flexible project methodologies, how they are applied in IT outsource and how they need to be adapted to the needs of projects\n\n\n- Knowledge of techniques and options for project infrastructure management\n\n\n- Deep understanding of the features and essence of the work performed and the specifics of interaction with various IT specialists (developers, QA's, BA's, UI / UX designer's, DevOps engineer's)\n\n\n- Understanding what good processes are, what needs to be monitored and what measures to take in order for the project to move towards successful completion\n\n\n- Understanding the algorithms for performing various additional PM activities in IT outsource (upsales, pre-sales, work with contracts, work with the community)\n\n\n- Practical use of most of the required artifacts during the first year of PM work\n\n\nAnd as a result, it will allow you to successfully pass an interview for the position of at least a Junior Project manager, work productively even in the absence of a mentor or an organized onboarding process for you and not fail your first projects!",

Originating as a UK government standard for managing information systems projects, PRINCE2 has since evolved into a versatile framework used across various industries and sectors worldwide, including in the UK, Western Europe, and Australia. It is available in multiple languages, supporting its international adoption.\nThe methodology emphasizes dividing projects into manageable, controllable stages, enabling effective governance and improved project oversight. PRINCE2 is especially valued for its adaptability, allowing practitioners to tailor the approach to the size, complexity, and needs of any given project.\nKey Benefits of PRINCE2®:\nEnhanced quality of final deliverables\nImproved resource management and cost control\nClear roles and responsibilities within the project team\nStructured documentation and transparency\nGreater confidence and collaboration among stakeholders\nPRINCE2® training equips professionals with fundamental project management skills and supports career development by providing an industry-respected certification.\nWhile PRINCE2® delivers substantial advantages, it may be less suitable for smaller projects or highly adaptive environments, due to its emphasis on documentation and formal structure. In such cases, tailoring the methodology appropriately is essential to ensure its value without overburdening the project.\nIn essence, PRINCE2® provides a comprehensive framework that, when applied effectively, increases the likelihood of project success through structured planning, control, and accountability.",

Do you struggle with team resistance when trying to roll out a new initiative? Do you wish you had tools to help improve communication in your organization?\nIf you answered yes to any of the above, then this course is for you!\nThese are common barriers to success in healthcare organizations. Clinicians and clinical leaders often wear multiple hats. Whether that hat is preceptor, project manager, project leader, staff development, or one of the many other hats that are required for that catch-all phrase at the end of most job descriptions: \"And any other tasks required by management\" - we're not often taught the skills to be successful in those roles. We went to school to be nurses, therapists, and physicians – not managers, project managers, or organizational change leaders.\nThis course combines content from my Healthcare Project Management, Change Management in Healthcare, and Communication Basics courses - providing a comprehensive introduction to tools and techniques to set your healthcare initiatives up for success. You'll be introduced to project basics, like the project life cycle and tools and techniques to help achieve success in each phase. You'll gain an understanding of change management models and methods of navigating organizational change during each phase of the project life cycle. And you'll receive techniques for improving communication within your team and throughout your organization.\nI've included additional activities in this course to support your journey and encourage immediate application of your new knowledge.\nLet the journey begin!\nCONTINUING EDUCATION NOTES:\nPMP(R) Certificate Holders: This course content is appropriate to be self-logged for 1 PDU in Ways of Working and 1.5 PDUs in Leadership under the Education category. Nothing will be automatically added to your Dashboard after taking this course. You will have to manually log into your PMI(R) account and self-enter the PDUs in your Dashboard. Please message me with any questions on how to log your PDUs.\nPhysical Therapists/PTAs: For the year 2025 - This course is approved for 2 continuing education credits (1 credit for Project Healthcare Project Management and 1 credit for Change Management in Healthcare) by the West Virginia Board of Physical Therapy (WVBOPT) for physical therapists and physical therapy assistants in the United States. Please message me for details on obtaining the appropriate course certificate if this applies to you. (Note: Credit can only be awarded to each participant one time, as it is the same course being presented in multiple packages. Message me with any questions. Participants licensed in other states are responsible for checking if their state of licensure will accept the WVBOPT approval) Thank you!",

Even if these principles are fully followed.\n\nWhy is this happening? What is missing?\nBecause there are three traps that a project manager and his team can fall into.\nThese are:\n1) Endless, sometimes chronic and chimerical changes in project goals, scope, specifications, schedule, budget;\n2) Unexpected deviations from the plan. People basically know how to run a project when things go well. When things go badly - they don't necessarily deal with it anymore;\n3) Failure to meet deadlines and deliver expected results despite project monitoring;\nThe course is very practical.\nI will share with you three lifewheels for projects.\nAll will be presented using my own experience.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\n- How to manage project changes in advance using the Trade Off Matrix technique;\n- how to manage deviations using the Deviation Baseball Game model;\n- how to ensure the desired project pace using the Short Interval Control (SIC) mechanism;\n- how to increase your individual project success rate;\n\n\nWho should attend the course?\nI. Beginners who are starting their adventure in project management\nII. Practitioners who have quite a bit of experience in projects\nIII. Project management trainers and mentors\nIV.

Drawing from his 25 years of experience in consulting and managing major projects, Jamal shares valuable insights and practical techniques to master the art of schedule management.\nBeginning with an overview of the project manager's responsibilities, we explore the vital role of the schedule management plan within the overall project plan. We then dive into the key steps of the schedule management process, including Activity Definition, Activity Sequencing, Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Duration Estimating, Schedule Development, and Schedule Control.\nWithin Schedule Development, we explore various tools and techniques, such as software commonly used for scheduling, Activity Sequencing using methods like Precedence diagramming (PDM) and Arrow diagramming (ADM), and Activity Duration Estimation employing expert judgment, analogous estimating (Top-Down), engineering estimating (Bottom-Up), and network diagrams including PERT and Critical Path methods.\nContinuing our exploration, we delve into project schedule controls methodologies, including Variance Analysis, which involves comparing Scheduled Time with Actual Time, and Earned Value Management (EVM), where metrics like SV, SPI, EAC, ETC, and VAC provide valuable insights.\nWe also examine schedule variance tolerances and discuss the levels at which they should be tracked. Additionally, we explore several methods for the Schedule Variance Response Process, equipping you with effective strategies to address deviations from the planned schedule.\nSubsequently, we shift our focus to Project Schedule with the aid of real-life examples, enabling you to better understand practical implementation. We also explore the Schedule Change Control Process, which involves Schedule Control and managing schedule changes through the Change Request document. Furthermore, we discuss assessing the impact of changes on the overall project.\nTo reinforce your learning, you will be provided with an assignment that challenges you to create your own Schedule Management Plan, applying the knowledge and techniques acquired throughout the course. This hands-on exercise, such as planning a bathroom or kitchen renovation project, allows you to practically apply the principles of schedule management.\nEnroll in this course led by Jamal and acquire the expertise to effectively manage project schedules.

      "description": "Agile is an approach for a successful project delivery. I would like to emphasize the word, successful as mostly Agile focuses on achieving the expected goals and results.\nAgile is based on DSDM framework, which stands for Dynamic System Development Method. DSDM was found in 1994 by a group of IT Practitioners, to improve the traditional approach.\nDSDM is a method of incremental delivery of parts of the solution. It means, that in DSDM Project is divided on increments and so the solution is delivered partially, to deliver the expected level of quality.\nThe course is more focused on theory of Agile and introduces you with basics of methodology. These knowledges will be also enough to start a career in Project Management or open your own business.\nAfter completing this course you will be prepared for the Foundation level exam. If you want to pass the exam, please watch the course till the last video, as at the exam, there may be any question from each section.\nThis course is for people, who want to know how to build project or business succesfully. Understanding of Project Management is good, but knowing how to successfuly build it are in demand everywhere.",

      "description": "The world of risk management is all about navigating the unknown. Processes, frameworks, and plans provide structure, but people remain at the heart of every project’s success.\nArtificial intelligence can analyse data, model scenarios, and flag potential risks, but it cannot understand human motivation, empathy, or trust. These qualities are essential for building resilient teams and managing uncertainty with confidence.\nThis course puts people at the centre of risk management. It explores how emotional intelligence underpins a strong risk-aware culture through motivation, empathy, open communication, and effective mitigation strategies.\nYou will learn how leaders use critical thinking, analytical skills, and courage to make sound decisions that balance risk and reward. More importantly, you will see how emotionally intelligent leadership inspires trust and shapes the emotional climate in which risk management thrives.\n\n\nThe Human-Centred Risk Management Beyond the Limits of AI course covers\n\nThe intersection of risk management principles and emotional intelligence skills\nHow emotions influence behaviour, communication, and performance\nThe identification, assessment, and mitigation of risk from a human-centred perspective.\nPractical strategies for empowering people and managing performance in risk-sensitive environments.\nThe limits of AI in risk management and how human judgment bridges the gap.\n\n\nWhy Take The Human-Centred Risk Management Beyond the Limits of AI Course?\n\nBy integrating technical strategies with the human element, this course helps project leaders and professionals build stronger, more adaptable teams. You will gain the tools to manage not just the risks themselves, but also the emotions and behaviours that determine how risks are addressed.\nHuman-centred risk management goes beyond the limits of AI because at the core of every project are people.\n\n\nBy completing this course, you will be able to:\n\nExplain how emotional intelligence influences risk perception, decision-making, and team responses in ways that AI cannot replicate\nRecognise how emotional intelligence skills underpin effective risk identification, assessment, and mitigation\nDevelop practical strategies for working constructively with emotions in high-risk situations\nEvaluate communication approaches that build trust and psychological safety when discussing and managing risk\nEnhance communication and collaboration to support balanced, informed risk-based decisions.\nCreate an action plan that applies your emotional intelligence skills to strengthen risk management beyond the limits of AI\nBy prioritising emotional intelligence and people management skills, a more risk-aware culture can be encouraged to navigate uncertainty and achieve success in risk management projects.\n\n\nAll videos are recorded in High Definition 1080p.\nAll PDFs can be completed online and are Section 508 / ADA Accessibility compliant.\nAll videos have grammatically correct English captions.\nLatest update - September 2025",

      "description": "Today's leaders need more than technical skills. They need self-awareness, interpersonal, group, and systems skills to help them navigate in increasingly complex and cross-functional environments. They need to be the calm in the eye of the storm, adapting constantly to new challenges not as a lone warrior, but as a catalyst for teamwork.\nTeamwork is the most important hack for a leader, but not always the easiest hack to access. Most arrive in leadership positions because they have been skilled and reliable contributors. Thinking back to their family of origin, which this course guides self-reflection on from the perspective of family systems thinking, leaders were often highly responsible kids, who are used to functioning independently and expect others to do the same. They may live by the old adage, \"If you want something done right, do it yourself.\" Unfortunately that reflects a systems concept called \"over-functioning,\" which actually causes \"underfunctioning\" in the rest of team and in the larger system. Hacks for balancing over and under functioning are an example of the systems thinking gems available in this course.\nYour instructor, Gilmore Crosby, has worked with thousands of leaders at all levels, in organizations such as Dupont, ALCOA, Beiersdorf, PECO Nuclear, Entergy, Jamalco, Campari, Contadina, Treehouse, Red Stripe, Sound Transit, Moon Palace Resort, The Samish Indian Nation and many others. He is also senior faculty for the Leadership Institute of Seattle (LIOS), and has written six books related to leadership. He brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to bear on on helping you become the most effective and agile leader you can be.\nThis course will equip you with creative short-cuts to high personal and team performance, guiding you as you experiment and practice in your real life as you learn. It is designed with immediate results in mind. More importantly, it will teach you to fish by equipping you with skills for continuous self and team improvement. Mr. Crosby will be right there with, offering a life-time commitment to helping you think through and learn from the challenges you face.\nIn this course you'll learn:\n\n\nHacks for leading under any circumstances\nHacks for the human side of project management\nHow to align complex and cross-functional systems\nHacks for decreasing misunderstanding, resolving conflict, and improving communication\nHow to harness group dynamics for productivity and morale\nHow to hack the force field and break the homeostasis in any system\nThis course is challenging but relatively quick, containing 10 lectures and approximately 100 minutes of video content. There are short quizzes after each segment and agile leadership downloads to drive learning home. It's designed for anyone, regardless of experience level, who wants to be a more agile and effective leader, with the added benefit of life hacks for professional and personal life.\nIf you are ready to become an effective and agile leader, enroll today!",

In general, the UK, Australia prefer PRINCE2, and the US and American countries prefer PMP. Asia, Africa and the Middle East area have no strong preference for PMP or PRINCE2. The important thing is that PMP (PMBOK) can be used with PRINCE2.\nPRINCE2 and PMP acknowledge each other's existence in their advertising material and attempt to position themselves as complementary products – PRINCE2 as a \"methodology\" and PMP as a \"standard\"[26] – which can be used alongside each other.

And my custom course has helped many others pass the exam. Let me give you a hint here - The secret lies in the processes!\nThis tutorial should help you learn the most important lesson, which is not taught in any book, but is the key to getting that certificate and to becoming better project managers.\nProjects take people and processes to happen. Great projects deliver value to an organization and great project teams and managers, create that value. Developing a deliverable, takes the entire team, the stakeholder community to work in collaboration. Therefore, the knowledge and understanding of project processes are super important for everyone who is a part of a project. The project manager, the Sponsor, The project team, The stakeholders, The PMO and The organization too.\nProcesses are many and their integration is complex but something we cannot avoid. It is a type of knowledge, that has not been displayed in books and thereby not taught enough. No matter, how much of an Agile or hybrid we become, processes will also remain an integral part of a project and their successful integration will also matter to the success of the project outcome.\n\n\nTake the class and learn for yourself!",

I’m Eric Heilmann, and I’ve been leading new product development programs for over 20 years at various companies in the tech industry. I have found this field of program and project management very rewarding, and I’m excited to have the opportunity to share what I’ve learned with you.\nThe objective of new product development is to enable the sales, delivery and support of products and services. The goal of course is to provide customers with value while meeting the business needs of your company.\nIn this course, I will be covering a lot of familiar concepts and techniques that are part of general project management. However, in the context of new product development, some of these techniques take on more significance than others. For example, interfaces to product management, business development, and customer support are critical to defining and validating the product before releasing it to mass production.\nAs a new product development program manager, you are not just responsible for delivering a product on time and under budget, but also for making sure that planning and execution of the entire new product introduction is carried out successfully. No matter what industry you are in, technology and globalization will continue to increase competitive pressure, making the successful development and launch of new products even more critical to the health and survival of your company.",

You can start with no experience as a beginner and end with a working knowledge of Google Sheets and scheduling. We will build a Gantt chart-style schedule from start to finish so you will end the course with a schedule of your own to track your current project. (Or a theoretical one that you WANT to track!) The existing online courses on scheduling are typically dry, slow, and are not suited for beginners. This course changes that!\nBrendan has used this kind of schedule to track dozens of commercial construction projects over the last 10 years of his career. This is the class he wishes he had back in 2014 when re-entering the construction field. It shares the foundational elements of the tools and techniques to build an effective and clear schedule as quickly as possible. A detailed and clear schedule increases the speed of any project and helps everyone involved to be efficient and come away satisfied.\nIn this class you'll learn:\nHow to get access to Google Sheets for free\nHow to set up and build a schedule\nHow to actually plan activities in order and organize them correctly in a Gantt chart style.\nFormatting techniques for giving plenty of info without adding visual clutter\nHow to edit and change your schedule when the ideal plans don’t work out! (This always happens!)\nYou’ll be creating:\nA custom schedule to track your own project accurately and simply.\nWhy make a schedule?\nScheduling keeps your project on track whether that’s a $3 million construction project or a plan to clean out the garage over spring break this year. Anything that has more than 10 steps to it and relies on one action following another step by step deserves a proper schedule to have high quality and the fastest possible finishing date! So why are we using Google Sheets and not a fancy, purpose-built scheduling program?\nWhy Google Sheets?\nGoogle Sheets is an incredible way to make a schedule. After using 5 different dedicated programs for scheduling, Brendan has circled back to the simplicity and ease of Google Sheets for his professional work. Here’s why:\nIt’s free\nIt’s faster than other programs\nIt’s simple for other people to pick up and interpret\nIt’s highly customizable\nIt’s perfectly integrated to mobile devices like phones and tablets\nIt speaks a common language of the business word which is: the language of spreadsheet\nExports to excel well if you need that option\nIt is effective in practice\nDo I need to be a spreadsheet expert to do this?\nNo!

Simply go to dtsimulator dot com and download a free template that allows you to perform simulation without having to purchase expensive software. List your project risks on a register. As in qualitative risk analysis, you add 2 dimensions to each risk line: frequency and severity. We teach you how to add expert’s opinion, adding distribution functions to both frequency and severity of possible risk events. You are ready to perform a Monte Carlo simulation: a mathematical method on top of Excel that generates random values along the distributions of your risks. With thousands of repetitions or scenarios, DTSimulator generates datasets from which graphs summarize the outcomes of your analysis. We will teach you how to analyze histograms, tornado charts, S curves and scatter plots to get the most out of a quantitative project risk analysis.

If so, our exclusive PMP Exam Prep course is just what you need! This Udemy course offers detailed explanations and practice tests based on the most updated version of the PMBOK Guide (7th edition), as well as many call outs from PMBOK 6th edition and 6 other PMI exam textbooks. Aspirants will be able to gain a better understanding of each knowledge area with exam questions that are similar to the real exam and two mock tests that are situationally based.\n\n\nMy PMP experience\nUnlike some of the exams you’ve found on Udemy or online, I recently passed the PMP on my first try in mid-2023, with above target in all categories. You can look me up in the PMI registry, visit my LinkedIn or PMP review on my website for more information.\nI also passed my PMI-ACP a few years ago with above target in all categories, so I understand the structure of the agile questions from the PMI. I have also practically used agile for the last 8+ years of experience in running agile teams in tech.\nNote:\nOn my website (Yourdigitalaid) I have reviews of both my taking and passing the PMP and PMI-ACP. You can read more there for free!\nThe purpose of me creating this Udemy course was to create an exam simulator with realistic PMP questions of someone that actually wrote the exam recently and understand the examination content outline which has completely change the structure of the PMP.\nI personally also struggled with finding a cheap set of high quality PMP exam questions which was off-putting and discouraging.\n\n\nEach practice exam includes 180 questions covering the following:\nAll of the exam content outlines (ECOs)\nAll five process groups\nPredictive, Hybrid and Agile related questions (especially scrum).\nQuestions covering business environment, people and process\nA clear walkthrough on why each the rationale for the correct answer and the corresponding references to the PMIs documentation.\nMany of the questions are situational based, and don’t have a direct answer available in the references, but most be deduced.\n\n\nWhen taking these exams\nTo ensure success in passing the these practice exams and even the PMP certification exam, analyze the questions slowly and re-read the answers. If you get the wrong answer, understand why the answer is wrong and the review the references I left.\nWith a total duration of four hours for each of our PMP practice tests, we try to replicate the real exam, and come with questions that relate to the PMBOK, Agile practice guide and many of the other reading materials.\n\n\nRefer to the PMP ECO (examination content outline) for the specific tasks. Each of the tasks labelled at the bottom of each answer / question, will tell you how each question relates to the actual exam.\n\n\nDomain I - People\nDomain II - Process\nDomain III - Business environment\n\n\nNote: I wish I could add all of the tasks, but Udemy seems to have a limit on how many knowledge areas you're allowed to have. I also can't choose more than one, so take the knowledge areas in Udemy for what they're worth.\n\n\nFurther training and support\nIf you’re looking for more support to pass the PMP outside of the educator support offered by Udemy - if you buy the course, I will set-up a 30 minute office hours (VIA Adplist) with you to help chat through any issues you may be have with studying or provide you with guidance on mock exams and exam sets offer by me. I can also point you in the right direction on where to get the resources below.\n\n\nReferences I used at the end of almost all the practice questions:\nPMBOK Guide Sixth edition\nPMBOK Guide Seventh edition\nAgile practice guide\nEffective Project Management - Traditional Agile, Extreme (7th edition)\nEssential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process\nProject Management: The Managerial Process (4th and 7th edition)\nProject Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling 10th edition\nInformation Technology Project Management 8th Edition\n\nWhen going through the questions, reference these documents at the end of each question.",

      "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE YOU REGISTER: this course was created for people who want to learn how to organize all the necessary planning information for a website project before they interview / hire a website designer or a developer. This course is NOT for a web designer, web project manager, web developer, agency owner or someone in digital marketing wanting to learn about website planning for their clients' websites.\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nWhether you’ve hired a web developer before or you’re gearing up for your first project, we’ve all had the exact same thoughts cross our minds…\n\n\n✓ I don’t even know what I want for my website.\n✓ How do I communicate what I want to a developer so they actually get it right?\n✓ I’m worried they will take advantage of me because I don’t know enough.\n✓ What if the project ends up way more expensive than my quote?\n✓ I’m afraid I won’t understand anything my web developer says to me.\n\n\nThe good news is that you’re not alone. And I’m here to help you leave these fears in the dust once and for all.\n\n\nHey there, I’m Natasha!\n\n\nAs the founder of On Purpose Projects, a web design/development team that has created hundreds of websites, I’ve seen every high and low in the book…\n\n\n...and I’ve been through them myself!\n\n\nAs an ‘accidental’ founder of a web agency, and with zero technical knowledge at all, I had no idea how the website creation process was supposed to go to achieve the results I wanted…\n\n\n… and I ended up losing tens of thousands of my own money on my website projects.\n\n\nFor years I struggled to run website projects properly….\n… I had no idea what questions to ask when hiring someone to do the work…\n… I didn’t know how to communicate exactly what I wanted so they could provide an accurate quote…\n… I was constantly stressed out and worried I was sinking all my money into a project that wouldn’t even turn out the way I wanted.\n\n\nBut when I finally stopped and took the time to figure out why my projects weren’t successful, I worked out exactly what was required to make every single project run smoothly, stay on time, and be on budget.\n\n\nI discovered that I:\n\n\n✓ Didn’t have a game plan\n✓ Hired the wrong person\n✓ Did not communicate my expectations clearly\n\n\nThat’s why I created this course.\n\n\nI want to remove all the guesswork from the website creation process so you can have the confidence to get exactly what you need without the endless stress and headaches.\n\n\nImagine…\n\n\n✓ no more miscommunications\n✓ no technical surprises\n✓ no missed deadlines\n✓ no unexpected invoices\n✓ the right expert to help accomplish your goals\n✓ no more sleepless nights and daily headaches\n\n\n\n\nAll of this is totally possible for you, you just need the right plan.\n\n\n\n\n3 reasons why most website projects end in frustration and disappointment.\n\n\n1. You have no game plan.\nWebsites may seem simple on the surface, but in reality there are so many layers and moving parts to the project.\n\n\nWeb developers may be experts, but they can’t read your mind. If you don’t know exactly what you want your website to look like and do, it’s impossible for them to meet your goals.\n\n\nThis course will give you a step-by-step game plan for preparing for your website project, so you’ll never have to guess at any part of your website again.\n\n\n\n\n2. You hire the wrong person.\nWebsites are complicated, I get it! And it’s tempting to want to rely on the experts to tell you what you need to and who can help you accomplish it.\n\n\nBut if you’re not clear on what your ideal website looks like and does, chances are you’ll hire the wrong person and waste time (and money) on expensive mistakes and website do-overs.\n\n\nThis course is going to dig into exactly what different web experts can do so you can make an informed choice about the type of professional that’s the right fit for your needs.\n\n\n\n\n3. You don’t clearly communicate your expectations.\nIt can be terrifying to hand off your website to a professional and trust that they do exactly what you need them to do. You end up feeling helpless and frustrated when things don’t go to plan, and you’re left correcting them over and over again until eventually you just want to give up and start again with someone else.\n\n\nI’m going to show you how to communicate your expectations and feedback with your website developer so you are both on the same page every step of the way. You’ll be empowered to avoid every misunderstanding and miscommunication that hinders so many other business owners.\n\n\n\n\nYour stress-free website plan starts now.\n\n\nEver heard the phrase “measure three times, cut once”?\n\n\nThat’s exactly what this course is going to help you do. We’re going to put all the work in at the front end so you get exactly what you need without expensive re-dos (and all the frustration that comes along with it).\n\n\nEven if you aren’t tech savvy…\n… even if you have that creative brain that struggles to plan…\n… even if you don’t know the first thing about websites…\n\n\nYou have the ability to create an effective website plan. All you need is a nudge in the right direction.\n\n\nLet’s get started!",

      "description": "Agile Project Management has revolutionized the way organizations approach project delivery, offering a framework for achieving flexibility, speed, and customer satisfaction in a rapidly changing business environment. This comprehensive course is designed to equip participants with the knowledge, skills, and tools necessary to effectively manage projects using Agile methodologies.\nThis course provides an in-depth exploration into Agile Project Management, a contemporary approach to project management that prioritizes flexibility and collaboration. Traditionally, many projects followed a linear, fixed-path progression, but in today's fast-paced digital age, businesses require a more adaptive and responsive methodology. Enter Agile. By embracing change as a constant, Agile Project Management allows for dynamic adaptations, ensuring that the end product is both relevant and of high quality.\nThe Agile approach is grounded in a set of guiding principles that emphasize customer collaboration, responding to change, and delivering functional products incrementally. Within this module, participants will delve into the twelve principles of the Agile Manifesto, understanding its philosophy and values. Furthermore, learners will be introduced to popular Agile frameworks such as Scrum, Kanban, and Lean. Each of these methodologies offers distinct tools and techniques for handling projects, and this course provides hands-on experience with each, helping students discern the best approach for different project types.\nA critical component of Agile Project Management is the range of tools and techniques available to manage and track progress. In this segment, students will learn about user stories, backlogs, sprint planning, retrospectives, and daily stand-ups, among others. Beyond the mechanics, it's vital to understand the human side of Agile. As such, this course delves into the various roles involved in an Agile team - from the Scrum Master and Product Owner to the Development Team - shedding light on the responsibilities and interactions that drive Agile projects forward.\nThrough a blend of theoretical insights and practical applications, participants will explore the principles and values of Agile, the key frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, and Lean), and the best practices for implementing Agile in diverse industries. The course also emphasizes collaboration, iterative development, and adaptability to deliver high-quality results.\nBy the end of this online course, learners will not only grasp the foundational concepts of Agile but will also be equipped with the tools and knowledge to implement Agile practices effectively in their respective domains.",

      "description": "This course is designed for healthcare project managers (PMs) or clinical project leads with limited formal background in change management fundamentals. Throughout the course modules, you will receive an introduction to how people navigate change and an introduction to the change management process by reviewing some popular theories and models of change. We will also cover an overview of the life cycle of a project. Finally we’ll combine both change management principles and the project life cycle by reviewing some common barriers to change in healthcare projects throughout each stage of the project life cycle and allow time to apply the change management principles you just learned to each.\nAs a physical therapist, I was tasked with managing projects that required behavioral change, but I had no formal knowledge of change management theories, models, or tools to help manage that process. If a goal of our projects is to improve adoption of a new organization initiative, especially ones that involve workflow changes or practice changes, change management is an integral piece to ensuring that our projects are a success!\nThe goal of this course is to provide you with lessons learned, 'what I wish I had knowns', and basic tools to set you up for successfully implementing change at your organizations!\nLet the journey begin!\nCONTINUING EDUCATION NOTES:\nPMP(R) Certificate Holders: This course content is appropriate to be self-logged for 0.5 PDU in Power Skills under the Education category.

      "description": "Have you ever wondered why the programs at your organization aren't fully adopted? Why it feels like each department works in a silo instead of resembling actual teammates? Why the ball gets dropped so often? Why there's so much miscommunication? Why people keep doing things the way they've always been doing them - even if those processes aren't working?\nIf you answered yes to any of those questions - then this course if for you!\nThis course is a combination of the best of my Healthcare Project Management (101) and Healthcare Project Management v2.0 (102) courses. The first half of this course provides an introduction to project management terminology and the project life cycle. While the second half of this course will repeat and build off of those concepts, diving deeper into each. The second part of this course also includes assignments and resources to encourage you to further apply your newly gained knowledge. Because stories are known to improve learning, I've created healthcare project scenarios that we'll follow throughout the entire course to help the information stick! You'll also have an opportunity to create your own clinic profile and apply the information learned to a project unique to your organization.\nI was a physical therapist that wore the hat of project manager in my organization for years without knowing what a project manager was. Now that I've formally studied the field, received my certification, and have been a practicing project manager in the healthcare space for years, it's my goal to pass on the 'what-I-wish-I-had-knowns' to my fellow clinicians-turned-project managers/leads. Together we can make a positive difference in the awesome world of healthcare!\nLet the journey begin!\nCONTINUING EDUCATION NOTES:\nPMP(R) Certificate Holders: This course content is appropriate to be self-logged for 2 PDUs for Ways of Working under the Education category. Nothing will be automatically added to your Dashboard after taking this course. You will have to manually log into your PMI(R) account and self-enter the PDUs in your Dashboard. Please message me with any questions on how to log your PDUs.\nPhysical Therapists/PTAs: For the year 2025 - This course is approved for 1 continuing education credit by the West Virginia Board of Physical Therapy (WVBOPT) for physical therapists and physical therapy assistants in the United States. Please message me for details on obtaining the appropriate course certificate if this applies to you. (Note: Credit can only be awarded to each participant one time, as it is the same course being presented in multiple packages. Message me with any questions. Participants licensed in other states are responsible for checking if their state of licensure will accept the WVBOPT approval) Thank you!",

I do public training, such as the certified scrum master and the certified product owner class, as well as private trainings in companies across the nation.\nIn this class, I will give you and your team enough information to baseline everyone, and let you get going with Scrum and Agile: what it means to be Agile, what Scrum is and how it is Agile, the roles and the meetings in Scrum, and the underpinnings and requirements of Scrum.\nIn the class videos, I try to incorporate my usual engaging style with lots of examples and stories. We’ve created an accompanying .pdf handout to give you some walk away notes and resources to dive in deeper on the points that interest you in particular. This video could be used with teams or management to help get everyone on the same page about what it means to be Agile and implement Scrum.\nStudents will fill in blanks and diagrams on the handout as they follow along with the videos. Students will complete several application exercises throughout the course. The video run time is a little over an hour... about 70 minutes. If students do all the exercises, they should be able to finish in less than 2 hours.\nWe're going to cover all this and more in a one hour baseline overview that I hope is something that gives you a good sense of what Agile is, what it means to be Agile, and how we do Scrum. This course is not just for individuals, but hopefully for teams as well, to iron out some of the problems that they might face going forward.\nI will be circling back to the class discussion area around once a week to respond to discussions and provide additional input.

      "description": "A general contractor is a professional who manages the construction of buildings, roads, bridges, or other infrastructure projects. They oversee all aspects of a construction project, from the planning and design stages to the final inspection and handover. They are responsible for hiring and supervising subcontractors, negotiating contracts, and ensuring that the project is completed on time and within budget. General contractors typically have a background in construction, engineering, or architecture, and they may be licensed by their state or province to perform construction work.\nGeneral contractor is a manager, and possibly a tradesman, employed by the client on the advice of the architect, engineer or the architectural technologist or the client him/herself if acting as the manager. A general contractor is responsible for the overall coordination of a project. A general contractor must first assess the project-specific documents (referred to as bid, proposal or tender documents). In the case of renovations, a site visit is required to get a better understanding of the project. Depending on the project delivery method, the contractor will submit a fixed price proposal or bid, cost plus price or an estimate. The general contractor considers the cost of home office overhead, general conditions, materials and equipment as well as the cost of labor to provide the owner with a price for the project.\n\n\nContract documents include drawings, project manual (including general, supplementary and/or special conditions and specifications), addendum or modifications issued prior to proposal/ bidding and prepared by a design professional such as an architect. The general contractor may be the construction manager or construction manager at high risk.\n\n\nThere are no set educational qualifications to become a general contractor, though many employers prefer a bachelor's degree. Some general contractors obtain bachelor's degrees in construction science, building science, surveying, construction safety, or other disciplines.\nMost of the construction professionals are aware about the poor performance of construction, yet we keep seeing projects fail and lose money. Despite all the innovations and all the project management methodologies that are being implemented, the industry is still far to be efficient. The true problem is that we are not mastering the basics due to the lack of trainings and mentorship.\nThe goal of this course, is to teach you the basics. The basics of commercial and contractual knowledge skills and knowledge that you were not exposed to, the basics that we thought they are not for engineers, the basics that should be mastered by anyone working in the construction sector.\nMy goal is to share all the experience, knowledge and skills that I’ve I have gained from real work experiences in different tenders, mega projects; and international clients in different countries and present them to you as lessons to learn from.\nThe course is structured into 5 chapters, These chapters will describe the story of a Contract from its formation by the client till its execution by Contractors. This course will be your guide in any construction project and the way to improve your career path.\nIn the first two chapters, we will start talking about the basics in the construction. The skills and attitude of a project manager, and what you are missing to enhance your career. We will talk about how to read and understand international forms of agreement, the structure of any bidding documents and many more.\nIn chapter three, we will see how the contract is formed and developed by the Client. We will come across the important terms and conditions used in most of the agreements. I will introduce the risk management process and how risks are playing a major role in the preparation of any contract. We will talk about the choice of the right contract form, bonds and guarantees that the client can use to guarantee the success of his investment.\nIn chapter four, we will come across the typical disputes that occur in the industry, the common contractual pitfalls. We will see the root causes of these problems and how we can avoid them.\nIn the last chapter, we will see how the contractor can win and complete a successful project, starting from the estimation and bidding stage, passing through the award and negotiation of the contract, till its execution and administration.\nWe will talk about many topics, with real case studies.",

      "description": "Agile is a great framework, but it is designed for projects without a specific scope. You are supposed to start working on the project with an overall idea of where you want to go and the specifics are discovered along the way.\nThe majority of projects though tend to be Hybrid Agile, in the sense that they have a waterfall approach with a predefined set of requirements, but still use Agile to manage the day-to-day processes.\nAgile tools for forecasting projects, though, are not meant for Hybrid projects. They focus on forecasting epics or versions and assume that you have all the stories estimated in your backlog. In a Hybrid six-month project this is impossible since you cannot have your team estimate the whole project at once.\nIn this course, you will receive a spreadsheet that enables you to forecast a Hybrid Agile project as a whole (not just an epic) by using your Initial Offer (the initial break-down of the project in estimated features) as a reference. In this way, you don't have to estimate the whole project with your team, instead you use the team's estimates sprint after sprint to increase the accuracy of your forecast as the project progresses.\nOnce you complete the course, you will have a real tool in your hands that will enable you to get a fresh status of your project with a few clicks and with minor manual work, including a forecast of the completion time of the whole project.",

Do you need help creating tools that will schedule and track the progress of your projects? Do you want to be able to communicate effectively with your project team?\nIf So, Then Continue To Read And Find Out How This Course Will Benefit Your Career And Improve Your IT Skills For Project Management.\nHere is a summary of what you will learn:\n\n\nUnderstand what a Gantt chart is and why it is critical to project management.\nLearn about the history and evolution of the Gantt chart\nUnderstand the key components of the Gantt chart\nDevelop skills with spreadsheet software such as formatting, conditional formatting, and design.\nCreate a dynamic Gantt chart for complex projects\nUnderstand the limitations of spreadsheet software\nLearn about the advanced features of modern software\nCreate advanced Gantt charts using specialized tools such as Monday and TeamGantt\nAvoid mistakes and apply best practices\n\n\nDeveloping skills with spreadsheets and project management software is something that all project team professionals should do. This practical course will teach you how to create professional Gantt charts designed to schedule and track the progress of a project. Not only that, you will create something visually impressive and you will be the go-to in the team for making the project's spreadsheets and monitoring tools.\nRecent statistics from a research organisation suggest that only 22% of project managers use project management software. That means that most project managers are likely to use spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel.\nOne of the main reasons that project managers do not use project management software or dedicated Gantt programs is the lack of support from an organisation. Learning how to use spreadsheets to create effective Gantt charts means that you will not have this problem. There will be no need to use expensive software that nobody knows how to use!\nHuge projects require complex scheduling with great detail. You will already understand this but have you got the skills to work with spreadsheets and create something effective? By the end of this course, the answer will be ‘yes’.\nFor project managers that want to work with project management software and dedicated Gantt software, you will learn how to work with apps such as Monday and TeamGantt. This will give you experience with specialized tools before deciding on apps that you think are right for your organisation. There are many project tools and specialized programs to choose from.\nOne of the essential tools you, and your project team, are going to need is the Gantt chart. The Gantt chart is a critical tool used to schedule and monitor a project’s timeline. You will use this tool to visualise task durations, schedules, and progress. There are various software solutions out there but being able to create a Gantt chart enables you to build something specific to your project.\nA Gantt chart is an invaluable tool that will help you and your team better understand the workflow through visualisation. The Gantt is also an effective communication tool. You can communicate to your team and stakeholders the progress of the phases and tasks of a project. The Gantt chart can be part of stakeholder reporting and included with status reports.\nYou will learn how to plan the layout, add formatting, and include conditional formatting to your Gantt chart. This will provide you with excellent visualisation of the project timeline as well as the task durations. Your team will easily be able to view the progress of the project and have no difficulties in understanding the information.\nThe course also provides tutorials that will help you understand the limitations of spreadsheet software. In future, you may decide to work with dedicated Gantt software. But this course will provide you with the foundations to understand the charts and how they can be applied to projects.\nYou will learn about the mistakes that project managers can make when applying Gantt charts to projects. You can enhance your management career by avoiding these mistakes and increase the likelihood of successful projects.\nEnrolling on this course will allow you to progress through easy-to-follow tutorials broken down into short video lengths. You will easily be able to learn at your own pace. This course will take you through each step of creating a professional Gantt chart. You will learn how to create charts from scratch, develop your spreadsheet skills, and build your confidence working with project management tools.\nThe tutorials feature LibreOffice Calc as the spreadsheet software of choice. However, Microsoft Excel has the same functionality and you will be able to create the charts shown in the tutorials. The navigation may be a little different. You can also use other spreadsheet software of your choice. Experience working with project tools and software would be beneficial.\nThe course is not going to teach you all about project management. You should already have a good understanding of project management in practice either through experience or studies. The course will also not teach you how to use spreadsheet software or apps. You should be comfortable with the software of your choice and have some experience with using formulas and other functionality (e.g. drag and drop). You will be expected to have spreadsheet experience and be proficient with using software apps before enrolling on this course.\nThis course is all about you developing on your existing spreadsheet, productivity, and project skills that most modern organisations will be looking for. Enrol now and add those essential IT skills to your resume. You will be an asset to your organisation or future employers!",

      "description": "In the beginning of my career, I was assigned to projects where the solution had already been selected, and I considered that to be very normal. That's the way things are done, I thought, and I never thought to question that approach. Sometimes, our projects would be successful, sometimes not.  Sure, I would look for the reasons for success or failure, but usually I was always looking at the wrong place. Maybe the team makes the difference? Perhaps it was my knowledge of the subject matter that defined victory?\nIt took me some time, but I came up with my answer. Some activities need to be completed before the project commences, at least on a basic level. Otherwise, project success is just pure luck.\nThis course is all about those things you need to do before your project is formed to ensure that you create the benefits your project is intended to generate!\nThe course is made up of 6 sections:\nWhat problem are you solving or opportunity you want to generate? If you can't answer this, how do you know that you reached it?\nWhere are you starting from, and what should you have at the end? This is the transformation you are working towards; the basis of all projects\nWho will be affected by your project, either positively or negatively? All parts are key, but this is the element I see neglected the most.\nWhat needs have to be fulfilled? At least on a high level, you have to have a basic idea of what people are looking for.\nHow many solutions are there to create the opportunity or solve the problem? There are always at least two. Find out why I say this.\nWhat is the best solution? Here, we are talking about the solution that brings the most value.\nI know what you are thinking. You don't have the time to go through all these steps. The fact is that you don't have the time NOT to perform these activities. This course will show you how you conduct these exercises quickly and efficiently.\nSo, if you are looking to find out how you can run your projects better, this course is exactly right for you.\nDon't wait. Let's get started!\nLast updated September 16th, 2019",

No unnecessary repetition of subject which makes it boring and monotonous but carefully designed subject that makes you self-sufficient as you move through the course.\nThere are 3 types of students who can take this course.\nExperienced Project Management professionals\nProfessionals who just attained the qualification requirement for PMP Certification exam & CAPM Certification Exam\nThose who are interested in knowing/learning Project Management from world best practices and standards perspective based on PMBOK Guide from PMI regardless of attempting the certification exam or not.\nThe course has been designed in such a way that it serves all the 3 types of aspirants accordingly and comprehensively  without subjecting any of them to either boredom or inadequacy - while giving a common benefit to all, of improving their professional and personal quality of life by enhancing the productivity.\nIt takes off smoothly by setting the stage appropriately taking along all aspirants towards a strong base via practical examples, scenarios, anecdotes and analogies from the rich experience of the trainer as a seasoned Project Manager across the world and across many projects - small, medium and large out of which some of them are mission critical.\nA proper blend of various requirements of aspirants like learning effective Project Management and also be enabled to crack the CAPM/PMP certification exam.\nHere are a couple of time tested approaches used by the trainer - that he used to train many aspirants towards being great Project Managers and also pass the certification exam easily.\n\"If you give a person a fish, you give him/her a meal once. If you teach in the art of catching fish, you give him/her a meal for lifetime\"\n\"A good trainer is one who makes himself/herself progressively unnecessary\"\nActually the above proverb is meant for a Project Manager but I have adapted it to the training too. It can be applicable to anything where you are performing and enabling organisations and people.\nWhile Tips & Tricks are given where needed and appropriate, more focus is on making the student self-sufficient with the Project Management knowledge & skills where he/she can perform as an effective Project Manager at work either locally or across global turfs, projects, cultures and teams, by tailoring and applying the Project Management Body Of Knowledge.\nThis course also takes the aspirants through situational/contextual fluency which is needed and also heavily advocated by PMBOK Guide, to handle projects in diverse environments.\nA certification is not Project Management in itself. It is a validation of the Project Management knowledge, skills and efficacy that you have. So it is imperative that you focus on\nattaining proper Project Management knowledge and skills if you are new or a recent entrant onto the turf or\nhoning and/or aligning the knowledge and skills you already possess as an experienced individual by way of theory and practice, to the world's acclaimed standards and best practices\nAnd receive in both cases, another desired outcome of getting enabled to crack the certification exam as a natural bonus & inevitable by-product.\nNote - Premium QA access and PDU certificates are provided to only paid customers.",

      "description": "Cash flow is a very meaningful term to most contractors, who must be sensitive to the issue of cash flow if they are to survive. Many construction firms that were undertaking profitable projects have failed in business simply because of severe cash flow problems. Essentially, these problems exist when funds are not available to meet current financial obligations. Thus, it is possible for a project that is profitable “on paper” to generate insufficient funds to meet current financial obligations. This is well known among contractors, who tend to pay close attention to this topic. The primary objective of most firms is to make a profit, but the maintenance of a positive cash flow is also of crucial importance.\n\n\nA cash flow analysis is an investigation of a project in which the focus is on the flow of money. This includes a separate analysis of the expenditures of money during the construction phase of a project and the revenues or income that will be generated as the project is being completed. A positive cash flow is when the cumulative revenues exceed the cumulative expenditures, meaning that surplus cash is available. On large projects, this excess cash can be invested in various short-term opportunities. A negative cash flow can also occur, and this means that more money is being spent than received. This will mean that the firm will need to take the appropriate steps to borrow from within the firm or financial institutions to cover the shortfall in funds.\n\n\nIn fact, the capability to timely obtain sufficient cash is considered one of the most common and critical challenges that contractors usually face during the execution of any construction project. As a result, cash must be thought of as a limited resource because its procurement has always been the first concern of contractors. During any project period, contractors never carry out any work that has no cash availability despite the commitment to stick to schedules.\n\n\nBased on the above, any contractor or developer during the project bidding stage, should develop and forecast a realistic and reliable cash flow for the project under consideration in order to plan ahead for funding securing. This is what the course is all about, in which you’ll understand in detailed steps how to forecast your periodical “expenses” (i.e. cost baseline) and “income” throughout the project duration. The course will start by explaining basics of what is required from certain project management knowledge areas to forecast the cash flow as well as what are components of the project bid price. Consequently, the different components that makes up the project cash flow profile will be discussed. Then, important contract provisions that impacts the cash flow will be explained followed by identifying the difference between “cash flow profile” and “net cash flow profile”. Thereafter, we will understand the consequences of having a negative cash flow in our project and how to minimize such negative cash flow. Followed by that, we will apply detailed examples with different scenarios to understand how to determine and develop the cash flow and net cash flow profiles. This includes identifying the maximum required credit to secure funding, determining the financing charges, and considering downpayments. Finally, we will discuss (with examples) important practical considerations that should be taken into account while developing the cash flow to reflect the actual movement of money in and out of the project. This includes:\n- How to consider the financing charges in your cash flow and come up with a final mark-up for your project\n- How to consider subcontracted work items in your cash flow\n- How to consider the actual timing of your expenses in real-life\n- How to consider varying contract conditions that can affect your periodical income\n- How to consider the time value of money to practically identify the project’s profitability",

      "description": "The basis of any professional project management process is mastering project management methods. Master the ten most essential methods and lay the foundation for your successful project management:\n\n\nWork Breakdown Structure - The heart of project management because it makes it immediately clear what the project is about.\nWork Package Description - Precisely specifies the content of each work package.\nMilestone Plan - Provides an easy-to-understand overview of the current status and future progress.\nGantt Chart - Visualizes a project’s time dimensions.\nNetwork Diagram - Visualizes, among other things, a project’s critical path and, thus, shows which work packages should not be delayed under any circumstances.\nResource Plan - Provides an overview of required resources and project costs.\nStakeholder Analysis - Helps to understand how to manage a project’s different stakeholders.\nCommunication Plan - Schedules project team meetings and communications with stakeholders.\nRisk Plan – Definition of preventive and corrective actions for potential hazards.\nQuality Management Plan – Plan of measures to achieve a project’s quality objectives.\n\n\nGood methodological skills are essential for success in project management. However, they alone are not enough to excel as a project manager. Soft skills are at least as important. For this reason, I will help you in the next module to become even better in the 10 most important project management soft skills:\n\n\nLeadership - People don't want to be managed, they want to be led.\nMotivating Employees - With good project managers, employees tend to be internally motivated.\nExuding Authority - If one's own instructions are not followed to a sufficient degree, it is often due to a lack of authority.\nSincere Interest in the Team - Only when everything is right on the relationship level can employees be reached on the subject level.\nBeing a Problem Solver - In project management, creative ways of solving novel problems must be found.\nResilience - Project management can be the trigger for a lot of stress, which is why it is important to develop good resilience.\nCommunicating Effectively - A good project manager is able to quickly get to the heart of what others need to know.\nManaging Conflict - Good project managers are also good conflict managers.\nPresenting - Even non-technical stakeholders should be able to follow the presentation easily.\nLearning Ability - Good project managers have a positive attitude toward learning.\n\n\nNow, you will have a solid understanding of how to systematically plan projects, and how to lead your team. Finally we will deepen your understanding in four supplementary videos. These cover the project charter, software in project management, the magic triangle and agile project management.\n\n\nCourse Picture from starline on Freepik",

These are covered in the 6 lessons in this course\nIntroduction to Agile Mindset – Here we cover where agile comes from and the potential change in the way we think in traditional vs agile environments\nContinuous Improvement – Constantly looking for opportunities to improve things when it comes to our product, process, and people\nIteration over Analysis – How interacting with customers more often is usually superior to spending a lot of time analyzing and estimating work\nA Little Queuing Theory – A simple equation that leads to all agile practices\nProbabilistic vs Deterministic Outlook – An understanding of the fact that the nature of the world is such that we cannot make decisions that have a 100% certainty of an outcome\nTeamwork – Starting with the end in mind, how do we come together across disciplines to produce value for customers\nThe aim of this course is to equip you with an understanding of the underlying concepts of Agile. This will make any subsequent Agile training that you embark on much more effective. Most Agile methods, frameworks, and strategies are built on the principles explored in this course. While we will not cover which particular framework or technique or strategy to adopt, it will give you some pointers towards selecting the one that best suits your context.",

Would it be helpful for you to build team cohesion and communication strategies for diverse teams? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this course is for you!\nDiversity is more than just about bringing people together. In business, diversity and inclusivity are powerful tools that can add to the core competency of any organisation. Diversity injects fresh perspectives which can be vital in business projects. A survey highlighted that diverse teams have a higher likelihood of making better decisions. Additionally, research shows that such teams outperform others 87% of the time due to their ability to consider a wider range of perspectives. This suggests that diversity can not only bring in fresh ideas but also increase the overall productivity of teams. However, to extract maximum benefit, leaders must understand team dynamics and the nuances of building a diverse team for better project outcomes. This course is designed to teach you how to build a framework for diverse teams and to focus on strong team dynamics to minimise conflicts, increase cohesion and improve performance!\nOver a series of short video lectures, we will dive deep into the key elements of team management within projects, focusing on how to create high-performing, cohesive and diverse teams. You will learn to recognise the importance of understanding team dynamics, ensuring that each member’s strengths are maximised while weaknesses are effectively managed. By exploring how diverse backgrounds and perspectives can enrich team collaboration, you'll discover the power of fostering a more inclusive environment that encourages creativity, innovation and robust problem-solving.",

Along the many lessons, we carefully add all the components on how to build a robust risk register, able to build probabilistic contingencies on a project.

Positive risks are opportunities, while negative risks are threats. The practice of risk management includes planning the approach, identifying and analyzing risks, response planning and implementation, and ongoing monitoring of risks. Risk management is an essential aspect of all organizational activities. This standard describes the application of risk management within an enterprise risk management (ERM) context that includes the portfolio, program, and project domains. Risk management shapes the decision-making processes across the organization and within each of the domains.\nSuccessful organizations are able to effectively and efficiently identify the risks that directly influence goals and objectives. The challenge for most organizations is making the best use of resources by focusing on the right risks. This depends on the characteristics of the organization, its environment, internal maturity, culture, and strategy. Determining the most impactful risks can be difficult.

      "description": "This course explores all issues about construction delays, its definitions, causes and impact, associated ramifications. Concurrent Delays are considered as one of the law problematical areas and most complicated & controversial kind of delay disputes. This is due to its unique/complex nature and the fact that there is no one standard and agreed coherent definition or interpretation of concurrent delay. We herein proposed various options for definition of concurrent delays, which its selection depends on how both parties agreed to deal with concurrency, along with proposed contractual bespoke agreed Clauses/ Provisions to reflect the contractor entitlement. Also application of detailed CPM delay analysis and application of Dominant Cause if applicable, “time-but-no-money” approach or Apportionment (preferably Apportionment of Time). And, further recommended the establishment of a UAE dedicated Technology and Construction Court Division that will definitely allow for more efficient resolution of construction industry complex disputes. Plus identifying and analyzing the basis and rules governing the determination of EOT in cases of concurrency under various civil and common law jurisdictions along with court’s relevant approach. It is concluded that Civil Law countries (such as USA, Scotland, Canada and Australia) preferred approach for concurrency is Apportionment. I guarantee it's such an interesting journey, I Hope you enjoy it.",

      "description": "Nowadays, Project Managers are a key figure in any company or administration, since they allow to manage the different projects being executed with solvency. In this context and in my experience, the PMI PMP certification allows you to boost your professional career while publicly showing your knowledge in project management. However, achieving this certification requires a very intense study process, where mock exams are key to measure your level of preparation.\n\n\nBeyond this theoretical idea, I imagine that if you are reading this is because you are preparing for the PMP certification exam. Therefore, you have already spent a considerable number of hours familiarizing yourself with the PMBOK v.7 and with its interesting concepts such as the WBS, Burndown/Burnup graphs, the soft/hard skills that a Project Manager must have, the importance of monitoring and controlling, the importance of agile methodologies, etc.\n\n\nIt is likely that for those of you who are going to prepare for the exam, once you have assimilated all these concepts, you will find it challenging to find a high-quality simulator with updated questions from the PMBOK v.7. This was my case, and that is why I decided to create this resource to help all those people who, like me, needed to test their knowledge with a tool that really simulates what the exam will be like.\n\n\nThis simulator is constantly evolving, so I will be adding new questions on a regular basis so that you can find all kinds of scenarios that can come up in the exam.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThis material is prepared to help the project management community prepare for the PMP certification and is in no way official. In that sense, all rights related to PMI and the PMP brand belong to their respective owners.\n\n\nMaterial uses\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license.",

It's what they care about...THE BIG PICTURE.\nI've been using Earned Value Analysis (EVA) for over 20 years with projects of all sizes and complexity (Waterfall, Agile and Lean) and I can guarantee that from my experience, it is the best way to track and communicate project status.\nIn this course, I take you step-by-step through the process of creating an EVA diagram, using a very simple example. But although the example is simple, it will teach you all of the principles you need to understand to use EVA for complex projects and even programs.\nThe course is delivered in a series of short videos, each one with a downloadable spreadsheet that show you how I worked through the example myslef. In addition, I have included a video that discusses how Earned Value Analysis can be applied to Agile and Lean projects.\nI have also included some bonus videos from my Udemy Lean Project Management course that are not part of the EVA core course but explain some ideas and concepts that  I mention during the videos and that I think may  be of interest to you.\nIn my experience, a lot of people are put off using EVA because textbooks describe it using a set of barely comprehensible formulae and ratios. But the power of EVA is pictorial and that's they way you will learn it. Towards of the course is jargon buster video, just in case you need to know the \"correct\" formulae and ratios to quote in a professional examination.\n\nTo find out more about this course, I encourage you to watch the free introductory video which is available free. If you like what you see then sign up and take advantage of the 30-day, no questions asked, money back guarantee.\nGain your sponsor and steering committees confidence by joining me inside and starting to learn right now.",

In some cases, claims can be levied by an outside party against an CONTRACTOR company.\nIn extreme cases, an unresolved claim can lead to termination of the contract.\nA claim brought by CONTRACTOR must not be viewed as an unmerited attack on the Employer but rather as a right to compensation for increased costs, extension of time or other disadvantages incurred by CONTRACTOR which were not within scope at the time of negotiation of the order.\nA claim is generated by a failing or breach of obligation of a party’ or by the occurrence of an event for which the parties have pre-agreed that one party should bear the risk.\nHaving identified a breach or failing, established the cause and effect, the claim must then be substantiated and supported by documentation and the quantum, both in terms of time and cost",

Curious about the level of challenge? Explore our sample questions now and experience the rigor of our practice tests!\n\n\nQuestion 1.\nDuring a large-scale project, the project manager notices that the project is experiencing significant delays due to a critical vendor’s late deliveries. Despite the project team’s efforts to mitigate the delays, the project schedule is slipping, and the project manager anticipates that the project will not meet the planned completion date. The project sponsor is concerned about the potential impact on the project’s overall success. What should the project manager do next to address this issue?\n\n\nA. Request additional resources from the project sponsor to expedite the vendor’s deliveries and get back on track.\nB. Update the project schedule to reflect the new expected completion date and communicate this change to all stakeholders.\nC. Initiate a formal change request to adjust the project scope to accommodate the delays caused by the vendor.\nD. Conduct a root cause analysis to determine the underlying issues with the vendor’s performance and develop a corrective action plan.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: D. Conduct a root cause analysis to determine the underlying issues with the vendor’s performance and develop a corrective action plan.\nExplanation:\nThe project manager should first conduct a root cause analysis to understand the specific reasons behind the vendor’s late deliveries. Identifying the underlying issues allows for the development of a targeted corrective action plan. This approach helps address the root cause of the problem rather than just reacting to the symptoms. While updating the schedule (Option B) or requesting additional resources (Option A) might be necessary later, understanding and resolving the root cause is crucial for long-term success and preventing recurrence.\n\n\nQuestion 2.\nYou are the project manager for a large-scale construction project. During the project execution phase, you realize that the initial cost estimates were significantly underestimated due to unforeseen site conditions. The project is already halfway through, and budget overruns are imminent. Which of the following actions should you take first?\n\n\nA. Immediately inform the project sponsor about the cost overrun and request additional funding.\nB. Conduct a thorough cost variance analysis to determine the exact reasons for the cost overrun.\nC. Implement a change control process to formally document the cost overrun and request necessary changes.\nD. Re-estimate the remaining project work to assess the overall project cost and develop a contingency plan.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: B. Conduct a thorough cost variance analysis to determine the exact reasons for the cost overrun.\nExplanation: Before taking any drastic actions, it's crucial to understand the root causes of the cost overrun. A thorough cost variance analysis will help identify the specific areas where costs have exceeded estimates and inform the next steps.\n\n\nQuestion 3.\nYou are the project manager for a software development project using an Agile methodology. Your team is struggling to meet sprint goals due to frequent interruptions from stakeholders requesting additional features. How can you best manage stakeholder expectations and maintain project progress?\n\n\nA. Create a strict change control process with rigorous approval requirements.\nB. Explain the Agile methodology to stakeholders and emphasize the importance of the product backlog.\nC. Establish regular communication channels with stakeholders to address their requests and manage expectations.\nD. Ignore the stakeholder requests and focus solely on completing the current sprint backlog.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: C. Establish regular communication channels with stakeholders to address their requests and manage expectations.\nExplanation: Open and regular communication is essential for managing stakeholder expectations in an Agile environment. While it's important to maintain focus on the current sprint, ignoring stakeholders' requests can lead to project dissatisfaction and potential risks. By establishing regular communication channels, you can effectively manage expectations and prioritize requests accordingly.\n\n\nQuestion 4:\nYou are the project manager for a large construction project with a budget of $10 million. Halfway through the project, the cost performance index (CPI) is 0.75, and the schedule performance index (SPI) is 1.2. During a review meeting, the senior management questions the project's current status. Given that the planned value (PV) at this point is $6 million and the actual cost (AC) is $4.5 million, which of the following statements best describes the project's financial and schedule status?\n\n\nA) The project is under budget but behind schedule, with cost overruns expected in the future.\nB) The project is on budget and ahead of schedule, with no significant cost overruns anticipated.\nC) The project is over budget and ahead of schedule, with a potential risk of cost overruns.\nD) The project is under budget and ahead of schedule, with cost overruns expected due to inefficient cost management.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: A) The project is under budget but behind schedule, with cost overruns expected in the future.\nExplanation: The CPI is calculated as EV/AC, where EV (Earned Value) = PV * SPI. Here, EV = $6 million * 1.2 = $7.2 million. The CPI = EV/AC = $7.2 million / $4.5 million = 1.6. However, since the CPI is given as 0.75 in the question, there might be an error in the EV calculation or provided values. Based on the provided CPI and AC, the cost is under budget (because CPI < 1), but the SPI indicates the project is ahead of schedule (because SPI > 1).

Are you interested in learning the core components of SAFe to transform the workflow of complex projects for your business? Would it be helpful for you to implement SAFe and scale agile practises across all departments to boost project outcomes? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this course is for you!\nSAFe, or the Scaled Agile Framework, in essence, is a mindset for businesses that want to adopt a more flexible and efficient workflow for organisational projects. SAFe is part of the agile methodology, which was pioneered in 2011 for the software development industry to make development workflows more adaptive to market changes and customer needs. These methodologies focused on creating a decentralised system for decision-making, to speed up workflows, emphasise deconstructing large tasks and completing complex project tasks into smaller sections. Thereby ensuring continuous delivery and improvement with each work cycle. A report by American professional services giant McKinsey showed that 70% of organisations believe that agility is one of the top three factors necessary for business success today, with agile approaches fostering better adaptability and faster response times to market changes. This statistic highlights how agile practises boost workflows by empowering teams to be more adaptable and flexible. And that is exactly what this course will help you to do!\nOver a series of short video lectures, we will dive into the world of the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), a powerful methodology designed to help you navigate the complexities of scaling agile practices across large organisations. You will uncover the foundational principles of SAFe, starting with a clear understanding of its basics and recognising the core components that make it so effective. We'll explore Lean Portfolio Management (LPM) in depth, helping you develop strategies to align organisational goals with execution while maximising value delivery. We'll guide you through the steps to scale agile practices across teams, departments and enterprise-wide, ensuring seamless collaboration and cohesion. Along the way, you will gain insights into the business benefits of SAFe, equipping you to communicate its advantages to stakeholders and build momentum for organisational transformation. Not only will you highlight SAFe’s value for business leaders, but you’ll also integrate proven best practices for implementing SAFe, preparing you to lead with confidence and precision.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to not only enhance workplace productivity and project outcomes but also successfully scale the SAFe model across your organisation.

The Exam Insitute Peoplecert officially provides 2 practice papers for Foundation level and 2 papers for practitioner level. Students often ask to request for additional resources to help prepare for exams. So we have created this revision pack to help with that!\n\n\nWhat’s included\nBalance Global’s revision bundle includes the following:\n2 official PRINCE2 foundation papers provided by the EI (Axelos/Peoplecert)\n2 additional non EI foundation papers written by our lead trainer (Jackie Hewett) who has been teaching PRINCE2 for over 13 years and taught 3 different versions of the method to thousand of students. You can therefore be assured that these extra papers do relate to the 6th edition of PRINCE2 and have been written by someone with great depth of knowledge and experience.\nEnhanced rationales for the 2 official practitioner papers. We feel that ATO’s creating their own practitioner papers actually poses a big risk to students understanding the method properly. This is because trainers are not the chief examiner and therefore reputable ATOs do not do this! We have therefore decided that the best way to help students prepare for the official practitioner exam is to work with the official exam institiute practice papers but give you the deepest explanation possible.\n\n\nAlways be cautious\nStudents need to take extreme caution when looking for additional exam peparation resources for the following reasons:\nYou need to ensure practice questions relate to the current version of PRINCE2 (6th edition) because there are questions in the public domain that relate to old versions of PRINCE2, and the version they relate to may not be made clear. Questions that relate to old versions will only confuse you as there have been some changes to the method.\nSome unscrupulous ATO’s have put live papers into the public domain, which you may think would be a good thing. However, not if the provider indicates that wrong answers are correct because they don’t actually know better! We have seen this happen many times!\nNon EI provided questions. When a provider offers more than 2 practice papers, they will have made-up the additional questions/papers themselves. You need to be careful regarding which provider you choose as the calibre of trainers who have written the questions varies a lot. First, you need to make sure questions have been written by an approved trainer and also understand the experience of that trainer.",
