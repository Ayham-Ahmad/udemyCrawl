That's because open source project management will go far better if you're already comfortable with the open source tools and best practices that make administration efficient and effective.\nThese days, even commercial applications will utilize at least some open source code. So understanding the practical and legal implications of the various open source licenses out there can save you a lot of trouble down the road. (Just ask Google and Oracle about the millions of dollars in legal fees they paid out through the course of their dispute over terms of the GNU GPL Version 2 license.)\nBut knowing how to survive and thrive in the open source world is only part of the problem. You'll also need to convince other people that you're up to the task. By \"other people\", I mean employers, investors, team members...and your patient-but-suspicious relatives.\nFor that, the LPI Open Source Essentials certification is the perfect solution. And this course is your one-stop-shot for all the background, context, and knowledge you'll need.\nSign up. Pass the exam.

It is a great refresher for cybersecurity professionals!\"\n\"A great introduction to not just Linux security, but general security concepts that every IT worker should know. Just passed the exam with a score of 710. An excellent resource to help focus my attention to the important weak areas I needed to revise before passing the exam. Many thanks!\"\n\"Excellent course. Just passed the exam with a score of 670 out of 800. If you want to pass the certificate, I recommend this course.\"\n\"Great course. Covered a little more than I was expecting.\"\nBy the way, it's true that \"LPI\" stands for \"Linux Professional Institute\", but this certification is actually platform-neutral and is not specific to Linux.

Each candidate gets a unique set of questions, with 10-25% variation across exams, so it’s important to focus on understanding concepts, not just memorizing answers.\nUnderstand the Concepts, Don’t Memorize: The exam tests your understanding of SAP System Administration principles, not your ability to memorize facts. By focusing on concepts, you’ll be able to tackle any question, even if it’s unfamiliar.\nPractice Multiple-Choice Questions: Since SAP certification exams are mostly multiple-choice, it’s crucial to practice this type of question. Our practice exams will help you get comfortable with this format.\nCarefully Read the Answer Choices: Some options can be tricky, so read all the answer choices thoroughly before selecting your response.\nWatch Out for Three-Answer Questions: These are often the most challenging. Missing one answer can cost you the entire question. Answer these carefully, and leave them for last if necessary.\nUtilize SAP Learning Hub: Take advantage of assessment tests available in SAP Learning Hub to solidify your understanding and highlight areas that need more focus.\nBe Prepared for Trick Questions: Some questions are designed to test deep understanding, especially multiple-choice questions. Make sure you have a solid grasp of SAP’s system administration modules.\nPrioritize One-Answer Questions First: These are easier to score on. Answer them before tackling the more complex multi-answer questions.\nTrue/False Questions Are Rare: Most questions will require more than a simple true/false response, so prepare accordingly.\nRely on the Right Study Materials: Use the official SAP materials and course books as your primary study resource. These will guide you in the right direction.\nStay Calm During the Exam: The exam process is straightforward. Don’t let the proctor make you nervous. Once the exam starts, you’ll only hear from them at the beginning and end.\nUse Multi-Select Clues: Multi-select questions often indicate how many correct answers there are. Use this information to exclude incorrect options and narrow down your choices.\nRetake Practice Tests Regularly: Keep practicing until you consistently score 90% or higher. This is a strong indicator that you’re ready for the actual exam.\nLearn from Feedback: Whether you pass or fail, review the areas you did well in and those that need improvement. If you fail, use this feedback to prepare for the next attempt.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not affiliated with SAP. Our practice exams are designed to aid in your preparation and understanding, but they do not guarantee specific questions on your exam.\nWhen you follow these tips and leverage the comprehensive resources, you significantly increase your chances of passing the certification exam. I'm confident in our content and support your journey to certification success. With well-structured SAP C_C4H56_2411 - Certified SAP Service Cloud V2 practice exams and expert tips, you’ll be prepared to tackle the exam confidently and efficiently.

      "description": "Pytest is a free and open-source software program that is a python-based testing framework for writing and running test programs. Even though we may use Pytest to write simple to complicated tests, i.e We can write programs to test API, database, UI, and so on, in today's world of REST services, Pytest is primarily used for API testing. It reduces the test suite’s execution time. It is incredibly simple to get started with because of its simple syntax.\n\n\nGive your team on-demand, actionable insights into the status of your product with a fast, scalable test automation framework written in Python using the Pytest toolkit. Learn how to eliminate boilerplate setup and teardown code, run multiple tests at the same time, and track the history of your test runs to identify slow or problematic tests.\n\n\nThis course will help you master automation testing with Pytest framework. Pytest is a testing framework which allows us to write test codes using python. We can write code to test anything in any environment, like database, API, and even GUI if you want. It is a simple framework to learn, just like python.\nIn this course, we will be go through all topics of Python Pytest framework and it assumes that you have minimal prior experience with Python coding.\nWe will learn everything about Pytest that will help us build a test automation framework easily. We will cover all important aspects of pytest and also how automation is done in real test environment.\n\n\nA Bulletproof approach to automation fundamentals Python is one of the most popular languages in the world, and the demand for it is only increasing. Pytest is one of the most actively maintained testing frameworks in the industry, and provides an incredible set of tools for faster, less-stressful testing.\nAutomated testing is one of the most in-demand fields in today's tech market, but there is very little guidance on how the engineer can move from writing tests to building a robust test architecture. Reliable test frameworks save compounding amounts of time and money, improve trust between testers and developers, and make for happier testers. Happy testers are more productive, more effective, and tend to grow within the organization. Everyone wins.\nThe most widely circulated videos on these topics speak only to the technologies themselves, and do not offer viable implementation guidance or valuable industry practices. I have made these valuable practices the focus of this course.\nContent and Overview Suitable for those comfortable with basic Python and Object-Oriented Programming concepts, these lectures build a rock-solid foundation of skills required to automate at a professional level.\nBeginning with a brief introduction and a step-by-step setup of Pytest, this course allows you to watch as I walk you through each action, explaining as we go.\nwill learn how to use test searching to avoid cumbersome test suites, and how fixtures can eliminate up to 80% of the code in a bloated codebase.\nEquipped with code samples, short quizzes, and info-rich videos, you’ll have no trouble following along with the concepts, and I am always available for questions.\nFinally, automating is a blast, and I wish more people did it. Let me rephrase that - I wish more people did it, and did it well! We need more people like you executing effective, high-value automation solutions, so let's get started on this journey together!",

      "description": "The continuous growth of the Internet presents a number of challenges. Among the most fundamental of these challenges is ensuring that the routing and addressing system continues to function efficiently even as the number of connected devices continues to increase. A basic observation during early network research and development work was that the single IP address, which includes both identity and location, leads to suboptimal route scaling and hinders multihoming and device mobility.\n\n\nLocator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) provides improved routing scalability and facilitates flexible address assignment for multi-homing, provider independence, mobility, and virtualization. LISP offers an alternative to traditional Internet architecture by introducing two separate IP addresses: one to indicate routing locators (RLOCs) for routing traffic through the global Internet and a second address for endpoint identifiers (EIDs) used to identify network sessions between devices.\n\n\nLocator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a network architecture and protocol that implements the use of two namespaces instead of a single IP address:\n\n\nEndpoint identifiers (EIDs)—assigned to end hosts.\n\n\nRouting locators (RLOCs)—assigned to devices (primarily routers) that make up the global routing system.\n\n\nSplitting EID and RLOC functions yields several advantages including improved routing system scalability, and improved multihoming efficiency and ingress traffic engineering.\nLISP functionality requires LISP-specific configuration of one or more LISP-related devices, such as the LISP egress tunnel router (ETR), ingress tunnel router (ITR), proxy ETR (PETR), proxy ITR (PITR), map resolver (MR), map server (MS), and LISP alternative logical topology (ALT) device.",

      "description": "ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a framework for standardizing the selection, planning, delivery, and maintenance of information technology services inside a company. The goal is to increase efficiency and ensure that services are delivered in a consistent manner\nBenefits of ITIL Certification\nITIL is a widely recognized framework that covers procedures, duties, and checklists that are practically universal in all businesses. Furthermore, ITIL positions are among the most in-demand jobs today due to the advantages that ITIL specialists provide in accomplishing the organization's vision with less investment. ITIL specialists are in high demand, and anyone pursuing a career in IT-related sectors can benefit from obtaining ITIL Certification and\nAligns the business and IT\nOffers the best practices for service management\nDefines the roles of every task precisely\nOffers reliable and useful services\nDelivers better customer experience\nEnhances service delivery success\nImproves utilization of resources by lowering costs\nComprehensive visibility of IT costs and assets\nIncreases ability to manage business risk and service disruption or failure\nSupports constant business change for a stable service environment\nThe many benefits of ITIL 4 Foundation certification have made it one of the world's most popular ITSM frameworks. In addition, it has assisted in creating a thriving global community of practitioners who not only assist in upskilling and supporting new students but also provide invaluable insight into where the ITIL 4 Foundation can be improved.\nWhen the ITIL 4 Foundation was declared back in November 2017, it rapidly caused an uproar. First, AXELOS announced that this latest iteration would be community-driven, taking advantage of the proficiency in service design, operation, transition, and procedure offered by the worldwide ITIL community. Simultaneously, ITIL 4 would also address the most common hang-ups practitioners had with ITIL V3, presenting a modernized framework more in line with changing practices.\nLet's take a look at a few of the benefits ITIL 4 Foundation Certification provides:\n1. Integration and Compatibility\nOne of the most significant benefits that ITIL 4 has over its previous version is its compatibility with the leading frameworks and standards. ITIL v3 was exclusively for practitioners.\n2. Flexible Practices\nITIL 4 practices are more straightforward and adaptable. It provides a holistic approach to organizations. The new practices adopted in ITIL 4 helps organizations to adapt to a flexible environment.\nITIL 4 includes 34 practices, which are categorized into three categories:\nGeneral management\nTechnical management\nService management\n3. Varied Certification Path\nOne of the greatest strengths of ITIL 4 is its various modules. The new form of ITIL has changed with the new structure. After completing the ITIL 4 Foundation, you can move on to:\nITIL Managing Professional\nITIL Strategic Leader\nITIL Managing Professional\nITIL Specialist Create, Deliver, and Support\nITIL Specialist Drive Stakeholder Value\nITIL Specialist High Velocity IT\nITIL Specialist Direct, Plan, and Improve\nITIL Managing Professional\nITIL Strategist- Direct, Plan, and Improve\nITIL leader- Digital and IT strategy\nTo attain the above designations, learners must complete two modules and move towards the \"ITIL Master\" level. However, there is no need to complete all the modules together. It is indeed a great advantage for the professionals, and the payment part is considered.\n4. Adaptability and Future-proofing\nOne of the biggest stability of ITIL 4 is that it acknowledges how the worlds of business and technology are invariably changing and evolving. As a result, ITIL best practices provide a level of fluidity and adaptability that enables users to take full advantage of any unique opportunities to streamline operations, deliver enhanced services to customers, get the drop on competitors, and more. Even better, with the practitioner community set to provide ongoing and growing insight, ITIL users can appreciate a future-proof system that will continue to accommodate changing circumstances, whatever may come shortly.\nIn competitive industries, this quantity for change can be vital. Circling competitors always have chances to take advantage of static and rigid businesses in the current digital age.\n5. Worldwide Recognized Qualification\nITIL 4 Foundation certification sets an international benchmark for your qualification and service management skills. In addition, leading international service providers recognize ITIL 4 certification as a prerequisite for services management experts. Therefore, it boosts your career even at the international level.\n6. Hike in Salaries\nOne of the fascinating advantages of getting ITIL 4 Foundation certified is the salary drawn by ITIL 4 certified professionals. Having a good salary is not just a necessity, but it also motivates employees towards performing better, thereby serving the organization in the perfect possible manner. According to PayScale, on average, ITIL certified professionals earn about 74,000 dollars in the US and 9,96,199 lakhs per annum in India.\n7. A Smart Approach to Improving the Initiatives\nSmart professionals work smarter ways to exhibit their skills and values. ITIL 4 Foundation courses & workshops provide smart skills to help you identify the potential to improve the initiatives.\n8. Better Return On Investment (ROI)\nITIL 4 Foundation certified professionals help organizations establish robust processes through service strategies, design, improvements, etc. ROI helps the IT operations to run smoothly, thereby maximizing the value and decreasing the service costs. From the employer's perspective, ITIL training and skills can provide value right away and bring efficiency to the IT processes.\n9. Enhanced Collaboration\nThe benefit of providing training to numerous students in a single framework is that gradually they become acquainted with the ITIL 4 terminologies. It enhances collaboration and communication between different departments. Group learning makes the students connected for a longer period.\nIt may also be valid to point out that companies that upskill several employees in the same course can often enjoy significant discounts. It is worth keeping in mind if you ever need to sell ITIL 4 to your organization.\n10. Customer satisfaction\nWith technology omnipresent in modern businesses, there are certain functions and features that customers expect as standard. For example, you would expect a popular retailer to have a working e-commerce platform and online customer service. Most customers would anticipate the same for every company, from utility suppliers to car manufacturers.\nITIL 4 Foundation facilitates valuable insight into the essential business services and features, wherein the ITIL service lifecycle covers continual service advancement, incident management, and development and release. Offering high-quality services to the customers and dissatisfaction due to defects will lead to enhanced customer satisfaction. In return, it leads to more business and can expect profits down the line.\nwhich will give you better clarity on the subject.

And do not worry about the time or if you fail the first time. Next time you'll do much better.\nStop the exam anytime, if you're not patient enough to go over all 40 questions per test.\nOnce done, you get your total score, and per domain. These are the same domains used in the actual exam.\nClick Review Questions and check both the right and wrong choices for each individual question.\nRead the detailed Explanation for each question. Many explanations have precious hints.\nRepeat with the second practice test. Don't skip it, as both these tests together cover most actual exam questions.\nRepeat these tests again and again, until you consistently score 90% or more on each. And then go for the real deal. Good luck!\n\"Neo4j Graph Data Science Certified: Exam Practice Tests\" is also available as a paperback or Kindle book, on Amazon.",

This topic requires the know-how to apply business logic to particular applications, using record types, formula fields, validation rules, and roll-up summary fields. Understanding the capabilities and use cases for the various automation tools, including Approval Processes, Workflow, Flow Builder, and Process Builder are also important.\nOne tricky topic under this section is knowing the possible solutions to automate business processes while avoiding errors. For example, the potential for field updates to cause recursion. Recursion is a valid programming technique, used when a method calls itself to solve a complex problem, however, it can cause a problem in Salesforce, if an update on one field triggers an update on another field which causes an update back on the first field, resulting in a recursive loop.\n\n\n\n\nSalesforce Fundamentals\nIn this section, test takers need to be familiar with the capabilities of the base objects and know the capabilities and use cases for declarative customizations versus programmatic solutions. It also includes knowing the use cases for using an AppExchange app.\nAs part of declaratively building or customizing an application, the appropriate level of an object, record, and field access for different types of users must always be kept in mind. This section will present scenarios and the test taker will need to determine the appropriate access and sharing solution, using features such as profile object access, permission sets, role hierarchy, sharing rules, manual sharing, and field-level security.\nA fraction of this section also covers the features and capabilities of Salesforce reports, report types, and dashboards, using global, obiect-specific actions and layouts to optimize Salesforce experience, and Chatter use cases and configurations\n\n\nData Modeling & Management\nThe Data Modeling and Management topic has the third-largest weighting in the exam, so test takers should spend time to be familiar with topic objectives. In order to pass the data modeling and management section of the Platform App Builder certification exam, test takers must be familiar with a variety of topics related to data management. These topics include being able to determine the appropriate data model given a scenario, the different relationship types and implications of selecting one on the user interface, reporting, and record access. In addition, the considerations for changing a field data type is also relevant.\nThe use cases and capabilities of external objects and when it is appropriate to use them as part of a data model design are discussed here. In order to work visually with the data model, a knowledge of schema builder is required. Finally, the options for importing and exporting data into and out of Salesforce, including the capabilities of external data sources are particularly covered by this section.\n\n\nUser Interface\nIn the User Interface section, test takers need to understand how to declaratively customize the user interface and when and how to use custom buttons, links, and actions. In addition, the knowledge on Lightning Components and how they can be incorporated into an application declaratively or programmatically are the main focus of this topic.\n\n\nApp Deployment\nIn this section, test takers need to be familiar with the options and best practices for deploying an application from a sandbox to production or from one org to another. This includes understanding the different types of sandboxes, different deployment tools, and when it is appropriate to use each tool for a particular type of deployment. Change sets are one way of deploying metadata from a sandbox. It is also important to understand the capabilities and role of packages in app development and deployment. Knowing the appropriate deployment tools based on given requirements are vital in devising an effective and efficient deployment plan.",

Cisco also offers professional-level certifications in Cisco Certified DevNet Professional, which proves your skills in developing and maintaining applications built on Cisco networks, and Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional, which proves your skills in incident response, cloud security, and other active defense security roles.\n\n\nWhat are the other Cisco certifications and what do they cover?\nCisco has associate (CCNA), professional (CCNP), and expert (CCIE) certifications. These include the CCNA, Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate (entry security analyst skills), and Cisco Certified DevNet Associate (developing apps on Cisco platforms). CCNP certifications in the enterprise (routing, switching, and wireless), collaboration (Cisco apps and services), data center (Cisco infrastructure), security (Cisco security solutions), and service provider (implementing and operating Cisco solutions), along with Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional and Cisco Certified DevNet Professional; CCIE certifications in enterprise infrastructure (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), enterprise wireless (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), data center (building and operating Cisco data center solutions), security (implementing Cisco security solutions), service provider (implementing Cisco service provider solutions); and design expert to prepare you for designing large networks.\n\n\nWhat should I learn before Cisco CCNA?\nBefore the Cisco Certified Network Associate examination, you should know basic networking, security, automation, programming, and IP addressing. The CCNA examination intends to certify that you know to perform basic Network Associate tasks. These include managing, monitoring, and maintaining an organization's network infrastructure. A CCNA will not need to architect, design, or develop an advanced network, but they will need to understand it, modify it, and configure it. CCNAs generally have some entry-level, hands-on experience in information technology. Many CCNAs will have an Associate's or Bachelors in an IT-related field. Alternatively, those seeking Cisco certification can take Udemy courses to learn the basics of networking and information technology.\n\n\nHow do I know if CCNA is right for me?\nA CCNA is generally ideal for those who are pursuing a career in networking or security. Cisco certifications are particularly prized for their rigor and valued by employers across the globe. Entry-level IT professionals who want to expand their career and improve their marketability (or their paygrade) may want to get a Network Associate certification to show their dedication to the field. Alternatively, those who seek to learn more about networking or discover whether networking might be the best path for them may consider taking Cisco certification courses. While alternative certification paths (such as CompTIA's Network+) exist, Cisco generally represents the gold standard in networking and security. Further, Cisco's entry-level certifications lead down a more advanced certification path.\n\n\nWhy should you enroll in this course?\nOne reason: Muharrem Aydın.

      "description": "ANSIBLE – AUTOMATION FOR EVERYONE\nANSIBLE is OPEN SOURCE, SIMPLE, POWERFUL, and AGENTLESS.\nThe database is one of the important key areas which is missed while implementing DevOps. The professionals lay full importance on code management, continuous integration, etc. but fail to automate the databases. Database handling must be properly done and is very important for data-centric applications. The database plays a major role in such applications, and it needs to be automated and rapidly expand along with DevOps. Ansible addresses this need by allowing you to provision and configure your resources using automation. Ansible doesn’t require setting up complex agents, customized security, or centralized configuration servers. All you need to do is describe your automation jobs.\nMoreover, Ansible goes beyond just configuration management; it's a versatile tool that covers various aspects of IT automation. It can automate repetitive tasks, manage complex workflows, and ensure consistent configurations across your infrastructure. This versatility makes Ansible an invaluable asset for not only automating databases but also for handling network devices, cloud provisioning, application deployment, and more.\nAnsible is often combined into the DevOps tool category of ‘Configuration Management’ and compared to Puppet, Chef & Salt. The term ‘Configuration Management’ is generally used to describe the management of the state of IT infrastructure, which can include servers, storage, and databases, etc. However, Ansible's simplicity and agentless architecture set it apart, making it an attractive choice for organizations looking to achieve efficient automation without the overhead of managing additional agents or complex setups.",

      "description": "*** Part of the best selling course: CCNA Cyber Ops Tools: Sec Onion, Wireshark, and Kali Linux ***\nIt is estimated that there will be about 1.5 million unfilled jobs in cyber security by the year 2020. A more recent statistic increased this number for cyber security unfilled jobs to be 3.5 million by the year 2021. In addition, recent article highlights Cisco Systems intention to become a cyber security force. For these reasons, Cisco created the CCNA Cyber Ops certification, which can become one of the most certifications in demand in the near future. Furthermore, Cisco created a scholarship program for this certification, which emphasis its importance.\nIn this course you will learn about the tools that you can use for your study of the CCNA Cyber Ops certification and the current Cisco CyberOps Associate certification. Learning the theory side is important, but the hands on side is more important, since the main purpose of your study is to apply your knowledge in production, and since your hands on will enforce your theory knowledge. You can not teach someone how to drive a car by showing him or her how to do it, but you have to let him try and practice how to do that. Furthermore, showing you hands on labs and how to use tools without teaching you how to create these labs and install these tools, might not give you the ultimate benefit from your study . For this reason, I have created this course to teach you how to create your own home labs, and to understand the core usage and important features of the tools used in them. I believe in the saying: \"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime\". If you have access to online labs, such as that offered by Cisco through their scholarship, you still need to know how to create your own home labs to continue practicing and experimenting, which is what this course will help you to achieve. On the other hand, this course will prepare you to go through these online labs quickly, and with confidence, since you will be familiar with the tools used in them.  And not just online labs, but any other hands on Cyber Ops courses, like what I intend to publish in the near future.\nWireshark is a network packet analyzer that displays the details of captured network traffic. It is an open source and free software that is considered the de facto standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies and educational institutions. And since Wireshark is an open source application, you can develop protocol dissectors for unsupported protocol, for example, and add it to Wireshark. In cybersecurity, You can use Wireshark for threat hunting in proactive incident response and for forensics in post incident response activities.\nThis course include the following lectures:\nIntroduction to Wireshark\nDownloading & Installing Wireshark\nExploring the Wiresahrk GUI & Working with Capture Filters\nWorking with Display Filters.\nWorking with Coloring Rules and Saving Captures\nFollow TCP Stream & Extracting Malicious Files\n\n\nI hope that you will join me in this course and start your Cyber security journey. Happy learning!",
