This standard is ISO 45003 and it is intended to be used together with ISO 45001 within an occupational health and safety management system.\nThis course presents the guidelines in ISO 45003 for improving psychological health and safety at work in correlation with the requirements for an occupational health and safety system from ISO 45001.\nThe structure of the course includes an introductive section where the subjects are about the importance of workplace mental health, the purpose of an occupational health and safety management system, the structure of ISO 45003, basic human needs that an organization should consider if the intention is to provide a healthy and safe environment or the workplace factors affecting psychological health and safety.\nThen, the course follows the structure of ISO 45003:2021 so we will be discussing about the context of the organization, including the need to identify stakeholders and aspects that impact an organization's health and safety performance; the involvement of the top management in improving employee well-being and recognizing the importance of workplace mental health; the identification of hazards and the assessment of psychosocial risks, the programs of the organization for rehabilitation and return to work, the process for managing incidents and nonconformities or how the performance in managing psychosocial risks can be improved.\nVery important for those tasked with implementing and managing OH&S systems is that the course offers multiple examples of hazards of a psychosocial nature including those in relation to poor leadership, toxic organizational culture, remote work and work in isolation, work overload and deadlines, interpersonal relationships, work/life balance, bullying and victimization or the use of inadequate and poorly maintained work equipment.\nThere are also many examples offered by ISO 45003 on how the organization can control its psychosocial risks and improve employee well-being.\nAll guidelines are explained and discussed in relationship to the requirements for an occupational health and safety management system from ISO 45001 to facilitate their understanding and to offer the whole picture to somebody who may not be familiar with the subject.\nLearn about the subject of psychological health and safety at work and the best practice suggested by the first international standard on this subject, ISO 45003.",

      "description": "Well, we're going to build an interactive dynamic dashboard in excel. Yes you heard it right. We gonna create it in MS Excel. No, we are not kidding…. Let me show you the end result, then you might believe me. You may have seen dashboards in tableau, power BI. but it's time you learn how to do that in excel.\nWhy excel?\nMy reason for building it in MS excel is because excel is easily available to everyone, and almost everyone have hands-on experience in working in Excel.\nAdditionally let me tell you one very amazing part. You gonna learn to create the dashboard in less than two hours. Yes you heard it right, in less than 2 hours Amazing isn't it. Just imagine, your manager asked you to submit the report, and comeback with and interactive, dynamic, analytical dashboard. Definitely, It is going to add some extra points in your performance score. Start expecting a good bonus already.\n\n\nNow your question would be Why do we create a dashboard? What is the purpose?\nThe main purpose of an operational Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive snapshot of performance, which means that you should incorporate a large amount of detail without using too many drill downs. Analytical Dashboards – Use data from the past to identify trends that can influence future decision-making.\n\n\nIn this course we used one of the very popular KPI “Time to Hire” and built an interactive dashboard around it. Which calculates and visualize the ageing of different stages, then we can also check or you can say filter the data week wise, by sourcing channel, skill wise. Also we can go ahead and check the recruiters efficiency, which business unit is takes too much time to get the candidate hired.\n\n\nWe have also went ahead and created an anatomy of dashboard which will help you drill down the problem into smaller parts so that it becomes easy for you to build any interactive dashboard in very less time. That is a step by step approach to build a dashboard for any type of business problems.",

      "description": "WARNING: This course is not for everyone. You should only consider this course if you want to expand your mind, reveal and overcome unconscious bias, and improve relationships, productivity, morale and diversity in every area of work and life. If that is you, then keep reading.\n\n\nDo you ever feel like you judge people too fast?\nYou see them in the grocery store or during an interview and your mind lights up like fireworks. They’re too fat, too skinny, too tall, too short, too ugly, too pretty, too clean, too inked, too tough, too weak, too stupid, too smart, too rich, too poor, too old, too young.\nEveryone has those thoughts.\nThe problem is they block you from discovering who that person really is. They stop you from asking yourself what they might be like on the inside. So you avoid them. You skip them for jobs. You never ask about their story and you miss out on valuable relationships.\nAnd the bigger problem is you only engage with those who fit your idea of how a person “should” be. So you create a circle of influence around you that lacks diversity, open communication, and growth. All of that holds you back in untold ways in business and life.\n\n\nYou Can’t Change Other People But You CAN Change Yourself\nYour instincts never change, and you can’t force others to be different either. But that doesn’t mean you can’t adjust your own habits to lift yourself up to new horizons where you can see the world, and other people from different and more useful perspectives.\nWith a bit of effort and minor adjustments, you can begin to realize old, ineffective thought patterns and replace them with new, more useful tools and behaviors.\n\n\nWhat Are Unconscious Biases?\nUnconscious biases are perspectives you hold that form automatically based on a variety of information sources from the world around you.\nThey’re kind of like what happens when someone throws a ball at your face. Your hands automatically fly up to protect your head. Unconscious biases are a type of automatic, instinctual self-defense mechanism as well.\nWhen you see someone with tattoos and you judge them as “bad” or “trouble,” you might avoid them because your bias told you they’re no good. Sometimes that judgment might be right. But what about when it isn’t?\nWhat if that person is the nicest, friendliest, most loyal and trustworthy human on the planet? What if they hold the key to the biggest opportunity of your life? Too bad. You will never know, because you judged them incorrectly and you did it automatically.\n\n\nIs This a Corporate Problem Too?\nUnconscious bias is a problem for everyone, and when it enters the workplace, it digs a pit of despair for businesses. Human Resources, recruiters, and anyone who hires or works together will likely face the challenges of unconscious bias.\nThe problem is, it leads to weakness in the business. It’s like building a castle on a foundation of toothpicks. Without accounting for unconscious bias, you end up with a workforce made of people who were judged “good enough” based on shallow social cues, rather than the value they can actually provide.\nUltimately, you create an environment that lacks diversity, innovation, and any kind of creative thought at all. In this course, I’ll show you how and when to say, “So what?” so you can see beyond those biases to find, recruit and grow the best team and company possible!\n\n\nWhat Will You Learn in this Course?\nIn this course, my goal is to help you begin to recognize different kinds of biases in your life. Together, we will review types of biases most people don’t know exist. We will also work to help you overcome those biases in your own life so you gain perspective, insight and the ability to make conscious choices that serve you better.\n\n\nInside You Will Discover:\nA Powerful Way to Test Your Unconscious Bias to Reveal Your Hidden Weaknesses\nSeveral Sneaky Unconscious Biases that Wreak Havoc on Every Decision in Life\nThe Most Devastating Impacts of Bias in Your Personal & Professional Development\nSimple, Profound Exercises to Help You Reframe Your Perspective Overnight\nTools to Help You Communicate More Clearly, Improve Productivity and Diversity\nHow to Create Your Own Story and an Action Plan for Exponential Change\n\n\nWho Am I?\nI’m Gail Miller, and I’ve spent decades disrupting stale corporate policies, beliefs, and unconscious biases. I’m featured on TEDx and various media outlets. I’ve served in HR and corporate recruiting for more than 20 years. Over the course of my career I’ve helped countless companies and individuals transform into leaders who stand up for what is right and have the courage to rebel against unconscious bias that restrains relationships, progress and performance in business and life.\n\n\nEnjoy Free Resources\nWhen you enroll in this course, you’ll find a plethora of useful resources, tools and case studies to help you in your journey to overcome unconscious bias. As new knowledge becomes available, I’m committed to making updates so you have the latest information to help you go forward and accomplish your goals.\n\n\nAre You Ready to Overcome Unconscious Bias?\nIf any of this made you stop and think, “Holy crap! I’m probably dealing with unconscious bias and this is the change I need!” then scroll up and enroll in Unconscious Bias: Fuel Diversity and Become a Better You now!\n\n\nSincerely,\nGail Miller\n\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nQ - Why does unconscious bias matter?\nA - Unconscious bias permeates every aspect of human life and it can really undermine your personal progress, and lead you to miss fantastic opportunities.

In worst case scenarios unconscious bias can even be the difference between life and death.\nQ - Is it really possible to defeat unconscious bias?\nA - Yes, and though you can’t completely eradicate it, you can always strive to make better decisions that enhance your life.

If asked whether they have unconscious bias, most people would confidently say that they either don't have it or have it minimally.\nEXERCISES TO CHECK YOUR BIAS\nIt's one thing to reluctantly admit that you might have a bias, but it's another thing to be shown that you have a bias. In this course, we'll go over some easy exercises anyone can do in order to uncover the extent of their unconscious bias.\nREVERSING UNCONSCIOUS BIAS\nIt's not enough to fully realize that you have bias. The next step is to want to fix that, and to take the necessary actions to fix that. We'll go over things you can do to begin reversing your bias.\nBENEFITS OF THIS COURSE\nBy the end of this course, you will make your hiring process a more fair one to yourself and to your candidates. Everyone will win. You will get the best possible employees, and your candidates will be treated fairly and without prejudice, preconceived notions, or bias.\nInvest in yourself! Enroll today!",

This is what differentiates our program and sets our Graduates above the rest.

Keep reading to meet her!\nWHY OUR LEVEL 2 GRADUATES EXCEL\nJoining this course and completing Level 2 of the program requires effort but you can do this! We want you to stand-out and excel as a coach but only you can do the work. We can’t guarantee your success or that you will make money as a coach. Only you are responsible for the effort you put in and the success you achieve. What we can guarantee is that we make it as simple and easy regardless of your current skill level and we are there to guide you every step of the way; however long that takes. We want you to be satisfied and if you are not, you can request a refund from Udemy within 30 days of purchase. Be sure to read Udemy’s terms for details.\nTHE POWER OF BELIEF\nBut when you commit and stay enrolled in the course (no refund), you put into motion the power of belief. When you buy the course on Udemy, it is a one-time low-cost investment that will continue to pay dividends in countless ways for years to come. Level 2 is simple: in addition to staying enrolled in the course for longer than 35 days, you complete 100% of the coursework, complete 100% of the coaching practicum fieldwork and submit it for approval and we cover the 1791 U.S.D. fees that we normally charge on our website for Level 2 Graduation.\nWhy do we do this? When you meet Louise, you will understand the purpose-driven passion that propels our mission! You may have already seen this before but it is worth a second, third or fourth read.\n\n\nMEET YOUR INSTRUCTOR LOUISE ANNE MAURICE\nIf you have never met me before, my name is Louise Anne Maurice; Louise for short. When being interviewed, I am always asked the question “what have been the most important aspects of your 30+ year career; your university and specialized education, the impressive skills you developed working for companies and educational institutions or boot-strapping it to build your company from the ground-up”? My response is always “ALL OF IT” because every experience has shaped who I am, my purpose and the reason I am a Coaching Training and Development Specialist today.\nLOUISE TALKS OVERCOMING CHALLENGES\nYou see, I was not handed life on a silver platter! I worked hard to achieve what I have; overcoming many challenges along the way. How did I do this? I developed, what I later termed, my Empowered Coach Approach; a revolutionary framework founded on empowerment, integrity and respect that leverages my DE Effect to accelerate and strengthen transformation. Using this approach, I was able to power-past blocks and obstacles so I could achieve my goals and experience my limitless potential. The thousands and thousands of people I have either coached, trained, consulted or taught over the past 30+ years have also benefited from my Empowered Coach Approach.\nLOUISE ANNE MAURICE’S MISSION\nBut that is just scratching the surface! I see a world where everyone is overcoming their challenges and living their full potential. Can you imagine the positive impact? But I can’t do it alone! My mission is to train millions of coaches world-wide to coach millions of people world-wide to live their full potential. How will I do this? I have teamed up with the Udemy E-Learning Platform to make my proprietary coaching training programs easily accessible to a global audience at an affordable price. As Director of Coaching Training and Coaching Courses Development for Holistic Coach Academy, I use my Empowered Coach Approach to develop purposeful, comprehensive and streamlined curriculum that shortens the learning curve for you to become a Professional World-Class Coach.\nWHAT IS YOUR MISSION?\nPurpose is powerful! Yes, you might be fired-up at the cost-savings bonus that I have made exclusively available on Udemy. Who doesn’t love a deal! More importantly though, I hope you’re fired-up at the prospect of being a part of making a positive difference in the world; I know I am! Are you ready to do something more meaningful with your life; something that makes an impact and leaves a lasting legacy with your name written all over it?

      "description": "INTERVIEWING THE BEST  = THE BEST AT INTERVIEWING\nYou'll find it's not secret that most hiring managers don't actually get good at interviewing and hiring.\nAnd you may agree that one of the causes is not getting enough practice. Sure.\nBut you may also find that not having a quantitative approach, with evidence-based questions, measuring skills, traits and outcomes for these, is also one major problem.\nAnd on top of that, most courses don't cover this.\nYou'll find they give you more gimmicks and useless subjective questions, trying to \"break\" the candidate or ask him what sort animal they would be, and you're supposed to believe you'll hire quality people like this.\nIn this course, you are going to learn how to effectively prepare for and conduct quality interviews that generate better candidates.\n\n\n\n\nBREAKING IT DOWN\nYou'll find that this course is the result of my experience coaching several hiring managers and partners at different firms, covering both the process and the required skills of interviewing. You'll find this course broken into three main modules:\nFirst, you'll come across the Preliminary Work module, where you will learn about a quantitative, due diligence approach, how to craft role descriptions, prepare questions, and consider different sourcing systems;\nThen, you'll get to know the Interviewing module, where you'll learn about the full interviewing process, the different question types, soft skills to use, and traps to avoid;\nFinally, you'll learn about some Post-Interview considerations in their own module, covering topics such as closing a candidate, onboarding them, company culture, and more;\n\n\n\n\nTHE PERFECT COURSE... FOR WHOM?\nNaturally, you'll find a fit with this course if you're a professional that has to perform interviews in their daily job functions. Maybe you're a HR professional, a hiring manager, or you're just tasked with recruiting and interviewing.\nBut, besides that, you'll be the ideal student for this course if:\nYou're someone tired of subjective approaches to interviewing, and you want a more rigorous approach;\nYou're just starting out with interviewing, and you want the right framework from the beginning;\nYou're curious about the current traps in terms of redacting job descriptions, conducting interviews, and other elements at different stages of the process;\nYou want to know what a full interviewing process looks like, from job role redaction to hiring, as well as the numbers involved;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn about the different approaches to interviewing (the \"prosecutor\", the \"sponge\", etc) and why most fail, as well as why the quantitative approach is the one that generates the highest-quality candidates in the most reliable manner;\nYou'll get to know some tips and guidelines to effectively craft a role description, including focusing on the right level of work, the right quantity and mixture of work, clearly knowing the difference between a job posting and a role description, and not focusing on activities but instead outcomes;\nYou'll learn how to properly prepare interviewing questions based on skills, including specific considerations such as using the past tense, using Brad Smart's TORC (or Threat of Reference Check), focusing on similar outcomes to this position, and preparing everything beforehand to collect data;\nYou'll learn about why hiring manager accountability is crucial for a quality hiring process, not dumping responsibility on HR, using specific scorecards and quantitative techniques, and making hiring success part of incentives, among other measures;\nYou'll get to know an overview of the different sourcing systems for candidates, including recruiters, online platforms, referral programs, and staffing for temporary situations, as well as the costs and time involved in each;\nYou'll get to know about the general interviewing process in general, starting with your candidate sourcing and reviewing of CVs, then your interviewing, including 3 different interview types (the screening interview, the \"main\" interview and possibly deep dive interviews with experts), and finally, your scoring of the final candidates and selection - as well as what to do in each task;\nYou'll learn about the three main types of interviewing questions: Functional, Interpersonal and Cultural, which focus on different important areas of candidates, and that are all required, letting you evaluate the candidate on their technical skills, on their personal values, and on their communication/teamwork/other interpersonal capabilities;\nYou'll learn about the main soft skills to keep in mind when interviewing, including establishing rapport and empathy, being able to read a candidate's reactions (including lies and hesitations), as well as probing, insisting, and maintaining diplomacy and respect;\nYou'll get to know which traps to avoid in the interviewing process, from you possibly not having enough depth in the questions you ask, to losing control of the flow of the interview, asking the wrong questions, making snap judgments, and/or possibly not coordinating with other interviewers, resulting in repetition and a bad experience for the candidate;\nYou'll learn about the main types of checks to perform on a candidate before accepting them, including possible pre-employment tests, reference checks and background checks, that you can perform to be more sure about a candidate's quality;\nYou'll learn about the components of closing a candidate, including negotiating compensation and benefits, inculcating the right company culture, taking into account the person's home and family (other possible influencers), as well as being transparent on other opportunities and which way they're leaning;\nYou'll learn about a brief overview of the onboarding process, including components such as welcome packages, introductions to key people, cultural indoctrination, possible orientation or mentoring events or programs, and the person's ramp-up;\nFinally, you'll get to know about how you can create long-term changes in hiring processes, including changing the company culture to hold hiring managers accountable and use hiring success as KPIs, and changing HR policies, with senior management support, to reflect this, among other measures;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit. I don't want you to waste your money.\nIf you think this course is a fit and can take your dispute resolution knowledge to the next level... it would be a pleasure to have you as a student.\nSee you on the other side!",

      "description": "MULTIPLE CONFLICTS, ONE SINGLE CONFLICT\nConflict is something present in our lives.\nConflicts may occur big and small, in our personal or professional lives, and for multiple reasons.\nBut despite these reasons, one thing is true - and a constant.\nKnowing how to solve conflicts is crucial.\nThis is what we will explore in this course.\n\n\n\n\nWHY THIS COURSE?\nNaturally, you will find multiple courses on social skills.\nSo... why this one?\nEasy. Because it's the most complete one out there.\nI've been coaching top executives and professionals for over 5 years, helping with conflict resolution in many different contexts:\nConflicts with co-workers that are competing in terms of workload or credit;\nConflicts with other executives to obtain support for key initiatives;\nConflicts with subordinates or managers in terms of not agreeing with the given performance ratings or reviews;\nAnd many others;\nWhat this mean in practice is that I know the techniques that disarm people. That get people to talk. That make people feel safe to voice their concerns. That reveal the source of conflicts. That make adversaries create alliances.\nAnd many other use cases. You see where I'm going with this.\nFor years, I've been leveraging exclusive, proprietary techniques.\nNow it's time I share some of them with you.\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE STRUCTURE\nThis short course will walk you through some core techniques for conflict resolution, especially if you're leading a team, including showing respect and empathy, analyzing the person's rules, detecting whether the person goes violent or silent, and many others.\nThe course has three major components:\n- The Diagnostic (how to assess what type of conflict you have on your hands, and what rules were broken that led to it);\n- The Techniques (techniques to use to de-escalate the situation including empathy, understanding, respect, guiding towards implementation, and others);\n- The Traps (traps to avoid that can escalate the situation or cause a misalignment of expectations later);\nNot only is it a conflict resolution course, it's also, in many ways a social skills course in general, which means you will be able to transplant many of these techniques from this context to other areas of life (relationships, family, friends, and others).\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn how to diagnose the type of conflict that you have on your hands (a \"hot\" conflict versus a \"cold\" conflict) - as well as which tools to use for either case;\nYou'll learn about the types of personal rules that, when broken, cause conflicts (people being disrespected, offended, or others), as well as how to avoid breaking them in the future;\nYou'll learn how to show respect and understanding with the other side, which makes them identify more with you and drop their guard, becoming more persuadable;\nYou'll learn how to comfort and support someone that has heightened emotions, helping them effectively transition from emotion to logic;\nYou'll learn how to leverage mediation and diplomacy when there is a conflict between two other parties and you are in the middle - and how to effectively perform that mediation without offending either side;\nYou'll learn when to leverage personal boundaries to prevent negative behavior by others, as well as how it can prevent bigger conflicts later on;\nYou'll learn how to leverage the principle of implementation intention to make the other side focus on a solution to the problem instead of continuing to focus on negativity;\nYou'll learn about what usual misalignment traps you can fall into (having different expectations, interpretations, others) and how to address them;\nYou'll learn about what usual escalation traps there are (disrespecting someone, not paying attention, others) and how to address them;\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit. I don't want you to waste your money.\nIf you think this course is a fit and can take your knowledge to the next level... it would be a pleasure to have you as a student.\nSee on the other side!",

      "description": "Confidently achieve the below objectives for your organization:\n1)Shorten the time for new employees to become productive and revenue-generating\n2)Minimize the cost of poorly trained new hires, in terms of substandard quality and customer service\n3)Reduce turnover\n4)Increase engagement\n5)Establish leadership credibility\n\n\nOnboarding is a critical part of creating a great candidate experience for a new employee. When onboarding goes well, the benefits from increased employee engagement directly impact organizational success. Employees who go through an effective onboarding program become more productive quicker and put out more valuable work. Organizations with a standard onboarding process experience 54% greater new hire productivity leading to better performance. Employees who go through a more focused and detailed welcoming experience are more likely to be enthusiastic about their organization and ultimately can become brand ambassadors. This ultimately translates to an organization’s bottom-line and tangible results in higher productivity.\n\n\nGreat Onboarding Leads to Ongoing Employee Engagement\nImplementing a 30/60/90 Day Plan will help to increase employee engagement while making sure the new employee understands their responsibilities and expectations from the first day onward. Companies with highly engaged workers have higher rates of customer satisfaction and fewer errors. Learn how onboarding doesn’t just happen on day one.\nThe first 30 days is all about learning everything from where the office supplies are kept to what the company sells to what the new employee’s responsibilities will be.\nThe second month of employment should focus more on collaboration and taking on more responsibilities. Training usually is ongoing throughout an employee’s time at a company, but the intense training takes place within the first month. The employee will now use the training from the first 30 days to start implementing that knowledge.\nThe last 30 days of the plan is all about independence. As the employee starts taking on more responsibilities and working on bigger projects, they need to be more accountable for your work.\n\n\nIn this course, we propose an onboarding model that can help talent management leads to plan and execute an effective onboarding for their organization.\nThe four phases of the onboarding model are:\nValidation: Did I make the right choice (Validating the candidate's decision to join your organization)\nNavigation: Initial Development\nIntegration: Ongoing development and Retention\nSeparation: Supporting employees who have resigned\n\n\nWe include case studies from various corporates to give a 360-degree view of how successful organizations are using Onboarding as an effective Talent Management Strategic tool for employee engagement. Also is included a case study on virtual onboarding.\n\n\nLearning Insights:\nHere I share my own learnings and failings over 20 years of working with Business- Technology, Operations & Shared Services etc. I have shared insights on best practice & learning strategies adopted.\nI have segmented Learning Insights into two sections. The first section will deal with the foundation concepts that any learning partner, learning and development professional should be aware of. The second section deals with the Practical & realistic training operations, right from coming up with Strategy to Tactical Execution.\n\n\n\n\nTestimonials:\nIt's interesting and schematic explained ~ Olga Binzari\nIt was truly inspiring to learn from an L&D expert! ~ Chhavi Gupta\nGreat Course. Lots of beneficial information ~ Mohamad Elbekai\nOne of the best courses in Learning & Development. I was doing three courses parallelly and I feel so good to see such an Awesome Course created by Mr. Ravikanth. Please create more courses on L&D.

Edwards Deming\nIn layman’s terms Analytics can be defined as ‘the analysis of data to draw hidden insights to aid decision-making.’\nAs HR professionals, it is time to learn a skill that will transform the way you work. This course will get you trained on basic analytics techniques and help you uncover data-driven insights that will aid in HR decision-making and reporting.\nHR analytics gives organizations the capacity to leverage data in order to address challenges faced not only by HR, but also by the core business. It provides organizations the ability to develop and implement a people strategy in line with its business strategy, thereby improving performance across a broad range of metrics.\nHR analytics does not just deal with gathering data on employee efficiency. Instead, it aims to provide insight into each process by gathering data and then using it to make relevant decisions about how to improve these processes. The key aspect of HR analytics is to conclusively show the impact the HR department has on the organization as a whole. Establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between what HR does and business outcomes - and then creating strategies based on that information - is what HR analytics is all about.\nThis course is aimed to help participants receive both a conceptual understanding of the HR Analytics universe and process.

      "description": "The Workforce Planning and Employment: Orientation, Onboarding, and Exit Strategies course is the 9th of 20 courses developed as part of the Human Resources Certification Program.\nIn this course, the focus will be on several key elements of the organization's orientation, onboarding, and exit strategies. HR's role in post-offer employment activities will be explained, as well as the value of relevant and effective orientation and onboarding programs. Also important to this discussion is the supporting role retention strategies play in organizational success.\nAnd finally, you'll learn about key organizational exit procedures and processes. In topic one, Post-offer Employment Activities, HR's role goes beyond the offer and acceptance stage, with a look at activities like Form I-9 verification, orientation and onboarding practices, and proper records management.\nOnboarding can be the difference between an employee doing an adequate job or being a star performer. In topic two, Orientation and Onboarding Processes, you'll go deeper into orientation and onboarding processes and learn the importance of proper records management and retention.\nPoor retention strategies usually lead to high turnover costs. In topic three, Employee Retention Strategies and Practices, our focus will be on HR's role in reinforcing the company's driving principles and behavioral expectations through modeling, communication, and coaching activities.\nGiving inconsistent reasons for reducing the workforce opens the door to claims of unlawful discrimination. In topic four, Organizational Exits and Reductions in Force, the value of HR's unique knowledge, skills, and abilities will be evident as we discuss voluntary and involuntary terminations, downsizing, restructuring, and outplacement strategies and practices.\nThat’s it!

Ensuring a diverse and inclusive workforce is not just a moral imperative; it's also a strategic advantage. Yet, despite the best intentions, unconscious bias can creep into the hiring process, undermining these efforts. This is where the \"Master Course in Uncovering Unconscious Bias in Recruiting & Interviewing 101\" comes into play. In this 101 course, we'll explore the significance of this course and its foundational principles.\nUnderstanding Unconscious Bias\nBefore diving into the course itself, it's important to understand what unconscious bias is. Unconscious bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases can be based on various factors, such as race, gender, age, or other personal characteristics. In the context of recruiting and interviewing, unconscious bias can manifest in the form of preference for candidates who resemble those who currently work in the organization or in making judgments based on stereotypes.\nThe Master Course in Uncovering Unconscious Bias in Recruiting & Interviewing 101\nThis course is designed to provide an introductory understanding of unconscious bias in the context of recruitment and interviewing. It's the first step for HR professionals, hiring managers, and recruiters who want to foster diversity and inclusion in their organizations. Here are the key components of the course:\n1. Defining Unconscious Bias: Participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of what unconscious bias is, its implications, and how it impacts the hiring process.\n2. Recognizing Bias: The course helps individuals recognize and identify instances of unconscious bias in real-world recruitment scenarios.\n3. Impact on Decision-Making: Participants will learn how unconscious bias affects decision-making, including candidate screening, interviewing, and final selections.\n4. Mitigating Bias: Practical strategies and techniques will be shared to mitigate bias during the hiring process, including designing job descriptions, reviewing resumes, and conducting interviews.\n5. Inclusive Hiring Practices: The course will introduce participants to inclusive hiring practices, which are designed to attract diverse talent and reduce bias in the recruitment process.\n6. Evaluating Diversity Metrics: Understanding how to measure and assess diversity metrics to track progress and adapt strategies as needed.\nWhy This Course Matters\n1. Improved Decision-Making: By recognizing and addressing unconscious bias, organizations can make more objective hiring decisions, resulting in a diverse and innovative workforce.\n2. Better Employee Retention: When candidates are hired based on merit rather than bias, they are more likely to thrive in the workplace, leading to increased employee satisfaction and retention.\n3. Enhanced Reputation: Companies that actively combat unconscious bias are more likely to be perceived as inclusive and attractive to top talent.\n4. Legal Compliance: Unconscious bias in hiring can lead to discrimination claims. This course helps organizations avoid legal pitfalls by adhering to fair hiring practices.\nThe \"Master Course in Uncovering Unconscious Bias in Recruiting & Interviewing 101\" is the foundational step towards creating an inclusive, diverse, and forward-thinking workforce. By educating HR professionals, recruiters, and hiring managers about the impact of unconscious bias and providing practical tools to mitigate it, this course helps organizations stay ahead in a rapidly evolving world. In a time when diversity and inclusion are vital for success, it's an investment that pays off not only in terms of better hiring decisions but also in building a stronger and more innovative workforce.\nIn this master course, I would like to teach the major topics:\nIntroduction to Unconscious Bias &The Psychology of Bias\nLegal and Ethical Considerations and Self-Awareness and Bias\nBias in the Hiring Process\nMitigating Bias in Recruitment\nCreating Inclusive Hiring Practices\nBest Practices and Case Studies\nAction Planning and Next Steps\nHR Analytics: Privacy, Bias, and Compliance\nBuilding an Analytics Culture in HR\nEthical Considerations in Future Analytics\nUnderstanding Unconscious Bias\nRecognizing Bias in Resume Screening\nAddressing Bias in Job Descriptions\nCultural Competency in Recruitment\nBias in Interview Questions\nBias in Candidate Evaluation\nBias in Group Interviews and Panels\nUnconscious Bias in Technology and AI\nInfluence of Unconscious Bias in Offer Decisions\nManaging Bias in Virtual Interviews\nCreating an Inclusive Employer Brand\nInclusive Onboarding Practices\nBias Awareness Training for Recruiters\nMeasuring and Monitoring Bias in Recruitment\nUnconscious Bias in Leadership Selection\nAddressing Microaggressions in Interviews\nOvercoming Bias in Internal Promotions\nCommunicating Bias Reduction Initiatives\nEnroll now and learn today !\nGood Luck !",

      "description": "Performance Appraisal (PA) is the process that is used to evaluate the personality, performance and potential of the employees of an organization. It is a process of evaluating and communicating to an employee how he or she is performing the job and establishing a plan for improvement. Hence, it is a system of review and evaluation of job performance to assess accomplishments and to evolve plans for development.\nPerformance appraisal means evaluating an employee’s current and/or past performance relative to his performance standards. According to Newstrom, “It is the process of evaluating the performance of employees, sharing that information with them and searching for ways to improve their performance’’. It is the step where the management finds out how effective it has been at hiring and placing employees. It is recommended that in addition to an annual formal performance appraisal, informal performance appraisals should be conducted two or three times a year.\nThe main purpose of any organization is to make sure that all the employees work towards the strategic goal of the company. For this purpose, it is crucial that the company should define well-defined and clear goals and work efforts to each employee. Each employee should clearly know his goals and work effort. He should know, towards which direction he is working each day. It is essential that the goals and work effort defined should be specific, measurable, challenging, practically feasible and encourages participation.\nto translate job reqPerformance Criteria helps uirements into levels of acceptable or unacceptable employee behaviour. It is essential to define ‘Performance Criteria’ for conducting a performance appraisal. Hence, ‘performance criteria’ is an important determinant of performance.",

We're committed to equal opportunity for all people and don't discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, marital status, gender, gender identity, gender expression, disability, religion, height, weight, or veteran status.\nInclusion:\nOrganizations commit to making their organization a place where differences are welcome, different viewpoints are respected, and everyone feels like they belong and are included. By creating a vibrant climate of inclusion, organizations can better leverage diversity's resources to advance their collective capability by building a critical mass of diverse groups at work.\nEmpathy: what does it mean?\nUnlike sympathy, empathy doesn't involve feelings of compassion, sorrow, or pity. It's the ability to imagine someone else's pain, joy, anger in our hearts. In order for interpersonal relationships to work effectively and be satisfying, empathy is key. By making sense of what's said and not said; what's done and not done, we can make sense of everything. We're better at receiving and processing information, and finding solutions with it. Our intrinsic sense of justice is rooted in empathy, which strengthens bonds of trust. People can learn a lot about their behavior by empathizing with the negative, i.e., the emotions behind their unpleasant or destructive actions.\nThere are 5 major topics I'd like to cover in this master's course\n1. Introduction to DEI and Building an Empathetic Organization\n2. DEI recruitment strategies, Facilitating DEI training\n2. How to promote diversity equity and inclusion in the workplace?\n4. Measuring Empathetic and DEI Impact in Your Organization and Essential skills\n5. How to build an empathic organization",

It is intended for business owners, operations managers, and human resource professionals that are involved with making critical decisions regarding whether and how much to pay employees. This course is beginner/intermediate level with an emphasis on highlighting common problems that typically create liability for the business.\nNo special materials are required for this course, which will include lectures and handouts describing important information concerning best practices in paying employees. The course is structured to provide extensive discussion and guidance on avoiding the top five wage and hour traps that businesses frequently experience.\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 governs most of the employee pay practices in the United States. However, most of the applicable legal landscape is tenuously evolving. Furthermore, managers are frequently unsure of their specific payroll responsibilities and create liability for the organization. We will review developing regulatory activities that will continue to shape the legal landscape surrounding employment pay practices in the workplace for many years to come. In the meantime, employers need to assure managers are properly trained and understand the basics of wage and hour law.\nBesides identifying the five most common traps that ensnare employers regarding payroll practices, we will also discuss regulatory enforcement activities that help employers understand and mitigate legal liability. This will include, the latest legal developments e.g. pending changes to the overtime exemption regulations.",

      "description": "Are you struggling with turnover and a track record of unsuccessful hires? Are your interviews failing to produce enough reliable information to pick consistent ‘winners’? Are you missing out on the best candidates, often losing them to the competition?\n\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned HR professional or an entry-level recruiter, job market insider and hiring strategist Ryan Lecour shares his refreshing blueprint to guide you through the interviewing and hiring process with a step-by-step method that secures the best fit every time.\n\n\nThe interview is the only window you have for observing candidates. Business-building and team-transforming decisions are based on these limited and precious hours. Many take credit for the quote ‘a company is only as good as its people'. Truer words cannot be said. And the interview is ground zero for determining how good your company is going to be.\n\n\nIn this course, Ryan teaches invaluable foundations on interview planning & execution. Students will learn essential strategies for question building, test administration and candidate evaluation. They’ll also learn key tactics for achieving clarity and verification with candidate profiles, personalities and work history. The course upholds a constant respect for the crucial role the interview plays in determining the fate of companies in areas of team-building and employee selection.\n\n\nLearn to hire consistent winners with proven interview techniques from a leading recruiting strategist\n\n\nThe following are some of the key things you will learn how to do in this course:\n\n\nCut to the heart of the truth with penetrating sequences of probing questions that reveal critical details surrounding the candidate’s career change history\n\n\nIdentify the elements of strong and weak candidate questions and learn to evaluate how they contribute to the overall strength of the candidacy\n\n\nBring awareness to unconscious biases that tend to creep into the process and mitigate or eliminate their effect while restoring objectivity and sound evaluation\n\n\nLead the stakeholder synchronization meeting with an organized method that efficiently captures the various dimensions of the position and sets the table for the interview plan\n\n\nEstablish preemptive compensation discussions early in the interview process and setup foundations for favorable offer negotiations\n\n\nBuild an interview kit that guides the interview and ensures the best use of time for all personnel involved in the process\n\n\nRyan draws on nearly a decade of experience witnessing how the interview has the power and influence to ‘make or break’ companies. From supplying key personnel to the offices of Apple, Google and many other Fortune 100 companies, to starting and operating his own successful HR firm, Ryan has learned that decisions on matters of hiring are difficult and almost always based on incomplete information. The interview is the key tool that hiring professionals can wield in order to bridge this gap in hopes of bringing consistent success to candidate selection.

      "description": "Workplace sexual harassment is a critical issue in India. According to surveys, a large percentage of harassment cases remain unreported, often due to fear or a lack of awareness. With women forming an ever-growing part of the workforce, addressing this issue is essential for creating safe, respectful, and inclusive workplaces.\nTo tackle this challenge, the Indian government introduced the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act). The Act mandates organizations with 10 or more employees to establish measures to prevent and address sexual harassment, including setting up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) and providing mandatory employee training. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead to legal and financial consequences.\nThis training is designed to ensure that organizations not only meet their legal obligations but also foster a workplace culture that priorities dignity, respect, and equality for all employees.\n\n\nWhy This Course Is Crucial?\nPrevent Legal and Financial Risks: Comply with the POSH Act to avoid fines and reputational damage.\nCreate Awareness and Empower Employees: Educate employees on recognizing and addressing harassment, ensuring a safer workplace for everyone.\nFoster Inclusivity: Build a culture that values gender sensitivity, equality, and mutual respect.\nThis course is not just about compliance; it’s about making a difference in how organizations address and prevent harassment, empowering employees to contribute to a more positive work environment.\n\n\nWhy Choose This Training?\nInvesting in POSH training is more than meeting legal requirements; it’s a step toward fostering a respectful, safe, and inclusive workplace. By empowering employees and employers with knowledge, organizations can create an environment where everyone thrives.\nStart your journey toward a harassment-free workplace today. Compliance is just the beginning—this training helps you build a culture that stands for equality and respect.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn?\nUnderstanding Sexual Harassment: Learn what constitutes sexual harassment and its impact on workplaces and individuals. Gain insight into gender equality and inequality as per Indian law.\nPOSH Act and Preventive Authorities: Dive into the provisions of the POSH Act, understand landmark cases, and explore the roles and responsibilities of preventive authorities.\nIdentifying and Responding to Harassment: Develop the ability to recognize harassment—whether overt or subtle—and respond effectively and appropriately.\nInternal Complaints Committees (ICCs): Understand the structure, roles, and responsibilities of ICCs, as well as the rights of all parties involved, timelines for inquiries, and maintaining confidentiality.\nPreventing Sexual Harassment: Learn strategies for gender sensitization, preventing workplace discrimination, and educating employees and employers about fostering a harassment-free workplace.\nCase Studies: Analyze real-world scenarios such as quid pro quo harassment, hostile work environments, third-party harassment, challenges in remote work settings, and retaliation cases.",

For various reasons, parting ways is sometimes the best course of action.\nHowever, when we terminate employees, there are so many other things to consider than just the conversation such as:\n\n\nAm I exposed to legal risk if I terminate this employee?\nWhat do I say during the meeting that is safe?\nHow soon do I pay out this employee?\nHow do I calculate additional severance? When do I need to consider this?\nI've heard that I can protect my company by offering a bit more money to them. How do I go about reducing the risk and damages to my organization?\nWhy does it matter which date or time I terminate my employee?\nWhat documents do I need to provide my ex-employee if I terminate them?\n\n\nIn this course, you'll learn all of this... plus more.  When it comes to terminating an employee, more information is always better than less. If done well, terminating an employee won't hurt your employee engagement or your employee experience. In fact, when communicated properly, terminating an employee can lead to greater employee retention in the long term.\n\n\nEnsure you're prepared for this by starting on this one-stop-shop course today!",

It’s a $3 billion global business where the median rate for executive coaches is $500 an hour.\nThe news gets even better. You can be a management coach from where ever you are. I have worked with clients throughout North America, the UK, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark. So can you. With technologies such as Zoom or Skype, your home office is your gateway to the world. Payments re made electronically, instantly, and easily.\nYour business goals could be the same as mine: I work from where I want, with who I want, when I want, and how I want.\nLeaders want to get better. The competition for great executive positions is getting tighter. Those who have greater insight, knowledge, and information have an important edge over others in their industry.\nTo be sure, your clients want to hear about your experiences, your knowledge, your beliefs and get your advice. But the best way to serve them is to help them reach their own conclusions about how to excel as a top executive. You do this by asking really smart, thoughtful, insightful, and challenging questions. I will give you some of the most results oriented questions that I’ve used with my clients. But don’t stop there. After your client answers your question, ask a probing follow up question. Encourage them to go even deeper.\nAre you a business specialist? No problem. Your expertise in HR, technology, marketing, investor relations will serve to help specific clients see what’s possible in their careers.\nTake me for example. I help clients who are smart, talented, and experienced but have a hard time communicating their ideas in certain business situations. That hurts their careers and the company’s bottom line. I give them the communications tools they need and the confidence to succeed.\nGeneral business help in invaluable, too. You see the bigger picture and help your clients make the right moves.\nWhat about you? We tend to take for granted what we know. Don’t make that assumption. Your knowledge, experience, success, and even your mistakes could prove to be a valuable resource for those that you serve.\nWho are your potential clients? They could be individuals who know they need to get a leg up in order to get to the next step in their careers. You could get a portfolio of corporate clients who know that they have several members of their team who need your services. They may hire you on a monthly retainer basis.\nThere is no ceiling for your success as a management coach. Take this Management Coaching Course and see what’s possible for you. - Bob Berkowitz\n\n\nHere is what Udemy students say about this course:\n\"Interesting and insightful course which will stir your creativity, self awareness and self criticism for personal growth. Bob Berkowitz delivers the contents in very engaging manner with clear and concise vocabulary and presentation.

Without a firm grasp of what's permissible by law as well as what's needed to drive adoption internally, you could wind up with a policy that is ruled unlawful by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Why does that matter?\n\nAccording to a recent research on 400 companies by Cap Gemini and MIT, digitally mature businesses across all categories generate more revenue, are more profitable and command higher market valuation than businesses that refrain from embracing new media.\n\nSocial marketing was where we started. Social business is where we're headed.  You can't socialize the organization without rules.  Social media policy development is a critical component of socializing the enterprise. Learn how to draft social media polices for managers and clients.\n\nThis course will save you time and money by accelerating the development time you need to draft and gain approval for a social media policy. It will also minimize the risk of instituting an unlawful social media policy, like many major organizations have done already. Save your organization the time and expensive of having to learn your lesson in court.\n\nYou'll also get my world renown social media policy template , to get you off and running quickly with everything you need to be aware of to draft an effective social media policy.  Plus, you'll learn the rationale behind the language, so you can explain to your legal counsel, manager or client.\n\nIn this course, you get the benefit of my real world experience developing social media policies for major organizations including Edison International, the United States Marine Corps and many others.\n\nSocial media has become an integral part of our personal lives. Unless you take the time to specify how (not if) employees can use social media at work, you risk forfeiting the chance of alienating the best and the brightest candidates.  If you're a US-based organization, you might unknowingly violate the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nBut regardless of where you're based, draconian social media policies have the potential to severely tarnish your organization's reputation. Don't follow the International Olympic Committee's example.  Get it right the first time.",

If any of this resonates with you, then we have designed this course to help.\nImposter Syndrome is common and affects a lot of people. We created this course to assist you in challenging and overcoming this condition. You will discover the background of Impostor Syndrome and the numerous scales employed to measure or identify the syndrome through a series of short video-based lessons.\nWe'll define Imposter Syndrome and discuss its five different manifestations, including those that affect natural geniuses, experts, perfectionists, soloists and superheroes. In addition to discussing the multiple causes of Imposter Syndrome, which span from childhood events to personality qualities, we will also look at how persons with Imposter Syndrome think and how it impacts many aspects of their lives.\nAfterwards, we'll concentrate on cognitive biases and how Imposter Syndrome is related to them. Additionally, we'll talk about how therapy can help and effective ways to deal with and ultimately overcome Imposter Syndrome.\nThe goal of this course is to help managers and other team members work more effectively with employees and coworkers who experience Imposter Syndrome, with leaders who feel insecure, and with professionals who want to boost their confidence levels before applying for promotions or doing a better job in their current position. However, it's also appropriate for anyone else who wants to control the symptoms of Imposter Syndrome and believes they have it.\nSo, if these conditions are constantly weighing you down, making your work ineffective and holding you back from fulfilling your aspirations, you will greatly benefit from this course.

This comprehensive course, Generative AI for HR Professionals, is designed to empower HR practitioners with the knowledge and skills to leverage GenAI across the entire employee lifecycle—from talent acquisition to performance management and employee engagement. The course begins with a solid foundation in the basics of generative AI, contrasting its capabilities with traditional AI methods in HR contexts. It then delves into building a strong business case for integrating AI into HR operations, emphasizing practical applications that enhance efficiency, personalization, and strategic decision-making.\nLearners will explore how AI-generated interview questions and resume-based question customization can enhance recruitment. Through tools like Google’s Interview Warm-Up and real-world case studies like Unilever's use of ChatGPT for talent sourcing, participants will see how GenAI can automate screening, scoring, and communication. The course highlights applications in onboarding, such as AI-generated welcome emails, virtual onboarding assistants, and IBM Watson’s role in new hire integration. It also covers how to craft personalized learning and development experiences using AI for content creation, microlearning, and adaptive learning paths, drawing on examples like Microsoft’s GPT-enabled learning tools.\nFurther, the course examines the potential of GenAI in performance management through automated feedback, 360-degree evaluations, and data-driven appraisal writing. Engagement strategies using AI-generated pulse surveys, attrition prediction, and sentiment analysis of feedback will be demonstrated with case studies like GE’s AI-powered performance development and Qualtrics integrations. Learners will also master how GenAI can support HR compliance, policy writing, inclusive language use, and global policy localization.\nFinally, the course culminates in hands-on training in prompt engineering, including how to write effective prompts, role-specific templates, and techniques for optimizing AI outputs—backed by a ready-to-use 1000+ HR-focused prompts. This course is essential for forward-thinking HR professionals aiming to lead the AI-driven transformation of their function.",

No longer confined to administrative tasks, HR is now a key strategic partner, driving decisions that shape an organization’s future. One powerful tool that has emerged to support this transformation is HR Analytics. In this part, we will explore what HR Analytics is, why it matters, and how professionals can harness its power to make informed decisions.\n\n\nWhat is HR Analytics?\nHR Analytics, also known as People Analytics or Workforce Analytics, involves the application of data analysis techniques to human resources data. Its main goal is to provide insights that help organizations make better HR decisions, such as improving employee performance, increasing retention rates, and optimizing recruitment processes.\nHR Analytics goes beyond merely collecting data; it uses statistical analysis, modeling, and machine learning to uncover patterns and trends that can impact the workforce. It’s about turning raw data into actionable insights.\nHR Analytics is a transformative approach that enables HR professionals to contribute more strategically to their organizations. By leveraging data, HR teams can not only improve their operational efficiency but also align their efforts with broader business goals.\nAs organizations become more data-focused, professionals equipped with HR Analytics skills will be invaluable assets, driving better talent management, improving employee experiences, and ultimately contributing to the long-term success of the organization. Whether you’re just starting your HR journey or looking to enhance your expertise, mastering HR Analytics will open doors to new opportunities and help you stay ahead in the competitive HR landscape.\n\n\nThe Importance of HR Analytics for Organizational Success\nIn rapidly evolving business environment, companies are increasingly recognizing that people are their greatest asset. The success of any organization largely hinges on how well it manages, engages, and retains its workforce. This is where Human Resource analytics comes into play. By leveraging data-driven insights, HR analytics transforms traditional HR processes into more strategic, objective, and predictive systems. It can significantly enhance decision-making, drive employee engagement, and boost overall organizational performance.\n\n\n1. Data-Driven Decision Making\nHR analytics uses data to inform decisions. By analyzing data from recruitment, performance management, employee satisfaction surveys, and turnover rates, organizations can identify patterns and trends that would otherwise remain hidden. For example, data can highlight which recruitment channels provide the highest-quality hires or which departments are experiencing higher turnover rates and why.\nThis shift to data-driven decision-making enables HR departments to move beyond reactive measures and adopt a proactive approach. Instead of reacting to employee turnover, companies can use predictive analytics to identify early warning signs of disengagement, allowing for timely intervention. As a result, HR becomes a strategic partner in the organization, contributing directly to business outcomes.\n\n\n2. Optimizing Recruitment and Talent Management\nOne of the key areas where HR analytics adds value is in recruitment. By analyzing historical hiring data, HR can identify the qualities and characteristics that predict future employee success, enabling more effective talent acquisition. This ensures not only that the right candidates are hired but also that they are placed in the right roles. HR analytics can help reduce hiring biases and improve diversity by relying on objective data to inform decisions.\nMoreover, once employees are hired, HR analytics plays a crucial role in performance management. It can track employee progress, highlight skills gaps, and recommend training or development programs tailored to individual needs. This data-driven approach to talent management increases productivity and ensures employees are continuously aligned with organizational goals.\n\n\n3. Enhancing Employee Retention and Engagement\nHigh employee turnover is costly for any organization. Replacing employees involves recruitment costs, training expenses, and productivity losses. HR analytics can help reduce turnover by identifying patterns and factors that contribute to employee dissatisfaction and disengagement. Through employee surveys, exit interviews, and performance data, HR can pinpoint the root causes of turnover—be it inadequate compensation, lack of career growth opportunities, or workplace culture.\nAnalytics can also measure employee engagement levels across different teams or departments. By understanding what drives engagement and what doesn't, HR can implement targeted initiatives to improve job satisfaction, work-life balance, and overall workplace morale. This leads to higher retention rates, increased productivity, and a more committed workforce.\n\n\n4. Strategic Workforce Planning\nAs businesses grow and adapt to market demands, workforce planning becomes a critical component of success. HR analytics helps organizations anticipate future workforce needs based on business trends, expansion plans, and attrition rates. With access to predictive models, HR can provide actionable insights into how many employees will be needed, what skills will be required, and where gaps may emerge.\nBy aligning workforce planning with overall business strategy, HR analytics ensures that organizations are prepared to meet future challenges. This approach also helps organizations manage costs effectively by avoiding overstaffing or understaffing, both of which can harm business performance.\n\n\n5. Improving Compensation and Benefits Strategy\nEffective compensation and benefits strategies are key to attracting and retaining top talent. HR analytics provides insights into market trends, allowing companies to stay competitive in their offerings. By comparing compensation data across industries and regions, organizations can ensure that their salary structures are competitive and fair. Additionally, HR analytics can track employee benefits usage, helping companies design benefits packages that align with employee preferences, thus increasing satisfaction without unnecessary spending.\nHR analytics also plays a role in performance-based compensation, such as bonuses and incentives. By linking performance metrics to compensation, companies can ensure that high performers are rewarded appropriately, driving motivation and productivity.\n\n\n6. Creating an Inclusive Workplace Culture\nIn recent years, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) have become critical focal points for organizations worldwide. HR analytics can play a pivotal role in tracking DEI metrics, such as gender representation, pay equity, and promotion rates among different demographic groups. By analyzing this data, organizations can identify areas where they may be falling short in terms of inclusivity and take steps to address these gaps.\nThis leads to a more diverse and inclusive workforce, which research has shown to foster innovation, creativity, and better decision-making—ultimately contributing to organizational success.\n\n\n7. Reducing Costs and Improving Efficiency\nBeyond talent management, HR analytics can drive cost savings and operational efficiencies. By automating routine HR tasks, such as payroll processing, attendance tracking, and benefits administration, analytics helps streamline processes and reduce administrative overhead. This frees up HR professionals to focus on more strategic activities that add value to the business.\nAdditionally, HR analytics can optimize workforce scheduling, ensuring that the right number of employees are available at peak times, thereby reducing overtime costs and improving overall operational efficiency.\n\n\n8. Supporting Business Strategy\nUltimately, HR analytics bridges the gap between HR and broader business objectives. By aligning people-related data with organizational goals, HR can demonstrate its contribution to the company's bottom line. Analytics provides a clear picture of how HR initiatives—such as recruitment, training, employee engagement, and compensation—are impacting key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue growth, profitability, and customer satisfaction.\nThis shift transforms HR from a purely administrative function into a strategic partner that plays a critical role in driving business success. Organizations that embrace HR analytics are better equipped to adapt to changing market conditions, optimize their workforce, and achieve long-term growth.\n\n\nConclusion\nHR analytics is a critical tool for any organization that aims to stay competitive in today's business landscape. By harnessing the power of data, HR can make more informed decisions, improve employee satisfaction and retention, and contribute to organizational success. Companies that invest in HR analytics not only enhance their ability to manage their most important asset—people—but also gain a competitive edge in their respective industries.",

This shift transforms HR from a purely administrative function into a strategic partner that plays a critical role in driving business success. Organizations that embrace HR analytics are better equipped to adapt to changing market conditions, optimize their workforce, and achieve long-term growth."

This course was created to change that.\nBuilt with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools and expert-led research, this program goes beyond surface-level HR knowledge. It is a demanding, advanced-level certification course designed for professionals who want to step into senior HR leadership roles and become trusted advisors at the highest levels of business.\nUnlike traditional exam-prep programs, this course is structured as a comprehensive leadership journey. You will not only master HR theory but also learn how to apply it in ways that transform organizations. Through case studies, frameworks, and global best practices, you’ll discover how to align HR with business strategy and make decisions that drive measurable impact.\nWhat You’ll Gain in This Program\n1-Executive-Level HR Competencies – Develop mastery in leadership, ethical practice, cultural agility, and strategic navigation.\n2-Organizational Strategy Integration – Learn to embed HR into the core of business strategy to influence growth, innovation, and resilience.\n3-Data-Driven Decision Making – Explore predictive analytics, AI-powered tools, and workforce metrics to shape executive choices with confidence.\n4-Talent Strategy & Leadership Development – Build pipelines of future-ready leaders and design succession systems that secure long-term success.\n5-Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) – Implement inclusive practices that drive innovation and reflect the future of work.\n6-Change & Transformation Leadership – Gain frameworks for leading through mergers, acquisitions, restructuring, and digital transformation.\n7-Emerging HR Trends – From blockchain to remote work, explore the technologies and trends reshaping the HR landscape.\nWhy This Course Stands Out\nThis is not an entry-level program. It is deliberately designed for professionals ready to take on strategic responsibility. The learning journey is interactive, practical, and rooted in real-world case studies from global organizations. You’ll analyze how senior HR leaders tackled complex challenges—and learn how to apply those strategies in your own context.\nWho Should Enroll?\nMid-to-senior HR professionals preparing for executive-level roles.\nBusiness leaders who want to deepen their HR and talent expertise.\nConsultants and organizational advisors supporting leadership teams.\nAmbitious HR practitioners seeking a recognized certification to strengthen credibility.\nCertification\nUpon completion, you’ll receive a Professional HR Leadership Certification issued by our institute.

Enroll today and take your place as a strategic HR leader of the future.",

      "description": "Master course in HR fundamentals and HR leadership (A to Z)\nManaging the people in an organization is what Human Resource Management (HRM) does. Human resources management is about hiring and managing employees. An organization's Human Resources Department handles it.\nHuman resources management is all about making employees more effective, so the business can be more efficient. Businesses that are more efficient earn more profits with less wasted time and resources. A good HRM improves the direction of the company and lets employees work towards its goals. This purpose won't change no matter how the business environment changes.\nIn every organization, human resources play a big role. Outsiders don't understand HR's key value proposition, so it has limited impact. Employee development, compliance, and advocating for the organization and employees are some of HR's strengths.\nThe most common criticisms of HR teams are that they aren't strategic enough, they don't know how to handle finances, they have weak customer focus, or they're more internally focused than externally oriented.

The person who trained and taught me everything she knew about recruiting has been in the field for 20 YEARS! When I graduated college, I started working as a marketing professional, however I was looking for a way to grow my earning potential and have more work/life balance. What I found was that recruiting was not only an in-demand career, but also that it PAID WELL, and many companies now allow you to do it from the comfort of your home! With training from my seasoned recruiting mentor, and by selling my transferable skills while job searching - I've been able to land well-paying recruiting jobs with Fortune 500 companies, work remotely, and earn almost double the income I earned as a marketer! YOU TOO can do this. And you can do so without spending thousands of dollars on a college degree (like I did) by taking this comprehensive course on how to be a recruiter, apply the principles taught here and understanding that everything offered in this course is practical information that you can use to transform the trajectory of your career as quickly as you CHOOSE to apply it!",

You actually require a good hold of different laws starting from the recruitment, to their onboarding, mandatory paper work, different benefits such as PF, ESI, bonus, gratuity etc.\nAlso you will need to ensure that the decision of dismissal is taken after proper disciplinary proceedings. If you do not follow proper procedures, the company may have to pay compensation for wrongful termination or reinstate the employee with back wages in some cases.\nIn fact, as you go up the chain, legal knowledge becomes indispensable. Let’s say you are drafting a leave policy for a company, and fail to check the relevant Shops and Establishments Act of the state, you will almost certainly get it wrong. The consequence can be paying heavy fines by the company if an inspector comes visiting, a potentially negative impact on the brand and embarrassment in front of other employees.\nAlso if you talk about different functions of HR such as Recruitment, Training and Development, Performance Appraisal, Grievance handling etc then you will notice that a part, small to big, is played by the respective managers as well. But labour laws are something which other people usually don’t have much of an idea and if you make this strong then this will give you a lot of importance and growth in that company.\nThis is a must in Human Resource Management",

      "description": "One of my clients, a learning and development manager from a major mobile company, stopped me recently (after I'd been facilitating a strategy session for a group of her senior executives), \"How did you do that Neil? There are so many big egos in that room. How did you read them? They're not normally creative, how did you get them working together to come up with all those innovative ideas? And then, what magic did you use to get them to align and agree to a path forward? That's never happened before. I wish I could learn to do that.\"\n\"You could do it easily\" I replied, knowing her skill as a coach and L&D consultant, \"I'm happy to mentor you if you like.\"\nShe looked a little confused. \"Mentor? You mean teach don't you?\" She knew, after all, that I run one of the UK's most successful change facilitation schools.\n\"No, I think mentoring is much more appropriate for developing facilitation skills, don't you? The trick, I believe, is 'trying on skills and attitudes', assimilating the ones that work for you until you become a very best facilitator you can be. It's a continual learning process. It's not just about just learning skills or a set formula, it's about 'being' and 'doing'. That way you have true behavioural flexibility when you're working with a group and you can flex to their needs rather than forcing them to play by your rules. Like great coaching, great facilitation is a conversation with a purpose. It's more a set of ideas and principles working together, rather than a rigid plan. I'm willing to share the bits that I think make the most difference if you like.\"\nMy client was delighted and over the next few months I mentored her to become a really effective facilitator. And I'd like to make the same offer to you here on Udemy. I'd really love to have the opportunity to share what I believe are the most important ideas, tools and distinctions for a facilitator to have at their disposal. And I'd like to encourage you to try them on. I really do believe that if you throw yourself into this programme you can significantly increase your effectiveness in working with groups and in facilitating learning or change.\nMentoring, after all, is simply about me saying 'I've walked this path before. And I've been pretty successful at it. I've learnt a great deal, and have tried on even more. Would you be interested in hearing about the best bits of what I've learnt? And would you then, like to try on those ideas to see if you can get similar results in your professional life?'\nIf this sounds of interest, then I'd love to get to know you better and do my very best through these videos to help you accelerate your facilitation journey.\nNow, you may have already noticed that this isn't the shortest course on Udemy. In fact it runs to over 7 hours of video and that's without time for the exercises and practice that we suggest throughout. This isn't for the fainthearted. It's for people who really want to step up and facilitate. We've put in a huge amount of effort to develop a programme that layers skills in much the same ways as I'd do it face to face if we had the opportunity to work together in person. We've also updated it to include ideas for facilitating online or in a hybrid environment.\nIf you are only curious about facilitation and want a bluffers guide, or you want someone to be prescriptive and tell you what to do, then this course probably isn't for you - you'd possibly be better off starting with one of the lighter, shorter courses available on Udemy. Then, after that, if you want to ramp up your skills and accelerate your skills, then we'd be delighted to welcome you here onto our mentoring programme.\nWhy have we made it so long? Well the simple answer is we had a lot to say. But that doesn't really do the question justice. It would have made more commercial sense to make it shorter or to chop it into four courses, but we have a bigger mission. I really do believe that the world needs incredible facilitators right now and this course is intended to add value to people who share our vision and want to be part of making a positive difference in the world. I believe that facilitation skills really are that powerful. The world and business is changing at an ever increasing pace and highly skilled facilitators are already at the heart of helping people navigate change and find ways to thrive personally and professionally.\nYou are very welcome to join us if you're a complete beginner as long as you have a facilitation project in mind that you can apply the learning to. This material comes to life through application. It isn't intended as just theoretical knowledge. And also please remember this is mentoring not a formulaic programme. You need to be willing to layer your own learning and experiment to build your skills.\nOf course having some sort of experience as a coach, trainer, consultant, youth worker, manager, counsellor, learning and development professional, charity support worker, change activist, project manager, or similar, will be massively useful.\nThere are five key categories of student that we tend to attract to this programme.\nCoaches, consultants, L&D professionals and 1:1 change agents who wish to develop their ability to work with groups\nTrainers who are recognising that the training landscape has changed and less and less classroom based training courses are being commissioned because students don't have time to attend, theirs an increased environmental impact to travelling to courses and most important here on Udemy is that traditional classroom learning is increasingly being replaced by e-learning. But these challenges are also what makes high quality facilitation skills so valuable - facilitation is about so much more than skills.\nExisting facilitators who are self-taught who want to compare their skills against other industry experts. It is sometimes hard to improve when you don't have anyone to benchmark against.\nCharity professionals and civil servants who are increasingly being asked to facilitate focus groups and stakeholder engagement sessions\nPeople changing profession who want to gain a deep understanding of facilitation and have an inkling it might play a role in their future career.\nOf course, you might not fit into any of those categories, but at least it's nice to know the amazing company you are keeping.\nSo what do we hope you'll get by the end of the programme? Well here are a few things that we think you should be able to do:\nDevelop a personalised framework for facilitation that enables you to elegantly structure a facilitation session\nStructure frames to help steer a group towards positive change or learning and avoid potential pitfalls that could have derailed your facilitation\nDifferentiate between surface and deep structure language and recognise when and how to challenge the words used by group members to unlock learning\nBuild and cleanly set up group exercises so they run cleanly and maximise their impact\nSet clean learning or change objectives that help you align the needs of sponsors with those of individuals within a group\nGiven the over 6.5 hours of video, you can probably guess already that there will be so much more than that available on the programme, from opening the session with impact through to challenging dominant group members so everyone can speak. Sarah and I have tried our best to download everything we think you need to consider to build a powerful facilitation profile.\nLet me tell you a little bit about me. I'm a professional executive coach and facilitator. I specialise in managing effective change and supercharging high performing teams. But previously, I've also facilitated a lot of personal development experiences. I've facilitated groups of disenfranchised young people through to blue chip boards. I work with charities, start-ups and international brands. I've facilitated sessions at 10 and 11 Downing Street with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and have had the privilege of working with industry leaders such as Sir Richard Branson.\nBut what's even better, is the mentoring on this programme doesn't just come from me. I've invited Sarah Smith, one of the most extraordinary facilitators I know, to join me and share her knowledge and experience too. Sarah is an incredible coach and positive psychologist and former Head of Development at Cranfield University. Like me, she has huge experience working for some of the world's top organisations and blends a number of different modalities in order to maximise her impact with groups.\nThe programme varies between taught modules recorded especially with this programme in mind and classroom recordings from our 14 day NLP Trainer Training and Change Facilitation programmes. This makes the course feel much more interactive. It also saves you a lot of money. Students on the course in Bristol paid up to £3500 to attend and you get to share much of the same material for a fraction of the price. And of course you'll have a 30 day money back guarantee, so there is no real risk, other than the investment of your valuable time, if the course isn't for you.  We really want you to be successful, and experience shows the skills and attitudes we're sharing really can make a massive difference.\nThank you so much for considering joining us on this journey. I look forward to the adventure ahead.",

      "description": "DISC is a model of human behaviour that helps you to understand why people do what they do.\nThe dimensions of Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Compliance make up the model giving insights into a person's personality intelligence and their intrinsic motivation.  These dimensions interact with other personality factors to describe human behaviour.\nThis online course has been created to help you apply DISC behavioural principles to working in situations that involve influencing and selling or as part of a team.\nBy understanding your inherent behavioural style and then learning how to determine and appropriately react to the buying styles of your team members, customers and clients, you will be better able to communicate, motivate, convince and ultimately influence more buying decisions.

      "description": "Law has a very important role to play in what any HR manager does in a day, though it may not be always apparent. You actually require a good hold of different laws starting from the recruitment, to their onboarding, mandatory paper work, different benefits such as PF, ESI, bonus, gratuity etc.\nAlso you will need to ensure that the decision of dismissal is taken after proper disciplinary proceedings. If you do not follow proper procedures, the company may have to pay compensation for wrongful termination or reinstate the employee with back wages in some cases.\nIn fact, as you go up the chain, legal knowledge becomes indispensable. Let’s say you are drafting a leave policy for a company, and fail to check the relevant Shops and Establishments Act of the state, you will almost certainly get it wrong. The consequence can be paying heavy fines by the company if an inspector comes visiting, a potentially negative impact on the brand and embarrassment in front of other employees.\nAlso if you talk about different functions of HR such as Recruitment, Training and Development, Performance Appraisal, Grievance handling etc then you will notice that a part, small to big, is played by the respective managers as well. But labour laws are something which other people usually don’t have much of an idea and if you make this strong then this will give you a lot of importance and growth in that company.\nSome of the key laws covered:\nIntroduction\nNew amendments (Code on Wages/ Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions/ Code on Industrial Relations/Code on Social Security)\nApprentices Act, 1961\nBonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976\nChild and Adolescent Labour ( Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986\nContract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970\nEmployee’s Compensation Act, 1923\nEmployees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952\nEmployees’ State Insurance Act, 1948\nEqual Remuneration Act, 1976\nExemption from Furnishing Returns and Maintaining Register by certain establishments Act, 1988\nFactories Act, 1948\nIndustrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act 1946\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\nInter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979\nMaternity Benefit Act, 1961\nMinimum Wages Act, 1948\nPayment of Bonus Act, 1965\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nPayment of Wages Act, 1936\nSexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013\nShop and Establishment ActThe Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959\nTrade Unions Act, 1926",

We'll also examine the union-organizing process as prescribed by the National Labor Relations Act, employee rights and employer rights, employer and union unfair labor practices and the details of collective bargaining and its processes. The course ends with a discussion of strikes and picketing and secondary boycotts as well as lockouts.\nIn topic 1, Labor Relations and Unionization, we'll narrow our focus to the federal laws specifically affecting employment in union environments. The employer can't keep employees from participating in union activities. In topic 2, Unfair Labor Practices, you'll become more familiar with the complex areas of employer and union unfair labor practices.\nThe employer and the union are required to bargain in good faith. In topic 3, collective bargaining, we'll examine the collective bargaining process, strategies, and concepts such as contract negotiation; mandatory, voluntary, and unlawful bargaining subjects; good faith bargaining; contract costing; and contract administration.\nThere are only two types of lawful protected strikes - strikes for economic reasons or strikes against employers who have engaged in unfair labor practices. In topic 4, Strikes, Picketing, and Secondary Boycotts, we'll focus on the union's protected concerted activities, including lawful strikes, picketing, and boycotts, as well as lawful employer lockouts.\nThat’s it!

Performance goals are specific targets or objectives that individuals or teams are expected to achieve within a given timeframe. These goals play a fundamental role in driving employee performance, aligning organizational objectives, and fostering continuous improvement. We will explore the significance of performance goals in the realm of human resources and the benefits they bring to both employees and organizations.\n1. Clarity and Focus: Performance goals provide clarity and direction to employees. When employees have clear goals, they know what is expected of them and can focus their efforts on achieving those objectives. Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals helps employees understand the desired outcomes and enables them to prioritize their tasks effectively.\n2. Motivation and Engagement: Well-defined performance goals have a motivational effect on employees. When employees have challenging yet attainable goals, they are more likely to feel engaged and motivated to perform at their best. Goals create a sense of purpose and provide a framework for employees to channel their energy and expertise towards achieving desired outcomes. They can enhance job satisfaction and increase employee commitment to the organization.\n3. Performance Evaluation: Performance goals serve as a basis for assessing employee performance. By setting clear objectives, managers can evaluate and measure the progress and achievements of employees. Regular performance evaluations help identify areas of improvement, provide constructive feedback, and recognize top performers. Objective evaluation criteria linked to performance goals ensure fairness and transparency in the assessment process.\n4. Skill Development: Performance goals create opportunities for employees to develop and enhance their skills and competencies. By setting goals that require employees to stretch beyond their current capabilities, organizations can foster a culture of continuous learning and development. Employees are motivated to acquire new knowledge, acquire relevant training, and seek growth opportunities to meet or exceed their goals. This, in turn, benefits both the individual and the organization by building a skilled and capable workforce.\n5. Alignment with Organizational Objectives: Performance goals play a crucial role in aligning individual and team efforts with the broader organizational objectives. When goals are set in line with the strategic priorities of the organization, employees understand how their work contributes to the overall success of the company. This alignment promotes a sense of organizational unity and helps employees see the bigger picture, fostering a collective effort towards achieving organizational goals.\n6. Accountability and Performance Improvement: Performance goals create a sense of accountability among employees. When employees have clear goals and know they will be evaluated based on their performance, they are more likely to take ownership of their work and strive for excellence. Goals also provide a basis for identifying performance gaps and areas that require improvement. Managers can offer support, guidance, and resources to help employees overcome challenges and enhance their performance.\nPerformance goals are a vital component of effective human resource management. They provide clarity, motivation, and focus for employees, facilitate performance evaluation and skill development, align individual efforts with organizational objectives and foster a culture of accountability and continuous improvement. By recognizing the importance of performance goals, organizations can drive employee engagement, productivity, and ultimately, achieve their desired outcomes.",

If you are an HR expert or L&D practitioner, people manager, freelance trainer, coach or mentor, then this course is for you.\nBy the end of it you will be able to distinguish among a wide range of L&D methods, choose the most appropriate one for your situation and devise a practical plan on how to launch it in your organisation. And for extra confidence, each method I discuss includes a section with tips for L&D practitioners.\nAlthough you should know that this course isn’t meant to be watched from beginning to end.

We will cover how fees are charged and what difference that makes to the structure of a recruitment business.”\nThat is the basic information that every person in recruitment should know, albeit that many do not, they only get to know their own firm, but if you just cannot wait to get onto knowing what to do and when and how, you can go straight to video 6 and perhaps pop back here for the few minutes that these first videos take to watch..\nWe will then explore the two core disciplines in the recruitment process, the role of the Researcher and that of the Recruiter.These roles are the backbone of any search firm and without which the business just would not exist.These are the first positions that someone will usually do so it is vital to really understand what they cover as responsibilities and how to become great at both. Now, in some smaller firms, these roles are undertaken by the same person, but they are not the same role as they have different functions.But with these skills you will always be able to find yourself a job and from that develop a well-rewarded career.",

      "description": "Conflict and disagreements are a natural part of everyday life as there is not enough of what everyone wants to go around.  Conflict occurs over money, goods, services, power, possessions, time, and much more.\nIf something exists and more than one person wants or needs it, there is a potential for conflict to occur.\nConflict occurs all the time - at home, at work, between individuals, in teams, in groups, in tribes and between nations.  Where there are people, there is conflict.  This is underpinned by how people are using their emotional intelligence.\nSome disagreement and conflict is inevitable as this where learning, creativity, and understanding occurs.  It is not that conflict occurs that is the issue, it is how it is managed.\n\nThis course is about proactively working together with others in ways that will help you to communicate more efficiently as you work with them to understand and work with differences that lead to conflict.  In addition, the skills, processes and tools taught in this course can bring value to other aspects of your life.\n\nNegotiating and resolving conflict requires good use of emotional intelligence - your ability to balance your emotional needs with your thinking.  Managing conflict involves using skills such as rapport, empathy and listening.\nConflict modes and styles are reviewed looking at the strengths and liabilities of each. You get the chance to complete a questionnaire that will give you an insight to the mode / style that you prefer to use in conflict situations.  Completing this practical activity will enable you to identify ways to reframe and defuse conflict, creating more productive outcomes and results.\nThe course, also, covers flexibility and how you use behavioural preferences around working with time.  Your flexibility and adaptability underpins how you work with change and can have a profound impact on others that could lead to conflict.\nBy completing this course, you will be able to\nIdentify what conflict is about and how people react to conflict\nRecognize why some conflict is to be expected and why it is a part of healthy relationships\nCompare and contrast the various modes that can be used in conflict resolution\nAssess your own mode of conflict and how this helps or hinders you in working with conflict\nExplain how emotional responses differentiate from rational responses in conflict\nDetermine your behavioural preferences around managing and working with time and how they impact upon your flexibility\nDevelop strategies for dealing with conflict and have some ideas about how to resolve difficulties\nDiscover how emotional intelligence is used to resolve conflict and build emotional bonds\nThis course is a standalone course for anyone interested in understanding how to manage, work with and resolve conflict. It compliments other courses that explore emotional intelligence in more depth.\n\nYou'll receive all the information that you need and will be coached using loads of practical hints that you can use straight away.\n\nThe course is made up of a series of lectures, quizzes, and contains comprehensive course notes.\nThere are eight interactive exercises that involve some activity with other people and some reflection.  These are:\nWorking with Conflict\nExploring Conflict and What it Means\nThe Rules of Assertiveness\nManaging Toxic Situations\nChimp Reactions and Human Emotions\nThe Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Assessment\nAssessing and Focusing on How you Use your Time Preference\nReviewing your Learning\nThe course material makes up a one to two day workshop so is equivalent to 8 -12 hour's training. It forms part of our advanced emotional intelligence course endorsed by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\nPLEASE NOTE - This course is NOT for you if you are not prepared to work through the exercises that make up a fundamental part of the course.  Conflict cannot be managed just by watching the video lectures.  It requires you to do some reflective thinking, to get some feedback and to discuss your development with others.  I'm afraid that you won't get the best from the course unless you are prepared to do this.\nThere are SEVEN practical activities included within the course that are designed to help you understand conflict management. They will indicate to you how you can improve working with conflict and develop your emotional intelligence in the workplace.  All of them require you to engage with your team and do some work outside of the course.\nThis course is being continually refined and updated to ensure it remains current and relevant.\n\n\nThe course contains a series of Lightbulb Moments resource cards, which have been created to provide you with handy reminders of key points around topics covered within the course.\nAll PDFs can be completed online and are Section 508 / ADA Accessibility compliant.\nPDFs are available in English and in French.\nAll videos are high definition recorded in 1080p.\nAll videos have grammatically correct English captions.\nLatest update - July 2025",

      "description": "\"Leadership is not about being in charge. It's about taking care of those in your charge.\" — Simon Sinek\nWelcome to our comprehensive course on Organizational Behavior and Leadership! In this dynamic program, we delve into the intricacies of how organizations function, examining both the theories and practical strategies that drive success in modern workplaces. With data-backed insights and actionable strategies, this course will give you a deep understanding of how organizational behavior influences productivity, collaboration, and leadership.\nOrganizational behavior is more than just a field of study; it's the backbone of every successful company. Research shows that organizations with high employee engagement are 21% more profitable, and companies with strong team dynamics experience a 25% higher productivity rate. These statistics highlight just how crucial understanding individual behavior, group dynamics, and organizational culture can be to achieving business success.\nThroughout this course, we will explore the fundamental theories that underpin organizational behavior. You’ll gain insights into both classical theories, such as Frederick Taylor's Scientific Management, and modern perspectives, like Transformational Leadership Theory, which focuses on the ability of leaders to inspire, empower, and stimulate change within their teams.\nOne of the core areas we’ll examine is team dynamics. Research shows that effective teams can increase productivity by as much as 50% and are often more innovative. Understanding how teams form, communicate, and collaborate is crucial for fostering synergy within your organization. We’ll dive into factors such as trust, communication patterns, and shared goals, and how these contribute to team effectiveness.\nCommunication is another vital aspect of organizational behavior that we’ll explore in-depth. Studies have shown that companies with effective communication practices are 25% more likely to have above-average profitability. In this module, you'll learn how to optimize different communication channels and styles to increase efficiency, reduce conflicts, and build stronger relationships across teams and departments.\nConflict resolution plays a pivotal role in maintaining a healthy organizational environment. Research indicates that the cost of unresolved workplace conflict in the U.S. alone is estimated to be around $359 billion per year in lost productivity. We’ll provide you with proven strategies to manage and resolve conflicts constructively. You’ll learn how to address interpersonal disagreements, navigate cultural differences, and promote positive conflict resolution that fosters growth rather than division.\nThe course will also emphasize change management—a critical skill as organizations constantly evolve. According to a McKinsey & Company study, 70% of change initiatives fail, often due to poor leadership, lack of engagement, or resistance to change. We’ll introduce you to best practices for leading successful change initiatives, including the ADKAR model and Kotter's 8-Step Change Model, which have been widely used in organizational transformations worldwide.\nWhen it comes to leadership, we explore a variety of leadership styles and their impacts on organizational behavior. For instance, studies show that transformational leadership increases team engagement by 48% and promotes higher performance outcomes. You’ll learn how to adapt your leadership approach based on the needs of your team and organizational context. From autocratic to democratic, we’ll equip you with the tools to lead confidently and effectively, no matter your environment.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how organizational behavior shapes decision-making, productivity, and employee well-being. You will develop practical skills, such as how to motivate employees, build resilient teams, and implement effective communication strategies. Armed with these insights, you will be ready to lead with confidence and drive positive change in any organizational setting.\nJoin us on this transformative journey to unlock your leadership potential, and discover how understanding organizational behavior can propel you toward success in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing business landscape.",

But beyond the obvious biases, unconscious bias lurks to undermine business decisions and operations. This course provides clear information about various unconscious pitfalls in decision-making, in the context of diversity and inclusion, as well as in other contexts.\nThe course kicks off by introducing some key terms and the definition of unconscious bias. Over the lectures, we will be discussing how successful businesses have implemented strategies and practices that maintain a healthy and inclusive environment, liberated from unconscious biases, and you'll learn how to apply these solutions in your own organisation. We'll also cover vital topics such as cognitive and internalised biases, while also touching on various methods we can use in order to prevent prejudice and discrimination. We'll then take a closer look at the role bias plays in the decision-making process and how to challenge established perceptions, transforming them into objective and logical approaches.\nBy the end of the course, you will possess valuable knowledge on how to prevent various forms of bias and you'll be confident and self-assured in your capabilities and skills, while also being ready to implement what you have learnt.\nSo, if you're looking to establish an inclusive, diverse, and non-discriminatory environment for all - as well as learn to make clear and objective business decisions - enrol today!",

      "description": "Hello everyone, I welcome you to the course “HR Analytics : Factors affecting Performance Appraisal”.\n\n\nAppraisals are an act of assessing something or someone. A performance appraisal is a regular review of an employee's job performance and overall contribution to a company. Also known as an \"annual review,\" \"performance review or evaluation,\" or \"employee appraisal,\" a performance appraisal evaluates an employee’s skills, achievements and growth, or lack thereof. Companies use performance appraisal meetings to justify an employee’s reward which is usually increment in salary or bonus, based on their performance. Employees get good increments if their performance was commendable, whereas they get low increments or no increments at all if their performance was poor. The HR department is heavily engaged in it. It is clear by performance appraisal definition that this process affects the employees heavily. A good increment will lead to a more productive and satisfied employee. Whereas a low increment might lead to an unhappy employee which in turn might lead to the employee leaving the company. Hence this process should be unbiased. If an employee gets a lower increment than he deserves then he would be really unsatisfied and would look forward for an opportunity in another company.\n\n\nAfter this course you will be able to judge whether the performance appraisal process is biased or not. There can be many reasons leading to a biased appraisal process, like experienced employees getting higher increment, employees belonging to a particular department getting higher increment, male employees getting higher increment, etc. Performance appraisal should only be dependent on an employee’s performance and not on anything else.\n\n\nWe will use linear regression to find out factors which influence performance appraisal. This would help us find out if the process is biased or not.\n\n\nWe have created a very simple structure of the course in order to understand performance appraisal, how to judge if this process is biased or not, and what are the significant factors contributing towards it. The structure of the course is as follows:\nAbstract and course objectives of this course.\nThe step by step approach created by unlock Hr to solve any business problem.\nUnderstanding the business problem we need to solve in this course.\nIntroduction and installation for MS Excel Add-in Data Analysis Toolpak.\nUnderstand how to discover and collect data.\nUnderstand how to prepare and explore the data for meaningful insights.\nApply the Linear Regression technique to find significant factors contributing towards performance appraisal.\nTo go through the major findings and insights extracted from the data.\nConclusion of the course.\n\n\nThis course is created to understand and improve the voice of employees (VoE) who are the most crucial assets for any organization. With the help of this course, you can focus on your employees more, which in turn will be beneficial for the ROI.",

      "description": "Just like physical first aid, timely competent help from a mental health first aider can really prevent more serious problems developing. This is a much needed skill as the mounting stress in so many people’s lives is harming our individual and collective mental health as well as our physical well-being and economic prosperity. So, this first aid course is designed for you to be able to first explain to a friend or colleague exactly what is going on in their mind and secondly, and even more important, the training will help you alleviate their immediate sense of chaos, confusion, isolation and fear.\nTimely intervention with mental health first aid can literally help turn someone’s life around.\nIn addition to human suffering, stress and poor mental health also adds significant costs to any organization. Consequently, we see these extra costs in terms of lower productivity, employee disengagement, more accidents, mistakes, absenteeism, a decline in creative problem solving, loss of talented staff and more. In this respect applying the practical mental health first aid tips you will acquire from this course will reap dividends in terms of cost savings and enhanced people performance.\nTwelve learning points\nAs a mental health first aider, you will be able to lead and normalize conversations around mental health. The simple skills on this course can literally put a smile back on someone’s face and so prevent a difficult situation getting worse. The most important major learning points are:\n\n\nAdvice, tools and techniques to provide timely help with stress, burnout, emotional distress and mild to moderate mental health problems.\nAn understanding of the risk factors that create mental health problems and how to spot the symptoms.\nThe biological mechanics of stress and how long-term stress leads to both mental and physical ill-health.\nA working understanding of common mental health issues and stressors.\nHow to quickly calm someone down and get them back into their rational brain.\nHow to ease someone out of a panic or anxiety attack and prevent it occurring again.\nHelp someone identify key stressors in their life and deal with them.\nHow to help prevent distress becoming a more serious mental health problem.\nKey stress prevention strategies that improve well-being for the individual and so automatically improve their productivity and performance at work.\nGuidance on how to support someone who needs to seek professional help.\nThe ability to communicate mental health concerns to appropriate managers.\nWays to help develop a positive work culture that will ease workplace stress and incidentally stimulate more productive working.\nAnd a lot more that will help you make someone’s day.\nThe course content is based upon the Human Givens school of psychotherapy which comprises powerful science-based treatments that routinely provide rapid and sustainable relief for mental distress and illnesses. These include chronic anxiety and anger, depression, PTSD, phobias, psychosis, schizophrenia and addiction.\nAs such, this course utilizes recent scientific knowledge about:\n· The physiological process called the stress response,\n· The role our innate physical and emotional needs play in triggering stress,\n· How innate physical and emotional needs help maintain health and mental well-being,\n· How identifying someone’s unfulfilled needs can lift a variety of symptoms quickly,\n· The stress continuum and its role in the onset of mental ill-health,\n· The different functions of the brain’s hemispheres,\n· The cycle of depression and how to break out of it quickly,\n· The role of the dopamine system – nature’s reward system, in maintaining balance,\n· The role of trance in learning, human behaviour, and problematic states,\n· How the dream state de-arouses the day times’ stressful stimuli,\n· How your imagination can both create and help solve psychological problems,\n· How the ‘observing self’ separates someone’s problem from their core identity,\n· How the healing response comprises a rich system of mind-body interaction,\n· The role of ultradian rhythms in making internal mental & physical repairs,\n“Really excellent content - so useful for any manager or HR practitioner.

I will define each factor and discuss a comparison of two cases: one where the worker was determined to be an independent contractor and another where a class of workers were found to be employees. That way, you can see real situations that these factors were applied and learn common \"do's and don'ts.\" After every 5 factors, I will do a brief recap and discuss important take-a-ways. Once we conclude the 20 factor test, I also address the IRS Test and the Department of Labor Economic Realities test. I will then go through next steps for your business and the 5 simple steps to conduct your self-assessment. After that, I do a lecture where I discuss the key provisions of the form contracts that are included in the course and then I give a course wrap up.\nWorker classification is a hot issue for the federal government and state agencies which have increased audits in this area. Understanding these issues will help your business get proactive and hopefully stop a problem before it starts.\nPlease remember that the information in this course should be used as a general reference and you should not solely rely on this information for making legal decisions.

      "description": "Recruitment interviews aren’t always given the attention they deserve. If there is a job description sometimes it helps to set competency-based questions that you want answers too. But when these questions are asked in an interview often the answers to those questions tell you what you want to hear, and not actually what the individual has done in the past. In this course I am going to share with you the competency-based interview technique. An interview is always a crucial part of the recruitment and selection process. Wrong hiring would cost you a lot. It not only waste your time but also questioned your interviewing skills, ultimately it affects your business. So you need to know a solid interview technique. It is the past performance that best predicts future performance. Behavioural event interviewing (an advanced form of structured interviewing) gathers evidence of past behaviour against an agreed competency framework. The interviewee is guided to tell the ‘story’ of successful and unsuccessful outcomes in recent business roles whilst the interviewer skilfully probes and clarifies exactly how success was achieved. Behavioural event interviews should only be conducted by a trained interviewer to ensure your selection process is valid, robust, reliable, and defensible.",

You can hire people from anywhere in the world with just a laptop and an internet connection!\nOutsourcing is a key element in building a Lifestyle Business designed to earn you money in your sleep, from anywhere in the world.\nI've built and Outsourced two Lifestyle Businesses in the past Year alone, and I plan on building and outsourcing many, many more.\nAbout Your Instructor:\nAdam has run E-Commerce ventures since he was just 15 Years Old. With 7 Years under his belt, he's now 22 and specialises in Dropshipping. In 2016 he demonstrated his knowledge and ability in the E-Commerce field...\nFirstly, on eBay, he started with £0, and was able to turn over £8000 in 8 weeks, without having ANY inventory.\nMore notably, in September he launched a brand new website on Shopify. Within 3 weeks he had already turned over more than £1000 in a single day, and within 3 months had already received multiple 6-Figure valuations for the website. Less than 4 weeks in to 2017, this website finally hit 6-Figures in Gross Sales in GBP £. Now with that business outsourced, Adam is spending a couple of months this year creating very detailed, comprehensive courses to teach others how to do the same.\nA Word from Adam:\nNow it's 2017, and I want to give back to the community that helped me grow in 2016. I'm planning a LIVE Case Study taking absolute newbies from Zero, no knowledge or experience in E-Commerce at all, right through to earning their first online income with a Dropshipping business. Then, I'm going to create some new content on how to Outsource using my favourite Freelancer Marketplace.\nI have also created a dedicated Shopify Startups Facebook Group which I encourage you to Join and Participate in.\nThe Topics and Areas Covered in this Course include:\nWhat is a Virtual Assistant?\nWhy do I need a Virtual Assistant?\nWhere can I find a Virtual Assistant?\nAn Introduction to Currency Arbitrage / Cost of Living Differences\nPosting your first Job on UpWork\nHow to Filter Applicants using my '3-Factor Filtering Process'\nHow to Offer a Contract\nHow to Manage Virtual Assistants\nAn introduction to the UpWork Work Diary\nAn Introduction to UpWork Budgets and Payments\nAn Introduction to Trial Runs and how to Operate them\nPLUS... Some Free Downloads!\nFree Job Post Template you can use on your own UpWork Profile!\nIn addition, we also have a brand new Facebook Support Group for the Course.\nAre you ready to change your life?",

      "description": "Business is all about people, and hiring the right people makes a massive difference to the performance of any business or team.\nStart hiring confidently, skilfully and professionally. Make right decisions first time; avoid costly hiring mistakes\nThe recruitment & selection interview is still by far the most widely used method of hiring new talent to fill a job vacancy. Recruiting a new member to your team or business is an important decision. Get it right and the benefits are enormous. Get it wrong and you live with the consequences for a long time. Recruitment training can make a real difference to you and your business. A poor recruitment & selection decision can quickly have a very negative effect on performance: not only for the individual concerned, but also the whole team. Tackling the problem of the wrong hiring decision will take an incredible amount of time and effort. Far better to learn how to interview somebody for a job professionally and get it right first time.\n\nWHAT DO EXISTING STUDENTS SAY?\n'It is a wonderful course. I learned a lot of skills to help in the hiring process'. -  Emily Tillis\n'I really recommend this course. It is to the point, with practical examples and it gives you all the basics to be able to prepare for a good HR interviewer'. - Urska Cepin\n'The course was really helpful for revising and reviewing the major topics in recruitment. Richard Lock’s presentation is great and easy to understand. What I liked is that Richard draws attention to how easily we can succumb to the biases and prejudices at each stage of the recruitment interviewing. And these are traps we must avoid! The course examines all stages of recruitment and gives us ideas and some hands-on tools on how to improve interviewing. I would recommend this to anyone interested in HR and Recruitment! Big Thanks to Richard Lock for the fantastic insights! '  - Rafaela Rafailova\n'This course is presented in a clear & logical way. I find Richard's voice & tone easy to listen to & even though I'm already an experienced recruiter it was a great refresher. This would be a really good course for anyone with recruitment responsibilities'. - Kate Cartlidge\n\n\nTransform your interviewing skills and boost your career prospects. Recruitment Interviewing Made Easy takes away the worry of the recruitment decision. It leads you step by step through the recruitment process, showing you best practice interview tips, ideas and approaches to build your interview skills and identify the right person for your role and avoid making costly mistakes.\n\nYou will learn:\nThe key stages of the recruitment process\nThe role of the job description\nHow to clearly specify your candidate requirements\nHow to attract suitable candidates\nHow to shortlist quickly with laser like focus\nHow to structure the interview\nHow to conduct an interview\nHow to control the interview\nInterview questions to ask for successful evidence collection\nHow to avoid the key question traps\nWhat to listen out for\nHow to make the right decision\nHow to feel confident in your interview skills\nMany other interview tips\nThe course uses video and downloadable material to really engage learners. You will be given assignments, activities and exercises to practice and hone your skills, and be supported by an expert trainer along with fellow students.\nThere is a vast resource of material and support available online to candidates in their search for a job. Ironically, there is far less opportunity for the person who is conducting the interview. Frequently, the candidate is far better trained than the interviewer. This often results in the 'tail wagging the dog' - the candidate being in control of the interview. No wonder so many recruitment & selection interviewers feel under great pressure and stress when asked to conduct a job interview to fill a vacancy. They are not confident in their interview skills.\nIt doesn't matter whether you are a first time recruitment & selection interviewer or you are looking to hone your hiring and interview skills to a more professional level. This course has something for you.\nThis course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee and lifetime access to course material, including updates and additions. You will receive a certificate of completion on finishing the course. Courses can be accessed on computers, iOS devices and Android.",

      "description": "What Is Team Management?\nTeam management is all about working with your team to help them collaborate and be more productive. It also refers to the activities and tools that allow teams to work better together. That means managing assignments, schedules, workload and more.\nTo best manage teams, you need to set clear objectives, help facilitate teamwork, have clear communications and oversee performance, while adjusting workload as needed to get the most out of your resources. This also means seeing issues and resolving them before they become problems that sidetrack the project.\nTherefore, team management is a day-to-day activity when running a project. It touches almost every phase and method of project management. For example, when you’re scheduling a project and prioritizing tasks, what you’re doing is fundamental to team management.\n\n\nWhy Team Management Is Important\nA team is the fuel that drives a project. They take tasks, and with expertise and experience, complete them according to your plan—on time and within budget. To do this requires thorough administering and coordinating.\nThat’s easier said than done. There are objectives to meet, communication channels to create, collaboration to foster and being able to appraise your team’s performance all while in the midst of running the larger project.\nThe main importance of team management, then, is that it helps to bring your project in successfully. But there are more benefits that might not be as evident.\n\n\nTeam Building\nTeams work better when they work together. But not everyone on a team clicks immediately. You must promote the collaborative nature that bonds team members into an effective team. That means assembling the right team and giving each member responsibilities that fit their skillsets. It’s the first task of team management, setting the stage.\n\n\nProductivity\nWe touched on this before, but it’s worth emphasizing. Team management serves the project by getting teams to work better. That doesn’t mean driving them until they burn out, which is counterproductive. Rather, it’s about balancing their workload, supporting them and removing obstacles that prevent them from succeeding at their tasks.\n\n\nEducation\nTeams are not static. You probably will use the same team for similar projects. The more experience they have, the better they’ll work. Having a team that is well managed means that, as you add new team members, they will have less of a learning curve and be helped to get up to speed by the more experienced members. As teams gain experience and skills they become a more valued asset.\n\n\nMorale\nGiving teams what they need to do their work is not only going to increase their productivity, but they’ll be happier. Happiness might seem insignificant in the larger business environment, but happy teams are not only more productive. They are easier to retain and mean less turnover, which saves money.\n\n\nPerformance\nSimilar to productivity, performance speaks to the larger subject of helping organizations meet their goals and objectives. Team management creates stronger teams that meet the targets of the larger organization while they work on the smaller tasks of individual projects.\n\n\nWhat are the challenges of a virtual team?\nThe challenges of managing virtual teams are various – they include:\nCausing or being a victim of a misunderstanding – because of a problem with your chosen communication system.\nOccasional poorer performance – because of a lack of clarity and direction in your work.\nA feeling of detachment from other people working in the team – because you get caught up in your own work and the lack of face-to-cafe interactions makes you forget about the other people in your team.\nHowever, all of the listed challenges have a solution – you’ll just need to be patient in the execution of these solutions and experiment a little to find what works best for your team.\n\n\nHow do you overcome the challenges of virtual teams?\nThe short answer is – gradually and methodically.\nAs you grow in your career, managing teams is a necessity. You manage teams either directly or indirectly. Whether you are managing a small team or large team, a co-located team or virtual team, knowing the nuances, common pitfalls and best practices in team management will always be helpful. In fact, it can be an advantage too! In this program, you will learn the practical insights and management perspectives to manage teams well. Due to the times we live in, this program focuses a lot on the virtual aspects of team management.\n\n\nThis program is brought to you by a senior leader who has been managing virtual and multi cultural teams for the past 15 years.\n\n\nTestimonials:\nFantastic course, I have learnt a lot and will certainly look at things a little differently ~ Allyson Best\nThe course was so informative and it was beyond my expectation I really enjoyed it ~ Asandile Madolo\nThanks for the additional information on how to deal with the people in the organization and the productive meetings.\n~Jonathan B. Caracas\nI learned a lot from the discussion of Mr. Govind. It was simple and very informative. I'll make sure to implement what I've learned. ~ Anna Lourdes Abad Falcon",

      "description": "The world of work is transforming at a pace we’ve never seen before. According to a 2024 McKinsey survey, 87% of executives admit their organizations are experiencing critical skills gaps. At the same time, Gallup’s Global Workforce Report shows that only 23% of employees are engaged—leaving trillions in lost productivity on the table.\nThis isn’t just an HR problem—it’s a leadership crisis. And the professionals who can bridge this gap? CIPD-qualified People Professionals.\n(Disclosure: As required by Udemy, this course has been developed with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools for research and editing support, combined with human expertise in HR, CIPD frameworks, and instructional design.)\nThe CIPD Level 5 People Professional certification is globally recognized as the gold standard for HR and people management. It equips you not just to administer policies, but to influence strategy, drive cultural change, and use evidence-based practice to deliver measurable business impact.\nWhat Makes This Course Different\nMost HR training programs overwhelm you with theory, jargon, and endless hours of passive content. We’ve taken the opposite approach.\nIn just two hours—condensed into 20 engaging lessons—we deliver the most important, practical, and future-focused knowledge you need to succeed at Level 5. No fluff. No filler. Just the strategic insights, case studies, and frameworks that will immediately make you more credible in the boardroom.\nWe could have stretched this into 8 or 10 hours, but as Peter Drucker once said:\n“There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”\nWe respect your time. That’s why this course is designed for maximum impact in minimum time.\nWhat You Will Gain\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nMove beyond administrative HR and position yourself as a strategic business partner who speaks the language of leaders.\nLearn to apply evidence-based HR practices, using people analytics and data to make decisions that withstand scrutiny.\nUnderstand how to build and sustain high-performance organizational cultures, supported by real-world data from companies like Microsoft, Google, and Unilever.\nMaster the art of designing learning interventions that deliver ROI—and prove your value in financial terms.\nGain the confidence to lead ethical, inclusive, and future-ready HR practices that reflect the CIPD code of professionalism.\nStay ahead of the curve in talent management trends for 2025, including skills-based hiring, workforce agility, and predictive retention models.\nLearn how to navigate the challenges of AI, automation, and digital disruption in HR, while upholding tech ethics and employee trust.\nBuild your HR leadership brand as a CIPD-recognized People Professional, ready to influence strategy and drive change.\nData, Research, and Real-World Case Studies\nThis is not abstract theory. Every lesson is anchored in research findings, global reports, and case studies that show you what works in the real world.\nYou’ll learn how Unilever used AI and people analytics to reduce hiring time by 75% while improving diversity.\nYou’ll see how Microsoft’s cultural transformation under Satya Nadella tripled market value by shifting from a “know-it-all” to “learn-it-all” culture.\nYou’ll examine how Adobe scrapped annual performance reviews in favor of continuous feedback—cutting voluntary turnover by 30%.\nYou’ll understand how Google’s Project Oxygen redefined management by proving that soft skills, not technical skills, drive team performance.\nThese aren’t stories. They’re blueprints. And you’ll walk away knowing exactly how to apply them in your own career.\nQuality Over Quantity\nWe know many learners are tired of bloated courses that waste time. Our philosophy is different: sharp, evidence-based, and practical content in a concentrated format.\nIn just two hours, you’ll cover topics that some universities spread across months. You’ll leave with the ability to have higher-quality conversations with leadership, to link HR metrics with financial KPIs, and to design interventions that actually change culture, engagement, and retention.\nYour Next Step – Beyond Level 5\nIf you aspire to grow further, this course also introduces you to the CIPD Level 7 Certification—the senior standard for HR leadership. A link is provided in the resource section for those ready to pursue the next milestone in their journey.\nA Bigger Mission\nFor us, it’s always been about more than selling courses. We are committed to making HR education accessible, affordable, and research-driven. We invite you to explore our other Udemy courses in HR, leadership, and psychology, as well as our publications on Amazon.\nAnd if you’d like to support us in creating even more content, integrating modern research with technology, you can join our community on Patreon—the link is available in your resources.\nIn Closing\n“The future of work belongs to people professionals who can blend data with humanity, strategy with empathy, and compliance with courage.”\nThat is the role of a CIPD Level 5 People Professional.\nEnroll today—and become the HR leader your organization doesn’t just want, but desperately needs.",

      "description": "When you look at your organization does it reflect diversity? Do you wonder what practical steps you can take to ensure equity in your hiring practices? A common challenge that many organizations and institutions face is how to find employees from underrepresented populations and how to retain these employees.\n\n\nThis course will explore ways organizations and institutions can recruit and retain talent from underrepresented racial groups by focusing on practical steps that will help:\n\n\n· Identify barriers that cause bias in the hiring process.\n· Develop a recruitment and retention strategy specific to underrepresented racial groups.\n· Gain, rebuild and repair employee trust at a time when it’s needed most.\n· Build and continue the DEI momentum going in your workplace.\n\n\nWe will be examining specific workplace policies, procedures and practices that can lead to bias as well as interventions designed to address bias in different workplace systems. By taking changes one step beyond unconscious bias, we will enable learners to implement strategies designed to create an anti-racist workplace. We will explore different questions that can be asked to assess your workplace’s anti-racism efforts and look at ways to impact structures and systems within your organization. The methods in this course can be utilized over-and-over again to measure progress and keep your success going.",

      "description": "Managing teams is more than just hiring and motivating hard workers. Even the best managers will encounter challenging employees who, due to poor performance or personality conflicts, are dragging down the morale and productivity of their whole team.\nThis Udemy online training is designed to help equip HR professionals and managers to be able to handle employee poor performance in an effective way that aligns with the relevant legal and ethical considerations.\n\n\nPerformance issues can have a number of root causes. It could be that the employee is unclear on what is expected of them. It could be that they lack the skills or knowledge to do the job properly. It could be that they're experiencing personal problems that are affecting their work. Or it could be a combination of any of these factors.\n\n\nWhatever the cause, addressing performance issues is crucial for any business. Not only does it impact on the quality of your product or service, but it can also affect employee morale and motivation, as well as your bottom line.\n\n\nThere are a few key things to keep in mind when addressing performance issues with employees:\n\n\n1. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem. This means talking to the employee to get their side of the story and collecting any relevant data or evidence that will help you to identify the root cause of the problem.\n\n\n2. Be clear and concise in your communication with the employee. They need to understand what the problem is and what is expected of them going forward.\n\n\n3. Work with the employee to develop a plan of action to address the issue. This could involve additional training, setting clearer expectations, or changing the way work is allocated.\n\n\n4. Follow up with the employee to ensure that the issue is being addressed and that there is improvement in their performance.\n\n\n5. Be prepared to take further action if necessary, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n\nAddressing performance issues can be difficult, but it's important to remember that taking action is in the best interests of your business. By dealing with the problem swiftly and effectively, you can ensure that your employees are meeting your expectations and that your business is running smoothly.\n\n\nIn this course, you'll learn how to avoid and resolve performance problems by setting clear expectations with your employees. You'll also learn how to give feedback that leads to positive change.",

A preventable form of ineffective leadership is no leadership, which is what will occur if the organization does not proactively plan to fill future leadership vacancies. Learn how to develop your internal talent so they are ready when leadership opportunities appear - and they will!\nOrganizational sustainability is strengthened considerably when a robust succession planning process is in place. This includes a commitment to individual development planning. You'll learn how to create the individual development plans that prepare the successors, as well as how to create or enhance internal leadership development programs that directly support the succession process. Preparing successors can be accelerated by offering internal leadership development programs tailored to your culture and specific needs.\nPerhaps most importantly, you will learn how to communicate the succession planning and individual development processes to your employees such that they get excited about the opportunity to develop themselves. The transparent communication approach ensures you include and engage all interested employees - whether or not they are on a succession plan...yet.\nThis course provides all the tools, templates, and examples you need to begin implementing the succession planning process immediately.\nThe process outlined in this course is the same process I created and implemented as an executive in a nonprofit organization, following the process for several years while I developed my own successors. When they were ready, I left the organization to begin a path of entrepreneurship. I have since enhanced this process as an organizational development and business strategy consultant, helping my clients to establish succession planning in their organizations.",

Many HR professionals have focused on tactical HR activities. Though required for administrative purposes, tactical HR activities, by themselves, hardly add significant value to the business. This is because these kinds of activities lack the strategic outlook. Having a strategic outlook means HR professionals are able to understand business objectives, can define business needs and are able to design and apply business solutions from an HR perspective.\nThis course teaches students to develop an holistic view on how HR provides business value through a strategic way of thinking.

Do you want to make sure your HR department isn’t discriminating against neurodivergent candidates? Do you want to make sure that everyone you work with is given the opportunity to perform at their best? This course will help you gain a deeper insight into what it’s like to live with these conditions and how you can support those affected.\n15-20% of the population is estimated to be neurodiverse. Large organisations are finally starting to take this statistic seriously by implementing neurodiversity training programmes and other interventions to raise awareness and provide support. No matter how large or small your company is, your workforce can benefit greatly from understanding and supporting neurodiversity.\nThe essence of neurodiversity awareness is understanding that just because not everybody’s brain functions in the same way, that does not mean that anyone who is different to what society deems normal is less competent. In fact, some of the greatest minds humanity has seen have been neurodivergent. Albert Einstein is just one example of a great scientist who is believed to have been autistic. Many individuals with autism or ADHD have accomplished great things and are highly skilled in certain areas.\nThe course begins by listing a range of neurodiverse conditions, before focusing on ADHD and autism and how these symptoms affect people on a daily basis, in the workplace. We then explore the types of support you can offer employees with ADHD and autism. We look at how the strengths of these conditions can be a great benefit in many fields of work despite individuals often struggling to find employment. One reason for this is that they may not conform to social norms in terms of communication. We will take a closer look at how discrimination may be occurring in the hiring process – intentionally or unintentionally. The course concludes by reviewing some additional support options including government funding and neurodiversity training.\nIf you’re ready to make sure that your neurodivergent employees are able to reach their full potential, enrol now.",

A well-designed dashboard is a remarkable information management tool.\nData dashboards: Collections of tables, charts, maps, and summary statistics that are updated as new data become available.\n\n\nDashboards can be;\n• Static for a one-time view, or\n• Dynamic & interactive showing data changes\n\n\nEffective Dashboards:\n• Should present timely summary data or metrics/KPIs (useful to the user/decision-maker)\n• Should inform rather than overwhelm\n• Should call attention to unusual metrics/KPIs that require attention or are of interest\n\n\nUses of dashboards\n• To help management monitor specific aspects of the company’s performance related to their decision-making responsibilities\n• For corporate-level managers, daily data dashboards might summarize sales by region, current inventory levels, and other company-wide metrics\n• Front-line managers may view dashboards that contain metrics related to staffing levels, local inventory levels, and short-term sales forecasts\n\n\nAn HR Dashboard is a data visualization/visual display of important HR metrics, stats & insights on a single screen. The primary purpose of an HR Dashboard is for decision making by management teams of organizations.\nEmployers should ascertain what works well for their organizations and what measurements they feel are critical to be displayed on the HR Dashboard.\nExamples of What to Display on an HR Dashboard are things that the organization wants to monitor such as:\n▪ Workforce Demographics like Gender, Age etc\n▪ Employee Tenure/Years in Service\n▪ Employee Turnover\n\n\nThis course is aimed to help participants learn how to create an HR Dashboard Using Excel. It is specifically tailored for those people that have little or no experience in processing, analyzing and visualizing HR data.",

Hiring the right employee, on the other hand, pays you back in employee productivity, a successful employment relationship, and a positive impact on your total work environment.\nHiring the right employee enhances your work culture and pays you back a thousand times over in high employee morale, positive forward-thinking planning, and accomplishing challenging goals. It also ensures that you are making the most of the time and energy that your other employees invest in a relationship with the new employee—a costly and emotional process, indeed.\nWe all want to have the best people on our teams. The cost of making a bad decision in the hiring process is significant, with the Department of Labor estimating a loss equal to almost one-third of first-year earnings for each new employee that doesn’t work out.

However, HR practices can play a crucial role in implementing ISO 9001 effectively. Some HR-related considerations for ISO 9001 implementation include:\n1. Competence and Training (Clause 7.2): Ensure that employees involved in quality management are competent for their roles and provide training as necessary.\n2. Communication (Clause 7.4): Establish effective communication channels for quality-related information within the organization, including HR-related updates.\n3. Documentation (Clause 7.5): Maintain records of employee qualifications, training, and competence assessments as part of your quality management system.\n4. Internal Audits (Clause 9.2): Include HR processes and compliance in internal audits to ensure they align with ISO 9001 requirements.\n5. Corrective and Preventive Actions (Clause 10.2): Address HR-related issues and take corrective actions if they impact the effectiveness of the quality management system.\n6. Management Review (Clause 9.3): Include HR metrics and performance in management reviews to assess the overall effectiveness of the quality management system.\n\n\nWhile ISO 9001 doesn't have specific HR clauses, integrating HR practices into your quality management system can help ensure that your organization's human resources contribute effectively to achieving quality objectives.\n\n\nISO 27001 is an information security management standard, and it includes several clauses and controls related to human resources. These clauses help organizations manage the security of information assets through HR-related practices. Here are some key HR-related clauses and controls in ISO 27001:\n1. A.7.1.2 - Screening: Ensure that employees, contractors, and third-party users are subject to appropriate background checks and screening processes to verify their trustworthiness.\n2. A.7.2.1 - Responsibilities: Define the responsibilities and duties of employees and relevant stakeholders in relation to information security.\n3. A.7.2.2 - Competence: Ensure that employees have the necessary skills and competence to fulfill their information security responsibilities through training and awareness programs.\n4. A.7.2.3 - Awareness: Promote information security awareness among employees and stakeholders to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities.\n5. A.7.2.4 - Training: Provide ongoing training to employees to enhance their information security knowledge and skills.\n6. A.7.2.5 - Disciplinary Process: Establish disciplinary measures for employees who violate information security policies and procedures.\n7. A.7.2.6 - Termination or Change of Employment: Define procedures for handling the departure or change in roles of employees to protect information assets.\n8. A.8.1.4 - Secure Working Environment: Ensure that physical and environmental security controls protect information and information processing facilities in HR-related areas.\n9. A.11.2.9 - Contact with Authorities: Define procedures for reporting security incidents to the relevant authorities, which may involve HR personnel in certain cases.\n10. A.12.4.1 - Event Logging: Implement event logging procedures to monitor HR-related activities that may impact information security.\n11. A.18.1.2 - Compliance with Legal and Contractual Requirements: Ensure that HR processes comply with relevant legal and contractual requirements related to information security.\n\n\nThese clauses and controls in ISO 27001 help organizations establish a comprehensive approach to managing the human resources aspects of information security, ensuring that personnel are aware of their roles, trained to handle security matters, and that HR processes align with information security goals.\n\n\nCurriculum\n\n\nIntroduction\n1.

But this doesn’t have to be the case as autistic people can be some of the best employees a company may ever have.\nCompanies (including many major companies like Microsoft, SAP, and JP Morgan Chase) have begun to recognise the potential of autistic people and have been making an effort to employ more people on the spectrum.\nA leader at JPMorgan Chase Bank stated:\n“Our autistic employees achieve, on average, 48 percent to 140 percent more work than their typical colleagues, depending on the roles.”\nThat is a huge difference! And it is because they are managing autistic employees well.\nIn this course I invite you to think about autism and see how small adjustments can make a big impact.\n-\nAbout the author:\nTimothy Sproule has been working with autistic children and adults for 13 years using martial arts to help with their development. He was a befriender for the NAS (national autistic society) and member of his local committee between 2009-2019 and is now an ambassador for the European branch of Fighting for Autism.\nTimothy was diagnosed with asperges syndrome at 7 years old and understands the struggles and stigma faced by autistic people as well as their skills, abilities and potential.",

Students will gain a solid understanding of global labor laws, anti-discrimination policies, GDPR, and other regulatory frameworks, ensuring they are equipped to identify and mitigate risks while maintaining compliance across borders. These areas are particularly relevant to the regulatory knowledge assessed in the GPHR exam.\nThe program also covers global compensation and benefits strategies, helping students understand how organizations structure pay, manage payroll challenges, and ensure competitive yet equitable compensation across diverse markets.

Performance management's goal is to create an environment where people can perform to the best of their abilities to produce the highest-quality work most efficiently and effectively.\nPerformance-management programs use traditional tools such as creating and measuring goals, objectives, and milestones. They also aim to define what effective performance looks like and develop processes to measure performance. However, instead of using the traditional paradigm of year-end reviews, performance management turns every interaction with an employee into an occasion to learn.\nCompensation management, also known as wage and salary administration, remuneration management, or reward management, is concerned with designing and implementing total compensation package.\nCompensation management is the practice of planning and distributing the overall pay and benefits package to a company's employees. This program ensures that a company's salaries and bonuses remain competitive within the industry and equitable within the organization. It also involves managing company benefit programs, ensuring the job classifications are up to date, risks are minimized, and the package meets the overall needs of employees and their families.\nLearning outcomes from this Courses:\n\n\nUnderstanding Performance\nFundamentals of Performance Management\nPerformance Management System\nPerformance Counselling\nPerformance Management Process\nPerformance Planning\nUnderstanding Performance Appraisal\nPerformance Influencers\nMethods of Performance Appraisal\nJob and related concepts\nDegree Feedback\nPotential Appraisal\nMentoring and Coaching\nPerformance Monitoring\nPerformance Measurement\nCareer Development and Mobility\nPerformance Management Implementation\nEthics in Performance Management\nPerformance Management in International Context\nRole of HR professional in performance management\nUnderstanding Compensation Management\nFoundation of Compensation Management\nFactors influencing Compensation Management\nCompensation and Job Evaluation\nArchitecture of Compensation Management\nDesigning Compensation\nBehavioural Dimension of compensation management\nManaging Performance\nWages & salaries administration\nPerformance reward\nIncentives and Fringe Benefits\nStock Based Compensation\nCompensation and Business Environment\nExecutive Compensation\nChallenges to compensation management\nCompensation for Flexible Workforce\nLegal framework for Compensation\nInternational Payment System",

Or maybe you're just starting your HR journey and need a globally relevant credential that actually fits your context.\nThis aPHR Certification Course is built for you.\nDeveloped by the Institute of Human Resource and Leadership Development, this certification isn’t just a course—it’s a strategic solution for emerging HR leaders, self-taught professionals, and career movers seeking practical, technical, and employer-recognized HR credentials that are fully accessible from anywhere in the world.\nLet’s be clear: the global workforce is shifting. According to McKinsey & Company, over 40% of organizations are actively rethinking their HR infrastructure to match digital transformation and hybrid work demands. Simultaneously, LinkedIn’s “Future of Skills” report shows that HR roles have grown by 87% globally over the past five years, with certified professionals earning up to 30% more than their non-certified counterparts. Yet, traditional certifications like HRCI’s aPHR remain financially and logistically out of reach for many—especially in underserved regions.\nThat’s where we come in.\nThis course is designed for:\nEarly-career HR professionals, such as HR assistants, HR generalists, and coordinators who need an accessible yet comprehensive credential to fast-track promotions, expand knowledge, and demonstrate formal competency to hiring managers and HR departments.\nSupervisors, project leads, and line managers who are responsible for onboarding, performance reviews, leave approvals, or workplace conflict resolution—but lack foundational HR theory, labor law knowledge, or policy-driven management frameworks.\nGraduates from Business Administration, Public Policy, Organizational Psychology, or Human Services programs who are entering the workforce and need a practical, job-ready certification aligned with global HR practices, legal standards, and compliance protocols.\nProfessionals working in remote or underserved regions, including areas without easy access to HRCI, SHRM, or CIPD testing centers, who still want a high-quality credential rooted in global HR excellence—without paying hundreds of dollars in testing fees or waiting months for exam slots.\nFreelance HR consultants and independent advisors supporting SMEs, NGOs, and startups in areas like workforce planning, employee engagement, payroll structuring, and regulatory compliance—who want to back their experience with structured certification.\nTechnical recruiters, DEI specialists, and talent acquisition partners aiming to deepen their understanding of HRIS systems, labor law fundamentals, and holistic talent management practices that influence organizational success.\nInternational job seekers who need resume-enhancing, recruiter-friendly credentials to qualify for HR roles in global firms, remote-first companies, or international development organizations.\nCross-disciplinary professionals—such as administrative managers, executive assistants, operations coordinators, or customer service supervisors—who are transitioning into human resources and want a strong foundation built on practical implementation, not just theoretical knowledge.\nThis certification creates a bridge—between where you are, and where you want to be.\nIt’s an inclusive, scalable, and future-focused credential. Whether you're operating in Nairobi, Karachi, Manila, Dhaka, or anywhere else with limited HR certification access, this course puts the power of professional recognition in your hands.\nBy joining this certification, you're not only equipping yourself with core HR knowledge—you’re becoming part of a new global class of certified professionals redefining what it means to be people-centered, data-informed, and legally competent in modern HR.\nLet this course be your first step toward greater confidence, better opportunities, and a career that truly reflects your impact.",

Join me to build your confidence around using HR data!\nHR Analytics, also called People Analytics, talent analytics and workforce analytics has been increasingly used in corporate Human Resources (HR) teams.\nThis class is a beginner level introduction. It is intended for:\nHR employees who want to learn how businesses are using analytics to study their workforces,\nStudents who wish to explore whether they would enjoy a career in HR Analytics, and\nBeginner level analytics people who wonder how analytics is different in HR.\nThis course is not intended for analytics and statistical experts.\nThe course begins with real-world examples of analytics and the additional challenges that come with trying to study people.

      "description": "The belief that there are fundamental and universal differences between the sexes is a popular one. But it’s a belief that lacks scientific backing and one that continues to underpin gender inequality and discrimination, both in the workplace and in society. This course looks at the nature of gender bias, how it affects both individuals and organisations and what we can do to reduce its impact on our relationships and decision-making.\nStudies have shown that contrary to popular stereotypes, there are no differences at all in terms of women’s and men’s cognitive abilities. What’s more, the gendered roles that today appear immutable have not always been so - history tells us that prior to the industrial revolution, men and women performed a wide range of mutually interchangeable roles, and that even 100 years ago, jobs that today are seen as typically ‘female’ were done almost exclusively by men. Yet today’s workplace remains hampered by perceptions of gender-specific roles and broadly accepted ‘norms’ of gender behaviour, and organisations and individuals are suffering as a result.\n\nIn this course from Skill Boosters, Professor Binna Kandola and Dr Jo Kandola explain how today’s gender inequality stems not from biology and evolution but from artificial social constructs and show how challenging gender bias and dismantling gender stereotypes can deliver huge benefits at both an individual and organisational level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course looks at:\nWhy we carry around gender stereotypes and how they affect us\nThe impact of gender bias in the workplace and the business case for tackling it\nWhy addressing our bias helps us to assess people’s strengths, skills and potential more objectively and ensure that we recruit, retain and advance the best people\nHow to make sure that the decisions that we make are well-informed, fair and sustainable\nPractical techniques for identifying and addressing bias at an individual and organisational level",

Produced in partnership with leading UK business psychology consultancy Pearn Kandola, this course looks at why bias develops, its impact on the workplace and what we can do to tackle it at both an individual and organisational level.\nNo matter how open-minded we might like to think we are, we are all inherently biased. These biases develop over the course of our lives as a result of the influences of our friends and family, our personal experiences, our cultural background and external influences such as the media. While we may be largely unaware of them, they can exert a powerful influence on how we interact with those around us and the decisions that we make about people and situations.\nThis course combines original drama and expert analysis to provide psychological insights into how our own behaviour might be affected by bias and looks at what we can do to reduce or eliminate its influence on our working relationships and the decisions that we make. Suitable for teams of all types, the course has been designed to help people at all levels including operational managers and staff, HR managers and trainers and senior executives and business leaders.\n\nThis course will give a better understanding of:\n- Why humans are biased\n- The relationship between bias, prejudice and discrimination\n- How unconscious bias can impact on the workplace and on working relationships\n- What we can do to reduce or eliminate bias from our decision-making process\n- How to identify and address bias in specific situations, such as recruitment.",

Whether you have a single person working for you, a small team or a large group, being able to effectively communicate, coach and provide performance feedback is a vital part of being a great manager.\nCoaching is a common buzz-word used globally for everything from sports to business, but what are they key things you need to know to become an effective coach as a manager of people? We'll cover the types of coaching and ways to coach your staff as well as useful hints, tips and practical examples of coaching and how the way you speak to your staff can make a huge difference to individual, team and organisational performance.\nThis course is predominantly video based with lectures by Nigel Young, an experienced and qualified coach, manager and educator. The videos are a combination of presentation, animations and examples that will guide you through the coaching and interaction processes. There are also links to other material and a few document resources to help along the way.\nThe course itself should be able to be completed in about an hour, but by following links and putting what you learn into practise it can effectively guide you through study that could last for weeks and the benefits far longer.\nThe course is split into three key areas. The first is a series of knowledge based information lectures, the second deals with the theories and practices of coaching before the final section deals with how to give and use feedback in your management to improve performance. There are 17 short lectures that allow you to absorb the material in bite-sized chunks.\nYou should take this course if you're new to managing groups of people, an experienced manager who would like some new ideas or even looking to find out more about coaching and how it can help you as a managers or potential manager.",

Usually, first time restaurateurs are more focused on arranging the capital for opening a restaurant, that they forget about the working capital, that is, the money that would sustain the business, until the restaurant business reaches its break even and start generating profits. Its very important that owners must understand and also study the type of restaurant that they want to start with because every restaurant types can be determined by the time of reaching the break- even point.\nOne thing that every restaurant manager must watch carefully is that they should not spend more than what they receive, in such case the cash-flow of the organization must be manage very well to always ensure that there is consistent cash-flow that will help in the operation of the business.

      "description": "Welcome to the course on Organizational Psychology and Human Resource Management!\nWe’re about to embark on a journey that uncovers what truly makes workplaces thrive. Imagine being part of an organization where people aren’t just working—they’re engaged, satisfied, and motivated to do their best. Understanding the psychology behind human behavior at work can help create such environments, boosting both employee well-being and business success.\nOrganizational psychology is all about studying how people behave in professional settings and using that knowledge to improve performance, satisfaction, and overall workplace dynamics. In fact, studies show that companies with highly engaged employees are 21% more profitable than those without.\nTake Google’s Project Aristotle, for instance. Researchers found that the most successful teams had one crucial factor: psychological safety—the belief that team members can take risks and be vulnerable without fear of punishment. That insight transformed how teams were built, emphasizing trust and open communication as cornerstones of success.\nAs the world becomes more interconnected, globalization reshapes industries. While this opens doors to innovation and expansion, it also brings challenges—like navigating cultural differences and adapting to diverse markets. Yet, research from McKinsey shows that companies with diverse teams outperform their peers by 35%, as varied perspectives spark creativity and better decision-making.\nSpeaking of diversity, it’s not just a buzzword—it’s a competitive advantage. Salesforce, for example, actively works to close gender pay gaps and foster inclusion through mentorship programs, proving that ethical and diverse workplaces don’t just improve employee satisfaction—they drive results. In fact, Harvard Business Review reports that diverse companies see a 19% increase in revenue from innovation alone.\nBut creating a thriving workplace isn’t just about policies and diversity. Understanding employee motivation is key. Concepts like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and Herzberg’s motivation-hygiene theory show that people need more than just a paycheck to stay engaged. Companies like Zappos prioritize cultural fit and personal fulfillment, leading to lower turnover and happier teams.\nAnd while IQ often gets the spotlight, research by psychologist Daniel Goleman reveals that emotional intelligence (EQ) accounts for 58% of professional success. Leaders like Satya Nadella at Microsoft have embraced this, encouraging empathy and self-awareness to build stronger, more collaborative teams.\nOf course, no workplace is without challenges. Job stress alone costs U.S. companies over $300 billion annually in absenteeism, healthcare, and lost productivity. Forward-thinking organizations like Johnson & Johnson tackle this by investing in employee wellness programs, proving that prioritizing mental health is both humane and financially smart.\nWorkplaces are also shaped by power dynamics and politics. While office politics can be frustrating, studies show that employees who understand and navigate workplace politics tend to experience greater career success. And when leadership is intentional about fostering fairness and transparency, it can mitigate the negative effects of politics, creating a more trusting and cohesive environment.\nThe design of a job itself plays a huge role in performance and engagement. According to Hackman and Oldham’s Job Characteristics Model, jobs that offer meaning, autonomy, and regular feedback lead to more satisfied and productive employees. Spotify, for instance, embraces flexible work models, allowing employees to shape their schedules for better work-life balance.\nBehavioral psychology also has practical applications in HR. Behavioral modification (OBMOD) techniques, like positive reinforcement, can shape employee behavior and boost productivity. Walmart’s performance-based incentives, for example, significantly improved employee output and reduced turnover.\nLooking ahead, the future of work is evolving rapidly. From AI-driven recruitment to a stronger focus on employee well-being, organizations that stay ahead of these trends will build resilient, high-performing teams.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a deeper understanding of what drives human behavior in the workplace—and more importantly, you’ll know how to use that knowledge to create healthier, happier, and more successful organizations. Whether you’re an aspiring HR leader, manager, or consultant, mastering these concepts will empower you to make a real impact. Let’s get started!",

      "description": "Human resources are considered the biggest asset of an organisation and the main reason is that humans (employees) in an organisation are the sustainable competitive advantage. Sustainable competitive advantage is superior to competitive advantage due to the fact that it can not be copied by others. In the list of sustainable competitive advantages, you will always find human resources at the top of the list. But the same humans (employees) can be the biggest risk for an organisation if they are not managed properly. That is why understanding human resources management is inevitable.\nThis course is a perfect course for those who want to learn some of the basics of human resource management, specifically from a retail perspective. Many interesting topics are included in this course that will enhance your understanding of the topics related to human resource management.\nThe following topics are covered in this course for you:\n\n\nIntroduction to HRM\nCompetitive advantage vs sustainable competitive advantage in HRM\nObjectives of HRM\nPerformance measures in HRM\nChallenges in HRM\nIssues in HRM from a retail perspective\nDesigning organisational structure\nThe organisational structure in retailing\nSmall vs Large organisations\nCentralised vs decentralised management\nWinning the employee talent war\nEmployment Marketing\nTalent Development\nMotivating talent\nRetaining talent\nLegal issues in retail HRM\nAs you can see, all the topics covered in this course are of prime importance.

In topic one, Compensation Legislation, you'll expand your knowledge of legislation affecting compensation programs and ways to ensure compensation programs are compliant with applicable federal laws and regulations.\nEmployees may bring civil cases against their employers for failing to inform them of their rights under the FMLA. In topic two, Legislation Affecting Benefits, our focus will shift to legislation related to benefits and ways to ensure benefits programs are compliant with applicable federal laws and regulations.\nUSERRA prohibits employers from discriminating against covered individuals in employment decisions because of their military service. In topic three, Tax and Benefits Legislation and Compensation Accounting Practices, the focus will be on tax laws related to compensation and benefits as well as budgeting and accounting practices related to compensation and benefits.\nCompensation packages that lack strategic focus are often costly for organizations and their employees. In topic four, Common Compensation and Benefits Strategies, we'll look at some of the more common compensation and benefit strategies that HR professionals should be aware of.\nA structured needs assessment is essential. In topic five, Needs Assessments for Compensation and Benefits programs, the primary focus will be on identifying key elements and conducting compensation and benefits programs needs assessments, including benchmarking, employee surveys, and trend analysis.\nThat’s it!

Next we'll discuss legally mandated benefits, in particular Social Security and Medicare.\nThen we'll end with a review of the importance of effective and regular employee communications regarding compensation and benefits programs and employee self-service technologies. In topic one, Noncash Compensation Methods, you'll learn about noncash compensation methods such as equity programs and noncash reward systems.\nEmployees need to be physically, mentally, and emotionally fit to cope with the stresses of the modern workplace. In topic two, Common Benefits Programs, the focus will be on health and welfare benefits, retirement plans, and employee assistant programs, or EAPs.\nWhile workers' compensation benefits are extensive, they don't provide coverage for all workers' health issues. In topic three, Fiduciary Responsibilities, we'll discuss legally mandated benefits, in particular Social Security and Medicare.\nHR professionals should communicate with employees above and beyond what is mandated by law.\nIn topic four, Communication and Training, you'll gain a better understanding of the importance of communicating with employees regarding the company’s compensation and benefits programs, policies, and processes, as well as providing related training.\nThat’s it!

I’m excited to have you with us as we dive into two of the most essential aspects of modern workplace dynamics.\nIn this course, we’ll explore the Importance of Employee Relations in the Workplace—a crucial element for fostering a cohesive and productive work environment. Strong employee relations not only promote trust and communication but also serve as the foundation for long-term organizational success.\nWe’ll also discuss the Role of HR in Managing Employee Relations. Human Resources plays a pivotal role in maintaining positive relationships between employees and management. We'll examine best practices, policies, and frameworks that HR professionals use to create a healthy, collaborative workplace.\nNext, we’ll cover Employee Engagement—a key factor that directly influences organizational performance. We’ll explore how increased engagement leads to better productivity, innovation, and overall business outcomes.\nTo further support your understanding, we’ll look at Tools and Techniques for Measuring Employee Engagement. Knowing how to assess engagement levels is essential for identifying both strengths and areas for improvement. Moreover, we’ll examine Strategies for Enhancing Employee Engagement, offering practical insights and approaches to inspire commitment, enthusiasm, and motivation within your workforce.\nFinally, we’ll focus on Building a Positive Work Environment, which is vital for nurturing employee satisfaction, reducing turnover, and fostering long-term loyalty.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to strengthen employee relations, boost engagement, and drive your organization’s success. Let’s begin and transform the way you approach employee engagement and relations!\n\n\nDiscussing employee relations and employee engagement together in one online course makes sense because both concepts are deeply interconnected and play a crucial role in creating a positive work environment and driving organizational success. Here's why it’s beneficial to cover both topics in a single course:\n\n\n1. Interconnectedness of Concepts:\nEmployee Relations focuses on the relationship between employers and employees, encompassing everything from conflict resolution and communication to fair treatment and legal compliance. Strong employee relations are the foundation for a positive work environment where employees feel respected and valued.\nEmployee Engagement is about how emotionally invested and motivated employees are in their work and the organization. High levels of engagement are often the result of effective employee relations. When employees feel that their concerns are addressed, their contributions are recognized, and they are treated fairly, they are more likely to be engaged.\n\n\n2. Holistic Approach to HR Management:\nCombining employee relations and engagement in one course allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how to manage and motivate employees. It enables HR professionals to see the bigger picture of how managing relationships directly impacts engagement levels, and how engaged employees contribute to better employee relations.\n\n\n3. Strategies for Improvement:\nDiscussing both topics together allows for the exploration of strategies that improve both employee relations and engagement simultaneously. For example, open communication channels and conflict resolution mechanisms can enhance both relations and engagement. Recognizing and rewarding employees also strengthens both areas.\n\n\n4. Efficiency in Learning:\nSince both employee relations and engagement involve overlapping areas of HR practice, addressing them in a single course makes learning more efficient. HR professionals can gain insights into how improving one area can positively impact the other, leading to a more integrated approach to workforce management.\n\n\n5. Practical Application:\nA combined course can provide practical tools and frameworks that address both employee relations and engagement. For example, a module on conflict resolution might not only teach how to resolve disputes but also how to turn those resolutions into opportunities for increasing employee engagement.\n\n\n6. Organizational Culture and Performance:\nThe course can help participants understand how both employee relations and engagement contribute to building a positive organizational culture. A strong culture, in turn, enhances performance, reduces turnover, and makes the organization a more attractive place to work.\n\n\nIn summary, discussing employee relations and employee engagement together in one online course provides a more complete understanding of how to create a positive, productive, and motivated workforce. By learning about both areas in tandem, HR professionals can develop strategies that support a healthy work environment and drive organizational success.",

Learn how to nurture a workplace culture that empowers your work teams to thrive & grow.\n#LeadershipMastery #EmployeeEngagement\n\n\nMy Journey: From Educator to an Advocate of Positive Leadership\nWith over 28 online courses on Udemy, I had already immersed myself in teaching the world of global business management. Somewhere on the way,  I realized the need for a course teaching a deep understanding of managing the people side of an organization. I advocate that this course can be the cornerstone of organizational success. Whether you are running a small organization or a big one, I have created this course for learning for all.\nMy journey took an exciting turn as I also recognized the need to bridge the gap between theory & practice. I saw the necessity for this kind of course that could simplify the complexities of managing the people side of an organization. I have tried to integrate the concepts of leadership and culture building into a concise, effective, and transformative learning experience in this course. In short, I can say that I wanted to create a course that would help students acquire the essential skills needed to navigate the intricate & complex concepts of people management in an organization, whether for-profit or non-profit.\n#TransformativeLearning #BusinessSkills #BusinessManagement #Success\n\n\nCourse Highlights: What You'll Learn in This Course\nDeveloping People-Focused Leadership Skills: Level up your leadership skills with a focus on the people side of an organization.\nAchieving Excellence in Team Management: Explore success strategies most suitable to lead, motivate, and collaborate with your work teams more effectively.\nBuilding a Positive Culture in an Organization: Learn the art of creating an organizational culture that inspires all stakeholders and retains key talent.\nSuccessful Conflict Resolution Skills: Equipping you with the tools to handle conflicts in workplaces with grace & efficiency.\nOrganization-wide Holistic Development of Employees: How to foster a mindset of growth and innovation within your organization through successful employee development initiatives.\nEffective Change Management Leadership: Navigate organizational transition from non-performing to best performing using transformational leadership.\nPractice Test: International Professional Leadership Exams Preparation Practice Test\n#TeamManagement #ConflictResolution #LeadershipSkills\n\n\nAbout the Practice Test\nThis mock exam is divided into five sections, each focusing on a critical area of leadership & management based on this course content. It covers fundamental theories of human behavior, personality development, group dynamics, hybrid workplace management, and leadership in an Industry 4.0 environment. The variety of question types includes multiple-choice, true/false, multiple-selection, case-based, and fill-in-the-blank questions, mirroring the question diversity of the CLC exam.\n\n\nWhy this course?\nAs a management expert, you have to deal with the people in the organization, like the engineers who deal with the machines in any organization. Therefore, people management is a very, very difficult task when compared with dealing with the machines. That is the reason it is always a challenge. And the more you learn about the people, the more you feel confident about leading them, and managing them in small to large organizations and organizations of all types, whether profit organizations or non-profit organizations.\nIf you have anything to do with a large group of people to manage as your subordinates, or even if you wish to learn how to manage your superiors, because, after all, they are also people and the humans in the organizations. Whether you are looking to manage the subordinates or you are looking to manage the superiors, you will find this course very, very useful.\n\n\nWhat is Covered?\nIn this course, I will be talking about everything about the theories, the experiments, the research done on the human mind and personality development, and how organizational behavior and culture work, and how to manage them. I'll be taking certain experiments and research, which are done by very famous researchers in the area of understanding human psychology, human personality, human behavior, perception, feelings, and personality types. All these things will be taken up in this course, so that you have a fairly good idea of how to understand the people and how to manage the people.\nThis challenging part of managing people is very, very important for the simple reason that not only are you managing the people, but people are also making a perception about you as a leader or as an influencer. So in contrast to the machines, you are dealing with living people who are judging you, and also who are making impressions about you.\nThis challenging work requires not only dealing with the people but also dealing with the self, building the personality. Therefore, the challenge of this work of dealing with the people side of the organization requires working on the external as well as the internal side of the organization.\nWith this complex work, which you have to carry out, you really need to learn a lot of different aspects of this difficult task of dealing with and leading the people in the organization. In this course, let us try to understand this challenging task, how we can deal with the people, how we can understand the people, what suggestions and theories have been given by the people from time to time, and how they can really help us.\nLet's now dive into the course together. I can't wait to see you in the course.\n\n\nWho Should Enroll?\nManagers & Leaders: All roles of managers and leaders will find this course very useful.\nHR Professionals: Especially for HR professionals, this course can be a treasure of knowledge.\nTeam Leads: People in the process of building high-performing teams will learn effective leadership and management strategies in this course.\nAspiring Corporate Leaders: Senior management persons and corporate leaders will find many concepts of this course quite interesting.\n#LeadershipDevelopment #HRManagement\n\n\nEnroll Now and Become an Exceptional People-Centric Leader\nJoin me in \"Learn to Manage and Lead the People Side of an Organization\" and embark on a journey that will transform your leadership skills and reshape your organization's culture. With expert guidance, actionable insights, and a commitment to your growth, you'll be ready to lead with empathy and drive success from within.\n#LeadershipJourney #BusinessSuccess\nReady to take your leadership to new heights?

How to manage the human side of the organization? and how to deal with the people in the organization.",

Never be nervous or uncomfortable again when speaking to job applicants about why they might want to work for your organization.\nConducting a job interview can be every bit as stressful as being interviewed for a job. A manager conducting a job interview with a prospective employee needs to know how to communicate the needs of the position as well as the value of the company. The interviewing manager must know how to present the company and engage in meaningful conversation with the job applicant. A job interview can be unnatural and awkward for both the interviewer and the interviewee. This course will teach managers how to prepare for interviews, how to ask the right questions, how to avoid the wrong questions and how to learn valuable insights on applicants in order to lead to better hiring decisions.\nStudents of this Interviewing Skills course will learn how to be completely comfortable, confident and relaxed while conducting interviews.\nWhat will students achieve or be able to do after taking this Interviewing Skills course?\nConduct job interviews professionally\nPrepare for job interviews\nMinimize legal troubles from job interviews\nWhat do Udemy students of this Interviewing Skills course have to say about the instructor?\n\"5 Stars!

      "description": "The Business Management and Strategy - The HR Function and Business Environment course is the 3rd of 20 courses developed as part of the Human Resources Certification Program.\nThis course examines many of the elements of an organization's corporate strategy, key strategic business concepts, analysis of the business environment, and our first look at the federal legislative and regulatory process. As you complete the following course, keep in mind that in today's business environment, HR professionals cannot afford to be myopic. We need to look at the big picture and then determine the best ways for HR to be engaged in the company's overall strategy. This is how HR will become and remain a key strategic partner.\nIn topic one, Elements of an Organizational Strategy, we'll focus on interpreting and applying information from various internal sources, like accounting, marketing, and operations, to the development of the strategic plan. We'll be deepening our knowledge of the organization's vision, mission, values, business goals, and objectives, and we'll gain a better understanding of corporate governance and regulatory compliance. Now let's get started.\nA strong competitive advantage often translates to customer loyalty, increased profits, and greater value for the organization and its stakeholders. In topic two, Key Strategic Business Concepts, the expectation that HR be a strategic partner in the organization is explored.\nTo meet that expectation, you as an HR professional must show you have the knowledge, skills, and abilities, or KSAs, necessary to fill such an important role. The organization must know where it is before it can provide strategies on where to go. In topic three, Analyzing the Business Environment, I'll highlight the importance of an organization understanding where it is today.\nTwo tools used for this type of analysis are the SWOT analysis and SLEPT analysis. Together these tools enable you, as an HR professional, to contribute important information to the organization's strategic plan. HR professionals should strongly consider participating in both the legislative and rule-making processes. In topic four, Legislative and Regulatory Process, we'll discuss the steps necessary for Congress to pass a bill into law and the subsequent rule-making process.\nThe value of including the impact of proposed and enacted laws and regulations in our analysis should become apparent. Because of the significant impact, HR professionals should strongly consider participating in both the legislative and rule-making processes.\nThat’s it! Now, go ahead and push that “Take this course” button and see you on the inside!",

In addition, the emotional intelligence skills, processes and tools taught in this course can bring value to other aspects of your life.\nPeople often talk about positive and negative emotions.  This is not that helpful as emotions cannot really be labelled in that way.  The course also covers the myths around positive and negative emotions and why this terminology is not appropriate when working to understand emotions and emotional intelligence in the workplace.\nGood team working means that you can understand how each other works together. It means that you can have an understanding of other people's strengths and limitations through the way in which they use they prefer to approach situations, their focus and their behaviour.\nThe course, also, covers working with the emotions experienced during change and ways to develop resilience in individuals, teams and organisations.\nSome disagreement and conflict will be inevitable as this is where learning, creativity and understanding occurs.  It is not that conflict occurs that is the issue, it is how it is managed by the individuals involved, the team and the leader.\nThe course is based around the outer world component of emotional intelligence focusing on empathy and social skills.\nThis course is a standalone course for anyone interested in understanding how to work more effectively with others within teams.  It compliments other courses that explore emotional intelligence in more depth.\nThe course covers the DISC model looking at the behaviours of Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Compliance and how these work together in teams.\nYou get the opportunity to look at the four behavioural styles and how you can work better with others who have a different style to your own.   Completing the assessment to determine your own DISC style, will enable you to have a better understanding of your preferences and focus and how these differ from your team co-workers.\nYou'll receive all the information that you need and will be coached using loads of practical hints that you can use straight away.\nThe course is made up of a series of lectures and contains comprehensive course notes. There are a series of interactive exercises that involve some activity with other people and some reflection.\nThe course material makes up a one to two day workshop so is equivalent to 8 -12 hour's training. It forms part of our advanced emotional intelligence course endorsed by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\nPLEASE NOTE - This course is NOT for you if you are not prepared to work through the practical activities that make up a fundamental part of the course.  Team working cannot be developed just by watching the video lectures.  It requires you to do some reflective thinking, to get some feedback and to discuss your development with others.  I'm afraid that you won't get the best from the course unless you are prepared to do this.\nThere are SEVEN practical activities included within the course that are designed to help you and your team to develop your team working capabilities.\nThese are\nReflecting about this Course on Teams\nAssessing the Dynamics of your Team\nTeam Emotional Intelligence Checklist\nExploring Emotional Hot Buttons\nAssessing your Behavioural Style\nYour Least Preferred Style\nReview your Learning\nAll of these practical activities require you to engage with your team and do some work outside of the course.\nThis course is being continually refined and updated to ensure it remains current and relevant.\n\n\nAll videos are High Definition recorded in 1080p.\nAll PDFs can be completed online and are Section 508 / ADA Accessibility compliant.\nAll videos have grammatically correct English captions.\nLatest update - April 2025\n\n\nCPE (Continuing Professional Education)\nLearning Objectives\nIdentify how team working through emotional intelligence can lead to better outcomes\nRecognize why some conflict is to be expected and why it is a part of healthy relationships\nExamine behavioral styles with a focus on your style and how to work with others with different styles\nAscertain how to work to build the hearts and minds of your team\nExplore how people can behave and react to change and the emotions experienced in change\nDevelop and build your social skills and your emotional intelligence\nFor additional information, including refunds and complaints, please see Udemy Terms of Use, which is linked from the footer of this page.\nFor more information regarding administrative policies, please contact our support using the Help and Support link at the bottom of this page.",

And this works only when you can interact with, or at least observe, the person.\nYou Can Become a Mentalist\nNow, thanks to the exciting field known as psycho-linguistics, you can find out whether a person is telling the truth based on how they use language; and the best part is that it works without the need to interact with your subject!\nThat's right. You can tell if they are lying simply from listening to a conversation or speech, or even from a recording such as a voice mail message, or from an email or handwritten letter.\nIn this course, you’ll learn how to analyze the words people use—either in speech or in writing—and you will be able to determine who is being truthful and who is being deceptive. Even more so, you’ll learn the psychology behind the techniques to gain complete mastery of your detection skills.\nDr. David J. Lieberman is an award-winning author, with twelve published books, including two New York Times Bestsellers, which have been translated into 27 languages and selling millions of copies worldwide—including the internationally acclaimed, New York Times best-seller Never Be Lied to Again.  Moreover, Dr. Lieberman conducts training in tactics of lie-detection and interview and interrogation for the NSA, CIA, and the FBI’s elite Behavioral Analysis Unit. In fact, he created the program that’s mandatory for all Psychological Operations (or PSYOP) graduates in the United States Air Force—and he’s going to teach you, what he teaches to them.\nWelcome to SNAP: Statement and Narrative Analysis Protocol, the NEWEST and most advanced method to detect deception—the same easy-to-use-method—the same method that taught to  the FBI, CIA, NSA, and law enforcement agencies around the world.\nIf you’ve ever imagined what it would be like to instantly tell when someone was lying, you don’t have to imagine anymore; because now it can be your reality. The possibilities are endless when you learn the skill to detect deception in any conversation, statement, email, letter, or voice message.\nDr. Lieberman has demonstrated the ease-of-use and accuracy of these techniques on hundreds of television and radio programs. In a special report for FOX News, host Jeff Rosin declared, “It’s simply amazing! I was with him and he was never wrong . . . not even once. I even learned how to do it and that’s saying something.”\nDuring an appearance on Fox & Friends the host shocked the world, when on live TV she announced that she used one of Dr. Lieberman's techniques to learn that her husband was having an affair!\nWhile interviewing Dr. Lieberman on his nationally syndicated radio program G. Gordon Liddy told his listeners, “I wish I had these techniques back when I was in the FBI.”\nSave yourself time, energy, and heartache—and arm yourself today with techniques that are presented in the conversational and engaging, no-fluff style, that has made David Lieberman’s work so popular to MILLIONS OF PEOPLE around the world. In just about ONE HOUR, you will learn how to detect deceit without the need to interact with your subject! Again, you can tell if they are lying simply from listening to a conversation or speech, or even from a recording such as a voice mail message, or from an email or handwritten letter.\nIf you want to become a mentalist and easily know what people are thinking in any situation, then become a real-life mentalist now.\nDon't miss out on your opportunity to enroll now because when the course is deleted, it will only be available to those who own it.",

An essential component of such an environment is treating colleagues with the respect and dignity they deserve.\nA positive working environment places obligations on management, but also places responsibilities on all members to refrain from engaging in unacceptable behaviour; and where it occurs to challenge and expose it. A positive working environment is not created merely through the introduction of policies on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying. Each individual has a responsibility to ensure that such policies have real effect in the workplace.",

      "description": "This is an INSPIRATIONAL course to give anyone working as a manager or HR professional a new perspective on how to select new leaders!\nThis course is NOT a TRADITIONAL \"How to do talent management\"-course! This course well make you RE-THINK and RE-SHAPE the way you find and select talents!\nYou could try the 17th new psychological test or the 12th assessment center method to find your talents to become new managers. But we could also learn from those who have been successfully finding, selecting, and promoting their next generation of leaders for 40 million years: lions, elephants, and the like.\nThis talent management course lets you\nrethink your approach to select new leaders and\nfocus on what is really important for successful future leaders!\nYou will pay attention to the skills that determine leadership success and use the methods of (for instance) young lions and how they learn from an early age what is expected of a 'Lion King'. (By the way: Prides of lions are led by females...)\nTHIS COURSE IS MADE FOR\nyou, if you are\nExecutive who is responsible for the selection and development of new/young executives\nManager who trains prospective managers (= talents) and who wants to ensure that they can really lead\nHR experts in the human resources department who are responsible for talent management, learning & development, and the promotion of young talents\nEmployees without management responsibilities who want to know how they can improve their chances of being discovered as a talent and recommended for a management career\n\n\n>>> THIS COURSE IS NOT (!) FOR YOU <<<\nif you are looking for new tools like Big 5, DISC, etc.\n\n\nYOUR BENEFITS OF ATTENDING THIS COURSE\nYou see in which areas your talent management is already focusing on the relevant critical leadership criteria and where you might need to adjust it\nIn the future, you will pay even more attention to the vital leadership skills when selecting talents for management positions, instead of being blinded by technical or rhetorical skills\nYou leverage established methods from the animal kingdom (proven to be successful for millions of years) to prepare new managers for their tasks in the most effective way\nYou establish a healthy feedback culture for new (and seasoned) leaders to help them lead even better\nYou prevent people from being promoted who have no leadership potential (yet)\nYou avoid the promotion of people who will flourish much better in an expert role\nYou ensure that successors are developed and that your 'succession bench' is filled with top-class talents - made by your organization\nWhen a manager leaves, you no longer have to desperately call head hunters to find a successor because you always have candidates available who can take on management responsibility at short notice\n\n\nTHE IDEA OF THIS COURSE & WHY IT WAS RECORDED DURING A SAFARI\nBecause for millions of years, packs of animals live in groups with clear leadership responsibilities and succession methods\nLeaders of a pack or a herd are tested daily for their ability to lead their group - it's not a one way-street\nLeaders of an animal group only remain in their role if they ensure that the pack or herd is safe and well fed\nAnimals do not accept bad leadership\nGroup dynamics can be seen in animal groups as much as in groups of humans - while there is (in most cases) no 'political agenda'  negatively influencing the behavior\nBad leadership in animals usually leads to the death of the other animals - therefore, only animals with all leadership capabilities are eligible to lead! There are no dazzlers, gabblers, or people who only got promoted due to their connections\nThe examples from wildlife and how 'talent management' works in the animal kingdom show us exactly how we can improve our talent management in businesses and organisations.\nThe manager of the future has to be\nagile like a cheetah,\nperseverant like an African Wild Dog\nand level-headed like an elephant!\n\n\nYes, I actually recorded this course on a safari in South Africa.\nI, your coach Axel Rittershaus, have been a professional executive coach and facilitator of leadership development programs worldwide since 2008. Until 2010 I lived and worked near Stuttgart in Germany.\nIn 2010 my wife and I moved to South Africa, and I continued working with companies and executives around the world. I've been to more than 20 countries personally, and my online courses even reach 130+ countries.\nIn September 2021, we flew from Cape Town to the Sabi Sands area, near Kruger National Park, South Africa. The mission: Record the content for this and several other courses of our \"Wildlife Leadership\" academy at the Ulusaba Rock & Safari Lodge, owned by Sir Richard Branson.\n\n\nMy objective:\nTo produce the best course for you to re-ignite your talent management strategy and turn your company or organization into a talent magnet.\n\n\nTopics you will cover with this talent management course:\nChoosing the right talent for a leadership position\nFocus on the fundamental & required skills and qualities of a manager\nIdentifying #powerskills of potential candidates\nTrain your talents for a leadership role\nAmend your leadership development strategy\nPrepare the best people for their leadership role - beyond traditional training & courses\nRelevance of practical experience\nDevelopment of successors & building strong succession benches\nEstablish a thorough feedback culture for managers\nStop the 'one way street' of executive positions, and recall an executive if need be\nPromote good leadership\n\n\nMaterials for you, optimized to take your learnings into practice:\n57-page workbook / ebook\nchecklists\ntemplates\nyou can use immediately in your everyday life.",

This can result in a waste of organizational resources, time, and effort. Conducting training effectiveness evaluations can help identify which training programs are creating a positive impact and which are not. By evaluating training effectiveness, organizations can ensure that only the most impactful programs are continued, while those that are not adding value can be stopped or modified.\n\n\nIn many organizations, Learning and Development (L&D) is viewed as a luxury function and is often the first to get budget cuts during tough times. L&D leaders must present business impact data to showcase the value of their function and present it as a strategic rather than a luxury function. It is the responsibility of L&D leaders to conduct training effectiveness evaluations and present the results to elevate the function's importance.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn the what, why, how, and when of training effectiveness evaluation, giving you the hands-on capabilities to apply it in your organization.
