In this regard, PID* controller tuning guidelines and their rationale according to the Ziegler Nicholls method are offered to ensure optimum performance. Typical tuning examples have been included to assist you in understanding how specific formulae are applied.\nPart 2 focuses on the final control element of any process control system, that is the valve-actuator-positioner assembly. In this second module, you will find valuable insights into the working principles and construction details of the following control elements:\nControl valves (sliding stem and rotary / fast opening, linear and equal percentage)\nMixing and diverting 3-port control valves\nDiaphragm actuators (\"air-to-push-up\" and \"air-to-push-down\")\nPiston actuators (Single Acting and Double Acting / Fail Open (FO) and Fail Closed (FC))\nRack-and-pinion actuators (Single Acting and Double Acting / Fail Open (FO) and Fail Closed (FC))\nScotch Yoke actuators (Single Acting and Double Acting / Fail Open (FO) and Fail Closed (FC))\nPneumatic positioners (force balance, motion balance)\nDigital positioners\nI/P converters\n...\nThe module then proceeds through a series of process examples and solved problems that require you to:\nDismantle and assemble various types of control valves and actuators using 3D and 2D models\nIdentify the net effect of various control valve/actuator assemblies (direct acting, reverse acting, fail open, fail close...)\nConvert an actuator from Single Acting to Double Acting configuration and vice versa\nConvert a control valve/actuator assembly from a Fail Closed (FC) to a Fail Open (FA) configuration and vice versa\nConstruct the installation curve for a control valve\nDetermine flowrate and pressure drop through control valves for different valve lifts\nMatch the valve characteristics to the given application\nExamine the effect of selecting a control valve larger than necessary\nExamine the effect of differential pressure on the valve lift and actuator operation\nDetermine when a positioner should be fitted\n...\nThis will help you develop the necessary skills to ensure your process control systems run smoothly.\nPart 3 focuses on fluid properties control. This module identifies different ways in which precise control of temperature, pressure, flow and level is ensured. It provides real industrial examples of process control loops and the keys to interpret them in high quality video lectures. Both self-acting and modulating types of control are discussed in exquisite details.\nPart 4 introduces you to advanced process control in process industries. It identifies different ways in which precise control is ensured for the main process equipment such as chemical reactors, pumps, compressors, fired heaters and heat exchangers just to name a few. The numerous examples outlined in this module are taken from petroleum refineries, chemical and steam boiler plants, making the knowledge gained in this section extremely valuable to practicing engineers and technicians.\nPart 5 discusses the important concepts of Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS), Alarm Systems and Interlocks. It presents their anatomy, their requirement, their functions and how they are represented in engineering drawings such as Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams.\nPart 6 illustrates through 3D animations and cross-sectional views the main control instrument devices to measure temperature, pressure, flow and level. These instruments include thermocouples, RTDs’, Bourdon tube pressure gauges, Coriolis flowmeters, level radars and capillary systems just to name a few...\nAs you proceed through the masterclass, answer the 400+ question quiz to test your knowledge and emphasize the key learning points.\nThe quiz includes:\nTrue/False questions\nMulti-choice questions\nImages, cross-sectional views\nSolved problems\nAnd much more...\nYou have our promise that at after completing this masterclass, you will be an advanced process control professional, you won’t be a process control expert but you will be prepared to become one if that is what you want and persist to be. In fact, the knowledge that you will gain will help you understand all process control loops, instrumentations and safety systems so that you can draw the correct information from them. This will set you apart from your peers, whether you are a graduate student, a practicing engineer or a manager, and will give you an edge over your competitors when seeking employment at industrial facilities.\nSo with no further ado, check out the free preview videos and the curriculum of the course and we look forward to seeing you in the first section.\nThank you for your interest in our online courses. Hope to see you there!\nWR Training – Your Partner in Plant Engineering and Reliability\nSpread the wings of your knowledge\n\n\n---\n* When PID is mentioned, it is with reference to Proportional (P), Integral (I) and Derivative (D) control actions\n\n\nSafety note\nSizing, selection, installation and tuning of process control systems (control valves, actuators, controllers, sensors, wiring...) should not be based on arbitrarily assumed conditions or incomplete information. Merely having a control system does not make a process safe or reliable. Now, while it is obviously impossible to address every installation mistake ever made, we have included a valuable summary of the most frequent installation mistakes encountered in the field. We are confident that this valuable masterclass will help you contribute to the safety of your facility, your fellow workers and yourself.",

      "description": "The standard ISO 13485:2016 is an internationally recognized document, used by several regulatory authorities, which outlines the requirements to be fulfilled by the Quality Management System (QMS) of organizations working in the medical devices industry.\nThe standard specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements. Such organizations can be involved in one or more stages of the life-cycle, including design and development, production, storage and distribution, installation, or servicing of a medical device and design and development or provision of associated activities (e.g. technical support). ISO 13485:2016 can also be used by suppliers or external parties that provide product, including quality management system-related services to such organizations.\nRequirements of ISO 13485:2016 are applicable to organizations regardless of their size and regardless of their type except where explicitly stated. Wherever requirements are specified as applying to medical devices, the requirements apply equally to associated services as supplied by the organization.\nThe processes required by ISO 13485:2016 that are applicable to the organization, but are not performed by the organization, are the responsibility of the organization and are accounted for in the organization's quality management system by monitoring, maintaining, and controlling the processes.\nIf applicable regulatory requirements permit exclusions of design and development controls, this can be used as a justification for their exclusion from the quality management system. These regulatory requirements can provide alternative approaches that are to be addressed in the quality management system. It is the responsibility of the organization to ensure that claims of conformity to ISO 13485:2016 reflect any exclusion of design and development controls.\nA detailed understanding of this standard is critical for the correct implementation of the required processes and operating procedures in the quality system, to meet the applicable requirements during product design, production, distribution and servicing of the medical devices.\nThe aim of this training course is to provide the students with a solid understanding of the ISO 13485:2016 requirements, so they can be prepared to implement those requirements in their organization.",

These teams may include primary care clinicians, specialists, behavioral health providers, nurses, medical assistants, dietitians, pharmacists, social workers, and more. In this course we show the importance of care coordination and how a shared record can impact patient health.\nSection 2: Telephonic and Electronic Outreach: How to Monitor a Patient\nWhy is this outreach important? Clinic visits are too brief for the clinician or other staff to arrange all recommended care, and patients often miss or cancel appointments. In “Telephonic and Electronic Outreach: How to Monitor a Patient,” we explain the different types of services that can be performed on the telephone and computer to help with population health management at the practice.\nSection 3: Caregiver support\nA caregiver is a spouse, partner, family member, friend, volunteer or paid helper.\nA caregiver is someone who regularly assists another person with their activities of daily living due to needs related to chronic disease, acute illness, mental illness, aging or disability. In this course we will explore the many duties of the caregiver and why the support of the health care team is vital.\nStudents who will find this course useful will be:\nEmployed in the healthcare industry, or\nCaring for family member or friend with a chronic disease",

However, in order to keep patient and user risk at a minimum, authorities have tightened up regulations over recent years with the hope that manufacturers will build quality in, while taking risk out of a device. The growing complexity of medical devices requires more advance testing and certification to verify safety, performance and compliance to regulatory requirements.  To effectively help patients, healthcare products need to be available. However, before these products are sold, they need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. As the healthcare industry adapts to connected and evolving technologies, safety standards are always being updated. This makes new types of safety testing a must for today's healthcare products. It is very important to note that medical device manufacturers, developers and standards authors all look at the same safety issues when it comes to patient care, information access, data security, product safety and result reliability.\nRegulatory compliance for medical devices is difficult to navigate. Manufacturers, developers and end users often need assistance to stay on top of the latest trends and standards to keep their product compliant. Effective health technology policies address inequality as well as accessibility, affordability and availability of innovation and core medical devices required to target the health needs, particularly those that address the millennium development goals.",

The textile and apparel industry is highly diversified with a wide range of segments ranging from products of traditional handloom, handicrafts, wool, and silk products to the organized textile industry. The organized textile industry is characterized by the use of capital-intensive technology for the mass production of textile products and includes spinning, weaving, processing, and apparel manufacturing\nTextile Industry is providing one of the most basic needs of people and the holds importance; maintaining sustained growth for improving quality of life. It has a unique position as a self-reliant industry, from the production of raw materials to the delivery of finished products, with substantial value-addition at each stage of processing\nBoth industrialized and developing countries now have modern installations capable of highly efficient fabric production\nThe modern textile industry is still closely related to the apparel industry, but production of fabrics for industrial use has gained in importance. The resulting wide range of end uses demands a high degree of specialization.\nThe many types of modern textile fabrics, produced from both traditional and synthetic materials, are often classified according to structure. Fabrics made by interlacing include woven and knitted types, lace, nets, and braid; fabrics produced from fibre masses include bonded types, wool felt, and needle-woven types; composite fabrics are produced by uniting layers of various types.\nTextile fabrics are judged by many criteria. Flexibility and sufficient strength for the intended use are generally major requirements, and industrial fabrics must meet rigid specifications of width, weight per unit area, weave and yarn structure, strength and elongation, acidity or alkalinity, thickness, and porosity. In apparel fabrics, design and colour are major considerations, and certain physical properties may be of secondary importance.",

If corrosion is not controlled, it can lead to large costs in repairs or facility replacement. Even greater costs can be incurred from environmental damage, injuries and fatalities.\nCorrosion control personnel must have a good basic understanding of corrosion mechanisms. They also need to know the various conditions under which corrosion can occur on underground facilities. In this course, we will focus on the control of metallic corrosion by applying cathodic protection. This course was developed for cathodic protection field technicians, although this knowledge is also needed by corrosion engineering personnel. Cathodic protection (CP) is a corrosion-control technology that involves making a metal surface the cathodic side of an electrochemical cell. Connecting the metal to be protected with a more readily corroded metal to act as the anode of the electrochemical cell is the easiest way to apply CP. In theory, cathodic protection can be used to protect any metallic structure in contact with a bulk electrolyte. However, it is most commonly used to protect steel structures buried in soil or submerged in water in practice. Cathodic protection systems protect a variety of metallic structures in various situations. The most prevalent are water and fuel pipelines, storage tanks, ships and boats, offshore oil platforms, oil well casings, and other applications. This chapter will go through the fundamental principles of cathodic protection and current advancements in the field.",

      "description": "From the Author of Bestselling Udemy Courses in six sigma and lean: 'Welcome to the Course. I always challenge myself to bring in the best value to the trust that students have when they buy my courses. This course comes with Unconditional Udemy 30 day money-back guarantee if you aren't satisfied !' Relax and give it a try....\nLean manufacturing is a systematic method having the roots in the Japanese manufacturing industry for the minimization of waste without sacrificing productivity.\nLean Manufacturing has huge impressions from the Toyota Production System (TPS). Toyota along with Ford) is a pioneer of different lean concepts and tools like Jidoka (Autonomation), 5 Whys, A3, Just in Time (JIT), Pull System, etc.\nWhat do you imagine when you think of a lean body?\nWell, lean is not skinny. It simply denotes a mass with enough muscles and energy without fats.\nIn Manufacturing System too, lean manufacturing system denotes a system which is devoid of fats (which in this case are the unnecessary steps which are not value adding and wastes or MUDA which may be the wastes created through overburden or MURI and uneven work loads MURA.\nThis is a win-win situation for all parties,\nIndustries win with Lean because they can reduce the cost and wastes arising from unnecessary steps, delivery the product or services to the customers in time and improve the profits.\nStakeholders win with Lean because, by simplifying the steps, the profits are huge and there is a good transparency.\nCustomers win with Lean because they get the superior quality product and services in time without investing a huge cost.\nEmployees win with Lean because when the company gets stable and profitable, they have a good professional and financial future in the company. Also, as the lean steps are less complicated and well organized, the same job becomes easy and systematized.\nDo you know that the top fortune 500 companies use LEAN as their quality management tools?\nBe it INTEL who could introduce the new chip to the factory in 10 days compared to 14 weeks 5 years back using lean automation or Bank of America (ranking a golden 6th in Forbes Global 2000 list) who used lean tool like Hosin-Kanri in their management. The Japanese company TOYOTA (With total assets of $473 billions and market value of 200 billion, Toyota motors ranks 12th position in Forbes World’s Largest company list and world’s largest automobile manufacturer in 2018) is actually accredited for developing many lean principles such as pull system, A3 and 5 Why etc.\nWouldn't it be fun learning from the case studies of these big corporate for developing our small business?\nLean is a continuous improvement and a value oriented strategy of creating more value to the customers (users) using minimum resources with minimization of wastes in every steps of process.\nNote:\n• Value- Ability to provide the customers what they want in right time, quality and cost.\n• Waste-Any activity that utilizes time, space and resources without adding value to the product.\nLean is not just only a cost related practice. It’s way of thinking and organization of entire organization. It helps organization to be innovative and competitive.\nThere are no particular requirements for this course. Anyone with interest in project management, lean management or organizational management.\nAbout the course 'Lean Manufacturing master course: 25 Tools for Lean Production'\nUnique features of this course that you can count on-\n· More than 25 lean manufacturing tools explained with theory, problem solving scenarios, case studies and simulated case studies, quizzes, practice test and excel tutorials to solve some problems.\n· 15+ unique problem solving scenarios\n· Real World Case Studies\n· More than 20 animated or software integrated Simulated Case Studies\n· Quizzes as problem solving scenarios and a practice test.\n· Many templates and practice data files to work with.\nCourse in a nutshell...\nThe whole course is learning with fun games with professor Einstein, betty and Mark giving you progressively difficult games and tasks throughout the course. You can also check the knowledge with the time limited practice tests. In short, this course is a full package of all the lean tools that could be applied in the manufacturing business and in the service business with full of animated tutorials, downloadable pdfs and excel templates.\nMy name is Gunjan Subedi and I have been working in the sector of lean production and management and quality assurance for more than a decade now. I have experiences of lean management in many production and manufacturing business including and not limited to cosmetics, neutraceuticals, supplements and pharmaceuticals. In short, you can count on me for any problems and I’ll try my best to answer to your lean management and manufacturing problems in the best way I can.\nThis course consists of various lean manufacturing and lean management tools that will prove valuable asset in every manufacturing, improvement and management projects.\nWe will study the lean tools to manufacture the products according to the customer’s demand using the lean tools like Takt time, Just in time, Heijunka and Pull system and also study closely the scenario with and without these tools and improvements that could be made.\nErrors and defects could be minimized when they get easily into eyes of the operators so that they could be minimized. We will learn tools to make a Visual Factory using the tools like Visual Management, Visual Workplace, Visual Instructions, Color coding, 5S etc. There are plenty of resources in excel format for use of these tools.\nWe will also learn about reducing the time for changeover in a step by step simulated Case Study of Mike’s SMED journey using lean tools like Single Minute Exchange of Dies.\nDefects and wastes are the other big problems of a lean factory. The major revenue loss is always due to waste and defects which could be easily controlled with lean. For this we will study tools like Muda, Mura, Muri, and other 8 kinds of wastes including waste of Overproduction, Waiting, Transportation, In appropriate processing, Unnecessary Inventory, Motion, Defects, Talent. Also, we will study managing 6 kinds of defects like breakup, Setups, Small Stops, Startup rejects, cutting blade rejects etc. We will also study calculating the cost of poor quality including costs like Preventive Maintenance, Internal and External Failure Costs\nCommunication is another barrior of lean management. We will study about making the communication better with A3 reports with the PDCA or Plan Do Check and Act pathway and talk about Gemba walk too.\nWe will also study notifying the management about the process and errors using the visual management tools like Kanban, e Kanban and andon using simulated case before using Kanban and Andon and after using these lean tools.\nAutomation is the heart of any manufacturing business, we will study about Andon.using the case study of a Fortune 500 company.\nThe course also deals with the managerial aspects of lean manufacturing using tools like SMART GOALS, Key performance Indicators, Hosin Kanri or Policy Deployment and Making continuous improvement with Kaizen and Kaizen Events.\nThe Course covers the standardization techniques using Production capacity sheets, work capacity sheets and standard work combination diagrams\n· At last we will also study the road map of Mistake proofing also called Poka Yoke.\n\n\nPlease don’t forget to download the following templates when you join the course:\nA3 Analysis working template\nTakt time excel calculator\nFishbone Excel Templates\nFive Why Excel Templates\nWork Standardization chart\nProcess Capacity Excel template\nValue Stream Mapping excel template\nFlowchart excel template\nSwim-lane Map Excel Template.\nPlease Enroll into the course and I will see you inside to make sure you are learning skills for lifetime.",

It is a concept where two leading industries in any country, the healthcare and the tourism industry join hands to provide healthcare services to people beyond the boundary limits of their home country.\n‘Medical Tourism’ has become one of the fastest growing industries over the years, where people travel for getting medical or health-related treatments and combine it with a much-needed break to enjoy the culture, diversity, and food of a different country. ‘Medical Tourism’ provides people with accessibility, state-of-the-art healthcare infrastructure, and quality, all at affordable prices.\nAs per the Medical Tourism Market Report - 2015, India is the foremost destination as it provides the highest quality treatment at lowest cost. The concept of medical tourism started way back thousands of years ago. It is a social practice that started in the healthcare field in the ancient times. Researchers have found that several sites found in India, Persia, Egypt, and Greece had several travellers across them solely for the purposes of getting medical treatment.\nOver time, in a place, certain areas grew in fame with respect to their success in treating certain ailments. This fame may have been due to a specialist who was good at treating people, due to the presence of certain elements, such as minerals or mineral springs that may cure illnesses, or due to the ancient knowledge of a certain culture, such as Ayurveda, Unani, Homeopathy etc. ‘Medical Tourism’ offers highly-competitive healthcare packages at prices, which are much lower than those in the western countries.\nIt helps patients avail healthcare services using state-of-the-art infrastructure and technology, which may not be available or may be too expensive in their country. Patients can enjoy a combination of healthcare, as well as tourism, as these two industries together join hands to offer packages tailored together. Apart from the lost cost healthcare offerings, medical tourism also helps the patients avail high-quality healthcare services.\nMedical tourists are not restricted to just availing ‘needed’ healthcare services but due to the attractive offerings, they can now avail even ‘wanted’ healthcare services, including cosmetic ones and elective surgeries, which they may not be able to afford in their countries. Patients can now afford to undertake treatment of critical illnesses for prolonged periods also due to the affordability and reduced waiting time for such services.\n‘Medical Tourism’ enables medical tourists to enjoy the culture, food, people, and diversity packaged with tourist attractions in a foreign country and at the same time avail healthcare services. People can now enjoy and avail wellness treatments and rejuvenation therapies, involving holistic improvement involving of the mind, body, and soul offered by some countries due to their rich ancient knowledge of such treatments, such as Ayurveda, Naturopathy, Unani, Homeopathy etc.",

      "description": "Retail buying and merchandising is a very exciting field that looks at how retail enterprises go about planning the buying and selling of the right products, at the right place, right time, in the correct quantities, to the correct customer and at the correct price.\nHowever, it isn't an easy topic to get your head around and that's largely due to the fact that the subject matter is littered with specialised terminology, concepts, jargon, acronyms, etc. For individuals who are new to the field it can be quite daunting to understand what these concepts mean, let alone getting a full picture of how everything ties in together to realise the complex clockwork of the buying and merchandising cycle.\nThis beginner course in retail buying and merchandising is quite special - special in the sense that it isn't your regular textbook or mishmash of explanations and it doesn't make assumptions on prior knowledge. This means that you'll be able to connect with the concepts regardless of your educational or professional background.\nFurthermore, the course decomposes the topic into a number of fundamental but interrelated perspectives that describe the subject matter in a logical way. These perspectives define the course structure and also allow the discussion of useful examples taking into account the real-life industry aspects.\nThe course comprises of a range of audio-visual lectures with exercises towards the end of each relevant section to test your understanding of the topic.\nSo, are you ready to go from newcomer to all-rounder in retail buying and merchandising? You've stopped at the right course that's going to fast track your learning in record time!",

      "description": "If you're interested in learning new techniques to turn plastic trash into long-lasting valuable products using low-cost small-scale processes, then this course is for you. You'll learn how to create tableware, sign posts, jewelery, and other items from plastic scraps using equipment that can cost as little as 100 dollars.\n\n\nFor some of us, recycling simply means putting our used plastic into the right color bin and hope it eventually gets to a recycling station where it will then be converted into new products. Many of us hardly get to see how that happens. We assume it always has to involve large-scale equipment and complex automated processes out of our reach. Indeed in most cases this is necessary to realistically recycling the large portion of plastic waste that we generate daily.\n\n\nCurrently, humanity is generating the equivalent of its own weight in plastic waste every year. So we do need large-scale plastic recycling processes. However, there still seem to be some loop holes in the plastic recycling system whereby large amounts of plastics still don't get recycled or don't reach the recycling stations. So we do need more hands and minds on deck to ensure more plastics can be recycled.\n\n\nOne of the limitations of plastic recycling is the cost and the options of products into which plastics can be recycled. The types of plastics that can be recycled using conventional recycling processes are also limited.\n\n\nTo this end, this course introduces new techniques for achieving a diverse range of products from a single low-cost plastic processing equipment. Participants will learn some techniques for adapting conventional plastic processing techniques to produce a wider range of products.\n\n\nWhereas in conventional plastic processing and recycling, different equipment and/or major modifications to equipment would be required to achieve each of the products that you will learn to make in this course. Here we introduce methods for adopting a single plastic processing equipment to achieve multiple product types with minimal modification to the equipment.\n\n\nYou will learn step by step how to produce 6 different products using a single processing method with different techniques and hacks to achieve diverse products. This significantly reduces the initial cost and complexity of plastic recycling.\n\n\nSuch that by the end of the course, you should be equipped with the knowledge to set up a simple small-scale plastic recycling station where you can develop your own unique styles and designs with recycled plastics. This can then be scaled up to medium or large scale as desired.\n\n\nSeveral processes exist for plastic processing and recycling such as injection moulding and blow moulding. However, the conventional plastic processing methods are often limited in terms of the range of products achievable and/or require significant modification to the equipment in order to make changes to product design.\n\n\nFor example, an injection molding machine requires a different mold to make a specific type of product. Due to the cost of the molds, it is important to operate on a large scale in order to achieve economy of scale for the process to be profitable. While another process, blow molding, is limited to hollow shapes with closed ends.\n\n\nThis course presents techniques for achieving a range of products using a single processing machine. This reduces the cost and complexity of plastic processing and recycling by allowing a diverse range of products to be achieved using simple equipment.\n\n\nThe techniques presented facilitate value addition to recycled plastic products through creativity and craftsmanship. Thus increasing the potential for profitability of small-scale plastic recycling ventures. This is particularly important in plastic recycling whereby the collection and sorting process significantly inhibits large-scale plastic recycling using automated assembly lines.\n\n\nThe course is largely demonstrative with straight forward demonstrations. It is designed as a virtual hands-on guide where you can follow each step of the production process and replicate the process to achieve the end products. It also serves as a demonstration to provide a deeper insight into the plastic recycling process for those just wanting to know how it happens.\n\n\nThis course is aimed at a diverse audience with the primary goal of disseminating knowledge and transferring the skill of innovative plastic recycling to the public.\n\n\nThe target audience includes plastics and polymer engineering students, plastic processing technicians and technologists, entrepreneurs in plastic recycling and plastic industries, artists and artisans, tinkerers, inventors and innovators, researchers, and others who will find a practical demonstration course on plastic processing and recycling useful.\n\n\nPolicy makers and those involved in development work relating to plastic pollution management and environmental action are also enjoined to participate in the course to gain insight into how the recycling process works. This is expected to aid decision-making in setting policies on plastics. This is particularly important as some countries already have or are in the process of introducing taxes, regulations and even bans on certain categories of plastics.\n\n\nAbove all, I hope this course will inspire all participants to re-imagine plastics as materials of infinite possibilities and valuable resources and take an active role in moving the world towards a more circular plastic economy.",

Good manufacturing practice details the appropriate condition of production facilities, well-maintained and functional equipment, properly trained personnel, and reliable and documented manufacturing processes. Following good manufacturing practices allows manufacturers to control the production process and helps to ensure product quality. It is very important to note that Good manufacturing practice regulates every aspect of product manufacturing, starting from design and manufacturing through distribution and packaging. Good manufacturing practices covers two main important areas such as control of biological products and maintenance of electronic records and signatures. Staff must be properly trained with a clear understanding of their roles and expected hygiene standards. Staff members are delegated responsibilities with clear standard operating procedures that integrate and outline how to maintain good manufacturing requirements during production. Employees are integral to quality assurance.\nWhen it comes to facility and equipment maintenance, there is a huge gap in organizations. This particular issues cuts across the private sector and government establishments alike . The lack of equipment maintenance exposes consumers to several hazards. The ultimate aim of manufacturer should always be product safety and quality. It is quite common to see paint flaking in restaurant kitchens, exposing cooked food to physical as well as chemical hazards. In some manufacturing sites, the amount of dust on equipment and the environment is not the best. Let all follow the right principles of good manufacturing practices to safe life. Standard operating procedure reduce the risk of errors, accidents, and inconsistent results. And these days failure to use them can often negatively impact morale, productivity, and legal compliance. Whether you're a small business aiming for growth or large organization seeking to streamline opeartion standard operating procedure are an essental ingredient for success.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nHealthcare Systems do not work properly in most countries. A lot of people are left behind and the systems are usually extremely inefficient. On top of that, a lot of money is wasted. We also do not optimize the right things when it comes to healthcare. Using a rigorous approach from management consulting, you can drastically improve the situation, and help increase productivity in the whole economy. In this course, I will teach how to perform fast and efficiently different types of analyses during consulting projects related to healthcare.\nIn the course you will learn the following things:\nWhat potential goals Healthcare System can have?\nHow to estimate the total costs of the Healthcare System?\nHow to identify potential improvements?\nHow to analyze potential improvements in the Healthcare system using Excel?\nHow to Eliminate a Health Problem\nHow to treat faster and more patients\nHow do set priorities in the Healthcare system?\nHow to cut costs without jeopardizing the quality of healthcare?\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 185 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nHealthcare System is a complicated system that is difficult to optimize. You have to look not only and the direct effect but also at different externalities. The situation is also very dynamic and depends heavily on demographics. That’s why projects devoted to healthcare are extremely difficult. Most firms don’t give you the full toolbox that you need. This may lead to huge frustration during such projects and a lot of inefficiencies.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students understand and optimize the Healthcare System during consulting projects. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do during consulting projects devoted to the Healthcare System. You will master how to analyze data and draw conclusions from the analyses. On top of that, you will also get a lot of practical tips that will help you search for potential improvements.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of how to improve public services such as healthcare. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those that want to move later to industries related to Healthcare. The course will help you become an expert in the improvement of the Healthcare System on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nWhat potential goals Healthcare System can have?\nHow to estimate the total costs of the Healthcare System?\nHow to identify potential improvements?\nHow to analyze potential improvements in the Healthcare system using Excel?\nHow to Eliminate a Health Problem\nHow to treat faster and more patients\nHow do set priorities in the Healthcare system?\nHow to cut costs without jeopardizing the quality of healthcare?\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little introduction to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nHow Much Does the Healthcare System Cost? Before analyzing and optimizing, it is a good idea to estimate how much we really spend on the Healthcare System. We will look at direct and indirect costs, along with externalities.\nEliminate a Health Problem. The optimal solution is to fully eradicate a health problem. This is quite often possible, however, not enough money is invested in this area. In this section, we will see what kind of tools you can use and how you can do a cost-benefit analysis in this area.\nTreat Faster. There is a huge benefit coming from the fact that you treat faster patients. Patients can faster get back to their normal life and you have more resources to treat others. In this section, we will check the most useful tools and we will see how you can analyze their impact.\nTreat More Patients. Almost always you have more people that need to see the doctor than available doctors. That is why we will discuss now how you can try to treat more patients.\nLower the Frequency of a Health Problem. One of the ways to help the Healthcare System is to decrease the need for treatments. This can be achieved also by lowering the frequency of occurrence of the Health Problem. We will explore it in this section.\nCost Reductions in the Healthcare. In this section, we will discuss how you can cut the costs of the Healthcare System, without reducing the quality of service and the number of patients we are treating.\nPriorities in the Healthcare System. It’s time to see how we can set priorities when it comes to money allocation. In most cases no matter what you do the funds will be not sufficient to take care of all problems.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\n1. Useful frameworks and techniques\n2. Analyses shown in the course\n3. Additional resources\n4. Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies\n5. Links to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nHow to estimate the total costs of the Healthcare System\nHow to identify potential improvements\nHow to analyze potential improvements in the Healthcare System using Excel\nHow to set priorities in the Healthcare system\nHow to cut costs without jeopardizing the quality of healthcare\nTreat more patients\nTreat faster patients\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness Analysts\nManagers working in Healthcare Systems\nPeople responsible for improving the Healthcare System\nFinancial Controllers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics\nBasic or intermediate knowledge of finance & accounting",

      "description": "In this class we discuss carbon sequestration as a means to mitigate climate change.  The method promoted is carbon mineralization.\nThis course was developed as part of mission of the non-profit Carbon Negative Water and Energy founded by Dr. John Hoaglund.  If you have benefitted from the information, please consider making a donation.  If you're part of the 98% and can't make a donation, please massively forward the website and this course to your network ... it makes a difference.  More information is available at the foundation's website linked from Dr. Hoaglund's Udemy Instructor biography page.\nThe two-part course is based on two presentations, divided topically into 14 videos.  The first section features a Nevada Conservation League podcast, interviewing Dr. John Hoaglund.  The climate change issue, other industrial sources of carbon and how to mitigate it with carbon sequestration is discussed.  The second section is an expanded version of a presentation Dr. Hoaglund delivered to the National Groundwater Association (NGWA), and details the \"CNWE environmental trifecta\" (see below).\n\n\nUnlike the temporary biotic carbon sequestration used for \"carbon offsets\" (growing wetlands and forests in exchange for the \"right to pollute\", i.e. emit carbon), carbon mineralization is the Earth's permanent sink for carbon onto the seafloor.  There is an energy penalty associated with all carbon sequestration methods, but by combining it with brine desalination with the processes described here, the energy invested also 1) produces freshwater, 2) produces commodities such as hydrogen gas, an energy carrier that will soon replace lithium, 3) eliminates brine disposal, 4) eliminates carbon emissions, and 5) reduces salination of groundwater by producing a bicarbonate de-icing salt to replace chloride salts.\n\n\nA technical description of the three components of the “CNWE environmental trifecta” is as follows:\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) is reduced through the sequestration of carbon, achieved from flue stack capture (FSC), or direct air capture (DAC), of CO2, subsequently incorporated into solid carbonate mineral [MCO3 or MHCO3], or into increased naturally dissolved bicarbonate (HCO3) in groundwater, surface water, and oceans. Dissolved HCO3 can be incorporated into algae for biofuel, fertilizer, or feedstock production. The need for brine waste disposal is eliminated from both seawater and groundwater brine desalination operations. The most common technology for this step usually involves 1) the electrolysis of brine, producing a base MOH, and 2) the aeration of CO2 gas forming carbonic acid, which reacts with the base to produce a carbonate salt [MCO3 or MHCO3].\nFreshwater is produced from the desalination of brine, and is managed through the prevention of salinization from brine handling and road salting, as well as the treatment of the acidification of groundwater and surface waters resulting from acid precipitation and acid mine drainage. MHCO3, replacing MCl in road salting and fertilizer operations, provides “non-point” source application of the bicarbonate for the neutralization of acid precipitation. The elimination of MCl salts prevents the chloride salinization of groundwater and surface waters. MHCO3 can also be applied locally, providing “point” source application for the neutralization of acid mine drainage point sources.\nClean energy is promoted through the production of energy carriers: lithium extracted from brines, and hydrogen produced from the electrolysis of brine. Other marketable byproducts are produced from the electrolysis process described above, which has existed for over a hundred years, and is already the standard means for the production of these compounds industrially. The marketable byproducts are NaHCO3 and various HxClx compounds, including H2, Cl2, HCl, and ClOx. The H2 can supplement the hydrogen economy. The Cl2 and ClOx compounds can be used in water sanitation. The HCl can be used in various waste digestion (dissolution) practices, particularly organic matter from agriculture (e.g. offal). HCl applied to native metals produces that metal’s chloride plus hydrogen gas.\n[Throughout the discussion above, M is most commonly sodium, Na, when referring to univalent cations, and Ca or Mg when referring to divalent cations]",

      "description": "The main goal of the course is to give you the most potent practical tool for Solving Complex Problems.\nThis Algorithm has 8 STEPS. In a logical chain from receiving not apparent Complex Problem, step-by-step, through the whole Algorithm, you will find from 10 to 100 new solutions and even more depending on your efforts.\nSTEP 1 will help you to frame the Problem into such a formulation that reveals the task of how to eliminate any Simple or Complex Problem.\nSTEP 2 aims to divide Simple and Complex Problems. You will be able to make self-elimination of a Simple Problem, even if it is not from your profile branch of industry. And if the Problem is Complex, then you go to the next STEP 3.\nSTEP 3 shows you how to find the root cause of the Complex Problem. At STEP 3, the ideas to solve your Complex Problem begin to appear.\nSTEP 4 gives you the way to find resources to solve your Complex Problem.\nSTEP 5 leads you to frame your desired result in the system without a Complex Problem. STEP 5 shows how to apply resources that you found in STEP 4 to eliminate a Complex Problem with low costs and even without them. As a result, of STEP 5, you will get several ideas to solve your Complex Problem. And with ideas to resolve an issue, you may get contradictory demands to the elements of the system in which there is a Problem. Then you go to the next STEP 6.\nSTEP 6 will help you formulate contradictory demands to the element of the system in which there is a Problem. As a result of STEP 6, you will choose the principle for resolving contradictions. In case of severe Problem, when an accepted principle did not lead you to a solution, you go to the next STEP 7.\nSTEP 7 will get you acquainted with special techniques out of 40 available in TRIZ to resolve physical contradictions and to find an inventive solution to your Complex Problem.\nSTEP 8 leads you to the most powerful solution from the list of already found while doing all seven STEPs of the Algorithm.\nYou may ask me: what kind of Problems can I resolve using this Algorithm?\nIf I answer: \"ANY.\" You, probably, would not believe me.\nBut it's about 95% of all Problems around us.\nAnd what kind of those 5% Problems you won't fix by this tool - the only those that need preliminary researches when the nature of an undesirable phenomenon is not known.\nAfter finishing this course, it would be easy for you to find a lot of Solutions to ANY Complex Problems.\nYou'll see things around you in another way. What does it mean?\nAll things around you can help you to Solve a Problem with low costs and even without them. You need to know-how.\nWith this Engineering Problem-Solving Algorithm, you'll succeed in any severe case.\nBut it's not a magic wand - you will have to work a lot! And as a reward, there will be a lot of reliable decisions!\nAnd last, but not least: only practicing the Engineering Problem-Solving Algorithm will increase your skills and as a result, increase your market price!\nP.S.: From The World Economic Forum, TOP 10 high demanded soft skills:\n1. Complex Problem-Solving\n2. Critical Thinking\n3. Creativity\n..........................................\nGo ahead, enroll in the course!\nGet better at Solving Complex Problems!\nIt's worth a lot!",

It is quite surprising how huge of a role truck drivers play as brand ambassadors to their company. Company executives are not interacting with partners in-person every day, but you can guarantee that your truck drivers are, in such case its beneficial for companies to bestow some customer service skills on them to ensure that they are best representing the company properly. The application of technology in the trucking business is helping in responding quickly to the customer complaints and also ensure that work is being than on time to meet customer expectations. Moving forward, customer support and inside departments will only need to increase their availability and their service commitment to their shippers-and their consignees- in order to handle the complexities of their shippers evolving needs. The brands that have reputation in the truck industry , are always looking for ways and means to provide or seek resolution about customer challenges and issues. The ability of trucking company to make timely delivery in this industry is the corner stone of the customer service and this is what industry customers want.\nSafe and secure transportation is very important, no one want to get the phone call that the delivery has been lost due to an accident or theft. Trucking companies face a lot of challenges but it is still their mandate that loads are arrived safely. Trucking companies must also understand that the public is watching them, because bad driving have a bad implication for the company image. 24/7 service delivery is the right answer in responding to customer complaints and also giving them the best resolution.\nWork your business copy. Make all of your business communications and business copy adopt a customer-focused tone and outlook. After all, for most businesses customers get the majority of their information about a company from what they read, through a website, print brochures or literature or social media. Make sure your business literature is professional, but that it also keeps your customer in mind.",

      "description": "In Today's era the use of Air Conditioners is almost on rising trend. Because comfortable environment regardless of weather outside is a basic need of every human being.\nIf the air conditioner is installed less than the required capacity, then it will be over burdened and life will also be shortened. On the other hand if air conditioner is more than the required capacity it will be wastage of money.\nIt is also a fact that the exact estimation of air conditioner's capacity in Tons is not known by majority of our users. Even there are very less HVAC technicians who are aware of this knowledge.\nIn this course a simple and easy to understand method will be explained, by which every moderate literate person can estimate the exact requirement of the air conditioners for his room. Because, its the first step towards the creation of the comfortable environment in a room or closed space.\nWhereas, Air Conditioners can fulfill the needs of both residential and commercial purposes.\nBasically Air Conditioner is meant for two types of installations:-\n1. To create a comfortable environment for Human/animals in a closed space.\n2. To create a comfortable environment for the equipment/machinery.\n\n\nFor both purposes air conditioner is required regardless of outside weather. Because an air conditioner can produce heating and cooling in order to meet all weather conditions.\n\n\nThe formulae and the basics of the heat load load estimation have been well explained here.",

The study found that over 2/3rds of the participants were unsure or didn’t believe they could achieve their goals, and over a 1/4 either stopped or were unclear how to continue.\nThe pandemic created a reset. The New Normal requires a new structure for setting goals. People need to be able to make the purposeful connections between goal setting and goal achieving. Change is a part of life and from all accounts, this will not be the last crisis event.\nIt is not an option anymore. People need to replace smart goals with empowered goal setting and achieving.

Flight dispatchers, pilots, operations controllers, network planners and wide variety of other aviation specialists rely on it to ensure that decisions are made based on accurate, standardized, and legally valid information. Yet, for many professionals, the AIP remains a dense document, often consulted only in parts. This first of its kind course is designed to change that.\nThrough a structured and practical approach, participants of the course will gain full proficiency in navigating, interpreting, and applying the AIP in daily operations. The training covers each of its three major sections: GEN (General), ENR (En-route), and AD (Aerodromes), explaining not only what information is contained within each part, but also how to extract and apply it to real-world tasks. Students will learn how to:\n· Navigate through AIP structure and contents.\n· Understand national regulations, services, and charges (GEN).\n· Analyze and apply en-route rules, airspace structures, and ATS routes (ENR).\n· Interpret aerodrome data, procedures, and charts with confidence (AD).\n· Distinguish between AIP, NOTAMs, Supplements, and Amendments.\n· Apply AIP knowledge in mission preparation and execution, flight planning, operational decision-making and other tasks.\nBy the end of the course, participants will not only be able to use the AIP effectively but will also develop the professional mindset of an aviation information expert. This mastery will enhance their efficiency in operations, reduce risks, and provide a competitive edge in careers ranging from airline operations and dispatch to flight deck and network management.\nIn short: mastering the AIP means mastering the foundation of safe and efficient aviation!",

      "description": "Are you working in a hazardous industry such as oil and gas industry, pharma or chemical plant industry?? Do you want to minimize risk and improve your process safety management? Then Hazard and Operability Analysis, or HAZOP, is exactly what you need!\nWhat is HAZOP, you ask? HAZOP is a risk management and assessment tool that is widely used across various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, petrochemicals, and more. It helps industries identify potential hazards that can arise during system operations.\nOver the years, HAZOP has become one of the most reliable options for risk assessment in these industries.\nComing back to its history, HAZOP was first introduced in the 1960s to analyze chemical processes. Since then, it has been upgraded several times to meet the necessary standards for different sectors.\nTalking about standards, did you know that HAZOP comes under IEC 61882:2016? This implies that HAZOP follows strict guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of employees involved in system operations.\nThe HAZOP study consists of four phases that include initiation, preparation, execution, and completion. Each phase is designed to help you identify potential hazards in your process along with relevant details when analyzed correctly.\nOne of HAZOP's most vital elements is its use of guide words. These are words that help you in generating deviations from norms by thinking of the alternatives. Sounds interesting, right?\nFinally, by joining our course, you will learn how to create a HAZOP document from scratch. Our experts are here to guide you through every step of the way and provide you with the best learning experience possible.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Sign up for our HAZOP course today and stay ahead of the curve in ensuring the safety of your employees and process. Let's ensure a safer work environment for all.",

      "description": "This course is initially built around a carefully selected set of puzzles from Martin Gardner’s My Best Mathematical and Logic Puzzles. The problems are presented with clear, step-by-step reasoning, diagrams, and quizzes to challenge and engage you.\nBut this is far more than a puzzle course. Through these problems, and especially in later sections, we reflect on the very structure of logical thinking, when intuition fails, how formal reasoning helps, and how paradoxes expose the limits of thought. These discussions naturally lead to Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, inspired in part by the works of Torkel Franzén, Raymond Smullyan, and sections on Gödel from Ananyo Bhattacharya’s The Man from the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann.\nRather than covering logic in a purely symbolic or formal way, this course takes you on a journey guided by intuition, sometimes moving to higher levels of abstraction. Some puzzles are more accessible, while others are more subtle, but the main objective is to show different facets of reasoning (from intuitive reasoning to more rigorous reasoning in some cases), and from mathematics to philosophy, artificial intelligence, and decision-making.\nAlong the way, you will discover how understanding the limits of logic can help you evaluate information, avoid common reasoning traps, and even see where advanced AI systems like ChatGPT can make mistakes.\nSome sections are academic in nature, but others provide practical insights useful for professionals and leaders who want to think clearly, solve problems under uncertainty, and make smarter decisions. Although the course does not focus explicitly on business examples, it teaches transferable thinking skills directly applicable in professional contexts, which is why I chose the Business category. However, the course benefits anyone seeking to sharpen logical thinking and decision-making, regardless of their professional background\nIn this course, you will explore classic logic and probability puzzles, including the Prisoner’s Dilemma and Monty Hall scenarios, to strengthen your decision-making under uncertainty, weigh risks effectively, and anticipate outcomes in both personal and professional contexts.\nTopics include:\nLogic puzzles, probability challenges, and elements of game theory\nGödel’s completeness vs. incompleteness theorems explained clearly (with varying levels of abstraction and from different perspectives)\nLinks between logic, quantum systems, psychology, AI, and human intelligence\nHow intelligence, health, and compromise influence clear thinking\nPractical perspectives for viewing life events and learning from them\nWho this course is for:\nProfessionals and leaders seeking sharper decision-making skills and structured reasoning (specific lessons will be especially relevant).\nStudents of mathematics, computer science, or engineering who want to explore logic beyond the classroom.\nLifelong learners curious about puzzles, probability, and how formal reasoning applies to real life.\nAI and tech enthusiasts who want to see where artificial intelligence still makes logical mistakes.\nAnyone preparing for competitive exams, IQ tests, or interviews requiring strong logical thinking.\nThinkers, strategists, and problem-solvers who enjoy connecting abstract theory (like Gödel’s theorems) to practical insights.",

However, a Harvard Business Review study revealed that the unsuccessful companies are the ones who did not manage the scarce time, talent and energy of their workforces before Covid-19.\n\n\nWith all of the resources, tactics and tools online dedicated to time management, why are there so many people who struggle in this area? In this course, I personally train you to use my proprietary Empowerment Coaching Models so that you can empower yourself and/or clients to manage their time so that, regardless of what is happening, they can be successful.\n\n\nTime Management Life Coach Certification Training Content Overview\nWith almost 9+ hours of video tutorials, 158+ downloadable resources ready to use, hands-on practice assignments, interactive learning and Q & A, this continually updated 2-Level Certification Course keeps you in-the-know. Let's break it down for you:\n\n\nFirst 3 Sections: The first 3 sections of your Life Coach Training are dedicated to teaching you the Time Management 3 session interactive online Group Coaching Program. You are given step-by-step instruction designed to improve your proficiency using the latest technology as well as the how-to insight for delivering the professional Time Management Program. You walk away with done-for-you PDF documents as well as links to interactive online resources that you use during the session saving you time and money.\n\n\nNext 3 Sections: After you finish learning about the group coaching, the next 3 sections of your Life Coach Training focus on the essentials of Time Management Psychology and understanding people. I created frameworks for you to use that increase your competency during a coaching session. These help you understand at a deeper level why people struggle to manage time and the underlying patterns that stop them from being productive. You watch a client re-enactment to assess your own approach and with what you discover, adjust as needed before coaching real clients.\n\n\nNext 7 Sections: Now you are ready to coach people individually! The next 7 sections of your Time Management Life Coach Training focus on the individual coaching sessions in the 6 life areas. The sessions are mapped-out, timed-out, done-for-you Time Management Life Coach sessions complete with coaching questions, empowered planning techniques resources, activities, exercises, and insight. You have time to practice and implement what you learn.\n\n\nFinal Sections: The final sections are dedicated to your Time Management Life Coach Career, Practice or Business. You are given marketing strategies to fill your practice plus the exact structure to enroll clients. As a bonus, you receive ongoing personal and professional development.\n\n\n2 LEVELS OF CERTIFICATION: Students and Graduates of Empowerment Coach Academy on Udemy benefit from the E.C.A 2 Levels of Certification at no extra cost.

      "description": "Fire resistance of building structure« means the ability of the structure exposed to fire the appropriate time maintaining its strength. To recognize the precise value of the duration in which the construction retains its capacity, is crucial for fire-resistant design. Fire analysis calculation takes into account the actual technical state of construction material exposed to thermal impact or fire load and provide you with the critical temperature, e.g. the temperature to which the structure maintains its capacity or advice you of the optimal fire protection of the structural elements.\nWhy must we learn Fire Analysis?\nBecause we do not want that we have fire protection, which is oversized and as well uneconomical. On the other hand we do not want that the construction is in fire risk and does not allow a safe evacuation, as well as fire extinguishing and rescue.\nCourse Structure\nIn this course, I will present a thorough overview of structural fire analysis according to nominal temperature-time curves according to Eurocodes.\nWe will learn the following topics:\n- What is thermal action?\n- How to calculate temperature of protected and unprotected steel sections\n- How to create load combinations for the fire limit states\n- How to calculate fire resistance of structural members and their critical temperature\n- Fire protection systems for steel structures\nAll chapters will also provide you with worked examples which will cover theoretical part presented. At the end you will be presented a calculation of critical temperature and required fire protection for typical structural elements of real structure.\nI will provide you with an easy-to-follow material explanation, each section is clearly demonstrated in the presentation and covered with worked examples.",

I want you to benefit as well!\nHere are just a few of the reviews people, just like you, have shared about their experience before, during and/or after learning in the Self-Empowerment Life Coach Training Course.

It's 100% practical and this is exactly what I've been looking for”\n\n\nSelf-Empowerment Life Coach Training Real-World Application\nIf you struggle to achieve goals, you might be using an outdated method that is creating internal resistance. Like most people, you’ve been told that in order to achieve goals you must be self-disciplined. Yet this approach tends to be punitive and can sometimes lead people to give up on their dreams. Self-Discipline is old-school and for those who are serious about success in the New Normal, Self-Empowerment is the solution.\n\n\n· Resilience is needed now more than ever. Imagine that you’ve been selected to virtually coach a global team who have been side-lined by the pandemic and are having a challenging time achieving their targets.\n· This is the opportunity you have been waiting for but the company wants you to start tomorrow.

This report also discussed the need for ongoing wellness to provide people with a way to uniquely adapt to the ever-changing landscape that continually presents itself.\n\n\n· Self-Empowerment is the soft skill that will make the difference. In this course, I personally train you to use my proprietary Empowerment Coaching Models so that you understand the why and the how. Armed with this important insight, you can empower yourself and/or clients to learn these self-empowerment skills so that they can use change as a catalyst for growth and development as opposed to a reason to quit.\n\n\nSelf-Empowerment Life Coach Training Certification Course Content Overview\nWith 10+ hours of video tutorials, 165+ downloadable resources ready to use, hands-on practice assignments, interactive learning and Q & A, this continually updated 2-Level Certification Course keeps you in-the-know. Let's break it down for you:\n\n\n· First 3 Sections: The first 3 sections of your Life Coach Training are dedicated to teaching you the Self-Empowerment 3 session interactive online Group Coaching Program. You are given step-by-step instruction designed to improve your proficiency using the latest technology as well as the how-to insight for delivering the professional Self-Empowerment Program. You walk away with done-for-you PDF documents as well as links to interactive online resources that you use during the session saving you time and money.\n\n\n· Next 3 Sections: After you finish learning about the group coaching, the next 3 sections of your Life Coach Training focus on the essentials of Self-Empowerment Psychology and understanding people. I created frameworks for you to use that increase your competency during a coaching session. These help you understand at a deeper level why people struggle and the underlying self-discipline patterns that stop them from being successful. You watch a client re-enactment to assess your own approach and with what you discover, adjust as needed before coaching real clients.\n\n\n· Next 7 Sections: Now you are ready to coach people individually! The next 7 sections of your Self-Empowerment Life Coach Training focus on the individual coaching sessions in the 6 life areas.

      "description": "Food safety refers to the handling, preparation, and storage of food in a manner that prevents foodborne illness or food poisoning. It involves taking steps to prevent contamination of food with harmful bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens that can cause illness. Food safety also includes ensuring that food is stored at the correct temperatures, cooked properly, and served in a safe manner. Food safety is important to protect public health and prevent the spread of foodborne diseases.\nFood safety issues are as old as mankind and since time immemorial humans have developed strategies to ensure that the food they eat does not harm them. To produce food with any new technology, there must be appropriate safeguards to protect human and animal health.\nWelcome to food safety and sanitation. In this fun and animated course you will learn about food borne illness, how to prevent it and how to train employees in food sanitation. It is imperative that everyone in your organization from the owner, to the manager to all your employees learn the basic food safety practices for preparing and serving food. Do not assume people understand these rules or how to apply them. It is your job to protect customer health, improve employee performance and preserve your business reputation. Most people like myself learn these essential food safety practices in culinary school but some do not. It is your job to understand, identify and create a culture of food safety.\nThe concepts covered:\n• The Importance of Food Safety\n• HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points)\n• Receiving and Storing Food\n• Time and Temperature Control\n• Preventing Cross-Contamination\n• Safe Food Preparation\n• Methods of Thawing, Cooking, Cooling and Reheating Food\n• Cleaning and Sanitizing\n• Good Personal Hygiene\n• Food Safety Regulations\n• And much, much more . . .\nWho this course is for:\nThis food safety and sanitation course is designed to create a safe environment for your customers, your fellow employees and yourself.\nMany city, county or state regulations require you to pass an exam accredited under the Conference for Food Protection (CFP) Food Protection Manager Certification Program Standards.",

      "description": "The course is broken into 10 sections. The objective of the course is to explain what is the standard requirement for medical device design and development control. What does the medical device designer needs to do in order to be be compliant to design and therefore get approval from a regulatory authority to be able to sell the device on the market place.\nIt follows sections 7.3 of the ISO 13485 standard for design and development control of a medical device. It also references MDR 2017/745 and CFR 820.30. It will explain what needs to be done gain approval in the US, EU and globally.\nIn the introduction I will explain the famous Waterfall design diagram and I validate this explanation in the recap lecture.\nI have attached resources such as quizzes, standards, regulations, guide lines, templates and case studies.\nIn Section 1: General/Design & Development planning.\nIn this section we will examine section 7.3.1 & 7.3.2 of the standard which explains that design and development needs to be planned and this planning process must be documented.\nTo give context to the design and development process and to help to understand it better we will look at an example of a medical device which is a stent. We will use this example throughout the design process to illustrate better understanding.\nSection 2: User need/Intended Purpose.\nIn Section two we will understand what is meant by “Intended Purpose” what do we want the medical device to do. What disease is it going to treat.\nOnce we have defined the intended purpose, we need to understand what the user needs are and where do they come from. This can come from a lot of sources, and we will explain that. One main point here is stakeholders have different opinions on what they need the device to do.\nSection 3 Design & Development Inputs.\nWe need to understand how the User needs which is what the user wants. We need to learn how to translate this into a how.\nWith this we will look at how important traceability is. Each step in the process is linked and I will explain this via the Input Output Verification Validation matrix. IOVV.\nWe will understand how risk analysis must be used to identify any risks which will lead to amendments in the design.\nSection 4: Design & Development Outputs.\nIn this section design outputs are explained. In my simple definition the design outputs are the specification of the product.\nI will explain the design outputs must satisfy the design inputs.\nSection 5: Design & Development Review.\nWe will understand that at each stage of the design and development process there should be a review of the design process. It needs to be documented and a person in authority within the organization must sign off on the review to allow it to go to the next stage.\nSection 6: Design & Development Verification\nWe will understand what the ISO 13485 standards says about Design and Development Verification. Which is in section 7.3.6 of the standard.\nWe will understand what verification is. You are ensuring that the specification of the device is correct.\nI will explain what verification tests are by way of illustration with examples.\nSection 7 Design and Development Validation\nI will explain what the standard says about validation.\nI will explain what it is in simple terms. Is the device functioning as we intend it.\nSection 8 Design and Development Transfer:\nWhat is meant by design transfer. The product must eventually be made and sold in the marketplace. I will explain how this is going to be done.\nI will explain in a case study how important design transfer is.\nSection 9 Design and Development changes\nDesign Changes need to be controlled. I will explain how this needs to be done.\nI will discuss how important it is to control these changes via a case study.\nSection 10 Design and development Technical files.\nWe need to understand that the whole design control process needs to be documented, recorded and stored.\nWe will look at Design History File, Device Master Record, Device History Record which is associated with the US regulation and the Technical documentation which is associated with the European Union Regulation.",

      "description": "Welcome to our Training which explains you Most important Steps How To Obtain you Trucking Authority :\n\n\nFirst of all, let's figure out some details\nWHAT IS TRUCKING AUTHORITY?\nYou probably heard about a motor carrier operating authority together with many other terms like trucking authority, MC, DOT authority, MC Number, and USDOT Number. But all of these terms refers to the same thing.\nABOUT OPERATING AUTHORITY\nOperating authority is a motor carrier's right to operate a commercial motor vehicle to transport goods or passengers and it's required for most carriers in interstate commerce. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulates the trucking industry and grants active operating authority by issuing MC and USDOT Numbers. These numbers serve as unique identifiers for trucking companies and help the FMCSA with conducting inspections, monitoring safety scores, maintaining compliance reviews, etc.\nHERE IS A STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTION HOW TO OBTAIN OPERATING AUTHORITY\nCREATE YOUR COMPANY\nYou need to form your company, get an EIN number, and other business basics before you start filing paperwork. The prerequisites for your new business will differ depending on your state and city.\nAPPLY TO THE FMCSA FOR AUTHORITY\nYou'll use the Unified Registration System, which is a single online registration system that replaces multiple outdated forms. Each sort of authority has a $300 filing fee. It's a lengthy procedure, so be sure you have all of the necessary information before beginning. Remember to check if you require intrastate authority in your own state as well.\nAPPLY FOR INSURANCE\nObtaining trucking insurance is a significant barrier for new trucking companies to overcome, so do your research. Without proof of insurance, your authority will not be deemed \"active authority.\" Insurance premiums might be extremely costly. To discover the best insurance rates, fill out the applications completely and speak with the insurance firms about your organization and plans.\nGET THE UCR REGISTRATION\nThe Unified Carrier Registration system (UCR) is a funding mechanism that allows states to enforce motor carrier safety requirements. The UCR imposes fees according on the size of the fleet and must be renewed every year.\nGET THE IRP REGISTRATION\nThe International Registration Plan (IRP) is a registration reciprocity agreement between the US, Washington, D.C., and Canadian provinces that allows interstate carriers to pay fees depending on their annual miles in participating jurisdictions.\nGET THE IFTA REGISTRATION\nInterstate motor carriers must file IFTA (International Gasoline Tax Agreement) taxes on fuel purchases on a quarterly basis through the taxing authority of the carrier's base state.\nTAX ON THE USE OF HEAVY VEHICLES (HVUT)\nYou must file a Heavy Vehicle Use Tax return, or form 2290, with the IRS each year if you possess a vehicle with a gross weight of 55,000 pounds or more. In addition, four states impose additional weight distance charges on hauling inside their borders. You'll also need to complete registrations in Kentucky, New Mexico, New York, and Oregon if you plan to haul routinely through those states.",

      "description": "Pipeline Pigging refers to the practice of using devices or implements known as 'pigs' to perform various cleaning, clearing, maintenance, inspection, dimensioning, process and pipeline testing operations on new and existing pipelines. For existing operational pipelines pigging is normally performed without stopping the flow of the product in the pipeline. The 'pigs' can be of differing materials and configurations such Polyurethane Open Cell Foam, Cast Polyurethane and Rubber.\nThere are some hypotheses for why the process is called 'pipeline pigging', though none have been confirmed. One theory states that in the past, a leather-bound tool was sent through the pipeline, making the sound of a squealing pig as it passed through. Another theory is that after opening a pig trap, the tool lies in a pile of mud, in the same way a pig does.\nPipeline operators, service providers, and the regulatory community continually strive to improve the safety and\nintegrity of gas and liquid pipelines. In-line inspection of pipelines is a key technology utilized by the industry to help\nmaintain systems safety and integrity. In-line Inspection (ILI) really began in the 1960s with the introduction of a tool for corrosion measurement based on magnetic-flux-leakage technology. Today there are over 30 different tools in use by more than a dozen companies providing ILI services.",

I worked for retailers in home improvements, pharmaceuticals, vending, kids products, convenience stores, electronics, wood products, and many more so what you will see in this course are observations drawn from many industries.  I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are CEOs, Operational  Directors, COOs, Investment Directors, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, Customer Insight Managers, Data Science Managers, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy have already been taken by more than 300 000 students. The course you will take has been taken also by people from EY, McKinsey, PwC, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Dell, Walgreens, and many more as a part of Udemy for Business.\nI teach through cases so most of the lectures are case studies showing some business problems solved in Excel. There will be also an overview of the main techniques used in optimizing and running retail. To every lecture, you will find attached  (in additional resources) the Excels shown in the lecture so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nRetail has become quite complex and there is a shortage of business analysts and consultants that have a good understanding of how to approach retail. There is a lack of knowledge on how to get a broader view of the retail business and at the same time to be able to go deep into details. Even people working for years in retail have problems with seeing the whole picture and being able to find potential savings. Therefore, I have decided to create a course that will bridge this gap. This course will transform you into a retail expert in a relatively short time and help you see all the elements of the business. The approach you will see in this course was tested on humans and I have seen tremendous positive results. Thanks to this course you will become a priceless member of any team that is doing strategic and operational improvements projects in retail. It will help you land a job not only with retailers but also with consulting firms, and private equities investing in retail.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to build or to find improvements in retail you should master the techniques shown in this course. That is why I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or business analysts that have to advise their customers but also to retail managers, and analysts already working in retail or in PE.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you find and analyze production. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to analyze Retailer and find low-hanging fruits\nHow to build the business model of the Retailer in Excel in order to see the big picture and see how specific KPIs impact the profit\nHow to optimize Retailers' operations\nHow to behave in a multichannel surrounding (when you have also e-commerce operations)\nHow to expand your business into new categories and markets\nHow to analyze in-store engagements\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on retail\nBasic analyses that you should perform. In the second section, I will discuss the basic type of analysis that you can use to better understand the business that you work for. Here you will find the potential low-hanging fruits\nRetail Business Model. As a business analyst or consultant, you may be asked to model the whole business in Excel. I will show you in this section how to do it and you will get ready-made models. I will also show you how to model e-commerce.\nOptimization of in-store processes – case study. In section 4 I show you how to optimize processes in the store. I will use here a real case of a company from the home improvement / DIY sector. You will get also the model we used to calculate costs\nBusiness Hacks used by Retailers. It is always good to look at what others are doing. Here I will show you some hacks used by other retailers\nExpansion. At some point, you will start considering expansion. I will show you in this section how you can expand your retail      business and how to decide what to do\nMultichannel. As e-commerce has been a significant distribution channel traditional retailers were forced to transform into multichannel players (operating both in traditional stores, the offline world as well as online business) Here I will show you the main challenges and how to tackle them\nIn-store engagement and productivity analysis. If you have data on the customer behavior in the store you can get nice insight and craft a better strategy to grow your business. Here I will show you examples of such analyses that we did with Retailnext – a system to collect data on customer behavior in the store.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources:\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading",

The course structure is started from the scratch i.e. historical background of electrical and internal combustion engine technology until today's scenario.\nThomas Davenport is usually credited with building the first practical one-person “electric vehicle” in 1834, followed by a two-person version in 1847. The first EV to emerge, which resembled what might be called today a “car,” appeared in 1851 and traveled at a pace of approximately 20 mph (32 km/h).\nDecades later, the first mass-manufactured electric cars hit the marketplace with the development of the Edison Cell.\nThe Edison Cell had greater storage capacity than the batteries used in early EVs and prototypes.\nBy the 1900s, EVs had captured a notable share of the leisure car market. Among the 4200 automobiles sold in the United States in 1900, 38% were electric and only 22% were gasoline, while another 40% were still steam driven (Electric Vehicles, 2008).\nIn 1872, the American inventor, George Brayton, manufactured “Brayton’s Ready Motor”; he used constant pressure combustion and liquid fuel to produce what is often tagged as the irst “internal combustion engine” (ICE).\nThis Course has following outlines:-\n\n\nIntroduction to instructors and the Course outlines.\nHistorical Backgrounds of Electrical Vehicles.\nHistorical Evolution of Electric Vehicles.\nOperational Aspects of Electric Vehicles.\nBatteries in Electric Vehicles.\nCharging System in Electric Vehicles.\nConclusion.\nTesting & Certifications Policies.\nElectromagnetic Testing\nWe hope this course on Electric Vehicle Technology Complete Course will be helpful for all.

This fact results in some people having a high self-esteem and others a low self-esteem.\n\n\nStatistics about the recent pandemic and its negative impact on mental health brought these differences to light. The higher the self-esteem, the more a person was agile and adaptable to the unexpected outcomes created by the crisis. Having a strong and resilient self-esteem is a must-have character trait required for success in the New Normal.\n\n\nRegardless of the nurturing or lack of nurturing people received growing up, an empowered self-esteem can be unlocked. In this course, I personally train you to use my proprietary Empowerment Coaching Models so that you can guide your clients to discover their untapped potential and empowered Self-Esteem.\n\n\nSelf-Esteem Life Coach Training Certification Course Content Overview\nWith over 10+ hours of video tutorials, 146+ downloadable resources ready to use, hands-on practice assignments, interactive learning and Q & A, this continually updated 2-Level Certification Course keeps you in-the-know. Let's break it down for you:\n\n\nFirst 3 Sections: The first 3 sections of your Life Coach Training are dedicated to teaching you the Self-Esteem 3 session interactive online Group Coaching Program.

I created frameworks for you to use that increase your competency during a coaching session.  These help you understand at a deeper level why people have a low self-esteem and how this disposition stops them from being successful. You watch a client re-enactment to assess your own approach and with what you discover, adjust as needed before coaching real clients.\n\n\nNext 7 Sections: Now you are ready to coach people individually! The next 7 sections of your Self-Esteem Life Coach Training focus on the individual coaching sessions in the 6 life areas. The sessions are mapped-out, timed-out, done-for-you Self-Esteem Life Coach sessions complete with coaching questions, Neuro Linguistic Programming resources, activities, exercises, and insight.

There is a root folder for each section, within which, there are subfolders named Examples. Each example is provided in .bkp Aspen Plus format and .txt format. The .bkp files are set up as input files to view details and may be executed. The .txt files are solutions and may be viewed with Notepad. We recommend that while reading the text, Aspen Plus be used simultaneously to execute and review each example.\nLastly, we have made an effort to provide the describing equations of most of the models referred to in this online course and if not possible, because of the proprietary nature of the software, we have described the functionality. Please keep in mind that Aspen Plus is a proprietary software and the source code and implementation details are not available. Additionally, there are frequently several ways to solve the equations that describe the blocks, and there is no way to ascertain these details since Aspen Technology does not provide them.\n---\nSOFTWARE & HARDWARE :\nThe Aspen Plus software, like most other software, is being developed on a continuous basis and new versions are released frequently. This online course covers Aspen Plus version 11, which is the most recent version at the moment we recorded this video. Please keep in mind that this online course covers the fundamental features of Aspen Plus which do not change from version to version. The course covers the use of Aspen Plus on computers that use the Windows operating system. We assume that Aspen Plus is installed on your computer and that you have basic knowledge of operating the computer. If you are new to Aspen Plus and have little or no experience in chemical engineering simulation, then you have come to the right place.",

This certification is based on 5 pillars contained in the SMRP Book of Knowledge in a 110-question exam with a time of 2.5 hours (150 minutes) closed book, usually administered at one of the Pearson Vue centers around the world.\n\n\nAlthough there are preparation courses, I concluded that they were very expensive and that the average course time was not enough to address all the content satisfactorily. For this reason, I decided to prepare myself for this certification. To do this, I studied the material suggested by SMRP Book of Knowledge, I looked for videos, books and standard questions that would allow me to have a clearer vision of the focus of the exam.\n\n\nI decided that once I obtained certification, I would dedicate myself to condensing the useful material into a test simulator, with questions similar to the real exam.\n\n\nIn this way, the \"course\" has 2 diagnostic tests of 10 questions and 1 simulation exam (110 questions) very similar to the real certification. In all cases, the questions have their respective explanation, and I recommend that it be reviewed and also seen as a study tool and not just a test.\n\n\nI hope the simulator helps you achieve your goals, a warm hug!",

      "description": "• Chemical treatment involves the planned addition of a site-specific combination of chemicals. The treatment may include chemicals designed to inhibit corrosion, control microbial activity (biocide), Oxygen scavenge ,hydrogen sulfied scavenge , control scaling(scale inhibitor), and/or oil Demulsifier,The performance of chemical treatment programs must be verified. The two most common application methods used for chemical treatments are continuous injection and batch treatment.\n• Corrosion inhibitors are substances that are added to a pipeline to reduce the corrosion rate).\n• Biocides are used to mitigate various microbiological problems.\n• Scavengers are used to react with a particular potentially corrosive species making it unavailable to participate in corrosion reactions. The two most commonly used scavengers in the oil and gas industry are oxygen and H2S scavengers.\n• Scaling occurs when water constituents combine to form insoluble compounds which are then deposited on the pipe wall. Typical scales include calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, and barium sulfate and scale inhibitor prevent this formation to occurs\n• Dehydration chemicals, or demulsifiers, are chemical compounds that are widely used to destabilize, and assist in coalescence of, crude-oil emulsions.\n• Treatment chemicals are injected continuously when a specified concentration of chemical is desired in the fluids being transported. Continuous injection requires the installation of chemical pumps and other equipment including a chemical holding tank, a control unit, control interface, and potentially a mixer and flow meter.\n• Chemical injection can be performed through an open tube or quill or using an atomizing nozzle. Atomizing nozzles are used to disperse a chemical into the gas phase. Where top-of-line corrosion is occurring, it may be necessary to inject the treatment chemical into the gas phase. If chemicals are added directly to the line (i.e., not using a tube or quill), corrosion may occur at the site of chemical injection. The materials within the injection system should be compatible with the product (e.g., storage tanks, elastomers, tubing, etc.) The most effective position for chemical injection is the center of the pipe or vessel.\n• Batch treatments are designed to lay down an inhibition film to provide protection between treatments. Chemicals are typically pumped into the pipeline at a high concentration (generally, tens of thousands of parts per million) for a brief period of time.",

      "description": "One of the most important condition monitoring tool for the rotary machines is the vibration analysis. This is equally true for the pumps and pumping systems. The pumps exhibit signature vibration signals related to hydraulic turbulence, cavitation in addition to sub-synchronous vibrations, synchronous vibrations, and super-synchronous vibrations related to vane-pass frequencies, and other vibration exciting phenomenon. Many of these vibration frequencies are common for other rotary machines including compressors, turbines etc., and therefore are of a much larger interest in general industry.\nThis course “Basics of Vibrations and vibration measurement (Cat 1)” comprises of all topics included in Cat 1 vibration analyst course as recommended by ISO 18436-2.\nThis course has 5 sections namely - Vibration principles, Data acquisition, Signal processing, Equipment knowledge, and Acceptance testing. In these sections the basic motion of vibration and related terms and terminology, the vibration measurement instruments and transducers, the Time Waveform signals, the Frequency Response FFT spectrum and Shaft Orbit Analysis, the basic knowledge of rotary equipment used in the industry and finally an introduction to ISO vibration testing and acceptance standards for different types of machines are covered. These concepts provide a sound basis to understand the fundamental of vibrations. Therefore, this course is a precursor to the very detailed courses on vibrations on pumps and pumping systems, namely – “Vibration measurement and acceptance criteria as per API 610, 12th edition” and “Vibration measurement and acceptance criteria a per ISO 9906 and HI 9.6.4 standards” already available on this website.\nFor advanced understanding of vibration measurement and vibration analysis Cat II and Cat III vibration analyst programs are recommended.",

We will look at how they are organised, what kind of plans need to be included, what is shown on plans, look at symbols & abbreviations, and finish off with an exercise.\nWe will be using plans from an Architectural firm here in New Zealand, which will also be applicable to my US & UK audiences due to the layouts & formats being internationally the same.\nThe course also covers the basics of scaling. As you can appreciate, construction projects are too large to be drawn to a 1:1 scale, thus, we need to use scales to reduce the size onto paper that is manageable for construction teams. We will take a look at both the imperial and metric architect’s scale due to countries using either, or, or even both unit systems, thus catering for all.\nIncluded within the course are resources and exercises to reinforce your learning as you progress.\nIf you are new to the construction industry, or building your first home, and want to learn how to read plans, then this course is for you.\nSo that said, enrol now and learn how to read residential construction plans.",

Standard operating procedure should be followed the same way every time to guarantee that the organization remains consistent and in compliance with industry regulations and business standards. SOPs provide the policies, processes and standards needed for an organization to succeed. They reduce errors increase efficiency and enhance profitability. They also create a safe work environment and produce guidelines for how to resolve issues and overcome obstacles. An effective standard operating procedure explains the steps taken to complete a task and informs the employee of any risk associated with the process. The instructions should be brief and easy to understand with a focus on how things should be done rather than what needs to be done. Before writing an SOP, the author should perform a risk assessment of all the steps in the procedure.\nThe assessment should identify any obstacles that might arise during the process and any risk associated with the obstacles. To decide which procedure would benefit from an OSP organizations should make a list of all their business processes. Managers should discuss employees day-to-day responsibilities and tasks to ensure all procedures are accounted for. Any routine task that multiple employees handle should be considered for SOP creation.",

      "description": "Waste management or waste disposal includes the processes and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes the collection, transport, treatment, and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management processes and waste-related laws, technologies and economics mechanisms. Waste can be solid, liquid, or gases and each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste management deals with types of waste including industrial, biological, household, municipal, organic, biomedical, radioactive wastes. proper management of waste is important for building sustainable and liveable cities but it remains a challenge for many developing countries and cities. Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste collection system.\nThe segregation of waste is very important: this is the separation of wet and dry waste. The purpose is to recycle dry waste easily and to use wet waste as  compost. When segregating waste, the amount of waste that gets landfilled reduces considerably, resulting in lower levels of air and water pollution. Importantly waste segregation should be based on the type of waste and the most appropriate treatment and disposal. There are multiple facets of waste management that all come with hazards, both for those around the disposal site and those who work within waste management.",

Identify and assess the information security risks facing those parts of the organization that are declared in scope for your ISMS,\n3. Systematically check and record the status of your security risks and controls,\n4.Once your ISMS is operating normally, the metrics are looking good and you have amassed sufficient evidence , it can be formally audited for compliance with '27001 by an accredited certification body.\nWhere does ISO 27001 fit in?\nISO 27001 is the international standard that provides the specification for a best-practice ISMS and covers the compliance requirements.\nWhile ISO 27001 offers the specification, ISO 27002 provides the code of conduct – guidance and recommended best practices that can be used to enforce the specification.\n\n\nBenefits of an ISMS\nAn ISO 27001-compliant ISMS does more than simply help you comply with laws and win business. It a can also:\nRespond to evolving security threats: Constantly adapting to changes both in the environment and inside the organisation, an ISMS reduces the threat of continually evolving risks.\nImprove company culture: An ISMS’s holistic approach covers the whole organisation, not just IT. This enables employees to readily understand risks and embrace security controls as part of their everyday working practices.\nSecure your information in all its forms: An ISMS helps protect all forms of information, whether digital, paper-based or in the Cloud.\nIncrease your attack resilience: Implementing and maintaining an ISMS will significantly increase your organisation’s resilience to cyber attacks.\nManage all your information in one place: An ISMS provides a central framework for keeping your organisation’s information safe and managing it all in one place.\nReduce costs associated with information security: Thanks to the risk assessment and analysis approach of an ISMS, organisations can reduce costs spent on indiscriminately adding layers of defensive technology that might not work.\nProtect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of your data: An ISMS offers a set of policies, procedures, technical and physical controls to protect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of your information.",

      "description": "If you want to learn about oil drilling as a beginner, then check out this book!\nHow to drill an oil and gas well from A to Z, or in a shorter form from 1 to 7.\nThe first step, is to determine what type of rock we will be drilling. The second step is to refine this preliminary well configuration by determining the exact dimensions required of casing strings. Afterwards, the third stage is to select the appropriate bits, bottom hole assembly (BHA) and drillstring for each hole section.\nThe fourth step is a big one, selecting a rig, which goes hand in hand with the abovementioned characteristics of drilling a well. Eventually, we get a shortlist and go to the market to close the best fit for purpose rig contract. The fifth step is the huge logistics framework that surrounds a drilling operation to ensure it goes smoothly and most important of all, for safety to prevail. The sixth step, is to plug and abandon the well, gladly, strict regulations have been put in place to ensure industry best practices are always followed.\nLast but not least, the seventh step encompasses all of the previous six, which is to assess and mitigate the environmental impact of all the operations. Safety is, from the beginning until the end of oil and gas drilling, the n.1 priority.\nAbout the Expert\nI am a Mechanical & Petroleum Engineer (dual masters) with five years of work experience, always representing the same O&G company and doing so in four different countries: Portugal, Namibia, Morocco and Brazil. I am fluent in four languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish and French.\nThe international experience during my childhood where I lived in Italy, Brazil and Argentina (other than Portugal) aided me in thinking out of the box. The two exchange programs I participated in Sweden and Argentina reinforced this situation and helped me understand that an international environment incorporated with strong teamwork is definitely the key to success.\nTravelling is one of my big passions, I have travelled a lot during my childhood and I have travelled a lot for my job. Luckily, I also have a competition with my wife, which is to visit all the countries in the world, we are passed the sixty countries and we want to reach the seventy countries mark ASAP!",

The research was focused on students’ attitudes about failure. Many have used the findings, which were compiled over 30 years ago, to discuss advancements in brain research called neurogenesis. However, what is typically missing is the HOW. How does the brain change easily and what techniques will support this change?\n\n\nIn this course, I personally train you to use my proprietary Empowerment Coaching Models so that you understand the how but also the underlying why.

      "description": "Electrical and electronic equipment such as motors, generators, transformers, circuit breakers, fuses, switches, relays, solenoids and resistors produce significant amounts of heat, arcing and sparking during normal and abnormal operation, which could pose a substantial risk of fire or explosion in facilities where chemicals are manufactured, processed or utilized. To minimize the risk of fires or explosions that could result from this arcing, sparking and heat dissipation, it is critically important that electrical/ electronic equipment be designed, tested and labeled as being acceptable for use in the areas in which they are installed. This holds especially true for hazardous (classified) locations, i.e. locations where flammable, combustible or ignitable gases, vapors, liquids, dust, fibers or flyings may be present.\nHazardous area classification is the evaluation and classification of hazardous (classified) locations using scientific and engineering principles, within facilities where chemicals are manufactured, processed or utilized. Hazardous areas are classified solely for the purpose of ensuring the safe and proper specification and installation of electrical/ electronic equipment located within them. In this masterclass, the Hazardous Area Classification is studied from point of view of various standards like IEC, NPFA, CENELEC etc.\nA hazardous area classification is typically shown on plan view drawings of the facility (and sometimes on elevation drawings) that are commonly referred to as area classification drawings/diagrams. Based upon the area classification drawings, electrical/ electronic equipment can be properly specified and installed such that the risk of fires or explosions is greatly reduced. This course shows how to read these diagrams in a very easy way so that an absolute beginner is also able to understand.\nThis course mainly follows IEC 60079 standards and following protection techniques are covered:\n\n\n•IEC/EN 60079-0 - General Requirements\n•IEC/EN 60079-1 - Flameproof Enclosure 'd'\n•IEC/EN 60079-2 - Pressurization 'p'\n•IEC/EN 60079-5 - Powder Filling 'q'\n•IEC/EN 60079-6 - Oil Immersion 'o'\n•IEC/EN 60079-7 - Increased Safety 'e'\n•IEC/EN 60079-11 -Intrinsic Safety 'i'\n•IEC/EN 60079-15 -Electrical Apparatus type 'n'\n•IEC/EN 60079-18 -Encapsulation 'm'\nThis course will definitely help persons working in different domains in following way:\n1. Operation Engineer: Knows the significance and extent of Hazardous Area.\n2. Maintenance Engineer: Which type of equipment to be procured? How to do maintenance?\n3. Safety & PSM: Increase overall know how and will help in Audit and PHA.",

      "description": "Welcome to Workplace Safety OSHA's General Industry Training for Employees and Businesses from LearnSmart.\nIn this OSHA series, you will be introduced to the general safety requirements that any employee should be aware of and provides a comprehensive overview of general workplace safety that companies seek and can require their employees understand and adhere to. These health and safety programs and procedures in this course are derived from federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.\nThis course focuses and aligns closely with OSHAs General Industry Training Requirements, 29 CFR Part 1910\nCourse Breakdown:\nSection 1: In the pre-assessment quiz you'll face questions that test your current workplace knowledge, get to know your strengths and weaknesses.\nSection 2: Gain background information about OSHA and OSHA standards, inspections, citations, and penalties. At the end of this course, you will be able to distinguish between the role of OSHA and the role of the office of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS).\nSection 3: By recognizing and applying the basic values of industrial hygiene to the work environment, the workplace will become healthier and safer. Learn how to identify sources of potential problems, about the different types of hazards, and how to control and respond to those hazards in the workplace.\nSection 4: Whether you are a business owner looking for ways to improve costs and workplace safety, or a worker interested in learning more about how a safety and health program can benefit you.\nSection 5: OSHA Standards for Personal Protective Equipment takes a deeper look at using PPE controls in the workplace. This section describes the two primary means of protecting employees from workplace hazards before considering PPE; explains what should be included in PPE training; lists PPE that may be used for protection; and identifies hazards that are reduced or eliminated by using the appropriate PPE for eye, face, head, hearing, foot, hand and body protection.\nSection 6: A respirator is a device that is intended to protect employees from inhaling dangerous substances, such as chemicals and infection particulates. Respirators are among the most important parts of protective equipment for working in hazardous environments. Identify what respirators are, how respirators function, and what is needed for a respirator to provide protection.\nSection 7: Define terms such as floor opening, standard railing, standard toeboard, floor hole, and wall opening. You will be able to identify safety requirements to help prevent walking and working surface hazards related to general housekeeping floors, walls, open-sided surfaces, stairways, ladders, and scaffolding.\nSection 8: OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) is base on a simple concept - that employees have both a need and a right to know the hazards and identities of the chemicals You are exposed to when working. HCS addresses the issues of evaluating and communicating chemical hazard information to workers. In this section we will be giving the student an in-depth look into hazard communications and how it affects the workplace.\nSection 9: Hazardous Materials focuses on OSHA's requirements for hazardous materials and hazardous waste operations; the requirements for emergency response at uncontrolled hazardous worksites and treatment, storage and disposal facilities; and the steps an employer must take to protect the health and safety of employees in these environments.\nSection 10: The need for BBP training is essential for employees who are constantly at risk of exposure to blood, fluids, or other contaminated materials that are known to cause illnesses, or even death. This training identifies the types of BBPs, BBP exposure, and the proper protection from exposure, how to dispose of contaminated or used materials, and what to do in the event of exposure.\nSection 11: Find and identify the standards that are place in order to prevent these hazards, as well as the primary concerns associated with design and construction, ventilation, ignition sources, and storage. The student will be able to identify boiling points and will be able to explain the degrees in which explosions can occur and how to prevent them.\nSection 12: Employers must train employees about fire hazards that exist in the workplace, how to prevent fires, and what to do in the event one occurs.\nSection 13: Articulate the importance of ergonomics in the workplace. You will be able to define ergonomics and identify risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders, as well as explain the benefits of using a proactive approach to ergonomics in the workplace. The student will be able to discuss the elements of an effective ergonomic process.\nSection 14: Identify the four main types of injuries that may result from electrical contact. The student will be able to describe the three types of electrical hazards that may be encountered, and name warning signs that indicate their existence. You will also be able to identify methods of protection from electrical hazards and safety training requirements for working with electrical equipment.\nSection 15: Gain a thorough understanding of mechanical hazards and the importance of safeguarding machines. You will have learned about different types of guards and devices that will protect them as you work. Employees will understand OSHA standards in regard to machine guarding.\nSection 16: Solve general hazards related to slips, trips, and falls. You will also be able to explain the proper usage of ladders, stairs, ramps, and loading docks, as well as the common hazards and risks associated with each of these, and how to remedy those hazards and risks.\nSection 17: Fall Protection provides you with a look at the work conditions that require the use of fall protection and the available options to protect employees from falls. By taking this section, you will be able to identify fall protection methods available for protecting employees; the basic conditions that trigger the use of fall protection for employees in the general industry; and the importance of good work practices and training.\nSection 18: Locate the minimum requirements for lockout and tagout of energy isolating devices. You will be able to identify employer requirements and responsibilities, device requirements and procedural requirements. The student will also be able to explain the procedures for lockout and tagout, including preparation, procedures involving more than one person, group lockout and tagout, and periodic inspection.\nSection 19: Distinguish why having an emergency action plan is important.

There is a root folder for each section, within which, there are subfolders named Examples. Each example is provided in .bkp Aspen Plus format and .txt format. The .bkp files are set up as input files to view details and may be executed. The .txt files are solutions and may be viewed with Notepad. We recommend that while reading the text, Aspen Plus be used simultaneously to execute and review each example.\nLastly, we have made an effort to provide the describing equations of most of the models referred to in this online course and if not possible, because of the proprietary nature of the software, we have described the functionality. Please keep in mind that Aspen Plus is a proprietary software and the source code and implementation details are not available. Additionally, there are frequently several ways to solve the equations that describe the blocks, and there is no way to ascertain these details since Aspen Technology does not provide them.\n---\nSOFTWARE & HARDWARE :\nThe Aspen Plus software, like most other software, is being developed on a continuous basis and new versions are released frequently. This online course covers Aspen Plus version 11, which is the most recent version at the moment we recorded this video. Please keep in mind that this online course covers the fundamental features of Aspen Plus which do not change from version to version. The course covers the use of Aspen Plus on computers that use the Windows operating system. We assume that Aspen Plus is installed on your computer and that you have basic knowledge of operating the computer. If you are new to Aspen Plus and have little or no experience in chemical engineering simulation, then you have come to the right place.",

The environment is impacted daily by technological challenges and brings rapid change internationally to stay ahead in its game. These pressures have significant effects on the way airports do business not only from a financial perspective but also from an operational standpoint.\n\n\nAirport operations demand the highest standards of safety, reliability, efficiency and comfort. Given a continuously growing demand for air traffic, a high concentration of movements and a limited place available to handle operations, it is required to implement optimized procedures and technologies and a close connection of all stakeholders. For instance: about 90,000 people employed and 140 airlines handled to ensure that up to 90 million passengers are being carried annually at Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nIndividuals who work within the sector are required to know the roles airports play in the economy in order to discover the various customers and partners which gain profitable to the industry.\nThe roles of each individual within the industry are essential to the business as is the set of principles that the sectors operate within.\n\n\nThis course highlights the fundamentals of the operations in the airport environment in order to provide key knowledge concepts to the respective learner.\n\n\nThis course is designed to help persons who are starting a career in airport operations positions or all other aviation personnel who want to get a broader introduction to airport operations.",

      "description": "Safety valves, pressure relief valves and rupture discs should be taken very seriously.\nThey must always accurately respond to system conditions and prevent catastrophic failure when other instruments and control systems fail to adequately control process limits.\nUnfortunately, because of the lack of knowledge and disappearing expertise worldwide, the quality of selection and operation of these pressure relief devices is often insufficient.\nThis possibly jeopardizes the safety of each of us, living or working in the neighborhood of a process plant.\nProper sizing, selection, manufacture, assembly, test, installation and maintenance of a safety valves, a pressure relief valve or a rupture discs are all critical to obtaining maximum protection.\nDesigned around a series of practical examples which we work through to a solution, this valuable course is an essential guide to a complete understanding of construction details and functioning of safety valves, pressure relief valves and rupture discs.\nThis understanding is a pre-requisite for the proper sizing, selection, assembly, test, installation and maintenance of pressure relief valves.\nThe course presents reference data, technical recommendations and field observations based on our many years of experience in sizing, selecting, testing, installing and operating pressure relief devices.\nThe basic formulae and capacity correction factors contained in this course reflect current state-of-the-art pressure relief devices sizing technology.\nTypical valve sizing examples have been included to assist in understanding how specific formulae are applied.\nUseful technical data covering terminology, standards, codes, basic design, sizing and selection information, are presented in an easy to use format.\nReference is made to :\nASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC), Section VIII, Pressure Vessels\nAPI Recommended Practice RP520\nThis course also cautions the piping designer, the process engineer and any user of safety valves, that the performance of a properly sized and selected pressure relief device, can be severely compromised when used in conjunction with improper companion piping or incorrect handling and installation.\nPressure relief device installation guidelines and their rationale, as well as some precautions, are offered to ensure optimum performance and safety.\nNow, while it is obviously impossible to address every installation mistake ever made, we have included a valuable summary of the most frequent installation mistakes encountered in the field.\nIn addition, you will find at the end of each section a technical quiz to help you test your knowledge.\nIf you pass wonderful, if not, you can watch the video lectures again or ask us for help in the Q&A section.\nWe are confident that this valuable course will help you contribute to the safety of your facility, your fellow workers and yourself.\nThank you for your interest in our online courses. Hope to see you there.\nWR Training – Your Partner in Plant Engineering and Reliability\nSpread the wings of your knowledge\n\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY NOTES\n\n\nIt is important to always remember that a safety valve, a pressure relief valve or a rupture disc is a safety device employed to protect pressure vessels or systems from catastrophic failure. With this in mind, the application of pressure relief devices should be assigned only to fully trained personnel and be in strict compliance with rules provided by the governing Codes and Standards\n\n\nPressure relief devices must be sized, selected and installed by those who have complete knowledge of:\nThe pressure relieving requirements of the system to be protected\nThe environmental conditions particular to that installation\n\n\nSafety valves, pressure relief valves and/or rupture discs sizing and selection is the responsibility of:\nThe process engineer\nThe user of the system to be protected\n\n\nSizing and selection of pressure relief devices should not be based on arbitrarily assumed conditions or incomplete information. Merely having a mandatory safety device installation does not make a system safe",

      "description": "This course designed to explain the principles of vibration measurements and acceptable vibration values for rotodynamic pumps measured during factory and on-site inspections based on recommendations of international standards – ISO 10816-7, and ANSI/HI 9.6.4.\nThe guidelines in each standard has a specific scope, that is the ANSI /HI standard covers vibrations on non-rotating parts, while the ISO standard covers vibrations measured on both the rotating and non-rotating parts. Similarly, each standard covers specific industry and applications and thus simultaneously cover a wide range of industries and applications.\nVibration measurement during the factory inspections is of paramount importance in ensuring trouble free operations and reliability of the plant and equipment. Similarly vibration measurement in the field is an essential part of condition monitoring of rotodynamic pumps. Although these standards are dealing with new pumps, the compliance to the permissible vibration limits guarantees good health in operations and this information can be used as a baseline for field monitoring and planning interventions.\nExcessive vibrations in pumps can come from design deficiencies, inadequate quality control during manufacturing, improper testing arrangements - factory and site included, and from faulty installation and operations. This course covers the ground rules for balancing, fits and tolerances, proper testing arrangements and highlight the essentials of correct installation and operations.\nAlthough it is desirable that the participants are familiar with the basics of vibrations and vibration analysis, nonetheless the basic concepts related to vibrations and vibration analysis are covered under a sperate title which is referred to in this course as a pre-requisite.\nI hope that this course will assist the participants in improving their understanding and effectiveness in the field and will help in improving the reliability of the pumps in the plant.",

There is a root folder for each section, within which, there are subfolders named Examples. Each example is provided in .bkp Aspen Plus format and .txt format. The .bkp files are set up as input files to view details and may be executed. The .txt files are solutions and may be viewed with Notepad. We recommend that while reading the text, Aspen Plus be used simultaneously to execute and review each example.\nLastly, we have made an effort to provide the describing equations of most of the models referred to in this online course and if not possible, because of the proprietary nature of the software, we have described the functionality. Please keep in mind that Aspen Plus is a proprietary software and the source code and implementation details are not available. Additionally, there are frequently several ways to solve the equations that describe the blocks, and there is no way to ascertain these details since Aspen Technology does not provide them.\n---\nSOFTWARE & HARDWARE :\nThe Aspen Plus software, like most other software, is being developed on a continuous basis and new versions are released frequently. This online course covers Aspen Plus version 11, which is the most recent version at the moment we recorded this video. Please keep in mind that this online course covers the fundamental features of Aspen Plus which do not change from version to version. The course covers the use of Aspen Plus on computers that use the Windows operating system. We assume that Aspen Plus is installed on your computer and that you have basic knowledge of operating the computer.

Human activities such as energy production, transportation, manufacturing, construction etc lead to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions which is causing climate change. Global efforts for mitigation resulted in an international agreement called the Kyoto Protocol, which sets limits on the amount of emissions for different countries. Developed economies have more stringent targets than developing countries.\n\nIn addition of national efforts by countries, Kyoto has introduced a market based mechanism to push efforts towards emission reductions. This had led to the creation of a carbon market, where carbon is traded just like any other commodity, helping balance the net carbon emissions globally. So is this the right approach to greenhouse gas mitigation? This course will provide plenty of fodder for you to answer this question. It will in detail the background and the three mechanisms that are helping maintain the carbon balance.\nWhile the course explains the content in detail, you are expected to be familiar with concepts of global warming and climate change and associated terms such as greenhouse gases and emissions.\nThe course is designed in modules with engaging content and detailed case studies, providing you with a learning experience that’s fun and insightful at the same time. At the end of the course, you will be able to discuss whether the mechanisms at present are truly good for the environment.",

In this advanced course we will learn the difference between standard operations and so called ETOPS operations, which allow the airplanes to fly in remote areas where airport availability is limited, for example in deserts, over oceans or sparsely populated areas, such as Siberia or Amazon jungles. Advances in engine technology and fuel-efficiency have made twin-engine jets the first choice for airlines not only for short haul regional routes, but also for long-haul and very long-haul operations. Twinjet efficiency advantage is multiplied when paired with ETOPS.\nMy intention is that you understand the meaning and importance of ETOPS operations, including aviation regulations, certification process, flight planning and dispatch considerations, fuel planning and critical scenarios, technical aspects and other. The course is built from Airline Operations and Dispatch perspective based on my own more than 10 years’ experience in this field.\nThe structure of the course is following:\nIntroduction\nETOPS overview\nETOPS flight planning\nBONUS lectures\nYou will learn such topics as History of ETOPS, EASA and FAA Regulations, Adequate and Suitable aerodromes, International Standard Atmosphere, Equal Time Points, Minimum Required and ETOPS fuel, Aircraft speeds, ETOPS scenarios and Diversion procedures, Runway Approach Categories, ETOPS alternate planning, Weather impact, and much more!\nThe objective of this course for you is to be well oriented in most of ETOPS aspects, and get deep theoretical and practical knowledge on the subject and aviation in general. For better understanding the course contains a lot of graphical information, practical examples, additional reading materials, and quizzes after each section.\nI encourage you to begin this journey to Airline Operations and you will not regret it! If you have any questions during the course feel free to contact me, I will answer as quick as possible!",

This new method prevents the company from potentially under-bidding profit or bidding without the proper supporting justification.\n\n\nThis new WGL Tool greatly improves and integrates the Profit Justification write-up and the WGL calculations to enable more educated calculations that accurately reflect the company's true profit justifications.\n\n\nAdditional benefits include insight into your possible Min/Normal/Objective/Max profit (ROC), ROS, and profit dollar amounts for any given scenario.\n\n\nBonus tab within the Excel workbook includes a template Negotiation Tracker.\n\n\nBonus video at the end of the course shows you the inner workings of the workbook and explains how you can make modifications if desired.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis workbook does not replace the DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines Application and does not capture every element of the form.

Enriched by the autonomous driving study I did during my MBA, I will show you what matters and what doesn't.\nEach video is produced in English, avoiding deep technical terms and explanations. Anyone with a general education should be able to follow.\nJust like the race to the moon, the race to fully autonomous driving was started. On the one hand, we have a development driven by traditional players such as Audi / Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, Ford, GM, Toyota. On the other hand, start-ups like Google / Waymo, Uber, Cruise and Byton and other disruptive players invest to beat them in a revolutionary way.\nInstead of rockets and spacecrafts, the race will be decided by acoustics, camera, radar, laser/lidar sensors and algorithms using deep learning and closed loop theory.\nThe goal is a multi-trillion-dollar mobility as a service market that not only changes the industry, but everything from personal to everyone's life.\nJoin the race and see you inside the course. You'll enjoy it!",

The two most complicated areas are sales and marketing and the supply chain. During consulting projects, I have seen business analysts and management consultants struggling to understand the business fast enough to deliver value to the customer. This course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project in a consumer goods business much easier.\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in analyzing and improving Fast Moving Consumer Goods businesses (FMCG).

In the course you will learn 3 things:\nHow to model FMCG business in Excel\nHow to improve sales and marketing in order to increase margin and profit\nHow to improve the supply chain in order to increase margin and profit\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nConsulting projects especially when it comes to the consumer goods business are very demanding. The two most complicated areas are sales and marketing and supply chain. During consulting projects, I have seen business analysts and management consultants struggling to understand the business fast enough to deliver value to the customer.

That is why, I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or business analysts that have to advise their customers but also to owners, founders of businesses as well as directors.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you find and analyze FMCG business.

This includes all levels of energy in and around the body with special emphasis on the meridian and chakra systems. Several polarity balancing techniques are discussed and shown with detailed illustrations. Eastern medicine and applied kinesiology (muscle testing) form the basis of energy psychology. This course is useful for both the lay person who wishes to learn the basics of energy psychology and is essential for professionals.\nThe exciting field of energy psychology is only 30 years old. Although not well known, it is one of the fastest growing techniques in psychology. This is due to the amazingly quick and painless results that people experience with energy therapists. These techniques have proven more effective than traditional cognitive, talk therapy for addictions, phobias, obsessions, depression, anxiety, and especially Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).",

Hope to see you there!\nWR Training – Your Partner in Plant Engineering and Reliability\nSpread the wings of your knowledge\n\n\n---\nIMPORTANT NOTES :\nThis course is built with over 9 sections, each tackling a different chemical process and a different aspect of Aspen Plus. Feel free to jump to the sections that most interest you especially if you're a little bit more advanced. If you're starting from scratch or even if you're not, we do highly recommend starting from the beginning.\nAspen Plus is a complex process simulator and, in our opinion, the best way to learn is with hands-on experience, by attempting each example provided in this online course, and when difficulties are encountered, by referring to the problem setup and solution that you can find in the downloadable resource section.\nThe downloadable resources contain the input and solutions to all of the examples and workshops covered in this online course. There is a root folder for each section, within which, there are subfolders named Examples. Each example is provided in .bkp Aspen Plus format and .txt format. The .bkp files are set up as input files to view details and may be executed. The .txt files are solutions and may be viewed with Notepad. We recommend that while reading the text, Aspen Plus be used simultaneously to execute and review each example.\nLastly, we have made an effort to provide the describing equations of most of the models referred to in this online course and if not possible, because of the proprietary nature of the software, we have described the functionality. Please keep in mind that Aspen Plus is a proprietary software and the source code and implementation details are not available. Additionally, there are frequently several ways to solve the equations that describe the blocks, and there is no way to ascertain these details since Aspen Technology does not provide them.\n---\nSOFTWARE & HARDWARE :\nThe Aspen Plus software, like most other software, is being developed on a continuous basis and new versions are released frequently. This online course covers Aspen Plus version 11, which is the most recent version at the moment we recorded this video. Please keep in mind that this online course covers the fundamental features of Aspen Plus which do not change from version to version. The course covers the use of Aspen Plus on computers that use the Windows operating system. We assume that Aspen Plus is installed on your computer and that you have basic knowledge of operating the computer. If you are new to Aspen Plus and have little or no experience in chemical engineering simulation, then you have come to the right place.",

      "description": "Trucking can offer you many opportunities to earn a great living and have some adventure in the process. It can also even lead to you owing your own successful trucking business - if that is something you may be interested in doing.\nIn a world with so much uncertainty and job insecurity there is one industry that is currently offering thousands of open positions to those who can handle the work and the lifestyle, and that's the trucking industry.\nThe Trucking industry is a multi-billion dollar industry and it has many opportunities available for you right now.\nTrucking is exciting and can provide you with all kinds of benefits you won't find in any other job anywhere else. You can get started in only a few short weeks and then continue to learn as you go and grow your own career and business as far as your vision, goals and abilities can take you.\nIt still offers quite a lot of FREEDOM and INDEPENDENCE - despite the fact it is a heavily regulated industry with lots of rules. You still have a huge amount of control over your career, what you choose to haul and what your work life actually looks like on a day to day basis.\nSome of that is controlled by which company you choose to affiliate with and drive for. Other elements are controlled by how well you understand the trucking industry, your job, your company and how well you communicate with ley people - like your dispatcher and load planner.\nIf you do your work effectively then you can be a great career in trucking, make a lot of money and have a great quality of life too. But all of that starts with you learning the basics and then building your skills as a professional truck driver.\nThis Course Is an Overview of What Specific Steps You Need to Complete To Get Started in Trucking\nThe purpose here is to give you the key steps necessary to get your CDL (Commercial Driver's License) and quickly get a trucking job as an entry level truck driver. As you complete your road training, you will begin to gain additional real-world experience and knowledge.\nBeyond that you will continue to gain more experience and learn on the job as you actually do the job.\nCAUTION - Here is What You Need to Consider BEFORE You Start Trucking\nThere are many other considerations you need to carefully take into account BEFORE you head off to truck driving school!\nI highly advise you to conduct additional research and study in addition to this course to be sure trucking is the right career choice for you.\nDon't worry, I will point you in the right direction inside the course - but the leg work is up to you.\nTrucking does offer extraordinary opportunities and benefits to those who can handle the job and the lifestyle - BUT IT ISN'T THE RIGHT CAREER FOR EVERYONE.\nMake sure it is right for you before you just jump into it.\nOnce you become a truck driver how far you take your career is totally up to you.\nI have many other trucking courses, books and other resources for those who are really serious and want more than just a job and want to do far better than just getting by.\nIf you want to get ahead in trucking and in life instead of just getting by, then make sure you get the information you need to make the best decisions you can make throughout your career.\nYour opportunity is unlimited.\nThere are very few opportunities in life where you can literally start with nothing but drive and determination and then build a career from an entry level truck driver position all the way up to a fleet owner and beyond within a few short years.\nIf you know what you are doing, if you have goals and a plan and if you actually go do the work that is - but the opportunity is REAL, and it is wide open - and NOT for anyone else to set artificial barriers, limitations or ceilings that stop you from going any further.\nHow far you can go in trucking is only limited by your own vision, goals, abilities, drive and determination.\nHow about you?\nHow far do YOU want to take your career?\nLet's get your journey started - take this course and I will see you soon!",

Now in the new industrial age, as demand grow for cleaner and cheaper energy we look to other materials that can provide the solar cells of the new age. Ones that can be processed at low cost and at large scale using materials that are as readily available as sand and can fit into gadgets like phones and wearable technologies.\nFor this we look to Polymeric solar cells. Polymers offer the processibility, low cost, flexibility and potentially higher efficiency that is required for solar cells to be a sustainable and competitive renewable energy source.\nThe solar modules are made up of solar cells connected together in series and parallel.\nIn this course, we’ll go further up the value chain of solar energy systems by looking at how the cell itself is produced.\nThis course has been designed to give you a fundamental understanding of polymeric solar cells regardless of your technical or academic background and learning requirement.\nSo whether you are an industry professional in the area of solar energy, a student, a solar technician, a researcher or any individual seeking to know more about how solar cells are made and how they work. This course has been designed to give you the fundamental knowledge on polymeric solar cells.\nAlthough the course focuses on working principles and production process of the polymeric solar cells, along the way we explore some interesting aspects of solar energy and related concepts.",

It is true that negative thoughts and emotions are a normal survival response to disaster and grief. However, when negativity continues beyond the crisis and consumes people daily, this habit pattern negatively impacts every area of their life. In this course, I personally train you to use my proprietary Empowerment Coaching Models so that you excel as a Positive Thinking Life Coach.\n\n\nAs sited in the International Scientific Research Journal, Dr. Naragon-Gainey states that when negative thoughts override positive thinking “It can be harder to enjoy things because you’re more tuned in to what could go wrong; it can create friction with other people and fuel even more stress.” Combined with current events being streamed nightly on the news, a predisposition to negative thought patterns could be an insurmountable obstruction that impact people’s health, finances, career/business, relationships, personal growth and/or life purpose.\n\n\nPositive Thinking Life Coach Training Certification Course Content Overview\nWith 10 hours of video tutorials, 146+ downloadable resources ready to use, hands-on practice assignments, interactive learning and Q & A, this continually updated 2-Level Certification Course keeps you relevant and in the know.  Let's break it down for you:\n\n\nFirst 3 Sections:  The first 3 sections of your Life Coach Training are dedicated to teaching you the Positive Thinking 3 session interactive online Group Coaching Program. You are given step-by-step instruction designed to improve your proficiency using the latest technology as well as the how-to insight for delivering the professional program. You walk away with done-for-you PDF documents as well as links to interactive online resources that you use during the session saving you time and money.\n\n\nNext 3 Sections: After you finish learning about the group coaching, the next 3 sections of your Life Coach Training focus on the essentials of Positive Thinking Psychology and understanding people. I have created frameworks that simplify psychological concepts so that you can quickly learn and apply. More importantly, my frameworks increase your competency during a coaching session because they help you understand at a deeper level what truly blocks people from thinking in a more positive way.  You get to watch a client re-enactment so that you can assess your own approach and with what you discover, adjust as needed before coaching real clients.\n\n\nNext 7 Sections:  Now you are ready to coach people individually!  The next 7 sections of your Positive Thinking Life Coach Training focus on the individual coaching sessions in the 6 life areas.

Upon doing an exhaustive review, I concluded that they were very expensive and that the average time of the courses was not enough to address all the content satisfactorily. For this reason, I decided to prepare myself for this certification. To do this, I studied the material suggested by IAM, I looked for videos, books, and standard questions that would allow me to have a clearer vision of the focus of the exam. The truth is that the related material is very scarce. Because of this, I decided that once I obtained the certification, I would dedicate myself to condensing the useful material into a test simulator, with questions similar to the real exam.\n\n\nThe \"course\" has 2 simulation exams (60 questions) very similar to the real certification.\n\n\nI hope the simulator helps you achieve your goals, a warm hug!\n\n\nDisclaimer: The course and exam platform offered are not supported or condoned by the IAM.

I'll take you step by step on the audition process.\n\nThis is a must have for any actor! The online course is designed to provide a clear perspective of acting and auditioning from the business end to the creative side. From my over 35 years as a casting director and producer, I will give you insider secrets such as:\nAudition techniques that will make them remember you\nRe-framing your perspective to book more jobs\nOn-camera technique to show that you're a pro\nEssential knowledge into the competitive world of auditioning from the point of view of directors, producers, studio executives and casting directors.\nEasy-to-follow video clips take you through the process from preparation, what you should be doing in the audition room (and what not to do!), and your all-important mindset before, during and after the audition.\nAs an added bonus, several of my blog articles are included throughout to highlight the course.\nCompetition is huge in this business - this course will give you the edge over other actors.\n\nI know you're all being sold gimmicks and tools and shortcuts to \"Get on the red carpet\" and \"Get on the A-List\"...frankly I don't think that should be your goal. If all you're seeking is fame, then you're probably in it for the wrong reasons.\n\nI believe, and I think you do too, that you're an artist - a storyteller. You want to be on stage and on screen because you have a story to share and characters to embody.\n\"Your audition should not feel like a visit to the doctor!

I felt very comfortable working with Marci. Her approach was perfect for me, as if we were in rehearsals for a stage play—breaking down each beat—details, details, details. The hours flew by and it was even fun. She gave me honest feedback and more importantly, an insider's look as to what other casting directors look for and expect. That helped put me at ease which added an extra confidence when I walked into the room—very important.\"\nRosie Perez\nPineapple Express, Fearless, Untamed Heart, White Men Can't Jump, and The Counselor\n--------\n\"What I like about Marci is that she does not try to mold you into something that is outside of yourself. She recognizes your strengths and creates a comfortable environment where you can really allow yourself to be free and find some interesting moments.\"\nDave Franco\n21 Jump Street, Warm Bodies, Now You See Me\n--------\nMarci's coaching helps me approach audition scenes in the most creative way possible. With her patient & kind guidance, she encourages me to take risks. I truly enjoy collaborating with her!\"\nLacey Chabert\nMean Girls, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\n~~~~~\nWhether you're sitting behind the casting table with Marci (as I have), soaking up the invaluable lessons she's sharing in this course or lucky enough to enroll in one of her classes, what's always true is that Marci is\npassionate\nabout empowering every actor to do his or her best work. Ever!\nDean Pitchford - Songwriter, Director, Screenwriter, Author\n~~~~~~\nMarci Liroff's course is a must for every actor. I have been an Agent for over 12 years and the information on this course is a great resource. If you are a new to the business or a long time veteran, this course is a must have.\nChaim Magnum – Lemonlime Agency\n~~~~~\nI firmly believe that this is a MUST have for all actors. Marci was able to do something that no institution was able to do. She effectively constructed a blue print on how to successfully brand your product, packaged it in an easy to follow format, and made it available for every...one in all demographics.\nWesley Saintlouis\n~~~~~\nMarci's course was not only incredibly informative, but she presents very complicated information in an organized, very well designed, and easy to follow format. It is a must for everyone already involved with, or wanting to begin their venture into, the entertainment industry. This is the best investment anyone can make--it certainly was for me.\nDr. Brian Gedeon\n~~~~~\nFor anyone who is acting - Marci's course is an absolute must have! One thing you do or don't do in an audition - that they learn from Marci's course - could make or break your career!\nElaine Wilkes, Actress\n~~~~~\nI always wanted to know what casting directors look for, and now I know. The course is the ultimate audition guide. There's an abundance of valuable advice and tips for anyone serious about acting. I think those who take this course will definitely have an advantage by knowing what to do to prepare and knowing all the do’s and don'ts. It has helped demystify the audition process for me. The information presented in the course is very straight forward and easy to understand. I know I will definitely watch this again and put into practice all that I learn from it. Thank you Marci for putting together such a valuable resource!\nRob Novakov\n~~~~~\n\"Marci's course was exactly what I needed to better understand the anatomy of the audition. Her experience as a casting director and her wealth in character as a person make the class a delight and leavse you with more than your money's worth. This is not a class where you are simply being preached at, rather, it is a forum for actors to share their experiences under the guidance of an industry veteran. I left the class feeling prepared to tackle auditions with a confident perspective and an appreciation for the good souls still thriving in this business.\"\nAngelique Robinson\n~~~~~\n\"Marci Liroff and her course are a must if you want to act in Hollyweird. Marci is one of the rare people in this business who has a huge heart and cares about the project and the actors. She is an actor's casting director for sure and it is a pleasure to work with her as a filmmaker as well. She has a great eye for talent, she is honest, intuitive and supportive. I not only want to audition for her on any project she's doing, but I will be hiring her to cast my films as well. Bonus!\"\nAngela Shelton\n~~~~~\n\"Marci is so much more than a Casting Director. After being cast in a project by her, working with her privately and in class, Marci has become a much needed teacher and mentor in a difficult business that can leave an actor feeling frustrated and confused. She truly wants us to succeed, and I am forever grateful to her for sharing her vast knowledge with me.\"\nShanda Lee Munson\n~~~~~\nMarci, I love your course! This is like an entire season of crucial info packed into one package. You have a comfortable presentation style, your style is a pleasure to listen to and you often present a fresh perspective on the solid basics as well as bringing fresh insights to the actor. I highly recommend that actors add this to their arsenal of study materials! I will watch this again and again. Thank you!\nRay Remillard\n~~~~~\nA must have for actors. It's part of that set of tools in your tool bag or those arrows in your quiver that you need to get a better understanding about the business we're in. This is the next best thing to being in her studio and her immediate presence!\"\nKim Estes\n~~~~~\nWow! Marci really helps to demystify the casting process. The principles that she talks about in her course are universally true whether you are auditioning in LA, New York or here in Toronto. I especially loved the section on self-taping. We have the technology today to show filmmakers all over the world what we can do but we have to use the technology properly to present ourselves in the best possible light. Marci shows us how. I have been to casting director workshops in the past and always got the impression that the workshop was mainly a device to generate revenue during slow periods in the industry. But with Marci you know you are being taught by someone who truly likes and respects actors and wants them to be at their best. I loved the videos and I will be sure to recommend it to my Canadian actor friends. Thanks Marci.\nNeil Whitley\n~~~~~\n\"I have taken a lot of classes and even produced a few and I have to say that Marci Liroff's course is among the best of the best. Her feedback is honest and constructive, focusing on how the actor can best bring what is unique about themselves to the part, making your performance stand out from the others. She stresses the dual focus of the industry: Craft & Business and how the successful actor works on both sets of skills.\"\nRichard Sabine\n~~~~~\n\"Breaking walls is key to acting and Marci demolishes the fears and misconceptions of auditioning. She is the actors casting director and wants you to shine as bright as you can. Professionalism is important in the industry but having character and exuding personality is what will make your performance memorable. Marci guides you into the reality of the script and helps you become a better messenger.\"\nAnthony Ecclissi\n~~~~~\n\"The title of Casting Director/Producer is obviously EARNED when you study her background. Before you journey into ANY casting office...learn what the BEST casting office would want to experience from you in the audition process. Start your adventure in front of Marci Liroff because of the multifaceted way she looks at each and every one us actors, how she holistically informs us to bring the choices we individually want to bring to the material. Whatever mistakes you make auditioning, you'll never make them again after Marci Liroff's class.\"\nJennifer Rubin\n~~~~~\n\"Marci helped me understand that casting directors are on our side and WANT us to succeed. She boosts your confidence while also being honest and straightforward. (That's a neat trick, by the way, Marci.) Her class is a helpful, entertaining mix of hands-on experience, industry insight, and personal career guidance. Not bad when you usually pay twice as much for half the information and opportunity!\"\nAllen C. Gardner\n~~~~~\n\"I highly recommend Marci Liroff's class for actors at any level of experience. She has a genuine love for actors and a great respect for the craft. Her insights are clear and direct and I truly felt as though I was able to stretch with the material that I was given. I am a better actor for having gone through this, and more empowered with knowledge on the audition and on the perspective from a top notch casting professional.\nPablo Lyonne\n~~~~~\nI'm an actor (SAG since 1976) and also worked for ten years as an asst./associate casting director in N.Y. and L.A. This is a terrific course. The wealth of experience and information is invaluable. She gives it to you straight. It helped me personally with an acting audition I had last week. I also lead an audition workshop here in Honolulu and have recommended it to my students. If you're an actor just starting out or whether you've been around the block a few times, you need this course...and I ain't blowin' smoke.\"\nNed Van Zandt\n~~~~~\nTaking Marci's course is like having a friend pull you aside after they've auditioned and fill you in on what the casting director was looking for. She gives you all the information you need to prepare to do your personal best! Although it would be great to take a class with Marci in person, the beauty of the online course is that you can pause it or go back over something if you missed a point while taking notes, without feeling like an idiot by saying, \"I'm sorry, could you repeat that?\" (I took twelve pages of notes!) Marci has the experience to back up what she teaches, plus you can tell she truly cares about actors and wants them to do their best. Thanks Marci!\"\nCasey Robinson\n~~~~~\n\"Marci's course was an outstanding experience. She created a comfortable, inviting environment within which to work, and we had many helpful, insightful guests. Marci also gave us some great tips, strategies, and ways of preparing that I hadn't considered before, but will use from this day forward before entering an audition. It's the best class I've taken in years, and has had a direct result on helping my confidence in the audition room.\"\nNorma Maldonado\n~~~~~\n\"If you've ever stood in an audition room and wondered, \"What are the casting people thinking?\"... Guess no more. Marci's course not only tells you how casting directors think, but tells you exactly what to do to make them think of you as a true professional. No more hoping you're doing the right thing. Here are step by step instructions on how to handle most any audition situation. Marci tells you how to take care of all the \"business\" stuff and leaves you free to hone your skill and talent. This course will save you years of trial and error. I wish I had this when I first started out.\"\nLarry F. Scott\n~~~~~\n\"Marci's course is a must-have in any actor's arsenal. No matter what level you are at, Marci breaks down all the myths and facts about casting and what you need to do as an actor to get the job. It's like you have a private one on one coaching session with her! Thank you so much Marci, for not only sharing your wealth of knowledge but for being a fan of the actor.\"\nStacy Citron\n~~~~~\n\"Marci Liroff's course is a must for beginning as well as experienced actors. It breaks down not only what you do to sabotage yourself at auditions, but it also shows you what to can do at auditions to make a good impression. I love how the course is organized. This is an investment that will pay big dividends!!\"\nSusan Elise Duris\n~~~~~\nThank you for being such a bright shining force in the industry. Your class was enlightening and motivating. Your words of advice were invaluable and the guests you invited truly helped humanize the business. Thank you for sharing your vast experience with us and for introducing us to other kind, humble, talented individuals in the industry.\nLaura C. Spencer\n~~~~~\nI have never walked away from an audition class feeling so informed, confident, and knowledgeable than I have from Marci Liroff's course. Marci has such deep and rich experience in the business, she can connect with any actor on any level. If you are a serious actor and want the knowledge of how you can make or break your next audition, you need to attend a class with Marci Liroff.\nDuncan Calladine\n~~~~~\nTaking Marci's class was one of the smartest moves I've made since moving to LA. She truly cares about actors and wants to help in every way possible. I have a new outlook on auditions after seeing how much Marci, as a casting director, wants actors to succeed in the audition room. She gives guidance from her vast experience with actors, directors, producers, and other casting directors. She creates a safe space to take risks, ask questions, and learn. I'm thrilled to say that I've found a mentor in Marci and that I now have new tools to confidently tackle any audition that comes my way!\nAli Hill\n~~~~~~\nWorking with Marci was an invaluable experience. In a unique format of classes, Marci has created a positive and encouraging learning environment which fosters creativity and growth. Marci truly wants her actors to work hard and be the best they can be. By participating in the ‘Audition Bootcamp’ and having Marci - a nurturing and generous mentor, guiding you along the way – I know I am well on the path of doing just that.\nJennie Tkaz\n~~~~~\nI took Marci Liroff’s course and I cannot be happier that I did! She had an incredible amount of advice and information about the audition room that I had never heard before. After taking her class, I applied some of the things I learned to a few auditions and I felt that my performance and comfort level had both increased. I felt a confidence that I haven’t felt in a while and I credit it to her class.\nRachel C. Verret\n~~~~~\nIt's the unknown that makes this business scary and Marci not only demystified the process, but also gave one a sense of empowerment; giving me permission to do what I love, which is help filmmakers bring characters to life they have created on the page.\nVirginia Reece\n------\nMarci's Casting Director Credits:\nVampire Academy (2014)\nThe Sublime and Beautiful (2013)\nMr. Popper’s Penguins (2010)\nThe Paul Reiser Show (2010)\nGhosts of Girlfriends Past (2009)\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles (2008)\nAtlanta (2007)\nFull of It (2007)\nJust Like Heaven (2005)\nLand of the Dead (2005)\nNew York Minute (2004)\nMean Girls (2004)\nView from the Top (2003)\nGothika (2003)\nFreaky Friday (2003)\nInsomnia (2002)\nHard Ball (2001)\nSummer Catch (2001)\nCats & Dogs (2001)\nReady to Rumble (2000)\n“The Strip” (1999)\nThe Iron Giant (1999)\nJack Frost (1998)\n“Dellaventura” (1997)\nThe Spitfire Grill (1996)\nThe Tie That Binds (1995)\nIt Runs in the Family (1994)\nThe Crush (1993)\nUntamed Heart (1993)\nFernGully: The Last Rainforest (1992)\nThe Cutting Edge (1992)\nEve of Destruction (1991)\nThe Washing Machine Man (1991)\nSibling Rivalry (1990)\nMen at Work (1990)\nCoupe de Ville (1990)\nCousins (1989)\nThe Experts (1989)\nHomesick (1988)\nHearts of Fire (1987)\nYou Ruined My Life (1987)\nSiesta (1987)\nMannequin (1987)\nPretty in Pink (1986)\nLegend (1985)\nSt. Elmo’s Fire (1985)\nReturn to Oz (1985)\nMischief (1985)\nJohnny Dangerously (1984)\nThe Ratings Game (1984)\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)\nFootloose (1984)\nA Christmas Story (1983)\nRunning Brave (1983)\nAll the Right Moves (1983)\nTwilight Zone: The Movie (1983)\nPorky’s II: The Next Day (1983)\nBest Friends (1982)\nKiss Me Goodbye (1982)\nEndangered Species (1982)\nBest Friends (1982)\nSix Weeks (1982)\nBlade Runner (1982)\nPoltergeist (1982)\nE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\nProducer Credits:\nThe Sublime and Beautiful (2012) (producer)\nThe Spitfire Grill (1996) (co-producer)\nThe Crush (1993) (associate producer)\nUntamed Heart (1993) (associate producer)",

      "description": "Maintenance and Reliability (M&R) has emerged as a field encapsulating the latest understanding of maintenance in industry. It is becoming increasingly important for professionals in the field of Maintenance and Asset Management to develop sound understanding of the concepts of Maintenance Management and Reliability Engineering in order to achieve zero equipment failures, zero production losses, zero assembly line delays and maximum profitable service life from company's assets. You need to have the most updated knowledge on the latest maintenance management philosophies and best practices to be able to become a good maintenance management professional and improve maintenance in your company.\n\n\nHowever, just having the knowledge is not enough in order to excel in your career. What's equally important is to have a readily available proof of that knowledge. This is where certifications like the Certified Maintenance & Reliability Professional (CMRP) come in. They are accepted within industry as a badge that indicates that the person having that badge has been tested in this field. If you are a Certified Maintenance & Reliability Professional (CMRP), or hold any other similar certification in the field of M&R, it gives your word on the matter more weight than others on the table. It helps you excel in your career and open doors of new opportunities for you.\n\n\nThis course is designed for fulfilling both of the above objectives. It imparts you the understanding of the concepts of Maintenance & Reliability and it prepares you for certifications, most notably the CMRP.\n\n\nHowever, Maintenance & Reliability is a vast discipline. In order to make it understandable, it is divided into sub-disciplines by any body of knowledge that aims to teach it. Just like different books on a subject teach the same subject in different ways, different institutions in the field of Maintenance & Reliability approach this discipline in different ways.\n\n\nIn order to ensure consistency, this course follows the Body of Knowledge developed by Society of Maintenance & Reliability Professionals (SMRP) known as the CMRP Body of Knowledge. The CMRP Body of Knowledge has divided the discipline of Maintenance & Reliability into five pillars:\nBusiness & Management\nManufacturing Process Reliability\nEquipment Reliability\nLeadership & Organization\nWork Management\n\n\nEach of the above five pillars is a subject within itself. This course is based on teaching the 3rd Pillar: Equipment Reliability. This pillar is the most technical in nature among the five pillars. It includes knowledge of how equipment reliability is measured, tested, assessed, reported and improved. It includes calculable metrics to express different aspects of reliability of machines; methodologies of assessing the state of reliability of plant equipment; techniques for investigating reliability related issues in equipment; maintenance programs and best practices for improving reliability of plant equipment; and tools for measuring reliability growth.\n\n\nThis course introduces concepts of all of the above knowledge areas of Equipment Reliability in lectures having intuitive explanations and includes more than 140 practice test questions to make you ready for answering all questions related to Equipment Reliability in the CMRP exam. In this way, this course works on both the aspects i.e., the understanding part as well as the certification preparedness part.",

      "description": "In our daily lives, we encounter a multitude of risks, ranging from the mundane to the complex. In the business world, these risks extend to product quality and safety concerns, often arising from human error, negligence, or uncontrollable factors. To navigate this intricate landscape and protect our interests, a systematic approach to risk management is imperative.Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is the beacon that guides us through these turbulent waters. It serves as a powerful risk management tool designed to identify, quantify, and address potential failure modes, their consequences, root causes, and the existing controls in place to mitigate these failures. By undertaking FMEA, we proactively take action to minimize or even prevent failure modes, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of catastrophic events.\nSadly, many companies perform FMEA as a mere compliance exercise, driven solely by regulatory or customer requirements. The result? Ineffective FMEA processes that fall short of their potential to reduce failure incidents.\nThis course, however, is your key to unlocking the true power of FMEA. It offers a step-by-step approach, leading you towards conducting an FMEA that doesn't just fulfill obligations but actively reduces or eliminates risks. I have gone a step further by integrating cutting-edge AI technology into specific FMEA steps to enhance risk identification and bolster action plans.\nBut that's not all. Our course also equips you with the tools to manage suppliers effectively. We provide a comprehensive guide and audit checklist to ensure that your suppliers perform FMEA efficiently. This proactive approach cultivates a culture of quality and consistency, leading to outstanding product outcomes.\nIn today's fast-paced world, we all seek efficient ways to achieve results. What better way than to learn FMEA from a proactive expert? With over 30 years of experience, I've prevented countless problems, resulting in savings worth millions. I've also trained hundreds of engineers and managers worldwide in this methodology, honing their skills and transforming them into adept problem solvers.\nThe course materials are thoughtfully designed for easy learning. There are valuable resources, including a case study that you can even bring to job interviews, where your world-class knowledge in root cause analysis will set you apart from your competitors.\nDon't miss this opportunity to become a proficient FMEA practitioner with knowledge how and when to integrate AI into the FMEA steps. Join my course and embark on a journey towards mastering risk management using AI and achieving excellence in problem-solving. Your future awaits; seize it today.",

Thanks a lot, love, Marg”\n\n\nSelf-Awareness Life Coach Training Real-World Application\nSimilar to you, people want to become a Life Coach to use their gifts, talents, skills in a profession where they can be successful while making a positive difference. You might conclude that it requires a lot of hard work to make this happen. Effort is required but the real work is daily self-awareness.\n\n\nConsider this common scenario post Covid-19! More skilled workers are choosing to work remotely. Companies have put all of the technology in place to support productivity goals but satisfaction has dipped. You’ve been selected to coach a team of remote workers to improve morale through self-awareness.\nThis is the opportunity you have been waiting for but the company wants you to start tomorrow. Are you prepared? Do you have the technology know-how to conduct a remote meeting? Do you have a proven Self-Awareness Group Coaching program with the exact questions and interactive online resources that will AIM this team in the right direction?\nWhat if they want life coaching?

Are you ready for this request? Do you have step-by-step session guides in these 6 life areas with the right coaching questions, interactive activities and coaching techniques to EMPOWER people?\n\n\nSelf-Awareness Life Coach Training is the New Normal Soft Skill That Opens Doors\nOpportunities like this can change your life!

Self-awareness is much more than just its simplistic definition of how you see yourself and how others see you. This is where most training on self-awareness falls short. It only considers the basic understanding and doesn’t take into consideration the unconscious bias that directs the awareness.\n\n\nHave you ever heard of the saying “the grass is greener on the other side”? Often termed a syndrome, it is more accurately an outward manifestation of the Contrast Effect Bias. Judgments become relative based on comparison between 2 objects, 2 people or 2 circumstances. These contrasts are not absolute self-awareness but purely conceived from perception. It is this distinction which needs to be addressed.\n\n\nIn this course, I personally train you to use my proprietary Empowerment Coaching Models so that you can empower yourself and/or clients to understand the totality of self-awareness so that, regardless of the unconscious bias, success can be achieved.\n\n\nSelf-Awareness Life Coach Certification Training Content Overview\nWith almost 9+ hours of video tutorials, 152+ downloadable resources ready to use, hands-on practice assignments, interactive learning and Q & A, this continually updated 2-Level Certification Course keeps you in-the-know. Let's break it down for you:\n\n\nFirst 3 Sections: The first 3 sections of your Life Coach Training are dedicated to teaching you the Self-Awareness 3 session interactive online Group Coaching Program. You are given step-by-step instruction designed to improve your proficiency using the latest technology as well as the how-to insight for delivering the professional Self-Awareness Program. You walk away with done-for-you PDF documents as well as links to interactive online resources that you use during the session saving you time and money.\n\n\nNext 3 Sections: After you finish learning about the group coaching, the next 3 sections of your Life Coach Training focus on the essentials of Self-Awareness Psychology and understanding people. I created frameworks for you to use that increase your competency during a coaching session. These help you understand at a deeper level why people struggle to see their true nature and the underlying patterns that stop them from being successful. You watch a client re-enactment to assess your own approach and with what you discover, adjust as needed before coaching real clients.\n\n\nNext 7 Sections: Now you are ready to coach people individually! The next 7 sections of your Self-Awareness Life Coach Training focus on the individual coaching sessions in the 6 life areas. The sessions are mapped-out, timed-out, done-for-you Self-Awareness Life Coach sessions complete with coaching questions, empowered mindfulness techniques resources, activities, exercises, and insight. You have time to practice and implement what you learn.\n\n\nFinal Sections: The final sections are dedicated to your Self-Awareness Life Coach Career, Practice or Business. You are given marketing strategies to fill your practice plus the exact structure to enroll clients. As a bonus, you receive ongoing personal and professional development.\n\n\n2 LEVELS OF CERTIFICATION: Students and Graduates of Empowerment Coach Academy on Udemy benefit from the E.C.A 2 Levels of Certification at no extra cost.

Failures are prioritized according to how serious their consequences are, how frequently they occur, and how easily they can be detected. The purpose of the FMEA is to take actions to eliminate or reduce failures, starting with the highest-priority ones.\nThis course will be valuable for any Formula Student participant enrolled within the Electric Vehicle category. The course is meant to empower student participants with the knowledge of understanding the purpose behind the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) documentation and furthermore, fulfilling the requirements towards the submission of the same.\nThis course has been designed by the organizers of the Formula Bharat competition. While participants are still required to ensure that their documentation aligns with the competition their team has registered for, the knowledge provided in this course will still be relevant.",

      "description": "Maintenance and Reliability (M&R) has emerged as a field encapsulating the latest understanding of maintenance in industry. It is becoming increasingly important for professionals in the field of Maintenance and Asset Management to develop sound understanding of the concepts of Maintenance Management and Reliability Engineering in order to achieve zero equipment failures, zero production losses, zero assembly line delays and maximum profitable service life from company's assets. You need to have the most updated knowledge on the latest maintenance management philosophies and best practices to be able to become a good maintenance management professional and improve maintenance in your company.\n\n\nHowever, just having the knowledge is not enough in order to excel in your career. What's equally important is to have a readily available proof of that knowledge. This is where certifications like the Certified Maintenance & Reliability Professional (CMRP) come in. They are accepted within industry as a badge that indicates that the person having that badge has been tested in this field. If you are a Certified Maintenance & Reliability Professional (CMRP), or hold any other similar certification in the field of M&R, it gives your word on the matter more weight than others on the table. It helps you excel in your career and open doors of new opportunities for you.\n\n\nThis course is designed for fulfilling both of the above objectives. It imparts you the understanding of the concepts of Maintenance & Reliability and it prepares you for certifications, most notably the CMRP.\n\n\nHowever, Maintenance & Reliability is a vast discipline. In order to make it understandable, it is divided into sub-disciplines by any body of knowledge that aims to teach it. Just like different books on a subject teach the same subject in different ways, different institutions in the field of Maintenance & Reliability approach this discipline in different ways.\n\n\nIn order to ensure consistency, this course follows the Body of Knowledge developed by Society of Maintenance & Reliability Professionals (SMRP) known as the CMRP Body of Knowledge. The CMRP Body of Knowledge has divided the discipline of Maintenance & Reliability into five pillars:\nBusiness & Management\nManufacturing Process Reliability\nEquipment Reliability\nLeadership & Organization\nWork Management\n\n\nEach of the above five pillars is a subject within itself. This course is based on teaching the 5th Pillar: Work Management. Work Management is at the heart of effective maintenance. It deals with how maintenance work is identified, prioritized, planned, scheduled, executed, and reviewed. A solid grasp of work management principles ensures that maintenance resources are used optimally, downtime is minimized, and asset performance is consistently improved. By mastering this pillar, you lay the foundation for achieving world-class maintenance practices in your organization.\n\n\nThis course introduces concepts of maintenance work management in lectures having intuitive explanations and includes more than 130 practice test questions to make you ready for answering all questions related to Work Management in the CMRP exam. In this way, this course works on both the aspects i.e., the understanding part as well as the certification preparedness part.",

      "description": "This course is an introduction to electrical controls with an emphasis on motor controls in the real world.\nIn this course, we focus on industrial and commercial installations, we will start with the absolute basics of electrical circuits. We look at the fundamentals of resistive circuits, and introduce Ohms Law, a mathematical formula that all electricians learn. The course looks at the different types of voltages and where they come from in the real world, focussing on transformer formations from the power supply authority, and AC and DC Voltages. As this is a course on the fundamentals of electrical controls, we will go through the basics of control circuits such as, normally open and normally closed, and look at how controls are made up of series and parallel circuits.\nTaking a more practical approach to the subject, we dive inside control panels and look at each electrical component that we will be using later in the course, in our own motor control installation. We look inside the parts in detail and see how they work, discuss ratings, and learn how to size them up, with a particular focus on contactors and overloads. We also simplify an explanation of how an asynchronous motor works.\nBefore we get to wiring up our own control circuit, we look at the different types of control voltages in the real world and follow them  from end device at the customers installation all the way back to the supply transformer at the power company, so we can see how a full installation might look, and get an insight into different systems that we might find in industry.\nAfter learning the basics, we look at how we would install a motor control installation from scratch, including the motor itself. We get to see all the parts that we have learned about, working together in a mock real world installation, we learn how to size up the components and then go through the wiring of the circuit step by step. Part of installing a control board is commissioning it, so we go through the operation of the circuit after we have installed it to make sure it works.\nInstallations are often amended and modified in the real world, so we'll look at a few ways in which we could modify our mock installation, change our wiring around and re-commission the installation.\nAt the end of the course, we're going to challenge ourselves, and learn how to fault find a circuit as we would if we were called to a breakdown as an electrical controls technician. We'll go through a few faults that we might come up against in the industry and look at how we might repair them. We also briefly touch on preventative maintenance techniques and discuss why they are important, for safety reasons and also financial reasons too.\n\n\nControls can be quite daunting and complicated, we will go through slowly and steadily, learning each part of the installation in detail before putting it all together, the course is weighted towards learning from practical examples, perfect for those of us that are visual learners. And, instead of enforcing hard and fast rules of how things must be done, We focus more on learning how to break down circuits and understand them for ourselves.  I will show you wiring techniques used by Controls Electricians in the real world.\n\nWhat is covered in the course:\nLearn the fundamentals: AC and DC voltages, 3 phase voltages, resistive circuits, ohms law, normally open and normally closed, series and parallel circuits, supply transformers (star & delta), faults to earth.\nElectrical components: Control panels, isolating switches, circuit breakers, fuses, contactors, overloads, asynchronous motors, push buttons, indicator lights, power supplies.\nTypes of installations: Single phase, dual phase, power supply, mixed voltage control.\nInstallation of a motor control circuit: Install electrical components, wiring of a mock installation, commission installation.\nModifying an installation: Add and remove components, wire a hold in circuit, commission.\nFault finding and maintenance: Fault find and repair, use a multimeter, preventative maintenance.\nAre you ready to upskill?",

      "description": "Airline Operations: North Atlantic NAT HLA Flight Planning course is an aviation course about airline operations, flight planning and dispatch in a very interesting and busy region of our World – the North Atlantics. This region connects two biggest global economies – USA and European Union, but not only. Modern long-haul airplanes can operate direct flights from Middle East and Asia to Caribbean and South America, which also involves the North Atlantic crossing. More than 700,000 flights cross the North Atlantic yearly and that volume of traffic continues to increase, meaning more and more people will need to enhance their aviation knowledge of the region.\nIn this advanced course we will learn the requirements for theoretical and practical flight planning and aircraft operations in the region. The vast majority of North Atlantic flights are performed by commercial jet transport aircraft in the band of levels FL 290 – FL 410, that means in North Atlantic High-Level Airspace, commonly known as NAT HLA. So, we will concentrate on main NAT HLA aspects, such as: Basic entry and aircraft equipment requirements, FANS 1/A, Random Routes, Organized Track System, Data Link Mandate, PBCS, ETOPS/EDTO, etc. We also will look on special routes in the region, such as Blue Spruce routes, Tango Routes, Adjacent routes and other. We will learn basic characteristics of North Atlantic weather, such as prevailing winds, jet streams, tropical storms and hurricanes.\nProper knowledge and understanding of the region by the personnel directly involved in the operations (flight/aircraft dispatchers, pilots, flight followers, air traffic controllers, etc.) can significantly improve flight planning and preparations, which will increase flight safety and fuel economy. Those who are not directly involved into the operations, for example airline Sales and Marketing teams, will benefit from the advanced knowledge on the region and aircraft and airline operations matters in particular.\nMy intention is that you understand the meaning and importance of the North Atlantic operations, including aviation regulations, certification process, flight planning and dispatch considerations, fuel planning, technical aspects, weather and other. The course is built from Airline Operations and Flight Dispatch perspective based on my own more than 12 years’ experience in this field.\nThe structure of the course is following:\nIntroduction\nNorth Atlantic overview\nNAT HLA flight planning\nNorth Atlantic weather\nThe objective of this course for you is to be well oriented in most of the North Atlantic operational aspects, and get deep theoretical and practical knowledge on the subject and aviation in general. For better understanding the video course contains a lot of graphical information, practical examples, additional reading materials, articles and quizzes after each section.\nI encourage you to begin this journey to Airline Operations and you will not regret it! If you have any questions during the course feel free to contact me, I will answer as quick as possible!",

      "description": "Interviewing is carried out on a frequent basis across the globe. Investigative interviewing is the narrower band of criminal & disciplinary enquiry although it still connects with the fundamental process of speaking to people.\nOften steeped in mystery and conjecture the thought of conducting such a process fills many with fear and trepidation.\nThis entry level course provides the practical tools to enable you to confidently conduct an investigatory interview with both witnesses and those individuals that may have contravened your organisations disciplinary code or are subject of a grievance and reach a decision that is both fair and lawful.\nUsed widely across the business community and the public sector the same elements have been adopted by the UK Police.\nIan Kirke is the Managing Director of leading UK Risk Consultants TFS (www.tfsuccess.com).\n\"TFS is providing Hertfordshire with a bespoke \"out-of-custody\" interview package to enable us to train all our uniformed response and neighbourhood officers. This training is providing officers with skills in recognising when out-of-custody interviews should be staged, how to stage such an interview, interviewing both cooperative and non-cooperative suspects, and dealing confidently with legal representatives; all in all professionalising and adding a consistency to out-of-custody interviewing in Herts.”\nShane O'Neill, Detective Chief Inspector, Hertfordshire Constabulary\nWhat others have to say:\n“As an experienced LP professional I believe that that the TFS approach to interviewing is like a breath of fresh air. The process driven methodology provides a practical framework that can be used to match all investigatory outcomes from low level disciplinary & grievance procedures to complex criminal investigations. An invaluable tool providing a significant ROI for investigators, especially those with limited experience, I highly recommend the programme.”\nGary Tattersall, Group Risk Manager, Jack Wills\n“As an experienced investigator working within an ever changing company, time considered for investigations has always proven to be limited. The TFS investigation and interview techniques offer a structured process that is easy to follow, quick to prepare and gets the results required whilst demonstrating a clear understanding of investigations in business and knowledge of employment law. I also liked the approach to the training, particularly with the role-play exercises, it makes it go beyond just theory.”\nLeyton, Morgan Head of Business Protection at Sally Salon Services\nSome of the best bits:\nHow to manage different personalities presented: Liar, truth, silence, mixture, etc. Tested repeatedly via Employment Tribunals G.D, Space.UK\nKnowing that failure to obtain an admission is not the end of the line S.D, JD Sports\nConfidence in doing the right thing practically and legally O.C, Sainsbury’s Supermarkets\nApplying a consistent model to unique situations A.H, Waitrose\nFlow chart system OC, TSS\nFantastic structured way / process to investigate TP, Tesco\n5 WH, flowchart of events MB, Selco",

      "description": "Hello and Welcome to “Energy Management Economics”. My idea while preparing for this course is providing a simple yet well explained material for anyone who is interested in The field of Energy Management. Whether you are coming from technical or non-technical background. Attending this course would help you having your first steps in the field, also helping you finding what next steps to take.\n\n\nThe course content is covered through four main sections\nSection 1: Life Cycle Costing Analysis & Financing\nIn first section, we are going to discuss the process of LCCA, and financial analysis starting from the common terminologies you may encounter during the course, difference between interest rate and effective interest rate, Future and Present value calculations.\nThen we’ll move to Capital Budgeting Techniques and in this part, we’ll talk about five of these techniques, Net Present value, Payback Period, Return on Investment, Internal Rate of Return and Hurdle Rates.\nFinally, we have the Financing and Alternative Financing options which are available for you to fund your energy projects. In this part we’re covering equity, debt, leasing financing and finally Energy performance contracting.\n\n\nSection 2: Energy Rates & Tariff Structure\nHere we’re going to understand how utilities are billing your energy consumption. And the difference between energy Consumption and Demand. Then we’ll discuss in detail how energy demand is calculated.\nDuring this section as well, you’ll know different types of Tariff Structures and how to read/analysis your energy bill and understand its components. Finally, we’ll see what’s Demand Response programs and why utilities offer such programs.\n\n\nSection 3: Energy Accounting & Benchmarking\nGoing then to the third section, where it’ll help you to understand how to perform Energy Accounting activities for your facility or project. And explaining the whole process steps from measuring, recording, and collecting to analysis your energy-related data.\nThe second part of this section will be for Benchmarking and assess how well your facility is performing. To do so we need methods or techniques to measure and manage your performance so we can judge how good or bad your facility performs compared with other projects or facilities.\n\n\nSection 4: Energy Procurement\nFourth and Final section would be for Energy Purchasing planning in different energy markets, different energy sources. What is the Energy Balance sheet and how to read it? And finally, Cost Allocation planning, why we need it and how to build it?",

You will learn by doing and gain hands-on experience with practical examples and case studies. You will be able to apply these concepts (and use the Excel templates) directly to your work environment for immediate impact.\n\nThe course includes one hour of videos, and its content is based on my books (Data Science for Supply Chain Forecasting and Demand Forecasting Best Practices) and the content of the course I teach to professionals and university students.\nIt should take you 2 to 4 hours to complete it.\n\nThe course only requires limited experience with Excel (such as using usual formulas such as average and sum).",

Everyone has a different meaning and purpose for wanting to achieve success. But one universal character trait is required. It takes a considerable amount of mental strength to stay focused on the path to personal success and fulfillment; especially when there are unexpected and inconvenient delays. Covid-19 was a major detour for many people.\n\n\nThe Center for Addiction and Mental Health published a white paper titled Mental Health in Canada Covid-19 and Beyond.  In it, one of the studies reports how “women, people who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, those who are worried about their personal finances, people with children at home, and young people are more likely than others to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression at this time.”\n\n\nYou may have been impacted by the Pandemic or know people who were. Adjusting to the New Normal will take persistency. Recovery will require resiliency and a new empowered approach to personal success. In this course, I personally train you to use my proprietary Empowerment Coaching Models so that you can empower yourself and/or clients to attain personal success.\n\n\nPersonal Success Life Coach Training Certification Course Content Overview\nWith over 10+ hours of video tutorials, 146+ downloadable resources ready to use, hands-on practice assignments, interactive learning and Q & A, this continually updated 2-Level Certification Course keeps you in-the-know. Let's break it down for you:\n\n\nFirst 3 Sections: The first 3 sections of your Life Coach Training are dedicated to teaching you the Personal Success 3 session interactive online Group Coaching Program.

I created frameworks for you to use that increase your competency during a coaching session. These help you understand at a deeper level why people struggle and the underlying patterns that stop them from being successful. You watch a client re-enactment to assess your own approach and with what you discover, adjust as needed before coaching real clients.\n\n\nNext 7 Sections: Now you are ready to coach people individually! The next 7 sections of your Personal Success Life Coach Training focus on the individual coaching sessions in the 6 life areas. The sessions are mapped-out, timed-out, done-for-you Personal Success Life Coach sessions complete with coaching questions, visualization technique resources, activities, exercises, and insight.

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nConsulting projects especially when it comes to the consumer goods business are very demanding. The two most complicated areas are sales and marketing and the supply chain. During consulting projects, I have seen business analysts and management consultants struggling to understand the business fast enough to deliver value to the customer. This course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project in a consumer goods business much easier.\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in analyzing and improving Slow Moving Consumer Goods businesses (SMCG) such as furniture, smartphones, cars, etc. It is designed for people who want to become management consultants, and business analysts or have to run and optimize SMCG businesses on daily basis. In the course, you will learn 4 things:\nHow to model SMCG business in Excel\nHow to improve sales and marketing in order to increase margin and profit\nHow to improve the supply chain in order to increase margin and profit\nHow the move from selling a product to selling a service will impact the business\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through cases, so most of the lectures are case studies showing some business problems solved in Excel. There will be also an overview of the main challenges in sales and marketing as well as the supply chain typical for SMCG. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels shown in the lecture so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nConsulting projects especially when it comes to the consumer goods business are very demanding. The two most complicated areas are sales and marketing and the supply chain. During consulting projects, I have seen business analysts and management consultants struggling to understand the business fast enough to deliver value to the customer. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project in a consumer goods business much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do during a consulting project devoted to an SMCG company. I will show you also how to model the SMCG business in Excel.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to build or to find improvements in SMCG business you should master techniques related to analyzing and optimizing sales and marketing as well as the supply chain. That is why, I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or business analysts that have to advise their customers but also to owners, founders of businesses as well as directors.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you find and analyze SMCG business.

      "description": "Note: Students who complete this course can apply for the certification exam by Quality Gurus Inc. and achieve the Verified Certification from Quality Gurus Inc. It is optional, and there is no separate fee for it. Quality Gurus Inc. is the Authorized Training Partner (ATP # 6034) of the Project Management Institute (PMI®) and the official Recertification Partner of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM®)\nThe verified certification from Quality Gurus Inc. provides you with 2.5 pre-approved PMI PDUs and 2.5 SHRM PDCs at no additional cost to you.\nThis course is accredited by The CPD Group (UK). You are eligible to claim 3.0 CPDs for this course (Accreditation# 1016215)\n\n\nThe Fundamentals of Reliability Engineering training introduces the fundamentals of reliability theory and practice. The course gives students an overview of how to apply reliability engineering principles to design systems and processes.\n\n\nReliability is the ability of a system or component to perform its intended function under specified conditions for an extended period without failure. A reliable product is highly likely to perform as expected over time. A product's reliability is directly related to its quality. For that reason, reliability is also called \"quality over time.\"\n\n\nThis course is designed as the first step for students of reliability engineering and persons taking the CRE exam. This course assumes that you do not have any prior knowledge of reliability engineering. This training will provide the knowledge and skills necessary to understand the basics of reliability engineering and its application to systems development.\n\n\nThe course consists of video lectures, readings, and quizzes that help build upon each other so that by the end of the course, you have gained a firm grasp of the topics covered.\n\n\nTopics Covered:\nSection 1. Basic Definitions: We will start this course by understanding the definitions of Quality and Reliability. In this, you will also understand why things fail and the consequences of failures.\nSection 2. Basic Measurements: In this section, you will understand the basic reliability measurements, such as the Mean Time to Failure (MTTR) for nonrepairable products and the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for repairable products. In addition, you will learn to calculate the availability and the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR).\nSection 3. Censored Data: In real life, the reliability data is not complete. In this section, you will understand various types of censored data and how to deal with them.\nSection 4. Failure Patterns: In this section, you will learn the Bathtub Curve in Reliability Engineering. You will understand three phases in the product life: Infant mortality, useful life, and wear out. You will learn to calculate the Hazard Function.\nSection 5. Improving Reliability: This section will cover various Reliability tests such as ALT, HALT, HASS, ESS and Burn-in.\nSection 6. Reliability Block Diagram: In this section, you will learn to calculate the system reliability based on the reliability of individual components. You will also learn about three types of redundancies to improve the system's reliability.\nSection 7. Exponential Distribution: Even though the intent of this course was to teach Reliability without using complex mathematical and statistical formulas. In this section, you will learn to calculate the Reliability in the constant failure zone using limited mathematical complexities.\n\n\nContinuous Professional Development (CPD) Units:\nFor the ASQ® Recertification Units (RUs), we suggest 0.25 RUs under the Professional Development > Continuing Education category.\nFor PMI® 2.5, preapproved PDUs can be provided after completing our optional/free certification exam. The detailed steps for taking Quality Gurus Inc. certification with preapproved PDUs are provided in the courses.",

      "description": "What is Clinical Data?\nClinical data is a staple resource for most health and medical research. Clinical data is either collected during the course of ongoing patient care or as part of a formal clinical trial program. Clinical data falls into six major types:\n•Electronic health records.\n•Administrative Data\n•Claims Data\n•Patient/Disease Registries\n•Health Surveys\n•Clinical trials Data\n\n\nElectronic Health Record\nThe purest type of electronic clinical data which is obtained at the point of care at a\nmedical facility, hospital, clinic or practice.\nOften referred to as the electronic medical record (EMR), the EMR is generally not available to outside researchers. The data collected includes administrative and demographic information, diagnosis, treatment, prescription drugs, laboratory tests, physiologic monitoring data, hospitalization, patient insurance, etc.\nAdministrative Data\nThese types of data are associated with electronic health records, which are primarily hospital discharge data reported to a government agency like AHRQ.\nClaims Data\nClaims data describe the billable interactions (insurance claims) between insured patients and the healthcare delivery system. Claims data falls into four general categories: inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and enrolment. The sources of claims data can be obtained from the government (e.g., Medicare) and/or commercial health firms (e.g., United HealthCare).\nPatient / Disease Registries\nDisease registries are clinical information systems that track a narrow range of key data for\ncertain chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, diabetes, heart disease,\nand asthma. Registries often provide critical information for managing patient conditions.\nHealth Surveys\nIn order to provide an accurate evaluation of the population health, national surveys of the\nmost common chronic conditions are generally conducted to provide prevalence estimates.\nNational surveys are one of the few types of data collected specifically for research purposes,\nthus making it more widely accessible.\nClinical Trials Registries and Databases\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Clinical Data Management?\nClinical Data Management is the process of handling data from clinical trials. The inherent goal of any clinical data management system is to produce and maintain quality data. Clinical data management is a critical process in clinical research, which leads to the generation of high-quality, reliable, and statistically sound data from clinical trials. Clinical data management ensures the collection, integration, and availability of data at appropriate quality and cost.",

I'm glad I took a chance on me to get out of my box and my need to be \"perfect\" and to just start”\n\n\n“After taking all 10 courses from Louise and working with 10+ clients and 150-200 hours of coaching during a period of 1 year, I find this master life coaching course amazing! The feedback from my clients was 100% satisfaction. The tools from the guidelines (extended with my own) are working very well and fit most scenarios. The quotes are spot on! If this review sounds too good to be true, well...it's still a real review, based on the feedback from my clients. Of course, your experience will depend on your previous knowledge, your clients, and how you apply the tools and learnings. You'll have to do a lot of learning and experiencing yourself, however, it is completely worth your effort. I grew and learned a lot about myself as well as many new things from my clients: self-limiting beliefs, social dynamics in romantic or work relationships, mindset, patterns that we learn in our childhood and follow later. I'm grateful to be learning with Louise! Thank you a million times”\n\n\n“I've been practicing coaching for a couple of years based on my education and experience. I realize to take it to the next level. I needed a life coaching certification to legitimize my practice. This course is providing everything I need, and I now realize there is a structure name for some activities that I have practiced with my group coaching clients and just did not know it! It is all I have anticipated. Looking forward to completion”\n\n\nPersonal Development Life Coach Training That Empowers Success\nImagine that you're asked to coach your colleagues around the world who have been negatively impacted by the crisis.

They asked them to describe the new normal and outline the skills required to succeed. Responding, they used terms such as “massive disruption”. They see a \"world of technology\" and fear that human’s “paleolithic emotions” will create further inequality between the haves and have-nots in our society.\nChange disrupts the status quo! Some change happens slowly while other change creates chaos and confusion. The more personally developed a person is, the better they can adapt and use change as the building-blocks toward new found success in every area of their life.\nYes, technological change is inevitable but people can develop an empowered personal approach to embracing advancement. In this course, I personally train you to use my proprietary Empowerment Coaching Models so that you can guide yourself and/or clients to discover untapped personal potential.\n\n\nPersonal Development Life Coach Training Course Content Overview\nWith over 13+ hours of video tutorials, 153+ downloadable resources ready to use, hands-on practice assignments, interactive learning and Q & A, this continually updated 2-Level Certification Course keeps you in-the-know.

      "description": "Halal and Haram are fundamental Qur'anic terms that regulate Muslim daily life including diet by the Islamic Law.\nOn the other hand, there is no doubt that demand for Halal products has become very important and powerful economic value in today's world. It is not only constrained to Muslims but also to non-Muslims consumers who are from different races, culture, and beliefs. Because a halalan-tayyiban product is clean, pure, nutritious, hygienic and healthy.\nHalal food and products usually are no longer produced locally, even in the Muslim countries. Muslim consumers nowadays are faced with a broad selection of products and services. Each product category offers many different brands.\nHalalan Tayyiban is an enforced religious requirement on products and services for Muslims’ consumption and is now considered as a quality standard. The concept of halal covers all aspects of the management system.  It is not only focusing on the point of production including sourcing of halal ingredients, but all elements that is applied to the product supply and manufacturing surrounding processed food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and medical products and has been extended to services involved in the logistics of halal products.\nTherefore, providing halal products to one-third of the world’s population offers many economic opportunities for the various industries. However, it makes assuring the halal authenticity of these products requires more challenge. For all of these reasons, understanding Halalan Tayyiban in the production level is very crucial.\nI have arranged this course to create an understanding of Halal with its implementation, its certification, management, and sustainability to ensure that the integrity of Halal is not compromised during the process.\nAnd please keep in mind that this course comes with the lifetime access to the course, that means you will have access to all the new lectures I will be adding in future for no additional cost!",

However, for many aspiring food truck owners, the initial financial barriers can seem daunting. The good news is that starting a food truck with little to no money is possible. Launching a food truck journey generally entails various expenditures. On average, the initial investment typically falls between thousands of dollars. These costs can fluctuate significantly, influence by your chosen food type, the truck's condition ( new or used), your selected operating location, and the necessary permits and licenses in your jurisdiction. Bank loans often provide a lump sum of capital, while SBA loans are specifically designed to assist small businesses, offering favorable terms and competitive interest rates.\nParticipating in a restaurant incubator program can be a strategic approach to secure funding for food truck startup. These programs offer not only financial support but also mentorship, resources, and a collaborative environment to nurture your culinary venture. Starting with minimum viable product can be a prudent method to secure funding for your food truck startup.\nTo kick start your food truck business without substantial funds, consider renting equipment or buying a secondhand food truck and equipment. Renting allows you to access essential resources without a significant upfront investment, making it an ideal option when starting a food truck business with limited capital.",
