Online licensing with agencies is different - you upload your photos and agencies do all the rest for you.\nDepending on your dedication, this can be a fun little set-it-and-forget-it project to support your hobby, or it can be a full-time adventure that pays for all your bills.\nThe course is packed with actionable steps and activities - make sure you follow along and participate in the activities!\nForget the money for a second, though: imagine holding a book with your photo on the cover, imagine your friends texting you \"just saw one of your photos in a magazine I'm reading!\". The satisfaction is priceless.\nJoin this course and learn all I had to trial-and-error myself over seven years. Learn what CUQQ - the four pillars of success - stands for. Learn how to optimize your workflow to get the results with minimal effort.\nSample student reviews:\n\"I am a total beginner at this and I feel like I've already learned so much. It is a very practical course, filled with how-to's and do's and don'ts. Thanks so much for sharing this!\"\n\"I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction, and I feel I have the tools needed to start selling my pictures online. The instructor is likable; he has a great sense of humor, and sets realistic expectations. He included some wonderful life lessons about dealing with feedback, and ways to spend one's earnings. [...] \"\n\"The course is well organized and the material is very concise. I particularly like the use of actual screen shots to support the topic. After viewing and reading a good bit on getting into stock photography, this course was exactly what I needed to take the final step toward getting my photos online.\"\nI'll see you in the course!\n(And when I say \"see you\", I mean it - this is not one of those courses where a guy reads his PowerPoint slides to you.

Get paid for YOUR photos! It's easier than you think!\nFrankly, there's more opportunity than ever before. But you need to follow a couple of simple rules - and avoid some common mistakes.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nRecent Five-Star Reviews!:\n\"Amazing Course!\n\nI've just completed the course, it is well explained and worth the investment. This course really provides whatever it says and I always love courses from Robert. He is a great instructor.\"\n\"Stock Photo Ninja!\nMr. Scot's course is direct and perfectly informative, taught with passion and a knack for getting to the crux of the subject matter. As a life-long point-and-shoot photographer, Mr. Scot has changed the way I shoot my pictures, and has opened my eyes to the money that can be made by turning my love for shooting into passive income. THANK YOU!\" _________________________________________________________________________\nI take you from the inside of the camera to the inside of the stock photo agency business.\nAfter a section on the ingenious mechanics of the camera, this course concentrates on how to sell those high-quality photos you've taken.\nIn this course, I teach you how to turn your love of photography into long-term, passive income.\nToday is the day to start; there's NEVER been a more profitable or more accessible time to sell your photos to stock photography agencies.\nWhen I started shooting stock photography with my Canon AE1, back in the 1980s, getting your photos sold through stock photo agencies required an extraordinary and expensive effort - from shooting to developing the photos to finding the agencies to getting approved.\nThe process has become much simpler these days - but the competition is fierce.\nBy sticking to the basics - and establishing a work-flow that ensures that you're creating the highest quality images in the appropriate format - you can quickly move to the head of the line - and start selling your photos right away.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nI shoot with a Nikon D800 - a truly remarkable photographic tool - but these days, there are high-quality smart phones that have what it takes to capture world-class images.\nIt's NOT about the camera! The key to making money in the stock photo business is your creativity, and attention to detail.\nThis course is designed to save you money and time - by discussing specifically what the top stock photo agencies expect - AND what they reject\nI discuss which categories are hot, and which are not.\nAnd, I list not only my favorite stock photo agencies to work with (and who are willing to work with YOU), but I've included a downloadable, clickable .pdf list of links to more than two dozen agencies to whom YOU should be submitting.\nNow, let me be clear, this is NO get-rich-quick scheme. You'll need to commit yourself to a substantial amount of effort and detailed diligence. But, follow my plan step by step, and you will have your photos uploaded and optimized, and selling in no time.",

We don't often acquire this set of skills from shooting or editing any other genres of photography.\nThis course is specifically designed to provide the skills needed to produce high quality real estate photographs with the beginner real estate photographer in mind.\nThis course is packed with over 2 hours of video covering the HOW and the WHY of real estate photography.\nWe begin with the absolute basics by talking about essential gear. We then move on to composition rules for real estate photography and how they help to achieve our goal. After that, we move on to a sample photoshoot. We walk through each room in detail, taking several angles of each room.\nPost-processing, or editing, is where the real magic happens. It can be a complex process for beginners who are new to Photoshop and Lightroom, but we break each step down into easy-to-understand parts so that even total newcomers can get comfortable in the workflow.\nAll topics are covered in extreme detail, perfect for beginners!\nThe goals of real estate photography\nBasic gear and how to prepare it\nFlash gear and how it works\nComposition rules\nThe techniques to produce high quality images\nProper exposure settings\nAchieving correct color balance\nWindow views\nSetting up Lightroom and Photoshop\nUnderstanding editing workflow\nMaking your images \"pop!\"\nExposure blending with layer masks\nRemoving \"color casts\"\nAligning verticals\nExporting your photos for MLS\nYou should have a basic understanding of general photography before beginning this course, although it is not required.

And in this course, I'd like to share with you the many things that I've learned and experienced in my great wedding photography adventure. And it really has been an adventure.\nAnd just in a nutshell,  so you know where I'm coming from, and please understand, I am saying this not to brag but, just so you know that I've been there and not someone who just read a book, took a course, did some research on the business of wedding photography and try and tell you how to do it.\nAs they say, I've walked the talk for many years and I've built a very successful wedding and portrait photography business. And along the way I've won many accolades and earned my degrees for my photography, along with many ribbon & trophy awards and Epcot displays.\nBut, enough about me. You can read by full bio in the profile section.\nSo, you’re probably wondering, what this course can do for you. Well, since I've been involved in the many aspects of running a wedding photography business starting part time in our apartment, then built a home studio that was very successful that we expanded into a commercial shopping center location for 20 more years.\nThen to make a long story short, sold my PA studio, moved to NC and pretty much started over on a smaller scale and came full circle as we renovated a home studio, that included a camera room, sales room and office. So, I’ve been there & back.\nAnd now that I've recently retired from the business of wedding photography, I'm able to devote my time to train other photographers who also have the passion and share some very valuable information with you.\nThis course is about making money in the business of wedding photography, not f stops, or apertures. Much of the information in this course will not be found in text books or photography classes.\nWith over 2.5 hours of instruction, here's some of what I reveal to you:\n1.

Book More Brides Using This simple Sales Method - Here I discuss how I came across a way to book more weddings using this simple technique.\n16. Sales Letters That Book Weddings - In this segment I share with you the sales letters I used to book weddings when we moved and started over in North Carolina.

I try to be always updated and do a lot of online training. Your course was the best and most complete course I have done on Real Estate Photography.\nMany congratulations on your course and for your concern in approaching all aspects of this subject in detail.\nRui Gomes from Portugal\n\nThe market for skilled photographers photographing jobs for real estate and architecture is huge. Business is booming in commercial and residential construction.\nHomebuilders, property managers, construction companies, hospitals, retirement communities, hotels, manufacturing facilities, magazines, and real estate ventures all have a use for architecture and real estate photography. Architecture interiors are one of the most challenging subjects to compose and light. There are ambient light issues, color balance issues, and lighting issues.\n\nFor the photographer skilled at shooting quality photography, there is plenty of business photographing homes, real estate, and commercial properties for architects, builders, developers, and real estate agents.\nWhoever you shoot for, it is all architecture photography in one form or another yet each property will have a unique set of challenges that will dictate your photographic approach.\nIf you are planning to shoot architecture and real estate photography, then this online course is created just for you!\nThis course is geared toward intermediate through professional photographers.\nYou'll receive a broad overview of:\nPhotographic lighting\nLearn how to add light to room interiors\nCompose a strong composition.\nYou will also learn how to see the light quality\nHow to manage highlights and shadows\nHow to choose the right lighting accessory for the scene\nWhy use an umbrella over a lightbox\nand manage the color of various ambient light sources\n\nJoin award-winning commercial photographer Charlie Borland as he shares his knowledge in a step-by-step approach to photographing architectural properties.\nYou will learn how to light interiors without the room looking lit, how to manage lighting color balance, how to make the inside balance perfectly with the outside, how to find a storytelling angle, how to deal with poor light, how to fix bad color, how to work fast to be more profitable, and a whole lot more\nYou will learn how to light when there is no place to put your lights. And, we'll show you the latest methods in using Photoshop to enhance and composite your images as well as a complete Lightroom editing video series.\n\nWhat's covered:\nThe difference between real estate photography and architectural photography\nHow to see light and shadow.\nThe different qualities of light, color balance, and color correction.\nThe best equipment and how it works.\nHDR for architecture photography\nWhich light best applies to your subject.\nLighting color management: How to mix strobe with ambient light.\nLighting in offices, manufacturing plants, and home environments.\nThe disappearing lights technique.\nHow to light with strobes and how to light with flash.\nand how to use Photoshop  and Lightroom to create photos you can't do in a single capture\n15 hours of HD video, practice RAW files, and pdf downloads\nWhat will you learn?\nThere are many ways to shoot architecture photography and the method you choose will be based on how your images will be used. Are they for a realtor, a home builder, a commercial developer, or maybe an architect? Depending on who you are shooting for will depend on how you approach the photography and this course covers many methods that can be applied to each type of client.\n\nYou will learn how to shoot without supplemental light.\nHow to process a basic digital file quickly.\nHow to shoot for HDR.\nHow to process for HDR.\nHow to light a room with strobes.\nHow to deal with reflections.\nHow to replace lights, lamps, and windows.\nHow to fix distortion.\nHow to fix the bad color.\nHow to light a room with flash.\nHow to shoot for Photoshop.\nHow to use the hide-a-light technique.\nAnd many in-depth Photoshop techniques for beautiful architectural photography.\nAnd...practice photo files are included for download so you can master the art of processing images.\nYou will learn techniques that allow you to work quickly on low-budget assignments and how to create beautiful architecture photography for high-end clients as well.\nCourse requirements:\nPhotoshop is used widely in the course and while you do not need to be an expert, some familiarity (primarily Layer Masking techniques} will make it easier for you. But if you are not that familiar with Photoshop, don't worry, we have some introductory Photoshop videos that will guide you along the way.\nYou will need a digital camera with a wide-angle lens. For full-frame sensor cameras, a lens around 16-35 is perfect and if you have a cropped APS sensor camera then a wide-angle lens around 10-20 will work as well. If you don't have lenses in that range but do have a wide-angle lens then use it for the course and learn what you need for later purchase. You need a good tripod and a cable release or wireless device to trigger your camera. I also recommend wireless triggers to fire the strobe/flashes.\nThis course covers lighting extensively and includes several techniques. You will learn how to shoot architecture without lights, with strobes and umbrellas, and also with a flash unit.\nWho’s the Instructor?\nThere are many courses on how to be an amazing photographer, but how many are taught by true professionals who have a career and worked as a photographer?\nI was formally trained at Brooks Institute in the 1980s and have worked every day since. I have photographed for Fortune 500 companies, been published in countless magazines (you’ve probably heard of), and photographed Hollywood actors, pro athletes, politicians, hotels, well-known products, real estate, and more people, places, and things than I can recall.\nI have taught photo workshops across the USA and the Middle East. Founded two stock photo agencies, and sold thousands of stock photos. I love to teach and want to ensure you succeed and love photography in your own way. You can trust me to teach you photography!\nAre you ready to create stunning architectural photography?\nThen join me in this online adventure and in no time, you will gain a better understanding of how to create great photographs.\nAre you ready to discover simple and easy-to-follow strategies for creating effective real estate photography that I have used for 30 years in my professional business?\nWant to learn more about this course? Click to watch the video above.\nEnroll today!

I just started shooting real estate photography professionally this year in January and just shot my 220th home this past week. I am really looking to expand to more towards Architects, Designers, and Builders, and your course has definitely helped me with all of the above. Thanks again for giving such great insight into your experience as a photographer.\nChris Burk\n\nHi Charlie, - I took your class online at Udemy, Mastering Architecture and Real Estate Photography, and it led to my first architectural shoot being a huge success.  Thank you for this clear, informative, extremely helpful class.  Getting this client, and doing a great job at it, was a pivotal point in my career.  I am grateful. - Warm regards, Steven S\n\nI have never seen such a detailed and comprehensive set of lessons in all my online experiences and I have been taking courses since 2005. Don't look any further! -Fran S.\n\nProfessor,\nAll I can say is WOW!!! Great course, especially in Photoshop layering and masking. I take my hat off! There is not a single word I can say to express how grateful I am for you sharing your knowledge, I am doing everything you showed in this course in Real estate photography, especially in my Classic virtual tours, and this is great. Thank you Thank you Thank you.\"-Pedro\nI worked as a photographer + darkroom for 20 years and needed to transition to digital photography. This course has covered everything - camera use, interior/exterior lighting, equipment, photoshop, camera raw, photo mix, creative solutions, photography workflow, pricing, time management (& more). I have worked offline applying each of the techniques. I couldn't have learned this much in a full-year photography course. Outstanding, Mitchell M.\n\"Hi, Charlie.\nThanks a million, your course was/is absolutely awesome and I've learned a lot. The best is I've already started applying the knowledge gained and it made a big difference in the way that I take photos as well as in the post-processing stages.\nI would recommend this course to everybody doing architectural and real estate photography. I'll definitely work through this course again and again, in order to learn as much as I can.\nThanks again!\nKind regards and have a great day.\"\nHenk\n\"I have never seen such a detailed and comprehensive set of lessons in all my online experiences and I have been taking courses since 2005. The detail and explicit directions are just what the newbie needs. I have not engaged in architectural photography before and so this was an added bonus for me. I have previously taken courses with Charlie, and he is my ace when it comes to flash, but now also when I wish to learn more about photographing buildings and homes. Don't look any further!\" -Fran S.\nThis course was the second tutorial that I purchased on architectural photography. The other course was by a photography blog and had \"some\" great information but it just wasn't the same as this course. The advantage of this course is Charlie's methodical pace and detailed instruction coupled with Udemy's convenient interface. I have watched this course on my desktop, phone, tablet, in a waiting room, in bed, in my shed, and in my car, and all of the devices have tracked my progress flawlessly. In my other course, all I received was the video footage, 2 files to edit, and a rudimentary table of contents with time markers for topics covered. They didn't even put in chapter markers for me! The videos had to be loaded on each device I owned and I had to write down the minute markers where I left off to continue watching later. (Very frustrating and that course was over $100) If you're a busy professional and want a course that is ready whenever and wherever you are, this is great! Lastly, the deal I got on the course was ridiculous for such valuable content.\n-Milton V.\nDear Mr Borland,\nYour Mastering Architecture and Real Estate Photography\" course really helped me dramatically improve my real estate photography and bring it to a higher level.  I am currently working as a realtor in Athens Greece and looking at the photos of properties we have on the internet was really disappointing. Three months ago I decided to do something about it and I had a discussion with the owner of the Real Estate Agency and proposed to him to let me photograph at least the most expensive properties. Although I convinced him that I could do it and although I own a DSLR camera and have an experience with photography, I was feeling insecure about the quality of my photos. Therefore, I decided to search the internet for relevant courses and articles that might help me improve my RE photography and this is how I saw your course offered through Udemy. I immediately bought it and today I am so glad I did. It is very comprehensive and analytical, with a step-by-step guide of all the techniques you need to use in order to have a great result. It basically covers every aspect of Architecture and Real Estate Photography from the exterior to all the interior spaces and from a day to a dusk photo shoot of a property. The course has helped me a lot also with all the post-processing techniques that it offers, which are again explained in a very comprehensive way. Going through all the lessons and applying all the techniques I learned through the course, with just the basic gear of a camera, wide-angle lens, and a tripod, gave me the confidence I was missing before purchasing the course. I have already done a few photo shoots for the company and every day I am being asked to shoot more and more properties. Thank you for helping me realize my dream, - Katerina.",

      "description": "The premise of this course: to tell in detail about photostocks and their specifics. About how exciting it is and, at the same time, they also pay for it. In recent years, they began to accept content from mobile devices, therefore, uploading a photo to Instagram or Facebook - why not upload it to a photo bank with the ability to sell it. In our time of digitalization - this is a great solution!\nPhotostocks have existed since the early 2000s, but many do not take them seriously, but in vain. Photostocks came out in earnest in 2003, with the emergence of the top and now Shutterstock. Yes, back in 2000, the second powerful competitor, iStock, was born, but with the advent of Shutter, everything went much more fun.\nThese two stocks \"made the wind\" in the world of photo content and its sales.\nIn parallel with them and later, all sorts of depositphotos, bigstockphoto, alamy, dreamstime and a dozen more appeared. The selling were actually 3-4 photo stocks.\nFor those who are not yet in the subject and want to try themselves in this business, I advise you to start exclusively with the top five that I advise in the course. These are the leaders\nwho are really selling something.\nAll information and all content in the course is exclusively mine. Personal experience of staying at photo banks for over 10 years. Everything is told and shown at the most accessible level and the course rating, like Lego - from 0 to 99 years.\nI would be glad to see your feedback and comments, as well as successful followers! Enjoy watching!\n\n\nЦель курса: подробно рассказать о фотостоках и их специфике. О том, как это увлекательно и в то же время за это еще и платят. В последние годы стали принимать контент с мобильных устройств, поэтому загрузив фото в Инстаграм или Фейсбук – почему бы не загрузить его в фотобанк с возможностью продать.\nВ наше время цифровизации - это отличное решение!\n\n\nФотостоки существуют с начала 2000-х годов, но многие не воспринимают их всерьез, а зря. Фотостоки начали всерьез развиваться в 2003 году, с появлением топа, а теперь и Shutterstock. Да, еще в 2000 году родился второй мощный конкурент — iStock.\nно с появлением Shutter все пошло гораздо веселее.\nЭти две акции «взорвали» мир фотоконтента и его продаж.\nПараллельно с ними и позже появились всякие депозитные фото, bigstockphoto, alamy, Dreamstime и еще с десяток. На самом деле в продаже было 3-4 фотостока.\nТем, кто еще не в теме и хочет попробовать себя в этом деле, советую начать исключительно с пятерки, которую я советую в курсе. Это лидеры которые действительно что-то продают.\nВся информация и весь контент курса исключительно мой.",

      "description": "【超初心者用】いきなりPhotoshop！写真加工「切り抜き＆合成フォトレタッチ」マスター講座へようこそ。\nこの講座は、Adobe Photoshop（フォトショップ）歴20年超のプロが開発したコースです。\n\n\n有名企業のウェブページ、書籍用画像（写真集含む）、写真スタジオの写真画像のフォトレタッチ等、納品実績豊富な講師が「仕事でよく使う」テクニック（商業写真のPhotoshopレタッチ方法）を講座内容に「凝縮」しました。\n\n\n最新の『非破壊編集（ひはかいへんしゅう）』によるPhotoshopレタッチ方法を実演しております。\n楽しく「作例」をクリアしていくことで、着実に「実務で役立つテクニック」が身につきます。\n※ 当講座はAdobe Photoshop CCが必要です。（体験版もOK）\n※ Adobe Photoshop Elements（廉価版）は不可\n\n\n■ 非破壊編集とは？\n非破壊編集（ひはかいへんしゅう）とは、『元になる画像データを壊さずに編集するフォトレタッチ方法』のことです。\n近年、最新のPhotoshopデータは「非破壊編集」で作れるとより重宝されます。\n\n\n\n\n■ 非破壊編集で編集可能なPSD（Photoshopデータ）を作る\n昔ながらの「破壊編集」したPhotoshopデータを入稿するベテランの方も実はまだまだ多いです。\n破壊編集とは、消しゴムツール、ブラシツールなどで、元の写真画像を壊しながら編集することです。\n直接、写真にトーンカーブ、色相彩度などを適用しても元のデータを壊してしまいます。\n\n\nそれに対して、非破壊編集でpsdファイルを作成することができるとそれだけで付加価値が生まれます。\n何度も流用するデータは特に「非破壊編集」で作れるようになると重宝します。\n\n\n\n\n■今から学習をスタートする優位性\n今から、最新手法を「実学」として学べる初心者は有利になります。\nいきなりPhotoshopで「非破壊編集」をベースに習得できます。\n\n\nこれは、Adobe Photoshop CCの「最新ツール」を使えば難しくありません。しかも効率が最初から良いです。\n短期間で求める画像編集が可能になります。\n\n\nもっと言えば、技術の更新がストップしているベテランの技術者を一気に抜き去ることができます。\nこれは、沢山本を読んだりネットで調べても、「具体的」によくわからない人が大半だと思います。\n\n\n現実に非破壊編集で納品できる人は少ないです。それは、外注するほど実感します。\n\n\nこのコースは「作例」で遊ぶようにPhotoshopを操作することで、自然に「非破壊編集」できるようになる学習構造になってます。\nその理由は、理屈で「わかったつもりになる」のではなく、実際に「いきなり」やったほうが早く確実だからです。\n\n\n\n\n■ Photoshopのレイヤー機能を使いこなせ！\nPhotoshopは「レイヤー機能」がとても大切です。\nその中でも「レイヤーマスクサムネイル」と「調整レイヤー」が重要です。\n上記を正しく使うことで『修正に強いデータ』を作ることができます。\n\n\nさらに「スマートオブジェクト」も上手に活用することで非破壊編集が加速します。\n後から、変更したくなった時に「部分的な微修正」で手軽に対応できます。\n\n\nこれは、WEBデザイン（サイト、ブログ、LP（ランディングページ）、サムネイル、バナー等）、DTPデザイン（紙媒体）で写真画像のフォトレタッチ用データ作成の基本になります。\n\n\n\n\n■ AI（人工知能）の「Adobe Sensei（アドビセンセイ）」とアルゴリズムを活用する\n最近、PhotoshopはAdobe CCの中でも特に「最新機能」のAI（人工知能）「Adobe Sensei（アドビセンセイ）」とアルゴリズムを活用した新機能の追加が大量に増えてます。\n最新機能のツールとしてAdobe Photoshop CCで今すぐその機能を利用できます。\n\n\nそのため、昔のように「ペンツール」でパスを作って切り抜き範囲を手作業で作れなくてもだいじょうぶです。\n最新機能を使いこなせば「今からPhotoshopをはじめて勉強するよ！」という方も、いきなりプロレベルの作業効率が実現します。\n\n\n\n\n■ Photoshopはいきなり楽しい！\n実は、Adobeのソフトの中でも「Photoshop」は初心者の段階から楽しい珍しいソフトです。\n他のソフトは、最初とても難しく感じます。『基礎基本』になる操作が大切です。\nその理由は「応用」で基礎力がないと「挫折」するからです。\n\n\n例えば Adobe Illustratorなどの学習は特に「基礎基本」が重要です。\nそのため必然的にコース内容もスパルタ式で厳しくなっております。\n\n\nしかし、Photoshopの場合は「いきなり実例」から入ってもなんとかなることが多いです。\nそして「面白いゾーン」に初期段階から入ることができます。\n\n\nだから「いきなりPhotoshop！」です。\n\n\nいきなり応用からスタートしひたすら「面白く」Photoshopをマスターしましょう。\n一つ一つの作例の課題を焦らず楽しみながら進めてゴールまで到達してください。\n\n\nぜひ最後まで作例をクリアし最高の「達成感」を味わってほしいです。\n\n\nそれではゴールでお待ちしております！",

Wrong! I’ll explain why in Module 1.\nWhat to never do with a drone, and why (If you get this wrong, customers will walk away and you’ll lose a lot of money).\nHow to effortlessly film a property and create a cinematic look.\nThe art of effective video editing that immediately catch the interest of the viewers.\nHow to publish your videos and raise awareness of your brand.\nWhat you should do when dealing with clients.\nAnd much more!\n\n\nFor way less than the price of a single professional video, my blueprint will teach you invaluable skills that will let you use your drone to its full potential, sell properties quickly and be the envy of your colleagues.\nFrom learning how to fly a drone, dealing with clients, editing and publishing videos, we'll cover everything you need to know, no fluff. If you’ve never flown a drone or have no idea how to edit a video, this course is for you. If you know the basics but want to dig deeper, this is also a course for you.\n******************************************************************************************\nA contemporary, high quality real estate listing is not complete without a professional looking video. Over the last few years, the proliferation of high quality, inexpensive drones allowed essentially anyone to get into drone video production. The resulting videos tend to be… hideous, often negating all the effort that was put into the filming and editing and making the listing look cheap.\nThen there’s the difference between a video that’s of good technical quality and a video that adds this little something. An emotional connection. That’s what sells a property.\nLearn how to create professional, emotional real estate videos with my proven step by step system.\n******************************************************************************************\nBy the time you complete the course, you’ll have a complete system designed to approach potential customers and share a portfolio that sells. And the more you use it, the less time it you’ll need to complete a video. So more customers, less time = more money doing what you love.",

      "description": "There is something inherently beautiful about natural light. It can be soft and warm, or hard and unforgiving, or even have a sort of melancholy to it. These are the areas we will be looking at in this course.\nFashion and Beauty photography make use of natural light in many ways. A recent viewing of Vogue (October, 2012) reveals many natural light photography shots by up and coming and well established photographers. The techniques are not hard to understand, but still require the finesse and deliberate approach that is required when using artificial lighting.\nWe will look at natural light from all angles; full sun, modified sun, shade and moody, emotional light.\nWe will build some inexpensive modifiers for natural light, and also show how to correctly use white reflectors, silver and gold reflectors, scrims, mirrors, and more. These tools are not expensive, but the results they give can be astounding.\nThe natural light fashion/beauty photography course is divided into 12 lectures, each running approximately 30 minutes. There is a workbook, plans for building a scrim and large reflector, and lots of videos.\nMost lectures include a shoot with the gear we are using, a Photoshop tutorial, the PSD file for viewing and a look at how the final images were selected. Looking at the images as they are shot, and then edited, is very powerful as a learning tool.\nIf you are interested in portraiture, fashion, beauty or glamour, this natural light photography course will open your eyes to the very cool ways you can use natural light to make your images.\nThe beauty photography course is suited to any level of photographer. I recommend a light meter, although we will also show you ways to use your camera meter as we go. A couple of stands would also be a good addition to your natural light arsenal.\nThis class also has over two hours of bonus content, with new content being added in May 2013 and June 2013.",

En el capítulo de retoque me acompañarás mientras edito imágenes en lightroom, viendo todos mis pasos y secretos. Como ejercicio deberás editar tus propias imágenes. Te enseñaré a importar el material, seleccionarlo y ordenarlo. Una vez lo tengas, harás la combinación de fotografías de bracketing. Te mostraré cómo se hace las correcciones de lentes, la rectificación de verticales, usaremos las curvas de nivel y todos los ajustes básicos y avanzados con pinceles y clonados. Cambiarás el tono y el balance de blancos.\n\n\nCuando todo esté listo, harás la exportación y los últimos retoques en Photoshop para dejar tu proyecto perfecto para entregar.",

      "description": "Earning money doing something you love is an awesome experience!\nHowever, it's nowhere as easy as you might think as the market is full of photographers trying to do the same thing. Many of the obvious photography \"jobs\" are super saturated or simply don't exist any more and the career path of a photographer simply doesn't exist any more in any traditional sense.\nThis course shows you how to make money doing something you love!\nIf you don't know where to start in making money from your photography then this course will give you all of the information you need.\nYou will learn about multiple income streams, what the pros and cons of each are, what you need to consider to work in each and how to go about starting to get work.\nYou will learn tactics and techniques that I have used for many years to earn my living as a photographer and benefit from my real life experience.\nYou will come away from the course clear in the knowledge of which ways of earning money as a photographer will work for you and ready to dive in to getting started earning money.\nThe course isn't a list of stock photography websites and doesn't show you how to actually take photographs! It's all about looking at creative, often new ways of making money from your photography and includes multiple numbers of income ideas and techniques that really work and will earn money for you with some hard work and dedication!\n\nThe course is ideal for competent photographers who love taking pictures but don't know where to start making money from them. It's ideal if you're wanting to create additional income and also invaluable if you are planning on eventually making photography your full time career.\nRemember, I've fed my children and paid my rent since 2003 as a professional photographer. I'm ready to pass on the knowledge of how to do that to you so enrol on the course now!",

This course will get you taking great property photos in just 4 hours.\n\n\nThe course includes:\n\n\n2 hours of Property Photography training videos\nTeaching aids to accompany the videos\nA document explaining common camera functionality\n\n\nProperty Photography Course Content\nThis course is broken into sections. First, we deal with the camera and equipment you could use.\n\n\nUnlike other trainers, I am realistic about the budget you may have for photography gear. Perhaps, you have no influence over the equipment you get to use.\n\n\nIn this section, I explain all the different options and the pros and cons of each.\n\n\nIn this section we don’t just cover cameras, we look at tripods, flashes, lighting equipment, lenses and remote controls. I also tell you how you can work with the equipment you have, even if it is not ideal.\n\n\nThe next section is Photography Skills. Many trainers like to make photography sound complicated – it is not. I will keep it simple and focused on what you need to know to take great property photos. We will start with the simple stuff and just build it up until you have the knowledge to take great property photographs like a pro\n\n\nEnsuring that the photo shoot is a success is determined before you even arrive at the property. We cover what to do before the shoot to make sure it is a success. These are the things that if you educate your property owners on, will ensure a successful shoot.\n\n\nThe next section follows on to Preparing The Property. This section is the final touches of getting the property right before taking the photos.\n\n\nWe are finally ready to start taking property photos! We build on all of the technical skills you have learnt earlier in the course to make sure your photos really ‘pop’.\n\n\nThe next section looks at Inventory Photos and how to be take them.\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is for anyone who wants to take great property photographs, including:\n\n\nLandlords\nProperty Managers\nReal Estate Agents\nLetting Agents\nServiced Accommodation Providers\nHoteliers\nDevelopers\nHomeowners\nAnyone wanting to set up a Property Photography business\n\n\nEquipment Needed\nIt makes me laugh that for certain courses you need to have equipment that is completely out of reach for most property & Real Estate professionals. This course will teach you to make the most of the photography equipment that you have, give you the pros and cons of equipment options, as well as showing how to work around not have all the latest and greatest gear.\n\n\nThe minimum equipment needed for this course is a camera – any camera.\n\n\nIf you have a top of the range full frame camera – great! If you have the cheapest compact – no worries! This course is open to all.\n\n\nExperienced Photography Coach\nThere are other options for learning how to take great property photos. However, how many of them are designed by an experienced photography coach and professional jobbing property photographer?\n\n\nI own Landlord Photography, a UK Property Photography company with multiple offices. I am also still an active property photographer. Before becoming a property photographer, I was a photography trainer.\n\n\nYou are in good hands.\n\n\nI focus on the skills you need to take photos of the ‘bread and butter’ properties that the majority of property professionals are dealing with on a daily basis.\n\n\nThe course includes all the tips and tricks I have picked up along the way as a property photographer.\n\n\nGet this course now to start taking great property photos that sell properties.",

      "description": "In this course you'll learn a lighting technique for interiors photography that I developed over the years. I call this technique Creative Lighting.\nCreative Lighting gives you the most precise control over light you could possibly imagine. I’m talking surgical precision here, trust me. Lighting your scenes creatively makes you step from the realm of technical challenge into the realm of ultimate creative freedom, and these are completely different worlds. The technical drama suddenly becomes a white canvas for your imagination.\nThink about shooting products in the studio. In the studio there's no such a thing as the \"available light\". You don't use the light coming through the windows to light your product. You build the light from scratch, with all the freedom in the world, limited only by your imagination. But... what if you could enjoy this freedom while shooting interior scenes too? Well, this is what I'm gonna teach you here. In this course you'll learn how to master light in a way you never thought even possible. You'll learn how to make light behave the way you want, even interact the way you want.\nThis, of course, will open the doors for all kind of architectural and real estate, but specially for commercial, advertising interiors photography - and that's where you'll find some of the highest paying jobs.\nThe knowledge you'll acquire here will add some extremely powerful tools to your professional toolbox, trust me. It's gonna change the way you look at interiors - even at products photography. So join me in this course, learn Creative Lighting and widen your professional horizons right now!",

      "description": "This is the first commercial photography course to be designed and taught by a photography consultant with over 20 years of experience working not only as a photographer, but as a magazine photo editor, advertising agency art buyer, and photography rep.\nIn this Commercial Photography Masterclass, I will teach you everything I know about the business of commercial and editorial photography. You will learn how to best build and present your photography portfolio to potential clients, and reach out for the jobs and assignments that you really want.\nThis course is geared toward professional photographers at all levels of experience who want a better understanding of how to work within editorial, advertising and commercial markets.\nWe are going to start by defining your niche, or specialty, and target market. This will be the foundation of the course, what I call your Lighthouse for editing your work. Then I will teach you effective and authentic marketing skills to help you land assignments that light you up.\nCourse organization:\nModule 1 is an introduction to commercial and editorial photography key definitions and key players.\nYou’ll learn about the different roles at the kinds of brands and magazines you want to shoot for, what the titles mean, who selects and hires photographers, and what they want to see in your portfolio. I will provide a glossary of industry terms and insider lingo for you to reference throughout the course and your career.\n\n\nIn Module 2 we are going to home in on what niche of photography you want to specialize in and how to define your target market if you haven’t already or if you need to narrow it down.\n\n\nThis will be your Lighthouse for the rest of the course.\n\n\nModule 3 will show you how to edit your work to present a clear and outstanding website to your target market. We’ll also discuss print and tablet portfolios as well as branding.\n\n\nModule 4 covers everything you ever wanted to know about marketing your photography business for editorial and commercial assignments. You will learn about creating contact lists, networking, social media, email communication and print marketing. These lessons are packed full of guidance, examples, resources and actionable advice.\n\n\nModule 5 will give you an introductory understanding of rates, estimates, bidding, licensing and contracts for commercial and editorial photography.\n\n\nWith each module I will include examples, templates, homework, as well as helpful downloads.\n\n\nWhen you are done with this course, you will have a well-defined brand, the tools to find the people who hire photographers, and an understanding of how, when and how often to reach out to them.\n\n\nThe lessons in this course are not intended to cover the business of wedding photography, family portraits, senior photos, head shots, fine art, selling prints or stock photography (what I refer to as retail photography). Those are all very lucrative areas to be working in, but not my area of expertise.\n\n\nThis course is not designed to enhance the business of retail photographers, however it is an excellent course if you are looking to transform your retail business into more commercial work and gain a better understanding of editorial and advertising photography.\n\n\nThe course information is derived from my experience working in the United States. Markets and rates can differ in other countries, but much of this guidance is applicable to global markets.\n\n\nThis course focuses heavily on marketing, communication and portfolio building. I will not be teaching about shooting, lighting or other technical aspects of photography.\n\n\nWhy learn from me? ? I am a photography business consultant with over 20 years of experience working in the photography industry as a photo editor for magazines and television networks, as an art buyer and photography producer for national advertising agencies, and as a photographer representative and agency owner in New York City, California, Texas and other markets.\n\n\nI am also a photographer who has worked on commercial and editorial fashion, portrait and interiors assignments. My photography has been published in magazines, on the covers of albums, on digital billboards, in books, and in ad campaigns.\n\n\nI have worked with brands like Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Teen Vogue, The New Yorker, Esquire, UPS, Allstate Insurance, Universal Records, Disney, Netflix, Paramount, MTV, 7-Eleven, Mary Kay, Essence, James Avery, JCPenney and so many more.\n\n\nI am thrilled to be sharing my deep knowledge with you in this course — not only from my experience behind the camera, but from all of the roles that I have served in over the past two decades. I am grateful for this platform to be able to share all of this information in one place, especially now, to help photographers keep growing and elevating their businesses.\n\n\nI hope you will join me! #ImRootingForYou ✨",

Il corso ti guida passo dopo passo attraverso i segreti per realizzare scatti perfetti di qualsiasi ambiente, sia utilizzando una fotocamera sia il tuo smartphone.\nInoltre il corso ti fornisce preziosi consigli su come valorizzare gli spazi interni ed esterni, sfruttando al meglio la luce naturale e artificiale e utilizzando tecniche di homestaging per rendere gli ambientipiù accoglienti e attraenti.\nQuesto corso è stato appositamente progettato per tutti coloro che desiderano padroneggiare l'arte della fotografia immobiliare, sia professionisti del settore che privati che vogliono migliorare le proprie competenze fotografiche per annunci di vendita e affitto. Con spiegazioni chiare ed esempi pratici acquisirai competenze e tecniche che ti permetteranno di presentare gli immobili in modo professionale, aumentando le possibilità di venditao affitto.\nNon perdere questa opportunità di investire nel tuo successo nel mercato immobiliare! Iscriviti al nostro videocorso e trasforma le tue fotografie in un potente strumento di vendita che ti farà risaltare tra la massa.\n\n\nIn dettaglio, ciò che andremo ad affrontare insieme si divide in 4 fasi principali\nL'analisi degli attuali annunci immobiliari: cosa funziona e cosa non funziona nelle fotografie che si trovano in rete nei vari portali di affitto/vendita di case e appartamenti\nLa visita virtuale ad un immobile preso in esame: analizziamo i suoi interni, il mobilio e decidiamo cosa va tolto e cosa lasciato\nLa scelta degli oggetti che utilizzeremo per la fase di Home Staging: acquistiamo o reperiamo elementi di arredo da posizionare nello spazio, in modo da renderlo piu gradevole alla vista e dare la sensazione di una migliore vivibilitá\nHome Staging: diamo vita ad uno spazio rinnovato collocando sapientemente tutti gli oggetti reperiti\nIniziamo a scattare: si parte dalle fotografie grandangolari (che ben rendono lo spazio) decidendo angolature e altezze. Procediamo poi con le fotografie di dettaglio, che serviranno a creare una gallery più interessante.\nPost-produzione: una volta tornati al computer scarichiamo i file e iniziamo a correggere le foto. Regolazione dell'esposizione, apertura delle ombre, chiusura delle luci, saturazione, ecc. Tutti interventi che mirano a rendere ancor piú bello lo scatto. In questa fase vedremo le azioni base che si possono eseguire con qualunque software e App preferita dal singolo fotografo.",

      "description": "Czym jest kolor? Jakbyś odpowiedział na zadane pytanie? W jaki sposób opiszesz kolor czerwony, jak wygląda magenta, lub jak wyrazić kolor niebieski? Nie jesteśmy w stanie wyjaśnić koloru bez nazywania ich, jednak jesteśmy w stanie to wyrazić je poprzez opowiadanie historii.\nW tym kursie dogłębnie przyjrzymy się kolorom wpływającym na zdjęcia, lub jak możemy zbudować atmosferę na zdjęciu poprzez pracę z kolorem. Proces poprawy i procesowania koloru nazywamy - Gradowaniem.\nMusze się zgodzić że każda część retuszu jest ważna dla zdjęcia, jednak kolor jest tym elementem który ma największy impakt na finałowy odbiór i na to jak twoje zdjęcia będą widziane.\nDlaczego kolor jest tak ważny?\nPamiętaj, że zdjęcia to nie tylko klatka z ludzkiego życia. Zdjęcia opowiadają historie, a kolory są kontentem zdjęć. Twoim zadaniem jest sprawić by ludzie czuli emocje patrząc na zdjęcia. Chcesz pokazać co Ty czujesz poprzez swoje zdjęcia, nie ważne czy jesteś fotografem, czy retuszerem podobnie jak ja.\nDla mnie, jako retuszera kolory są najważniejszą częścią obrazu i informacji stojącym za nim. Jest to rownież ulubiona część mojej pracy. Pracowanie z czerwienią by pokazać silne emocje, pójście w roże by dodać delikatności, czy praca z kolorem niebieskiem by odbiorca mogł poczuć komfort.\nTo jest to czego was uczę. Dlaczego ten kurs jest specialmy? Bo nie tylko będziemy tutaj rozmawiać o teorii, a w większości czeka nas praca na prawdziwych przykładach.\nW tym kursie będziemy pracowali na kilku przykładach, na zdjęciach przy naturalnym swietle, studyjnym, portrecie, jak i modowym. Więc nie ważne czym się zajmujesz - na pewno znajdziesz coś dla siebie.\nMarcin",

Students will also need some type of camera to capture their small product or jewelry images. However, these cameras can include using an iPod, iPhone, iPad, smartphone, point & shoot, mirrorless or DSLR camera. Whatever camera you use, it will be helpful if your camera or lens has macro capability.  It will be helpful if students have some understanding of an image editing software program that will also be needed if they wish to do some final cropping on their images. An understanding of Adobe Photoshop will also be helpful if they wish to perform some of the more advanced editing that is discussed in this course."

      "description": "LATEST: Course Update - March 08, 2024\nDo you know that great looking photos can dramatically make a difference in what the perceived value is of the item you are photographing? Yes, it’s true. Several years ago I started helping my wife build her eBay business while creating the photos of jewelry and small products that she was selling. Over and over again I saw her sell her items on eBay for many times more than what she paid for them. Her items sometimes would sell for 35 or 50 times more than what she paid. Sometimes even more than that.\nWhat’s the difference between the items? Nothing, except the photos that she showed were beautiful. They were lit and composed beautifully, had interesting backgrounds and overall, had the look that you might see in the photographs displayed at high end jewelers and department stores. As the result, this gave them a much higher perceived value and her customers were willing to pay more for these items.\nYou are probably wondering, what’s the big deal? What makes these photos look so great? Can anyone learn to take photos like these? Yes, I absolutely believe anyone can? Here’s why:\nI have been a professional photographer for many years. Our studio specialized in portrait & wedding photography and we were quite busy. When she asked me to help her take her photos of jewelry and small products she started selling, I started doing so in a simple, easy and quick way since I didn’t have too much time to spend on her photos, I was quite busy taking my own photos and running the studio.\nWhat started as a simple and quick photo session of her items, has evolved through the years. I was able to fine tune the lighting, the set-up and overall way we photographed her items. Our method has remained simple, quick, easy to learn, and consistent. We step into our small studio room we have designated for taking these photos, turn on the lights, and begin the photography.\nIf you would like to learn how you can take photos of the small products or jewelry you are selling, consider enrolling in this course. Instead of photographing your items on a carpet or bed spread with bad lighting. Say NO to bad photos and start making more money. Whether you are selling your own products on your own website or small products on eBay, I truly believe this course can help you.\nIt really doesn’t take any more time taking outstanding and professional looking photos. I even show you several lighting methods and techniques you can use. Some of them cost very little and some of them are free.\nThere’s even a pretty good chance that you may already own a camera that is more than adequate and has the potential to produce these amazing photos. The only thing that may be missing is the knowledge you need to start taking more professional looking photos by using the methods I show you, step by step, in this course. Enroll today, say NO to bad photos and start making more money.",

In this case, an ambient light together with a flash light.\nYou will see the entire shooting, as well as through an hour backstage video, I will also comment those backstage videos.  I’ll share with you the entire process, you’ll see me missing the right shoot and also getting it right.\nAs this technic also requires some practice, and as you probably will have to cope with some difficulties, I guess it will be helpful.\nAfter all this shooting and technical part of the tutorial, and as usual, we will step into the post production process. Using both Lightroom and Photoshop, after a selection of images, I will show you the way I merge those shot together in order to create some strong final visuals.

Photos are all around us and have become a very important communication tool and a language, especially in business transactions. This is why product photography is one of the most important types of commercial photography and should not be underestimated. Gaining some knowledge about it seems indispensable, regardless of the industry in which you work.\n\n\nWhat will you learn?\nIn this training course, we will guide you through the basics of working in a studio with a flash, starting from equipment and ending with practical exercises. Then you will get to know the most important issues related to product photography. We will present the ways of taking photos of various products depending on their shape, form, colour and texture. These elements are very important in this type of photography. You will also learn how to take photos of objects which reflect light, for example those made of metal, glass, leather and plastic, and objects on white or black background. You will also learn how to arrange lights and get example lighting setups, how to add reflections and how to come up with scenic design in creative advertising photography.\nThe course is divided into two parts: working with studio lighting and product photography. It means that some issues related to using studio equipment may be repeated. However, you can never get enough of technicalities, so even if you repeat something twice, it will pay off when you work in a studio. After all, practice makes perfect. Good luck!\n\n\nYou will learn how to work in a studio with professional lighting\nYou will get to know how to connect your camera to studio lamps\nYou will get to know lighting setups useful when working with models\nYou will learn how to use specific light modifiers\nYou will learn how to take photos depending on the texture, shape and colour of the product\nYou will see how to take photos of products made of metal, plastic and glass\nYou will photograph objects on white or black background\nYou will get to know how you can add the reflection of an object\nYou will learn the techniques used in creative product photography",

      "description": "BE A STOCK CREATOR.\nOne day I noticed a way out. I realized I could use my own creativity to make passive income online. I learned how to sell videos, photos, and vector illustrations of old finished projects so they could be used by buyers all over the world.\nThis is not only a career for photography & videography professionals. But a path for everyone starting with iPhone Photography, Drone Photography, Travel Photography or even iPhone Filmmaking.\nSo, here are 3 reasons you should be selling Stock Footage & Stock Photography.\nEarn while you learn. It doesn't matter if you're a professional or beginner if you have a digital camera and know your way around it, it's enough to get started. You can even get started with mobile photography\nBring dead projects to life. If you've been using your photo or video camera for a while or have been working on motion graphics or illustrations, you have money sleeping in your HD. Make them useful again by selling them to buyers on stock agencies like Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, VideoHive, Pond5, GettyImages, etc.\nPASSIVE INCOME: Sales happen no matter if you're working, sleeping or traveling. \"You're not only going to learn how to sell your footage & photos on stock agencies – it's way beyond that. You'll learn how to set your own passive income.\"\nThis course was made for every creator, wherever you live or whatever the photo/video gear you have. I'll show you the way to go from zero to passive income.\nBeginners will learn how to do their first upload to a stock agency in less than 30 minutes after starting the course.\nAdvanced contributors will learn the advanced techniques of the pros to speed up the workflow and increase earnings.\n\n\nI often find creators dealing with this struggle, just as I did. Hating their day jobs, not being able to enjoy what they're doing and losing love for their art just because the need for money took over it. For many times I caught myself thinking if selling my time in exchange for money was what my life would always be about.\nGetting more money won't necessarily make you happier, that's why we actually focus on slowly building financial freedom. Being financially free means you don't need to waste your life doing things you don't like just because you need the money. It means you don't have to decide between projects looking for money only. Cause you don't need that money desperately.\nTHIS ISN'T EASY MONEY\nSelling Stock Footage & Stock Photography is far from a promise of easy money. If that's what you're looking for, I don't believe this course is for you. This course is made for creators interested in selling stock videos, photos or even illustrations to buyers all over the world. By growing your portfolio in the right direction, you'll be able to set a passive income source.\nIf you're not sure yet this course is for you, I invite you to watch the free lessons. The investment to enroll in this class can be quickly repaid by taking action and implementing the techniques revealed.\nOnce I understood there is a way out, and after living it for more than 6 years, I took the decision to help other creators do the same.

However, not all photospheres are created equal. In this course, we will focus on the highest quality production process possible.\nThis course will provide you with industry-standard expertise in purchasing equipment, acquiring, processing, and stitching panoramic images, and publishing them to a website and Google Maps, and Kuula. Additionally, we will upload more interactive experiences to a web hosting platform and view these using web browsers, phones with cardboard, and headsets.\nIn addition, we will explore how we can augment or enhance the user's experience using image popups, embedded video, pinned video, spatial audio, and links to websites, and documents. All of these features currently work on standard web browsers but only some of them are supported by Web XR on other devices. We will explore and test the current support level of these various enhancements and ways to work around others while the technology is catching up. Welcome to the bleeding edge of technology!\nI will walk you through the process that I use to create high-quality panoramic images using a DSLR camera and Sigma 8mm fisheye lens.
