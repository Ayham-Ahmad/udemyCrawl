      "description": "Master course in employee performance management 2.0\nWhy do we need Performance Management?\nThe process or system of measuring and improving performance within an organization is performance management. Typically, performance management is used to monitor individual performance, but it can also be used to monitor performance at an organizational and departmental level. There are a few common elements to a performance management system:\nA performance review, a manager-to-manager meeting, peer feedback, a performance improvement program, goal-setting, tracking, rewards and recognition\nTypically, managers track and develop their team members' performance and then report to their higher leadership team. Employees used to get annual performance reviews as part of the performance management process. In recent years, research has shown that frequent feedback is more effective than annual reviews, so many companies have dropped the annual review model for regular manager check-ins and informal feedback sessions. By making small adjustments over time instead of trying to make one big course correction at the end of the year, this type of performance management can help employees understand and align with company goals and objectives.\nIn this master course I would like to teach the 5 major topics.\n1. Introduction and importance of employee performance management 2.0\n2. Employee onboarding, orientation and performance appraisal\n3. Strategies for employee retention in human resource development\n4. How to measure and improve employee performance in a hybrid world?\n5. A step-by-step guide to effective employee performance management",

There are numerous examples in this course to help you understand the key concepts. In the Course, I have tried to balance between simplicity and technicality. While the flow of the content is simple, few technical words can not be avoided and I have explained these words. You will also be able to develop the skill of reading and interpreting a Bare Act. With the knowledge of the Code that you gain from this Course, reading the Bare Act of IR Code 2020 will be easy for you.\nI have kept a forward-looking approach and avoided going back to the legacy.\nThe objective of this course is to build your skills on labour laws so that you can handle real-life situations, manage inspections and audit at the workplace. For a start-up organisation or for a student, this course provides an approach to managing workers and workplace issues. The case study in the course will give you an insight into negotiations with Trade Union.\nLabour Law is a practising field and you gain expertise only by practising it.",

Competency based interviews can be used by organizations across all sectors. A competency-based interview is more systematic and each question targets a skill needed for the job. Competency based interviewing, often referred to as situational, behavioral or competency interviews, are a style of interviewing often used to evaluate a candidate’s key competencies, particularly when there are a number of candidates who have the technical merit for the role.\n\n\nAnd It is one of the most important steps that any company goes through when forming its own team. Because the success of this step means choosing the most appropriate and most efficient elements to work in the organization, which will reflect positively on productivity and performance, and thus increase profits.\n\n\nBased on the previous point, the employment interview is of great importance to you, either for the company to gain the employee who is able to change its course, or to hire the person responsible for its collapse.

Requiring degrees or a certain amount of experience often excludes talented candidates who have gained skills through non-traditional paths—whether that’s on-the-job learning, certifications, or life experience.\nAs organizations struggle to fill open roles, expand their talent pipelines, and meet equity goals, many are rethinking how they define and evaluate talent. But dropping degree requirements from job descriptions is just the start. Becoming a skills-based organization requires a thoughtful, practical reworking of how jobs are defined, how candidates are evaluated, and how hiring decisions are made.\nI'm delighted to have you join me for this course where you will learn more about the benefits of transforming into a skills-based organization. I’ll walk you through practical strategies and examples, grounded in research and real-world applications, to help you identify and remove the barriers that prevent you from accessing and supporting top talent—especially those from nontraditional backgrounds.\nIf you’re a leader, a hiring manager, or member of an HR team working within an organization that wants to make the shift from traditional, credential-based hiring to a more inclusive, skills-based approach—this course is for you!\nWhether you’re just starting to explore skills-based practices or are trying to move from theory to action, this course offers a clear, research-informed path forward. Along the way, I’ll share practical strategies, examples, and tools you can apply immediately—no matter the size or stage of your organization.\nIf you want to make hiring more effective, inclusive, and future-ready, this is where to start.",

It has been produced with two groups of people in mind: (i) anyone interested in taking their understanding of the subject to the next level; and (ii) managers with a responsibility for developing and sustaining a culture rooted in equality, diversity and inclusion. It comprises three video-based lessons:\nLesson 1: Understanding the complexities: PCS analysis This lesson, divided into four parts, presents a helpful framework for understanding how and why the issues involved in equality, diversity and inclusion are so complex. PCS analysis serves as a useful analytical tool for making sense of those complexities. It begins by revisiting the key concepts of equality and diversity.\nLesson 2: Beyond political correctness Many of the difficulties around equality, diversity and inclusion revolve around the use of language. However, the simplistic political correctness approach of simply banning certain words has created more problems than it has solved. This lesson, also divided into four parts, provides a much more realistic approach to the complex relationship between discrimination and language.\nLesson 3: Making it a reality Embedding equality, diversity and inclusion into a workplace culture is a challenging matter, and so this lesson explores steps that can be taken to equip you to rise to that challenge as effectively as possible.\nThere is also a module companion workbook that you will need to print out before you start the course. It contains space for notes plus an exercise relating to each of the three lessons. This is an important resource for you, as it will help to extend and consolidate your understanding and provide you with a set of notes to act as a reference source for future development.",

      "description": "Managing emotional reactions means choosing how and when to express the emotions we feel. People who do a good job of managing emotions know that it's healthy to express their feelings and are more productive at their workplace.\nThere are healthy and unhealthy emotions. Unhealthy or toxic emotions lead to burnout, anxieties, depression, and a whole load of physical illnesses.\nStudies show that high stress levels are costing businesses more than $300 Billion in the US alone. High blood pressure, fatigue, scattered thinking, anger and sleeplessness are some of the side effects to high stress.\nUnderstanding how emotions work gives you the key to managing your emotional response. Your emotional responses don’t necessarily have much to do with the current situation, or to reason, but you can overcome them with reason and by being aware of your reactions.\nEmotion is a form of stress because it activates the body’s physiological and psychological responses, similar to how stress functions. Emotions, whether positive (joy, excitement) or negative (fear, anger), trigger biochemical changes in the brain and body. When emotions like fear, anger, or sadness are prolonged or unmanaged, they can contribute to chronic stress.\nNot all stress is harmful though. Positive emotions can create a type of stress called eustress, which helps with motivation, focus, and performance. Feelings like excitement before an event trigger stress responses that improve cognitive function and resilience.\nSince emotions are deeply tied to stress responses in the body, whether they trigger distress or motivation depends on how they are processed and managed. Recognizing emotions as a form of stress allows us to develop better emotional regulation strategies for improved mental and physical health.\nYou can change how you feel. The key is to be aware of your emotional response and understand what might be behind it.",

      "description": "STARTUP FOUNDING OR STARTUP MANIPULATING?\nCreating a startup is a hard endeavor. For everyone involved.\nHowever, there are some injustices that may occur.\nWithin the startup itself (among founders and employees), with clients, investors, and in the broader ecosystem.\nIt's important to know which types of manipulation occur, as well as how each type can be leveraged in a startup environment.\nThis is what this course will cover.\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn about the nine main types of manipulation you can fall prey to (consistency manipulation, emotional manipulation, effort manipulation, standard manipulation, pressure manipulation, identification manipulation, fact manipulation, context manipulation and labeling manipulation;\nYou'll learn about how the psychological principle of consistency works, and how people use it to force others to act in alignment with what they have said or done before;\nYou'll learn about the persuasion technique of active choice - forcing someone to state something in the first person, such as \"I will do this\" or \"I will buy\" in order to force them to keep aligned with their statement later;\nYou'll learn about the persuasion principle of escalation of commitment. By asking for small favors or small agreements, you can then ask for bigger and bigger ones later;\nYou'll learn about why getting someone to take action on something makes them more likely to value it. For example, the IKEA effect - you will like more a piece of furniture if you've put in effort towards assembling it yourself;\nYou'll learn about how habits are a form of consistency. What you do once, twice ends up becoming ingrained in you;\nYou'll learn about the psychological principle of rationalisation - how people make emotional decisions, and then later try and justify them with logic;\nYou'll learn about how emotional manipulation works, by forcing the other side to feel a specific emotion, or feel guilty for their actions against you, such as emotional blackmail;\nYou'll learn about how hype and desire work by building up something in a person's mind, regardless of its actual value in reality;\nYou'll learn about how the concept of twisting the knife works, by making someone visualize the nightmare scenario of something to later drive them to action;\nYou'll learn about how bullying and emotional blackmail work, taking negative actions and forcing the person to feel responsible for them;\nYou'll learn about how fear and panic work. If you \"press someone's buttons\", you can easily drive them to action emotionally;\nYou'll learn about why emotional manipulation relies on the victim identifying with the person's reactions, and how the key in avoiding it is to eliminate those trained reactions;\nYou'll learn about the psychological concept of perceived effort - why, when something seems easier to do, people are more likely to do it - and how this effort can be changed;\nYou'll learn about how \"low-effort words\" such as \"quick\", \"simple\" and \"easy\" can be used to make something seem less effortful;\nYou'll learn about how reducing the number of available options makes people take action more easily (the paradox of choice);\nYou'll learn about how preempting doubt and negative situations can drive people to action (tackle their objection before they even have it and they are more likely to do something);\nYou'll learn about the concept of implementation intention (asking someone \"How would you do this?\" or \"What would it take?\" makes them visualize it, which makes it less effort, and makes them more likely to do it);\nYou'll learn about how inserting structure and/or progress into a process makes people more likely to finish it (\"You are at step 3 of 4\");\nYou'll learn about how standard manipulation works by having different standards for different people or elements;\nYou'll learn about how standards can be made different by hiding the criteria used in the first place;\nYou'll learn about how standards can be manipulated by making exceptions for specific people;\nYou'll learn about how motivated reasoning works (we do more diligence on the things we don't like, and vice-versa);\nYou'll learn about how unexpected rigidity changes standards (on paper, the requirements are the same, but unofficially, there are different things that different people must comply with);\nYou'll learn about how standard manipulation relies on hiding the criteria used in the first place, and the key to disarming it is through transparency, and forcing comparisons between cases;\nYou'll learn about how pressuring the other person using your presence and intensity is a dangerous type of manipulation;\nYou'll learn about how intimidation in specific works, by pressuring the other person so much you prevent them from even talking or contesting you;\nYou'll learn about how urgency works by forcing you to make an unprepared decision, using, for example, deadlines, or limiting the availability of something (in reality or just in your perception);\nHow bluffing and escalation dominance work - the other side takes action repeatedly as to never give you an opportunity;\nYou'll learn about how identification manipulation works, through the other side pretending to have something in common with you to make you more influenceable;\nYou'll learn about how empathy works, showing understanding of the other side, but also how it can be manipulated to make you feel understood and be more influenceable;\nYou'll learn about how affect labeling works, decreasing the intensity of your emotions by addressing them verbally, and stopping you from feeling emotions intensely;\nYou'll learn about how mirroring works, making someone feel subconsciously understood, which leads them to trust the other side more and be more influenceable;\nYou'll learn about how common ground works - mentioning tastes or life experiences in common with others to make them trust you more and be more influenceable;\nYou'll learn about why the biological principle of caring about others makes us tend to be nice to others who understand us - or pretend to - and makes us open to manipulation;\nYou'll learn about how fact manipulation works through simplifying, hiding or just lying about facts;\nYou'll learn about how statistics can be misleading by changing axes, comparisons, timeframes or others;\nYou'll learn about how lack of transparency about competing or contradictory information can make fake facts seem more real, and why comparison with other elements is crucial to avoid this type of manipulation;\nYou'll learn about how context manipulation works - by changing what you compare something to, you change its perceived value;\nYou'll learn about how you can choose what you contrast something to in order to change the value of something ($20 book vs. $10 ones is expensive, vs. $70 ones is cheap);\nYou'll learn about how you can change the option set you place yourself in to change your value and manipulate the other side (for example, as a professional, comparing yourself to other teams, to other people in the same team, to other people in the same position in the past, or other comparisons);\nYou'll learn about how the peak-end effect works - by having one highlight and ending on a high note, people forget about negative or boring parts of a presentation;\nYou'll learn about why context manipulation relies on us subconsciously accepting the options we're given instead of contesting them;\nYou'll learn about how labeling manipulation works - by giving something a specific name, even if simplistic or negative, it tends to stick, and spreads easily;\nYou'll learn about how bullying works by using negative labels - labeling someone a \"failure\", or \"loser\", or similar, and making it spread;\nYou'll learn about how stereotypes are a type of labeling manipulation - labeling a large quantity of people with simplistic names;\nYou'll learn about how the presence or absence of a name can humanize or de-humanize someone, making them a \"true person\" or a nameless stranger;\nYou'll learn about how scientific-sounding words can be used to make something seem of higher authority, without actually changing anything in it (saying \"a theory\" instead of \"a thought\", or using words in product names such as \"quantum\", \"exponential\", \"atomic\" or similar);\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit. I don't want you to waste your money.\nIf you think this course is a fit and can take your knowledge of how to protect yourself from manipulation to the next level... it would be a pleasure to have you as a student.\nSee on the other side!",

The advantage of this facility is that you NEED NOT have visual basic installed on your PC, however, installing Office will implicitly help achieve the purpose.\nYou can use VBA in all office versions, from MS Office 97 to MS Office 2013 and any of the latest versions available. Among VBA, Excel VBA is the most popular. The advantage of using VBA is that you can build compelling tools in MS Excel using linear programming.\nApplication of VBA\nYou might wonder why to use VBA in Excel as MS Excel itself provides loads of inbuilt functions. MS Excel provides only basic inbuilt functions which might not be sufficient to perform complex calculations. Under such circumstances, VBA becomes the most obvious solution.\nFor example, it is very hard to calculate the monthly repayment of a loan using Excel's built-in formulas. Rather, it is easy to program a VBA for such a calculation.\nAn HR Management system is used to handle employees' items' data work like editing, adding, and transferring. There is much software on the market and the free license covered some of this work. You can now build with this simple article your own software easily using a few lines of code.

Here are some instructions on how to effectively use ChatGPT for content creation:\n1. Access the ChatGPT Platform:\nYou can access ChatGPT through various platforms and applications, such as OpenAI's GPT-3, chatbots, or integrated APIs. Choose a platform that suits your needs\n2. Define Your Content Objective:\nClearly define the purpose and objective of your content. What are you trying to achieve? Who is your target audience? What is the main message or topic you want to convey?\n3. Start the Conversation:\nOpen the chat interface and initiate a conversation with ChatGPT. Address it as if you are having a conversation with a writing assistant. For example, \"Hello, can you help me write a blog post about [topic]?\"\n4. Provide Context and Guidance:\nGive ChatGPT context about the content you want to create. Include key points, ideas, or any specific instructions you have in mind. The more specific your guidance, the better the results will be\n5. Request an Outline:\nIf you are looking for an outline or structure for your content, ask ChatGPT to provide an outline with headings and subheadings. For example, \"Can you give me an outline for a 1,000-word article on [topic]?\"\n6. Generate Content:\nChatGPT can generate content based on the information and guidance you provide. It can create paragraphs, sentences, or ideas for your content piece. You can ask it to draft the entire piece or provide input paragraph by paragraph\n7. Review and Edit:\nReview the content generated by ChatGPT. While it can be quite helpful, it may require editing and refinement to meet your specific style, tone, and quality standards\n8. Iterate as Needed:\nIf the initial content isn't exactly what you're looking for, you can continue the conversation with ChatGPT to make revisions and improvements. Ask it to provide alternative suggestions or refine existing content\n9. Add Personal Touch and Expertise:\nInject your personal touch, expertise, and unique insights into the content. While ChatGPT can provide a foundation, your expertise and voice are essential for authentic and valuable content\n10. Proofread and Finalize:\nAfter editing and refining the content, proofread it for grammar, spelling, and consistency. Ensure that it aligns with your content objectives and guidelines\n11. Publish and Share:\nOnce you are satisfied with the content, you can publish it on your website, blog, or platform of choice. Share it with your target audience\nTips:\nBe as specific as possible when providing instructions to ChatGPT\nMaintain a consistent writing style and tone throughout the content\nUse ChatGPT for idea generation, research, and content assistance, but remember that it's a tool to complement your own creativity and expertise\nRespect copyright and plagiarism guidelines. Always attribute sources and ensure the content is original or properly cited\nUsing ChatGPT for content creation can be a valuable resource, especially for generating ideas, overcoming writer's block, and drafting content efficiently. It's a powerful tool to have in your content creation toolkit\n\n\nPerformance Management Process Why and How\nPerformance management is a systematic process that helps organizations align their employees' work with the company's strategic goals, monitor progress, provide feedback, and support employees in their professional development. It is a crucial practice for various reasons and can be implemented effectively by following a structured process. Here's why and how you should implement the performance management process:\n\n\nWhy Implement a Performance Management Process:\nAlign with Organizational Goals: Performance management helps align individual and team goals with the overall strategic objectives of the organization. This ensures that every employee's work contributes to the company's success\nImprove Employee Performance: By setting clear expectations, providing regular feedback, and offering development opportunities, performance management can enhance employees' skills and abilities\nMotivate and Engage Employees: Employees who receive consistent feedback, recognition, and support tend to be more motivated, engaged, and satisfied in their roles\nIdentify and Address Performance Issues: The process helps identify underperforming employees and enables managers to address performance issues through coaching, training, or performance improvement plans (PIPs)\nEnhance Communication: Regular performance discussions foster open and transparent communication between employees and managers, enhancing understanding and collaboration\nSupport Career Development: By focusing on employee development and growth, performance management can help individuals advance in their careers within the organization\nFacilitate Compensation Decisions: Performance management results often inform decisions related to pay raises, bonuses, and promotions\nHow to Implement a Performance Management Process:\nDefine Performance Expectations:\nClearly articulate job roles, responsibilities, and performance expectations for each employee. Use SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals and key performance indicators (KPIs)\nRegular Feedback:\nEncourage regular one-on-one meetings between managers and employees to provide feedback on performance. These discussions should be a two-way dialogue\nPerformance Appraisals:\nConduct formal performance appraisals or reviews periodically (e.g., annually) to evaluate performance against established goals and expectations\nRecognition and Reward:\nRecognize and reward outstanding performance. This can include verbal praise, bonuses, promotions, or other incentives\nDevelopment Plans:\nWork with employees to create development plans that outline skill-building opportunities and career growth paths\nPerformance Improvement Plans (PIPs):\nWhen employees are consistently underperforming, implement PIPs that outline specific improvement goals, timelines, and support mechanisms\nTraining and Coaching:\nProvide training and coaching to address skills gaps and help employees meet their performance expectations\nDocumentation:\nMaintain clear and comprehensive performance records, including meeting notes, feedback, and performance appraisals\nFeedback Surveys:\nCollect feedback from employees about the effectiveness of the performance management process and make improvements accordingly\nLegal and Ethical Considerations:\nEnsure that your performance management process complies with legal and ethical standards, including equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws and data privacy regulations\nContinuous Improvement:\nRegularly review and update your performance management process to adapt to changing organizational needs and industry trends\nImplementing a well-structured performance management process is essential for organizations seeking to enhance employee performance, align with strategic goals, and promote a culture of continuous improvement and development.

      "description": "Sun Tzu (or Sūn Zǐ in pinyin) was a 500 BC Chinese general, military strategist, and author of The Art of War, an immensely influential ancient Chinese book on military strategy. Many great leaders like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan study his work and became legendary leaders. Many corporate leaders paid thousands of dollars to attend courses to learn Sun Tzu secrets.\nWe believe that you too can learn to master his secrets with just two hundred dollars. This is because we take the essence and compile them into a 63-minute video course that will leave you with just enough materials to lead your team to greater heights.\nThe most valuable lesson out of his 13 chapters of 5,000 words must be found in the 3rd chapter: Win Without Fighting.\nAs translated from The Art of War: Generally, in war, the best thing is to take the enemy state whole and intact; to ruin it is inferior to this. To capture the entire army is better than to destroy it. Hence, to win on hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill.\nTo subdue the enemy without fighting is supreme excellence. In short, win without fighting is the best.\nHow does it apply to your people management?\nThe enemy here refers to not your enemy but the team that you are leading\nTake the enemy state whole and intact means you must lead your team wholly with not just their bodies, but also their minds, hearts and spirits\nNever destroy the bodies, minds, hearts and spirits of your team. So you cannot over-work them for you will be destroying their bodies and minds. You also cannot break their hearts by not delivering on your promises and make them give up on you\nTo win without fighting in people management is to manage without your team knowing that you are managing them. A manager is at his best when people barely know he exists, when the work is done, the team will say: we did it ourselves. This is because the manager has empowered the team so much and they have become so competent that they are mini managers themselves.  This must be the highest form of management: manage without managing\nIf you too want to be a great leader, learn from the master.\nFor this first time in the world of Udemy, we bring Sun Tzu Art of War into your hands. If you too want to be a better people manager, invest $200 into this valuable course. It will reward you with thousands of dollars, benefiting you for a lifetime.\nContents of this Udemy Sun Tzu People Management course includes:\nPeople Management is about Battles of the Mind\nThe background behind Art of War: Story of the Concubines\nArt of War: Win To Fight\nFive Elements of Art of War: Purpose, Climate, Support, Leadership and Methods\nSeven Conditions to Win\nHow to Win Without Fighting\nThe Five Strategies of Art of War\nFive Ways of Deception\nThe ultimate of Art of War: Win the Entire Nation\nIf you have always wanted to be a good people manager but don't know how here is the way. You'll be pleasantly pleased with what you've learnt from this highly entertaining and educational course People Management with Sun Tzu Art of War",

      "description": "Transfer of training refers to the ability of a learner to apply the knowledge, skills and behavior gained from a training situation to a real life scenario. A positive transfer of training must result in enhanced learner capabilities, improved job performance and better organisational results. This course, \"Transfer of Training\", will help you understand the concept of training transfer and learn the nuances of implementing it at your workplace.\nEvidence from research shows that approximately 20 percent or less of training skills and knowledge are applied back at the workplace. This not only nullifies the money and time invested in training interventions, but also renders the whole training exercise futile. This challenging situation therefore demands attention towards improving the training transfer system in organisations.\nIn this course, you would be able to understand how to address the training transfer challenge at your organisation and also use the appropriate tools and techniques to facilitate seamless transfer. This course uses a blended learning approach that comprises insightful videos, challenging cases, reinforcing quizzes and practical micro-interviews with experts in the transfer domain. The course content has been designed keeping in view the requirements of organisations across diverse industry sectors and geographies. Most importantly, the course provides you with insights that are both relevant to workplace realities and are practically implementable.\nIn short, if you are wondering how you can get maximum returns on the training investment in your organisation, this course is definitely for you.",

Therefore, it is important to learn from them in order to prevent future similar occurrences, regardless of their real consequence and, especially with those whose real consequence was insignificant, but which had the potential to cause a greater loss. To learn from incidents it is necessary to investigate their occurrence by identifying what happened, how it happened and why it happened. In other words, it is necessary to identify the causes.

Therefore, it is essential to develop this skill so that the results of investigations are assertive and convergent, regardless of the group investigating the incident.

They can be very difficult to deal with because of the complexities involved. This course examines common features of such problems and offers guidance on how to rise to the challenges involved.\nThere are no simple or straightforward solutions, but having a better understanding of the issues involved places managers and HR professionals in a much stronger position when it comes to wrestling with the difficulties presented.\nThe tendency in some organizations to not pay attention to such problems and simply hope they will go away is a very unwise strategy that can lead to a vicious circle in which problems related to the use of alcohol and drugs lead to other problems (conflict, substandard work, deadlines not being met, health and safety problems, and so on). These in turn can put additional pressures on any worker who is misusing alcohol or drugs, potentially leading to an even greater reliance on such substances.\nWithout a good understanding of the key issues involved, efforts to address the problems are unlikely to produce positive results. This course therefore serves as important basis for addressing alcohol and drugs problems in the workplace.",

      "description": "Language has long been recognized as playing an important role in relation to discrimination. This is because it can, on the one hand, reinforce stereotypes and discriminatory assumptions or, on the other, play a part in challenging them and seeking to eliminate them. Unfortunately, however, the notion of ‘political correctness’ has oversimplified complex issues and created a great deal of confusion. This course dispels all that confusion by clarifying the relationship between language and discrimination.\nAn oversimplified approach that simply seeks to ban the use of certain words has contributed to many people dismissing important issues as ‘political correctness gone mad’. This is a significant problem, as it means that some perfectly unproblematic forms of language are disapproved of, while some forms of discriminatory language go unchallenged. In addition, many people avoid the subject because they fear being criticized for saying something deemed racist, sexist or otherwise unacceptable.\nDr Neil Thompson has written and taught extensively about equality, diversity and inclusion and the need to avoid and address discrimination. His experience over many years has taught him that confusions and oversimplifications about the role of language in discrimination are not only very common, but also do a lot of harm.",

      "description": "Compensation should be viewed as the strategic management of wages and salaries. Compensation management strives for internal and external equity. Internal equity requires that pay be related to the relative worth of a job so that similar jobs get similar pay. External equity means paying workers what other firms in the labor market pay comparable workers.\nThe objective of efficiency are reflected in attempts to link a part of wages to productivity or profit, group or individual performance, acquisition and application of skills and so on. It can be achieved through high employment levels and low inflation. It implies that employees will move to wherever they receive a net gain. Market rates as affected by supply, demand, and general movements in pay levels. Salary relativities between jobs within the organization depending on the values attached to different jobs.\nTo an employee, pay is a primary reason for working. For some individuals, it may be the only reason. For most of us, it is the means by which we provide for our own and our family’s needs. Compensation is also important to organization. It represents a large proportion of expenditure. Compensation is also significant in the operation of the economy.\nThere are 3 core decisions, those involving pay level, pay structure, and pay system.  Supporting there are 3 other decisions, concerning pay form, pay treatment for special groups, and pay administration.  All the decisions are influenced by a number of environmental and organizational variable. Examples of their variables are the economic, social/cultural, and legal environments; as well as the organization’s structure and workforce.\nCompensation decisions are also affected by the dynamics of the particular organization. Employee pay must be consistent within the organization structure. Finally, compensation decisions are affected by the worldwide information highway. The social environment is changing dramatically, following the entry of women into the workforce. Valuing diversity while taking compensation decisions is very important.\nVictor Vroom formulated Valence Instrumentality Expectancy (VIE) theory. Valence stands for value, Instrumentality is the belief that if we do one thing it will lead to another, and expectancy is the probability that action or effort will lead to an outcome. An incentive or bonus scheme works only if the link between effort and reward is clear, and the value of the reward is worth the effort.",

Do you need help driving positive cultural change and securing widespread leadership support? If so, this course on strategic diversity and inclusion management is meant for you! In the modern world, more employers and businesses recognise the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\nFrom building diverse talent pools to deconstructing stereotypes, many leaders are helping to create inclusive environments that uplift marginalised groups. Despite growing support for D&I programs, there are still obvious disparities that need to be addressed. A report revealed that only 68.1% of the global gender gap between women and men had been closed. This indicates that women still trail men in major areas like economic opportunity and the ability to attain an education.\nOver a series of short video lectures, we will uncover the rich history of diversity and inclusion initiatives, providing you with valuable insights into their evolution and significance.

CHRO is a position on the board of directors .\nAccording to Forbes , business success is not only about being able to predict and plan for the future, but also about leading an organization thoughtfully and effectively. CHRO is a position that helps them guide the overall strategy and the workforce in a comprehensive way.\nThe role of CHRO in business\nLeadership and human resource development\nAs a senior position in the enterprise, CHRO is responsible for creating and nurturing human resources - the core factor for success and sustainability. Accordingly, they will be the ones to build and implement human resource strategies that are suitable for the goals such as planning recruitment, training, talent development, monitoring and evaluating human resources , etc. Through that, employees are always developed to meet the changing requirements of the market and the enterprise.\nInternal communication\nInternal communications are an integral part of the CHRO’s role. The CHRO must establish and maintain effective communication channels to ensure that all employees are kept informed of new policies, goals, and changes within the organization. Good communication not only reduces resistance but also increases employee buy-in and cooperation.\nConvey positive energy about corporate culture\nCorporate culture is an invisible yet powerful force that determines how a business operates, how people communicate, and how they maximize their potential. CHROs are responsible for building and maintaining a positive corporate culture where each individual feels respected, engaged, and empowered.\nIn addition to leading and developing human resources, CHROs are also responsible for ensuring the physical and mental safety of employees. They need to be able to identify and address potential employee safety issues before they become serious problems.\nPioneer in using technology in human resource management\nWith the rapid development of technology, CHROs need to be pioneers in applying and managing human resource management tools and software . Thereby, daily tasks such as tracking attendance, measuring performance, transmitting information to employees, etc. are optimized and more effective.\nBy using a scientific KPI tracking system, CHROs and CEOs can identify which employees need improvement, as well as those who have made positive progress or contributions to the business. Through this, they can measure the most appropriate and accurate payroll and other welfare indicators for each employee.\nBridge to the leadership\nAs a bridge and strategic human resources advisor to the board of directors, CHRO will work with other management levels such as CMO , CPO , CFO, CCO , etc. to conduct data analysis, assessment, identify needs and build competency frameworks. This not only helps the board of directors find suitable candidates but also ensures that human resources are always ready to meet future business goals.\n\n\nBest HR certifications: PHR and SHRM\nProfessional in Human Resources (PHR) by the HR Certification Institute (HRCI)\nThe HR Certification Institute is a well-known resource for continued education for HR professionals. Their most sought-after certification is the Professional in Human Resources (PHR).

      "description": "Mental health problems of various kinds are very common in our society, although many people – and organizations – prefer to pretend that they do not exist. In this course introduced by wellbeing expert Dr Neil Thompson, mental health expert Dr Suki Desai explains the significance of mental health issues and clarifies why workplaces need to take them seriously. This fits very well with the current fully justified emphasis on the importance of mental health and wellbeing in the workplace.\nMental health issues are complex and can prove quite challenging. This can lead to many people backing away from such challenges and hoping to avoid them. This course will help to avoid this by playing a part in boosting confidence.\nUnfortunately, mental health issues are also characterized by a significant degree of stigma, despite such problems being very common across the general population. Organizations that are genuinely committed to employee wellness will need to get past that stigma and offer working conditions that are supportive of good mental health, rather than a source of mental health difficulties (for example, through stress). This course can play a part in providing the basis of understanding necessary to move in that direction.\nIgnoring mental health problems or dealing with them in an uninformed way can be quite dangerous.",

And what can they do to help your organisation deliver on it's mission?\nYou don't need to be a paid Volunteer Manager or Volunteer Administrator to complete this course. In fact it's built for people with no experience whatsoever in volunteer management. However, you will likely still find some useful tips in this course if you are within the first 2 years of your career.\nIn this course I will teach you how to analyse your organisation so you can determine how volunteers can best help you. This is important so that everyone understands why you need volunteers, and later, so that your volunteers can feel satisfied that their time and contributions really are making a difference.\nThen we'll look at some of the limitations your organisation might have in recruiting volunteers and what kinds of volunteers will most benefit your organisation. This will ensure that the volunteers you find will be the best fit.\nThen we'll construct a Volunteer Role Description using the form and template included in the course. You can go through this process as many times as you need to build all the Role Descriptions you need for your program.\nFinally, we'll look at what you can do with your new Volunteer Role Descriptions. How you can break them into useful pieces and how you can use them to recruit volunteers from a variety of different sources.",

      "description": "Welcome to HR Analytics: Workforce Optimization with Machine Learning course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build predictive models for employee retention, performance assessment, and promotion eligibility using Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. This course is a perfect combination between machine learning and HR analytics, making it an ideal opportunity to level up your data science skills while improving your technical knowledge in human resource management. The course will be mainly focusing on three major aspects, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the HR dataset from various angles, the second one is predictive modeling where you will learn how to build HR predictive models using machine learning, and the third one is to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the model. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of human resources analytics, such as getting to know predictive modeling use cases in human resources, getting to know more about machine learning models that will be used, and you will also learn about technical challenges and limitations in HR analytics. Then, in the next section, you will learn how the HR predictive model works. This section will cover data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection, splitting the data into training and testing sets, model selection, model training, making predictions based on training data, and model evaluation. Afterward, you will also learn about several factors that contribute to an employee's performance and turnover rate, for example like job satisfaction, work life balance, career development opportunities, working environment, benefits, and compensations. Once you have learnt all necessary knowledge about HR analytics, we will start the project. Firstly you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. In addition to that, you will also learn how to find and download HR dataset from Kaggle. Once everything is ready, we will enter the first project section where you will explore the HR dataset from multiple angles, not only that, you will also visualize the data and try to identify trends or patterns in the data. In the second part, you will learn step by step on how to build employee retention predictive model, performance assessment predictive model, and promotion eligibility predictive model using Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Meanwhile, in the third part, you will learn how to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the model using several methods like confusion matrix, precision, and recall. Lastly, at the end of the course, we will conduct testing to make sure that the HR predictive models have been fully functioning and generate accurate results.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build HR predictive models using machine learning? Well, here is my answer. In today’s dynamic workplace, HR professionals face complex challenges in managing employee performance, retention, and talent optimization. Traditional methods often fall short in addressing these complexities. Machine learning models and big data analytics can revolutionize HR practices by providing data-driven insights and helping you to make more informed decisions. By leveraging these technologies, HR professionals can optimize employee performance by identifying factors that contribute to high productivity and high job satisfaction. In addition, it can also help you to identify top performers in your company which will enable more effective talent management and career development plans. Lastly, you can also increase retention rates by understanding and addressing the root causes of employee turnover, and formulate evidence-based company policies that drive better outcomes. Mastering these skills not only empowers HR professionals to make more strategic decisions but also opens up numerous career opportunities in the growing field of HR analytics and data science.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of human resources analytics, technical challenges and limitations in HR analytics, and its use cases\nLearn how HR predictive modeling works.

I´m Leo Capelossi, the Founder of The Sales Gang, ambi. careers now! - We help startups and scaleups to expand their teams across Europe and Brazil through a decentralized recruiters network based in many European countries and South America.\nThis course is the result of many years of recruiting experience and could help people, in many different moments: to start a career in recruitment, to improve tech sales recruitment skills, to help someone get a job as a sales recruiter, etc. The course is recorded in a very informal and relaxed manner, so I hope that the almost 6 hours of content are fun and useful. We go from the sales area, to end-to-end recruitment processes, no-code tools, automation, and other tips and tricks that the regular recruitment consultancies usually don't know.\n\n\nWhy take a tech sales recruitment course?\nAll the startups, tech, and innovative companies need to sell their products right? Yes, and they also need qualified and motivated salespeople to be able to do it. We know by experience how hard it is to find good salespeople (as sales is sometimes a \"career accident\" not a career plan) and how they can make a difference in any organization. We also know that many recruiters struggle in understanding sales, its processes, roles and also could improve in general recruitment practices.\n\n\nSome important stats and facts:\n\n\nThe SaaS industry has increased in size by around 500% over the past seven years. The market size value in 2022 - USD 186.6 billion and the revenue forecast for 2028 is USD 344.3 billion.\n41 to 44% of tech companies feel that they are behind on hiring tech sales profiles\nThere are tech sales bootcamps appearing everywhere to decrease the sales talent shortage\nThere are thousands of sales recruiter positions opened on Linkedin.

We suggest this course for any recruiter or people who would like to start a recruitment career.\n\n\nGeneralist Recruiters\nYou already know and perform full cycle recruitment, but you would love to understand and specialize in sales recruiting, such as update your knowledge, make sure you are not carrying mistakes throughout your processes and learn more about automation and no-code tools.\nIT Recruiters\nYou do great in IT Recruiting, but you know almost nothing about sales. Maybe you can combine sales knowledge with your tech recruiting practices and be a more complete recruiter, potentially changing your recruiting area (as tech is very crowded) for Sales and other business profiles.\nStarting your recruiting career\nYou just started or want to start your recruitment career, so this course could help you a lot to start with good practices, learn about sales recruiting and be one of the few Tech Sales Recruiters specialists in the market.\nAgency Recruiters\nYou work in or own a recruitment agency, so you want make sure your knowledge is up to date, learn more about automation and network with other students and recruiters.\nFreelance Recruiters\nYou work as a freelancer and want to improve in sales recruiting and make sure your processes are up to date.\nEarly Stage Startup Founders\nYou are just creating your startup and want to learn more about hiring processes, as you are recruiting yourself, at least at the beginning.\nSales professionals\nWho knows a lot about sales, but as you need to hire, it would be good to learn more about recruiting and best practices.\n\n\nConnect:\nAfter the course, we will also connect you with other like-minded students and recruiters for you to network and exchange best practices and knowledge through our private Tech Sales Recruiter community.\n\n\nWhat do we cover?\n1. Understanding the difference: B2B x B2C + Tech Sales\nLearn the fundamentals of sales, understand the differences between b2b and b2c, and how sales profiles are different in these 2 environments. Also, why Tech Sales is a recruiting trend?\n2. Sales Teams + Processes\nUnderstand which are the most common sales roles, the average salary range, and the B2B SaaS sales process and funnel, to finally get who does what, how and why.\n3. Recruiting: where to start\nOverview of the recruitment process, to-dos, and responsible areas and do´s and don'ts when writing an attractive job description + hundreds of templates from an external source.\n4.

      "description": "Active Listening in the Workplace & Human Resources is designed to enhance your communication skills, focusing on one of the most essential abilities in both professional and personal settings: active listening. This course equips HR professionals, managers, and employees with the tools and techniques to engage in more effective, empathetic, and focused listening, which can significantly improve workplace interactions and productivity.\nActive listening is the practice of fully concentrating, understanding, responding, and remembering what is being said during conversations. Unlike passive listening, where the listener may hear but not fully comprehend, active listening requires engagement, where the listener gives their full attention, processes the information, and responds thoughtfully. It’s not just about hearing words—it’s about understanding the intent, emotions, and nuances behind them. In the context of the workplace, active listening promotes clearer communication, reduces misunderstandings, and helps in resolving conflicts efficiently.\nWhy is Active Listening Important in the Workplace?\nIn today’s fast-paced work environment, effective communication is crucial. Active listening plays a pivotal role in building trust, fostering collaboration, and enhancing relationships among colleagues, teams, and leadership. For Human Resources professionals, active listening helps in understanding employee concerns, improving conflict resolution, and ensuring that workplace policies are implemented with empathy and fairness. By actively listening, HR teams can identify issues early, manage conflicts, and address grievances in a timely and effective manner.\nActive listening also contributes to improved decision-making by ensuring that all viewpoints are considered, leading to more inclusive and informed decisions. Moreover, it fosters an environment where employees feel heard, valued, and respected, which can lead to greater job satisfaction and retention.\nAdvantages of Active Listening:\nImproved Communication: Clear and concise conversations, reducing the risk of misinterpretation.\nStronger Relationships: Builds trust and rapport between team members, managers, and HR staff.\nEnhanced Problem Solving: Active listening allows a deeper understanding of issues, leading to better solutions.\nReduced Conflict: Helps in understanding the perspectives of others, minimizing workplace misunderstandings and disputes.\nEmployee Satisfaction: Employees feel valued when their concerns are actively listened to, improving morale.\nIncreased Productivity: Clear communication and understanding lead to more efficient work processes.\nThis course is ideal for HR professionals, managers, team leaders, supervisors, and anyone who wishes to improve their communication skills and create a more positive work environment. Whether you're dealing with employee relations, team dynamics, or leadership, active listening is an essential tool for success. It’s also beneficial for those in customer service or client-facing roles, where effective communication is key to relationship-building.\nActive listening is more than just a skill—it’s a critical tool for professional growth. By learning how to listen actively, you’ll be able to manage difficult conversations, understand team needs, resolve conflicts, and ultimately improve both individual and organizational performance. The ability to engage and understand others fosters a supportive and collaborative work culture, which is increasingly essential in today’s diverse and fast-moving workplace.\nAs workplaces continue to evolve, especially with remote and hybrid work models, the ability to listen and communicate effectively will only become more important. Active listening is expected to be a vital skill in fostering connection and collaboration in the future of work. With the rise of AI and automated systems, human empathy and understanding—driven by active listening—will remain essential for maintaining meaningful and productive human interactions.",

And you will see that there are many other reasons that make you and me get out of the bed each morning and go to work. Seeing money as a sole motivator is an outdated idea.

      "description": "Have you ever faced a situation at work that conflicted with your values and beliefs? Did it leave you feeling shocked, upset or even angry? Did the behaviour persist over time? If so, you may have experienced moral injury.\nMoral injury occurs when an individual’s conscience or moral compass is compromised due to witnessing or being unable to prevent actions that conflict with their values, beliefs or ethical code. It is a cognitive and emotional response triggered by events that violate a person’s moral framework. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers might have experienced moral injury when faced with inadequate protective equipment or when heavy workloads prevented them from delivering care to their usual standards. Such experiences can leave employees feeling isolated or detached from their roles, making it critical for leaders to recognise and address this issue effectively in the workplace.\nRecent research conducted by Softer Success, Affinity Health at Work and Sheffield University on the \"Links between burnout and moral injury\" highlights how moral injury contributes to burnout. This groundbreaking study in business settings offers valuable insights into understanding and addressing burnout, particularly in hybrid work environments.\nThis course explores how moral injury can lead to burnout and how unaddressed moral stress can escalate, affecting both individuals and teams. As a leader, how can you prevent moral injury and burnout? This course provides the tools to help you and your team build moral resilience.\nOver a series of short video-based lectures, you will gain a deep understanding of how to create teams that are aware of their values and moral systems. You will learn to foster a culture where leaders take responsibility for their actions, acknowledge mistakes and embrace vulnerability. The course will also guide you on how to strike a balance between protecting your team and safeguarding your own wellbeing, helping you focus on what can be controlled while letting go of what cannot.\nThrough storytelling, you’ll discover a powerful tool for sharing visions, diagnosing operational challenges and strengthening team dynamics. By experiencing the impact of stories as a cultural diagnostic tool, you’ll be equipped to apply this approach systematically in your role. You will also develop relational superpowers to build stronger connections within your team, ensuring that every individual feels heard and valued. The course introduces the “Art of Mattering,” helping leaders create environments where their teams feel connected to their work and empowered to contribute fully.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have the knowledge and strategies to prevent moral stress and injury, empowering yourself and your team to thrive with resilience. You’ll leave equipped to navigate challenges with confidence and build a culture of integrity and support.\nSo, are you ready to understand moral injury, address its impact and create a better future for yourself and your team?

You'll learn how to communicate well as an interviewer, improve your professionalism and discover the secrets to predicting performance.\nIf you are responsible for improving recruitment metrics across your organisation, this training is ideal for implementing a consistent theory and practice across management.\nThe behavioural methodology taught by Ranald Hendriks on this course is a proven process that results in better decisions, improved workplace performance and job placement statistics, providing invaluable management skills.\nBehavioural interviewing is a technique that focuses on a person's past behaviour and experiences, using examples from the candidate as indicators of their future performance. It offers the highest validity in behavioural predictability.\nOn this course, students learn how to encourage people to provide real-life situations where they demonstrated specific skills, competencies, and/or behaviours.\nThe key advantages of this behavioural interview training include:\nConcrete evidence: Candidates provide specific, real-world examples of their skills and behaviour, making it easier to assess their qualifications. You will gain information on how they did things, not how they would like to do things or think they should be done.\nPredictive value: Past behaviour is a good indicator of future behaviour, so the validity of information gained in interview can help to make more informed decisions.\nConsistency: Behavioural interviewing ensures all people are evaluated using the same criteria, so you are more objective when making decisions about people and also have an audit trail to protect the interviewer from criticisms of bias.\nThis is an interactive course where you may have the opportunity to learn and practice new skills with other students who learn at the same time as you, making the course suitable for both individuals and teams across your organisation.\n(c) 2023 - 2025 Stars Flight Ltd, All Rights Reserved - Starf is the registered trademark of HendriksBHCS Limited and used with permission.",

Are you a member of the recruitment team who wants to understand the process of Interviewing better? If you answered yes to these questions, then this course is for you.\n\n\n\n\nThis course will help hiring managers create safe boundaries and draft conversation and speech and the appropriate backdrop and setting to succeed as an interviewer.\nHi, I’m Dr. Ujjwal Bikram Khadka. In this course, I will share my insights and knowledge as a corporate coach and as a successful interviewee myself(Recently I was promoted to a management and leadership role at a successful American company following a successful interview).\n\n\nFirst, you will learn how to prepare for the “big day”. Then through ensuring through emails or phone or in-person that you’ll create a safe environment for them, you gain their confidence and serve as a great host.\n\n\nThen, you’ll learn to draft amazing and effective speech and setting to keep your power and position and yet make the interview candidates comfortable and at ease. You’ll learn how to keep a “poker face” and elicit the candidates best qualities. And while doing so, also represent your company in the best light: by making the interview process semi-predictable and smooth. And how do you do that? The answer: by asking insightful and pragmatic questions—Questions like how have they handled stresses at work? How do they tackle uncertainty? What are their expectations for salary? Their good habits and their weaknesses?\n\n\nIn this course, I have presented the key insights and knowledge to become a better interviewer. Like all worthwhile corporate skills, Interviewing requires a structured approach, and I'm happy to share that I have offered both \"outline and affirmation\" to succeed as an Interviewer. So, don't wait, take the advantage of this opportunity to start learning some interviewing skills or to hone your skills, if you're already a seasoned Interviewer.",

This industry is renowned for high turnover, fluctuating demand, and limited number of high -dollar work shifts, its very important for owners and operators to look for possible ways of balancing staff management and the same time improve profit margins. Restaurant owners are battling on two front that is they are looking for customers and also fighting for talents such as servers, kitchen crew, and managerial staff. Currently hiring and retaining the best talent for your restaurant business is very difficult, this has become a very big challenge to must operators.\nOne of the things that restaurant operators must do is to set up a human resource department that can aid in the establishment creating a culture of transparency, this means employees will feel safe, secure, and informed at all times. Human resources play a very vital role in making that happen. They can do that by creating and maintaining an environment of trust and transparency. The working environment must be safe for the employees to work so that they will build confidence and also understand that their work is safe. The restaurant owners must adopt a transparent and open door culture that allowed employees to feel free to contact their superiors and express their opinions concerning their job without fear. The nature of the restaurant business dictate that managers must do everything to decrease the turnover of the employees by way of hiring right the first time, this then means the person who is good enough may not be the right person for your position. Aim for the outstanding employee and you will reap the better reward. Restaurant employees need to be motivated more so that they can work to their maximum best.",

However, it can also be used as a preparation for when they do get that managerial role i.e aspiring managers, as well as by current managers to brush up on some skills that might have become a little rusty! It provides the tools and techniques necessary to the transition from a manager of self to a manager of others. Amongst the key topics covered, it explores the mind set shift and change in focus needed, managing the perceptions and changes in relationships, common managerial styles and how to use them to manage effectively, the complexity of team dynamics and creating the right culture for your team.\nOrganisations tend to promote people into managerial roles without setting them up for success by ensuring that they have the skills required to make this fundamental shift. A dangerous assumption is made which can result in a very difficult and demotivating few months for both the new manager and the team, …or even worse, a high performer can end up being promoted into incompetence. The end result can be a lack of motivation, a loss of confidence, non-delivery, performance management and potentially the exit of a previously high performing employee.\nI use examples and practical experience gained from my 25 years of being a Human Resources Director and Human Capital Specialist to illustrate the points covered.\nThis course will give you the tools, steps and techniques that you will need to set yourself up for success!",

You both show each other respect and can have productive conversations. As you and your employer may work closely together, you may eventually get to know their working style and how they operate. Making an effort to learn about their role in the company and their life outside of work can help you two grow closer. This can ultimately lead to better collaboration between you and your employer. Building rapport with your employer can create the opportunity for you to request their mentorship. This gives you access to their industry knowledge, insight and support.\nOne of the defining characteristics of a healthy employer-employee relationship is mutual respect, It's important that employers give their employees honest feedback about their performance. Similarly it's important that they can give instructions and expect strict compliance from employees. While the employer is the authority figure, it's equally important that they respect employees' time, boundaries contributions, and needs. Another indicator of a healthy employer-employee relationship is how they handle conflicts. Where there's a healthy relationship, both parties focus on resolving relationship productively. In some respect the presence of conflict can be a sign of a healthy relationship as it shows the openness to share conflicting opinions. Good employers know how to navigate such conflict and achieve lasting resolutions.",

      "description": "Hiring the right mid and senior-level talent is one of the most critical — and most challenging — tasks for growing businesses in India today. These roles often require a delicate mix of leadership ability, domain expertise, cultural alignment, and execution capability. Yet, the hiring landscape is noisy, candidate expectations are rising, and competition for high-quality talent is fierce. The consequences of getting it wrong can be significant — lost time, wasted resources, and organizational disruption. But when done right, the impact of a great hire is transformative.\nThis course is your step-by-step, real-world guide to mastering the recruitment process for mid and senior-level roles in the Indian market. It is designed for those who want to approach hiring not as a routine administrative task, but as a high-impact strategic function that directly contributes to business success.\nLed by Arijit Bose — a management graduate from XLRI Jamshedpur and a seasoned HR entrepreneur with over two decades of hands-on experience in executive and mid-level hiring — this course brings you insider knowledge from the trenches. Arijit has worked with organizations ranging from startups to large enterprises across industries, helping them build strong leadership teams and functional capabilities. His approach is practical, no-fluff, and deeply grounded in the realities of the Indian hiring ecosystem.\nWhat You’ll Learn\nOver the span of this 2-hour course, you will learn how to manage the entire recruitment lifecycle with clarity, confidence, and structure. Whether you’re new to hiring or looking to sharpen your process, you’ll gain actionable strategies that can be implemented right away.\nHere are the key areas we will cover:\n1. Crafting a Strong Employer Proposition\nAttracting top talent starts well before you post a job. Candidates today are evaluating your organization as much as you’re evaluating them. We’ll show you how to articulate a compelling employer value proposition that reflects your company’s culture, growth potential, and mission — one that appeals to ambitious professionals seeking meaningful work.\n2. Sourcing and Screening Candidates Strategically\nMost hiring mistakes happen at the top of the funnel. You’ll learn structured ways to identify the right sourcing channels, evaluate profiles beyond the resume, and screen candidates using thoughtful, role-specific criteria. We’ll cover both inbound and outbound hiring strategies, with tips on how to engage passive candidates and assess fit early in the process.\n3. Managing Interviews and Stakeholders\nHiring is a team sport. From interview planning to panel coordination, this module will help you design effective interview processes that reduce bias, improve candidate experience, and align interviewers on key evaluation metrics. You’ll also learn how to work with hiring managers, founders, and other decision-makers to streamline the process and avoid internal delays.\n4. Handling Offers and Candidate Engagement\nOne of the biggest challenges in the Indian market is offer dropouts. We’ll cover how to present offers strategically, engage candidates during their notice periods, and build trust that ensures they join. You’ll also understand how to negotiate offers professionally and handle counter-offers from current employers.\n5. Onboarding and Beyond\nThe hiring process doesn’t end with an offer letter. We’ll share onboarding best practices that help new hires integrate smoothly, feel valued, and hit the ground running. A strong onboarding experience can significantly improve retention and early performance, and you’ll walk away with a checklist to make this part of your process foolproof.\nWho This Course is For\n· HR Professionals and Talent Acquisition Specialists who want to deepen their understanding of strategic hiring and stay updated with best practices.\n· Startup Founders and Business Leaders who are directly involved in hiring key roles and want to build a scalable recruitment process.\n· Recruiters and Consultants working with growing companies in India who want to elevate the quality of their search and client engagement.",

Total exam time 4 hours to answer 160 answers, 80 questions in 2 hours and then 80 questions in the next 2 hours with approximately 95 are stand-alone knowledge items and 65 will be situational judgment items altogether. Situational judgment items, or SJIs, that will test your ability to choose the best course of action in relation to real-life HR scenarios presented in the questions\nIt is the situational judgment test is the difficult part, as a ready made answer to these questions are not readily available. The answers can only be found in a secret opinion poll that SHRM did with some HR subject matter experts. But take it the other way… it is the easiest part  you need not memorize anything, rather you can simply read through the question and answer it.\nSo, what is a situational judgement test (SJT). It is an aptitude test that evaluates using hypothetical situations based on real-life work-based situations. The SJT is taken in a multiple-choice format. The possible solutions will be presented in no order, and the general idea is to pick the response that is closest to how you would deal with that problem or situation. Some tests require you to select the most effective and the least effective, while others require some sort of rating or ranking – which is the most/least effective, which are you most/least likely to do and some answer require you to choose, the first step. When responding to the scenarios you should pick the approach that you feel reflects the best way you would deal with the situation in real life, rather than the solution your employer applies.\nDoing a lot of practice tests can really help you to crack the SHRM exams",

An organisations competitive advantage is its people and in order to add maximum value for the organisation, these people must be optimally distributed throughout the company.\nIn this course we will get into the following key areas:\nThe vision & strategy\nThe strategic roadmap\nThe aligning & cascading or organisational objectives\nThe capability gap analysis\nThe human capital strategy\nIntegrated performance management\nMonitoring, evaluating, and adjusting\nBy the end of this course, you will understand:\nWhat strategic workforce management is and how it adds value to the business\nHow strategic workforce management is required to achieve the organisations strategic objectives\nHow the organisation’s strategic objectives provide the framework for workforce management\nHow to align organisational strategy, the strategic roadmap and your workforce to build capability and capacity as a framework for business success\nWe will also look at how to use strategic workforce management to inform your people management processes such as performance management, talent management, talent acquisition, and succession planning.",

      "description": "Welcome to the “Your Career; Your Design” e-course! I’m Nicoa Dunne, certified lifestyle coach with 20+ years as an HR executive under my belt. I’ve consulted 100s of business leaders and top executives from Fortune 100 companies across the globe using my “Life by Design” strategy and blueprint, and there’s no more important time than now to plan the next chapter in your career.\nIn the beginning of the year, the entire world was turned upside down by the pandemic, resulting in the U.S. unemployment rate shooting up from 3.8 percent in February—among the lowest on record in the post-World War II era—to 13 percent in May. That rate was the era’s second highest, trailing only the level reached in April at over 14 percent.\nAll over the world, the pandemic caused both old and new businesses alike to close suddenly or decrease significantly in revenue. Millions, including some of my own clients, have lost their jobs and are now faced with a dilemma: What’s next?\nBut you know what else I’m thinking in this situation? Many of you who lost your jobs are now realizing you never enjoyed that job in the first place. Or like many of my clients over the years, maybe you’re still in your job and wish it was better and are even realizing this stay at home thing sure feels good—how can I make THIS a full time solution??\nSome of you are furloughed and unemployed and wondering if this is your pivotal moment—the moment where you get to turn a new leaf for your future. And I am willing to bet some of you dislike your career so much, you wish you were among those who did lose their jobs. Am I right?!\nListen, I’ve been there. Not only with my clients but personally, when I dreaded the drive to work, when I wished I had a different boss, and even the time when I quit with no plan…\nThat’s why I’m so excited to have you join me for this career course where we’ll talk about the challenges, joys, uncertainty, and possibilities associated with finally taking a close look at your life and designing your career to support it. I did it, and you can, too!\nUnlike other career courses that focus only on the tangible parts of landing your career such as resumes, cover letters, interview questions, etc., you and I will be diving deeper into your deepest heart’s desires and working to design them into long term goals—goals that create the foundation for a life you love, and, oh by the way, won’t dread or need a vacation from!\nIn this course, I’m going to give you a step-by-step on changing the way you perceive your world right now and help you shift how you think about your job so that you can find your True North in the most authentic way. I’m going to explain a concept I like to call “Life by Design,” which is all about discovering how to live the life you always wanted with the peace, contentment and satisfaction you always craved.\nYou may have lost all hope of finding your dream career at this stage in your life. You might think you have no idea what a dream career looks like to you, or you think to have the life you have requires compromise. But I beg to differ!\nMaybe you’re one of “the lucky ones” who didn’t lose your job, but secretly you really wish you had so you could get to doing what you love. No matter where you are in your career journey, this course will help you apply the “Life by Design” principles to your career so you can find your passion and settle into that life with ease and success.\nI want you to come out of this feeling like a new you, or should I say, the REAL YOU! I want you feeling like you have found your career truth and are ready to follow it wherever it takes you. This course is all about trusting the journey and trusting yourself. Let’s get that compass pointed back in the right direction. Let’s find YOUR TRUE NORTH!\nBut before we get too far, let’s talk about what this course is NOT. I’m not going to talk about how to get a new job here—there are plenty of free resources for that already available to you online. I’m going to focus on how you can prepare yourself to thrive in a new job or career. I’m going to help you find your truth, aligned to what really matters most to you, which will lead you to that new career, or actually, the LIFESTYLE, that you’ve been craving.\nI’m also NOT going to teach you how to build a resume or write a cover letter in this course. Why? Well, let me tell you a little secret… Having a great-looking resume and a well-written cover letter is awesome—and yes, it really has the power to set you apart from the rest of the pack when it comes to your job hunt. However, no piece of paper will help you find your sweet spot in a career field or your dream job for the life you crave. No matter what you think, it isn’t your image, it’s your way of BEING that sets you apart and helps you get what you want.\nSo be patient with yourself and this process, because we’re going to look past the image, and with a little self-discovery and guidance, you’ll be attracting and accepting or creating the dream job you’ve been looking for all this time.\nIt’s an honor to be on this path with you, and remember, you deserve to get what you really want! Ready to get started?\nHAPPY DESIGNING!",

      "description": "Anyone who works in any organization knows that organization culture is important because it affects the performance of the organization. According to the Harvard Business Review, ‘Great culture should provide continuous alignment to the vision, purpose, and goals of the organization.’\n\n\nCulture is not something that you can see, yet it is something that you can feel and experience. Culture contains the answer of \"what is\" and \"why is\" of an organization. It is dynamic. It shifts constantly in response to internal and external changes. That’s why so many people find it difficult to build and sustain the culture that they want to experience.\n\n\nA 2020 report by SHRM, the Society for Human Resource Management in the US, toxic organizational cultures are costing businesses billions. Nearly half of the employees in its survey said they had thought about leaving their current employer due to an issue with company culture. And almost one in five had left a job for precisely that reason within the last five years.\n\n\nIn this course, Designing and Systemizing Organizational Culture, you’ll learn not just how to design the blueprint of your culture, but also how to create a system that can ensure the sustainability of the culture that you want to experience in your organization.\n\n\nBecause when it comes to culture, whether you design it or not, it will exist anyway. So might as well design it.",

And then we'll discuss a few other important regulations that HR professionals should be aware of as part of their risk management responsibilities.\nIn topic one, Organizational Risk Management, you'll learn what is necessary to develop, monitor, and test business continuity and disaster recovery plans and how to communicate and train employees on those plans.\nWhile the process of business continuity planning is a natural extension of disaster recovery planning, the two processes are not the same. In topic two, Business Continuity and Liability Insurance, you'll further expand your knowledge of business continuity and disaster recovery plans including data storage and back up, alternative work locations, the related procedures, as well as the various types of insurance available to mitigate common business risks.\nEmployers must take appropriate personnel action when apparent drug-related cases arise.\nIn topic four, Other Workplace Safety and Security Legislation, we'll expand our regulatory discussions to include other federal laws and regulations related to workplace health, safety, security, and privacy. These will include the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the ADA, HIPPA, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nThat’s it! Now, go ahead and push that “Take this course” button and see you on the inside!",

      "description": "Succession planning is a process and strategy for replacement planning or passing on leadership roles. It is used to identify and develop new, potential leaders who can move into leadership roles when they become vacant. Effective succession or talent - pool management concerns itself with building a series of feeder groups up and down the entire leadership pipeline or progression. In contrast, replacement planning is focused narrowly on identifying specific back-up candidates for given senior management positions. Thought should be given to the retention of key employees, and the consequences that the departure of key employees may have on the business. The practice of business succession planning is conducted either by organizations themselves, or with the support of specialist management consulting firms.\nSuccession planning helps organizations meet diversity and inclusion goals. Because succession planning allows organizations to strategically develop people to prepare them to take on more responsibility and higher positions, it removes barriers to internal advancement that may exist because of implicit bias. By making an effort to plan for the promotion of candidates from diverse backgrounds, you can ensure that you maintain equity throughout all levels of your organization. Perform competency evaluations that measure current team members leadership, technical skills, and readiness to step into new roles.",

      "description": "Human resources (HR) are a vital function in any organization. It ensures that an organization has the right people, with the right skills, in the right positions, to achieve its goals. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a dynamic and diverse workforce, and HR plays a crucial role in sourcing, selecting, developing, and managing the talent.\nThe primary duties that HR departments in organizations working in the KSA perform include Recruitment, Employee engagement, compensation management, compliance management, training and development, etc.\nRecruitment is the process of identifying and hiring the right candidates for a job. In Saudi Arabia, the recruitment process is like other countries, with a few specific requirements. Employers are required to provide job offers in writing, including details such as the job title, salary, and benefits. Additionally, employers need to obtain a work permit and residency visa for expatriate employees. There are also laws and regulations that outline the rights and protections of employees, including minimum wage, working hours, and annual leave.\nEmployee engagement is the emotional connection that employees have with their work, colleagues, and organization. Engaged employees are more productive, more satisfied, and more likely to stay with the organization. In Saudi Arabia, employee engagement is a crucial factor in retaining talent.\nEmployers in Saudi Arabia use various strategies to engage employees, including regular communication, feedback, recognition, and employee development programs. Regular communication, such as team meetings and one-on-one sessions, helps employees stay informed and connected with their colleagues and the organization. Feedback and recognition programs, such as performance appraisals and employee of the month awards, help employees feel valued and appreciated. Employee development programs, such as training and career development, help employees grow and progress in their careers.\nTraining is the process of developing employees' skills and knowledge to enhance their job performance. In Saudi Arabia, training is a critical factor in retaining talent and maintaining a competitive edge in the marketplace.\nEmployers in Saudi Arabia provide various training programs, including orientation, job-specific training, and leadership development. Orientation programs introduce new employees to the organization's culture, policies, and procedures. Job-specific training provides employees with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform their jobs effectively. Leadership development programs help employees develop the skills and knowledge necessary to lead and manage others.\nCompensation and benefits refer to the rewards and incentives that an organization provides to its employees in exchange for their work. In Saudi Arabia, compensation and benefits are a critical factor in attracting and retaining top talent.\nEmployers in Saudi Arabia provide various compensation and benefits packages, including base salary, bonuses, health insurance, and retirement plans.\nCompliance refers to the laws and regulations that govern employment in Saudi Arabia. Employers in Saudi Arabia need to comply with various laws and regulations, including labor law, social security law, and immigration law.\nAlong with the functions mentioned above, the HR departments in organizations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also have to provide various services to the employees such as arranging for their work permits, Visas, etc. if they are Expat employees and providing them letters such as Reference letters, address confirmation letters etc. to the domestic and expat employees. Another important function performed by the employees in KSA is the management of employee leaves and attendance.\nThe HR department also works on strategic functions like Manpower planning and managing industrial disputes. All these functions have been briefly discussed in this course. The learners, who are interested in working in HR or are working as HR executives in organizations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, can certainly find the details of the work performed by the entire HR department in organizations based in the KSA, in this course.",

      "description": "This course offers an in-depth exploration of the PHRca certification, focusing on the essential concepts and legal frameworks needed for human resource professionals operating in California. It is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical foundations underpinning the complex employment landscape in the state. While the course aims to equip students with practical insights into regulatory compliance and human resource management, it prioritizes a deeper understanding of the principles and standards essential for navigating California’s distinct legal environment.\nThroughout the curriculum, students will engage with the intricacies of the California Labor Code, exploring how it differs from federal employment laws and how these differences impact organizational policies. A thorough examination of wage and hour regulations highlights key areas such as overtime rules, meal breaks, and timekeeping protocols. Students will develop a nuanced appreciation for how compliance with these rules contributes to both legal stability and employee satisfaction. This section lays the groundwork for understanding the critical role of compensation strategies, worker classifications, and fair employment practices within the framework of California’s unique legislative landscape.\nThe course also addresses the essential elements of employee recruitment, onboarding, and workplace conduct, with a focus on aligning organizational practices with state-specific requirements. From pre-employment checks to the complexities of employment-at-will policies, students will learn how to apply compliant hiring practices while fostering an inclusive work environment. The onboarding modules introduce key principles for building effective employee agreements and training programs that support both compliance and organizational culture.\nIn addition, this course delves into the legal mandates surrounding workplace safety and employee benefits. Students will gain insight into California’s Occupational Safety and Health regulations, as well as the Family Rights Act and other leave laws. These modules emphasize the importance of balancing employee well-being with operational demands, fostering a deeper understanding of how HR professionals can integrate compliance strategies with business goals. The exploration of workers’ compensation programs adds further dimension, preparing students to manage claims and mitigate risks effectively.\nCentral to the learning experience is the study of employee relations and the development of workplace policies. Students will explore how organizations can create policies that promote harmony, manage disciplinary actions, and protect whistleblower rights. The course further examines the ethical and legal responsibilities involved in termination and employee separation, with particular focus on compliance with California-specific laws governing final pay, severance, and wrongful termination claims.\nPrivacy and security protocols are another critical component of the curriculum. Students will learn about the legal considerations of monitoring employee communications and protecting sensitive data, fostering an understanding of how to balance privacy rights with organizational security needs. The course concludes with a detailed look at the role of regulatory agencies, such as the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) and the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). Students will acquire the knowledge needed to respond to inquiries, manage audits, and ensure ongoing compliance with California’s regulatory framework.\nBy the end of the course, students will possess the knowledge and analytical skills necessary to understand and apply the principles of human resource management within the context of California law. While the course does not emphasize hands-on application, it provides students with the essential theoretical tools to interpret complex legal requirements and align organizational strategies with state-specific standards. This foundational knowledge ensures that participants are well-prepared to navigate the challenges associated with the PHRca certification and apply HR principles effectively in a California context.",

It involves leveraging tools such as cloud-based HR software, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, big data analytics, and automated systems to streamline and optimize HR functions.\nThe goal of digital transformation is to improve the overall employee experience, increase HR efficiency, and enable better decision-making through data insights. By embracing technology, HR professionals can focus more on strategic, high-value tasks rather than spending time on repetitive, manual processes.\n\n\nThe Importance of Following Trends in Talent Attraction\nIn today's fast-paced, competitive labor market, attracting and retaining top talent has become a critical challenge for organizations. As businesses strive to secure the best employees, staying aligned with the latest trends in talent attraction is essential. Understanding the evolving expectations of potential candidates and adapting to the changing dynamics of the workforce ensures that companies remain competitive. This part highlights the key trends in talent attraction, focusing on employer branding, employee value proposition (EVP), and leveraging social media for effective employer marketing.\n\n\nDigital Transformation in Recruitment: Embracing the Future of Hiring\nIn the rapidly evolving world of recruitment, digital transformation has become a crucial step for organizations looking to stay competitive and attract the best talent. The traditional recruitment processes that relied heavily on paper applications, in-person interviews, and manual sorting of resumes have been replaced with innovative, digital solutions that streamline the hiring process, enhance candidate experience, and improve efficiency. This shift towards digital recruitment is transforming the way companies attract, evaluate, and onboard candidates.\n\n\nTrends In Learning & Development\nStaying updated with trends in Learning & Development is essential for organizations that aim to remain competitive, agile, and employee-focused. L&D trends reflect how the workforce is changing—and how organizations must adapt. Embracing these trends isn't just about keeping up with the times; it’s about building a resilient, future-ready organization where employees thrive and contribute to long-term success.\n\n\nData-Driven Decision Making in HR: Turning Workforce Insights into Strategic Action\nIn an era of digital transformation and talent scarcity, human resources must evolve from a support function into a strategic partner. One of the most powerful enablers of this shift is data-driven decision making—the ability to use metrics, analytics, and predictive models to guide workforce planning, employee engagement strategies, and turnover prevention.\nWhen used correctly, HR data is more than just numbers—it becomes a narrative that influences boardroom decisions and shapes the future of the organization.\nLinking HR metrics to business performance is not just about analytics—it’s about driving business value through people strategy. AI empowers HR professionals to go beyond reporting and become strategic advisors who anticipate challenges, optimize investments, and accelerate growth.\n\n\nStrategic Workforce Planning: How AI Transforms Talent Forecasting\nIn a volatile and fast-evolving business environment, the ability to anticipate future talent needs is one of HR’s most powerful strategic advantages. Organizations that align their workforce with long-term goals can adapt faster, innovate more effectively, and minimize disruptions. This is the essence of Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP)—and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly redefining how it’s done.\nBy analyzing vast datasets on business growth, technological advancements, labor market trends, and internal capabilities, AI enables HR leaders to move from reactive hiring to proactive talent strategy.\n\n\nZero HR: The Concept of Invisible Human Resources\nIn the fast-evolving landscape of organizational management, a bold new concept is taking shape—Zero HR. As automation, artificial intelligence, and digital transformation redefine the workplace, Human Resources is undergoing a quiet revolution. Zero HR represents a paradigm shift from traditional, process-heavy HR functions toward invisible, embedded, and fully automated systems that empower employees while freeing HR professionals to focus on strategy, culture, and human impact.",

Trauma-informed approaches have become increasingly cited in policy and adopted in practice as a means for reducing the negative impact of trauma experiences and supporting mental and physical health outcomes. They build on evidence developed over several decades. However, there has been a lack of consensus of understanding in the equine industry on how trauma-informed practice is defined, what its key principles are and how it can be built into services and systems. Trauma results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as harmful or life threatening. While unique to the individual, generally the experience of trauma can cause lasting adverse effects, limiting the ability to function and achieve mental, physical, social, emotional or spiritual well-being. Trauma-informed practice is an approach to health and care interventions which is grounded in the understanding that trauma exposure can impact an individual’s neurological, biological, psychological and social development.",

These exams are recognized globally as a standard of professional competence in HR, and earning the credential demonstrates both knowledge and commitment to the field. Many candidates, however, find that passing these exams requires more than theoretical understanding. It requires practice, strategy, and the ability to approach exam-style questions with confidence. This course has been created to provide exactly that kind of preparation through a structured series of unofficial practice tests.\nThe course offers realistic test simulations that closely mirror the format and level of difficulty of the SHRM-CP and SHRM-SCP certification exams. Each test has been carefully designed to provide a balance of question types that reflect the areas of knowledge covered by SHRM’s Body of Applied Skills and Knowledge. By taking these tests, you will experience the pace, style, and structure of the real exam, which will help reduce anxiety and increase familiarity before test day.\nEach practice question is followed by a detailed explanation. This ensures that learners do not simply memorize answers but understand the reasoning behind correct and incorrect choices. Explanations have been written to reinforce HR principles, clarify common misconceptions, and highlight exam-relevant strategies. Over time, this approach builds both accuracy and confidence, helping you recognize patterns in the types of questions that are likely to appear in the official exam.\nAnother important aspect of this course is its focus on exam strategies. Many candidates underestimate the importance of time management, careful reading, and logical elimination of incorrect options. In addition to providing practice questions, this course emphasizes approaches that will allow you to maximize your score, avoid common mistakes, and manage the pressure of timed testing conditions. By practicing these strategies across multiple tests, you will be better prepared to handle the challenges of exam day.\nThe course is intended for anyone preparing to take the SHRM-CP or SHRM-SCP exam. It is particularly valuable for candidates who want to measure their readiness, identify weak areas, and ensure they are allocating their study time effectively. Whether you are preparing for the exam for the first time or revisiting your preparation after a prior attempt, this course can provide the support and structure needed to approach the test with greater assurance.\nDisclaimer: This is an independent and unofficial preparation resource.

We’re going to explore the inner workings of workplace dynamics, getting to the heart of what really goes on in a company. This isn’t another boring or routine training session; it’s focused on addressing real issues and providing real solutions for teams.\nMany employees lose interest in their roles over time. They’re physically at work but mentally checked out, which affects performance and team morale. When you try to give feedback, it often feels like talking to a wall—nothing changes, and this lack of response can be incredibly frustrating. Encouraging everyone to collaborate can feel like managing complete disorder, and outdated HR methods only make it worse. It’s similar to trying to run a modern program on old, incompatible technology. Slow, inefficient processes become a burden, causing delays and unnecessary stress.\nThis course introduces modern strategies, grounded in real-world examples, to help energize your team and streamline HR tasks. By using these methods, you can create a workplace where people feel motivated and valued, rather than just showing up for a paycheck. It’s not just about improving performance, but about creating an environment where people can truly thrive. This is your guide to making that vision a reality. Let's learn together!",

A great organization is an organization that have diversified and inclusion staff that are working in harmony to achieve their corporate goals in a friendly and receptive atmosphere.\nGood modern organizations are practicing diversity and inclusion in their organization because great worker may not come from one one people or one country. Fostering inclusion in the working environment is very key to the success of the organisation.\nThe are some key strategies for organisation diversity and inclusion such as recruiting a diverse team in the organisation, managing diversity at the work place, encouraging employees to interact among themselves, appreciate employee whenever they do well, encouraging individuals to celebrate festivals together and encourage communication in the organisation both vertical or horizontal communication among all workers and managers in the organisation.\nThe challenges of diversity such as lack of coordination should be avoided in the organisation to ensure a good working environment that will enhance productivity. Wage gaps make it impossible for employees to be treated equitably; encourage an open dialogue around wages and discuss the connection between employee performance, position, and pay rate. Increasing transparency on traditionally taboo subjects like wages will help ensure fair compensation in the future.",

      "description": "An employment contract lays out the details pertinent to an employer-employee relationship. This legally binding document is usually beneficial to both parties. An employment contract clarifies each party's responsibilities and provides stability to both parties. However, the stability that an employment contract provides also can be problematic if the employee wants to end the employer-employee relationship. It is essential to keep in mind that the other party potentially may sue you for financial compensation if you wrongfully terminate the contract prematurely. While you may have written employment contract in some cases, contracts can be implied in some states. For instance, if your employee handbook, it may implied create a contract by which you are bound, under some state laws. If you don't have employment contract, you are an employee at will. This means that you can be fired for any reason or no reason, so long as that reason is not illegal. For instance, an illegal reason for firing an at-will employee could be racial discrimination.\nWhenever you enter into an employment contract, you should be aware of your rights and responsibilities under the contract. You do not want to be surprise at a later date by a provision of your contract that you overlooked or did not understand. You must understand what is in your contract and what you are agreeing to at the start of the contract so you know what rights and obligations there are on both sides. As a result, it is important that you carefully scrutinize your employment contract and ensure that you are clear about it's provisions before you sign it.",

Compliance is best nurtured by knowing the history and intent of regulations which regulate workforce performance.\nSection 2: What the workforce needs to know equips the individual employee with basic definitions of key HIPAA/HITECH terms, such as PHI, Consent, Privacy Notice and Authorization, which are likely to be encountered in regular workforce functions. Compliance is best implemented by well-trained processes and a well-trained workforce.\nSection 3: HIPAA Compliant Workforce helps the individual employee appreciate the employee’s responsibility for compliance and the basic elements of a compliant workplace. This section encourages the employee to seek out the resources that should be available through a Covered Entity's or Business Associate's Compliance Plan and to make use of the resources when needed to guide workplace compliance. This Section also includes case studies, and questions to enhance the key learning points. A template for Verification at Workforce Training Program and Employer Feedback on the Elements of a HIPAA-compliant Workforce are available with this Part.",

Accordingly, a law has been enacted for giving effect to the said Convention for protection of women against sexual harassment at workplace.\nThe number one cause of sexual harassment at the workplace is the dominant position of the harasser and the powerlessness of the aggrieved woman. The woman must muster the courage to speak up against the wrong, not just for herself, but for other women too. Women not speaking up against sexual harassment will give a boost to sexual harassers.\nThrough this course, understand what your rights and remedies are and how you can deal with sexual harassment at the workplace.",

The inspiration was due to the facts that people who read tarot are not getting the protection they need from YouTube company policies and values. So, I decided to create a structure planning of how to safeguard people who do any type of divination practice whatsoever on YouTube, but in this matter any social media outlet. This course can give your insight of how I develop my business affairs to try and develop your own. For those in the future that will be taking this course for work, volunteer, and or internship purposes, I hope you enjoy this material. I want to take the time thank any businesses that may have hired me and whatever other variants of this attribute of knowing and unknowing acknowledgements. Be prepared to use your own sense of style to get the content and customer service is something that all people regardless of their job have experienced. Be sure to give yourself a timely scheduled plan to get yourself together when taking the course. Reach out if you must and thank you to all whoever taught me anything, whether you know you taught me or not. I appreciate all, even children because they are our future and let's raise them to our best ability. They can teach us so much because of their purity of innocence.

Major polling companies such as Aon and Gallup typically report that the majority of workers are either \"just there\" at work, or actively disengaged.\nGood companies recognize that high employee engagement and satisfaction results in greater worker productivity, better employee retention, and reduced time off work. These companies make efforts to increase employee satisfaction by identifying issues through surveys, and addressing them through Employee Satisfaction (ESAT) programs. Such programs are designed to address broader issues, however, not the ones specific to an individual. And only a small minority of organizations approach improving employee satisfaction seriously.\nThe Four Corner Framework identifies the job attributes important to the individual - what aspects of their job that they value now and into the future. It then provides a process to drive the necessary changes needed for improving the problem areas for overall job satisfaction improvement.\nThis course is not only useful for individuals, but also very for professionals in Human Resources (HRP) and Human Resource Management interested in improving employee satisfaction.",

      "description": "Are you engaged with competencies as a feature within your organization’s human resources or organization development processes? Are you a student of organization psychology or human resources management? Are you an assessor for competencies? This course offers provides a rich source of theoretical and practical content to support your subject understanding and decision-making.\nThe course offers a strategic, conceptual, critical, and technical foundation to competency development. It explores the concept and history of competencies in organizations, the different approaches to how it is defined and practiced, and a supporting framework for decision-making. Competencies have been long practiced across most large organizations globally, but as yet, there is no universally accepted definition of what we mean by a ‘competency.’ Research data suggests it struggles with establishing demonstrable evidence of impacts in organization performance, and whether the resource and cost implications for practice through selection and assessment, performance management, succession, and talent management exhibit a clear benefit.\nWe know intuitively that competencies are welcomed and needed in all organizations. But what they are and how we can illustrate a formal value is challenging. Traditional methods of job analysis, work analysis, role design, and KSAOs (Knowledge, Skills, Attributes, Other) demonstrate an effective support for on-the-job-performance (OJP) because over time we develop confidence in the connections between employee characteristics and OJP. But it is competencies which really determine OJP and organization capability development (behavior, values, culture). In many cases, competencies are defined as KSAOs or results – in which case, a competency is unclear. The course provides a challenging insight into the concept of competencies and the variety of thinking and practical use.\nFor decision-makers, pursuing competency development is a strategic choice. It offers powerful opportunities for organization capability, but at the same time it may be worth focusing on other aspects of human resource strategies and organization development first. Competencies need a clear positioning within the design of capability processes, and a clear value from their practice.\nOur approach consolidates theory and practice and offers a strategic and technically-robust direction for developing and using competencies formally. Over 32 lectures, we chart the theoretical and conceptual factors, practice-based issues and impacts, and development considerations. We present a unique and theoretically-founded methodology for developing competencies and frameworks, and leave you with a solid foundation for decision-making and your approach to development and implementation.\nA comprehensive Resources & Information pack provides detailed study and supporting information for lectures. It includes research references, conceptual and practical illustrations, and a sequential development approach, from theory to practice.",

A job analysis identifies all duties and tasks that make up a single job function or role. Task analysis further breaks these tasks into the actual steps of performance. During these analysis, considering competencies—the behaviors and attitudes of high performers—helps determine keys to success. For some purposes, a job analysis provides all the needed information, but in other cases a task analysis is necessary to learn what an employee does at the most granular level. Job analysis is the process of studying a job to determine which activities and responsibilities it includes, its relative importance to other jobs, the qualifications necessary for performance of the job and the conditions under which the work is performed. The objective of this online course is to give a holistic idea of job analysis. Upon completion of this course, learners will become to know of the process of conducting job analysis. It will help to know how to conduct a job analysis, what modern tools are used for job analysis, problems, advantages and disadvantages of job analysis, and how job analysis data help in the hiring process.",

At the heart of his theoretical approach is PCS analysis. In this course he explains what PCS analysis is and shows how it can be used to make sense of the complexities involved. As such, it is an essential foundation for promoting equality and diversity.\nThe course is critical of approaches to equality and diversity that focus mainly or exclusively on the individual or personal level and have little or nothing to say about the wider context. The case is made for looking more holistically at situations involving discrimination by recognizing that much depends on the wider cultural level which is characterized by stereotypes, discriminatory assumptions and forms of language that stand in the way of genuine equality.\nIn turn, the cultural level needs to be understood as being shaped by wider structural factors – class, race/ethnicity and gender – and the ways in which these ‘social divisions’ reinforce and are reinforced by the common assumptions at the cultural level.\nPCS analysis provides a helpful framework for understanding how these three different levels – personal, cultural and structural interact and contribute to discrimination and oppression.",

Manpower Planning is the process of personnel planning; formulating plans to fill the future openings based on the analysis of environment and organizational plans. Manpower Planning applies management principles in procuring, developing, maintaining people in the organisation. So, manpower planning takes care of natural depletion of work force and the changing needs of the company as far as quality and nature of workers are concerned.\nManpower Planning is defined as the process by which management determines how an organization should move from its current manpower position to its desired manpower position. Regression Analysis technique presupposes a linear relationship between independent (casual) variables and dependent (target) variable. The Work-Study Technique is to be used when length of operations and amount of labour required can be calculated.\nThe future labor demand is determined by the figures of inflow and outflow of personnel which is discussed and decided by the managers. The Markov Model produces a series of matrices that give details about the various patterns of movement to and from the various jobs in the organization. It helps to determine the likelihood that an individual will display movement behaviours.\nNumber and percentage of starters at a particular job who target a future job within a specified time.

But that doesn't mean it is something everyone understands or knows how to use.\nEmployer branding is a \"force multiplier\" for recruiting, bringing a strategic approach to what is usually a brute force process. Properly armed with an employer brand, recruiters will be able to attract more of the talent their hiring managers actually want to talk to. They’ll have better conversations with candidates. And they’ll even be able to close more deals and increase their offer acceptance rate.\nBut while employer branding has become a hot topic in marketing and talent acquisition, recruiters are rarely trained in how to properly use their own. They are given the brand and told to “use this!” with next to no meaningful instruction, and without learning how to integrate it into their day-to-day work.\nConsequently, they never adopt this effective new tool and never see the ultimate value it drives for their company.\nNo matter where you work, not bringing in the best possible talent at the lowest possible cost is a missed opportunity to help your business grow.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to level-up your existing recruiting skills by tapping into your employer brand. This will lower your time to fill rates, increase your offer acceptance rates, and make you a more valuable recruiter.",

You will be fascinated by how far artificial intelligence has advanced in the past few years to the point where you can use AI to write job descriptions, write interview questions, automatically generate insights from candidate’s resume, conduct live interviews with AI virtual recruiters, and even do a fully automated coding or technical assessment. In the introduction session, you will learn how Ai can help you to automate and speed up the recruitment process by outsourcing some of the repetitive work to AI. Then, you will continue by learning to find qualified job candidates with AI. You are going to use Holly Hires AI and Each Hire to approach the top talents in the industry. Afterward, in the next session, you will learn to write job descriptions and interview questions using AI tools like Careers AI, Hire Hoc, Trio Dev, and Logic Balls. Then, you will also learn how to scan a candidate's resume and automatically generate valuable insights from the resume using AI tools like Hire Lake AI, Lisa Recruiter, and CV Grader. Those AI tools will enable you to find top talents in the industry by automatically filtering the candidates that match with skills, qualifications, and working experience that you specify in the job description. After finding the right candidates, you will continue the process by setting up an interview, you will learn to interview your candidates using an AI virtual recruiter which means that you don’t have to be present during the interview, instead you only need to share the interview invitation to each candidate. For this task, you will use AI tools like Talently AI, Greet AI, Easy Hire, and Hireflix.. In addition to the interview session, if you are a tech recruiter, most likely, you will need to set up a coding interview to test your candidate’s programming skills, therefore, in the next session, you will learn how to create technical assessment using Codeaid IO. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn about the ethical considerations and candidate’s privacy. We are going to have discussions regarding informed consent, data retention policies, data security, algorithmic bias, compliance with policy regulations, data ownership, and sharing policy.\nFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we utilise AI for the recruitment process? Well, there are many reasons why, firstly you will be able to automate a lot of repetitive tasks by outsourcing those tasks to AI, let me give you an example. There are five hundredths of candidates applying for the job, how long will it take you to read and analyse resumes from each candidate? Maybe days or even weeks, however, by using AI to scan and automatically find the top talents by matching their skills with the required qualifications, you will be able to save a lot of your time. Besides that, AI will also help you to make a better and data driven decision when it comes to deciding which candidate to hire. Last but not least, integrating AI to the recruitment process can also improve the overall recruitment experience for both candidates and recruiters.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn how AI can be used to automate and speed up recruitment process\nLearn how to find most qualified candidates using Holly Hires AI\nLearn how to find do talent sourcing using Each Hire\nLearn how to write job description and interview questions using Careers AI\nLearn how to write job description and interview questions using Hire Hoc\nLearn how to write interview questions using Trio\nLearn how to write job description using Logic Balls\nLearn how to conduct resume screening using Hire Lake AI, Lisa Recruiter, and CV Grader\nLearn how to interview job applicants using Greet AI, Talently AI, and Easy Hire\nLearn how to set up one way interview using Hireflix and D-ID\nLearn how to create technical assessment for coding interview using Codeaid\nLearn about ethical considerations for AI recruitment and candidate’s privacy",

      "description": "Essential Leadership Skills for Successful Business Leaders\nWelcome to the course.\nThe information contained within this business course can and will make a dramatic difference in your business and in your life, if you learn it and use it consistently.\nSadly, many managers and leaders are not properly trained or prepared for the roles the fill.\nThey do not know how to effectively lead and manage the people they are tasked with leading and managing. That results in a lot of unhappy people on all sides and leads to confusion, uncertainty and organizational. inefficiency.\nIt can also lead to regulatory and legal troubles for the business.\nTo do better, take this course and begin learning how to implement management control systems and strategies that work well, work consistently and that get better results from day one of implementation on.\nHandle Difficult Situations With Confidence\nEvery business will need to fire personnel sooner or later and end other relationships.\nThese are not situations to be taken lightly nor handled by incompetent nor otherwise improperly trained personnel. Handling these situations wrong can cause an already stressful and unpleasant situation for the person being terminated to be much worse on them than ever need be - and on you if you are the one conducting the termination - and it can end very badly for all involved parties involved.\nVerbal altercations, threats, even physical violence are all real possibilities - not to mention regulatory complaints and possible legal issues - which are all more likely when improperly trained personnel take the wrong approach.\nSome business risks are inherent, yet when terminating someones employment the vast majority of the times things go truly sideways and end in some level of tragedy - the root cause can usually be traced directly back to the person who handled the actual termination and how they went about it.\nLearn how to handle these situations the right way.\nIn this course you will learn not only how to handle an actual termination - but what you can do long before then and should do once it becomes apparent that a termination will be likely in the near future.\nYou will need to counsel the employee involved at the beginning of the problem behavior and document everything you do - and do it all correctly. In some cases, the employee may change their behavior and resolve the issues allowing you and your organization to be able to retain them and avoid the need to terminate their employment in the first place.\nIn the event that fails you will be documenting that you took all reasonable steps prior to the termination. When it comes down to the date and time and the event itself I will walk you through recommendations of what to do - and caution you on things you should absolutely NOT do...\nCounseling and firing people is a serious part of a business with significant potential repercussions for all involved.\nBe sure you get the training and develop the skills you need to do it right!\n\nMy name is L.D. Sewell and I will be your instructor for this course.\nI have personally hired, onboarded, trained, and managed hundreds of personnel over many years of real-world experience - and yes I have had to terminate employment on many occasions too.\nThe lessons I share with you are not just theory and academic ideas, but they are all lessons learned from years of real-world practical experience actually doing these things.\nWhile the topics and the procedures we cover in this course are never pleasant to have to deal with - they are necessary and critical skills to develop. Better to have those skills BEFORE they are needed.\nI look forward to having you in the course - and should you have any questions about anything covered in this course just let me know and I will do my best to help you.\nBest regards,\nL.D. Sewell",

      "description": "The Workforce Planning and Employment: Employment Legislation course is the 6th of 20 courses developed as part of the Human Resources Certification Program.\nThe materials presented in this course relate to the area of workforce planning and employment. Here we'll examine employment legislation and regulations and how you as the HR professional are expected to ensure compliance.\nThe four key knowledge areas we'll discuss are employment legislation and compliance, affirmative action planning and equal employment opportunity, internal workforce planning and staffing effectiveness, and workforce planning techniques and metrics.\nBefore I begin, I want to stress two very important points. First the PHR exam will only cover federal laws and regulations. No state laws will be tested.\nSecondly, I want to share some advice that I give all of my students: pay attention to the materials and answer the practice questions, and ultimately the PHR exam questions, based on the information you're learning. For those of us who have been in HR for a number of years, it's easy to answer questions based on the knowledge we already have.\nWhile you may arrive at a correct answer, you will not arrive at the correct answer every time. Answer all of the questions with the information provided in mind.\nThe first topic: Employment Legislation and Compliance. Employers must make efforts to increase the presence of women, minorities, covered veterans, and disabled individuals in the workplace.\nIn this second topic, Affirmative Action Planning and Equal Employment Opportunity, we'll examine the development, implementation, and evaluation of an affirmative action plan according to the requirements. When we conclude this topic you should be able to recognize these key aspects.\nHR planning has to consider the organizational strategy in order to anticipate employee skill and labor needs. Our next topic examines internal workforce and staffing effectiveness assessments. Here you should develop a knowledge of internal workforce assessment techniques and methods to examine past and future staffing effectiveness. Pay close attention to the details involved in the various analysis methods, as they tend to be particularly challenging as part of the exam.\nWhile attracting a large quantity of applicants may be desirable, the quality of the candidates is the most critical factor. In topic four, Workforce Planning Techniques and Metrics, we'll look at recruiting objectives and selection criteria, as well as sources and methods of recruitment. We'll then go on to discuss some advantages and disadvantages of those recruiting methods.\nThat’s it! Now, go ahead and push that “Take this course” button and see you on the inside!",

      "description": "Have You Ever Wondered How Your Unconscious Bias Could Be Impacting Your Decision-Making?\nIn a world where diversity is increasingly recognized as a strength, it is crucial to understand how unconscious bias influences our thoughts, behaviors, and interactions. Do you know that unconscious bias is often present in the workplace, even when we don’t realize it? Unconscious bias affects hiring decisions, team dynamics, performance evaluations, and overall workplace culture. The good news is that you can learn to identify, address, and mitigate these biases. With the right training, you can unlock your potential to make fair, inclusive decisions that benefit everyone in your organization.\nWelcome to our Unconscious Bias Training course—designed to help you recognize and cope with unconscious bias. In this course, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how these biases operate, their impact, and how to develop the skills necessary to reduce their effects. With increasing attention on the importance of diversity, this training is essential for individuals looking to foster a more inclusive and equitable workplace. According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, effective unconscious bias training helps raise awareness, leading to proactive measures that mitigate its impact. Let’s explore how this course can transform your approach to bias in the workplace.\nThe first section of this Unconscious Bias Training introduces the concept of unconscious bias, explaining its nature and significance. You’ll explore the different types of biases that impact our decisions and perceptions, including racial bias, gender bias, and confirmation bias. Understanding how these biases operate is the first step in recognizing them within yourself and others. This foundational knowledge is crucial for identifying the subtle, often unnoticed influences that unconscious bias has on our actions and interactions.\nIn the second section, we dive into how unconscious bias affects various aspects of organizational life. We’ll explore how bias influences recruitment, hiring practices, team dynamics, and performance evaluations. Real-life examples demonstrate how unconscious bias can lead to discrimination, hinder diversity, and perpetuate inequality within organizations. Addressing unconscious bias in these areas is key to creating a workplace that values diversity and fosters collaboration among all employees.\nThe third section focuses on practical strategies to reduce unconscious bias. You’ll learn techniques to raise self-awareness, such as mindfulness practices and reflection exercises that help you become more conscious of your own biases. Additionally, we’ll explore structured decision-making processes that ensure fairness, along with the importance of incorporating diversity training and education into organizational policies. By adopting inclusive practices, you can create a work environment where biases are actively addressed, and individuals feel empowered to succeed regardless of their background.\nIn the final section, we highlight the importance of continuous improvement in addressing unconscious bias. Traditional Unconscious Bias Training is just the beginning. The course emphasizes that long-term success in combating bias requires a commitment to ongoing education, leadership involvement, and policy reviews. Bias mitigation must be part of a broader strategy for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within organizations. Through regular updates, feedback loops, and continuous learning, you will be equipped to contribute to a workplace where everyone can thrive.\nWhat Makes This Course Essential?\nRaise Awareness: Understand how unconscious bias shapes your perceptions and decisions.\nMake Inclusive Decisions: Learn strategies to identify and reduce bias in your interactions and professional environment.\nPractical Insights: Gain actionable tools to create a more inclusive, equitable workplace.\nSustained Change: Learn the importance of continuous improvement and leadership commitment to combat unconscious bias effectively.\nCareer Pathways\nUpon completing this Unconscious Bias Training, you will be better equipped to contribute to roles such as:\nDiversity and Inclusion Officer\nHR Professional\nTeam Leader or Manager\nRecruitment Specialist\nOrganizational Development Consultant\nWorkplace Trainer\nWhy Study Unconscious Bias?\nBuild Self-Awareness: Recognize your own biases and take proactive steps to reduce their impact.\nEnhance Your Career: Gain the skills to lead diversity and inclusion initiatives, enhancing your professional profile.\nFoster Inclusivity: Contribute to a healthier, more inclusive workplace culture where everyone feels valued.\nCreate Real Change: Help organizations become more equitable and just for all employees.\nEnroll Today in the Unconscious Bias Training Course!\nTransform the way you approach decision-making and communication in your professional life.

      "description": "Despite your best efforts and dedication as an L&D professional, the results often fall short. Training sessions that seemed promising during development fail to create lasting change. Participants seem engaged during sessions but struggle to apply what they've learned when they return to their work. Knowledge evaporates within weeks, with performance metrics remaining unchanged despite significant investments in training. This disconnect between training efforts and actual results is frustrating, costly, and demoralizing for both you and your organization.\nThink about how much time and energy you've invested in creating learning experiences that were quickly forgotten. Consider the awkward conversations with stakeholders when they question the ROI of your training initiatives. Remember the frustration of seeing the same performance issues persist despite multiple training attempts. Without understanding the fundamental mechanisms of how people actually learn, you're forced to rely on trends, intuition, or outdated methods — essentially throwing darts blindfolded and hoping something sticks.\nEach ineffective training experience doesn't just waste resources; each ineffective training experience erodes confidence in your L&D function and diminishes your professional satisfaction. Meanwhile, the pace of change in today's workplace continues to accelerate, making effective learning more critical than ever. The gap between what you're trying to achieve and what's actually happening grows wider, leaving you caught in a cycle of redesigning the same training without understanding why it isn't working.\nThis concise course gives you the missing piece: Belcher's Model for Learning — a comprehensive framework that explains how people actually learn efficiently and effectively. In just 60 minutes of focused video content, you'll discover the fundamental mechanisms that drive successful learning experiences.\nYou'll learn how to:\nUnderstand how working memory, long-term memory, and practical application work together to create lasting learning.\nDiagnose exactly where and why current training isn't working.\nDesign learning experiences that work with human cognition.\nOrganize training for maximum retention and application.\nAnticipate and address the personal, organizing, and social factors that impact learning outcomes.\nThe course includes a practical challenge where you'll immediately apply what you've learned by modifying a small section in a training experience, aligning them with the Model for Learning.\nAlthough changing established practices can feel challenging, staying stuck with ineffective training is far more frustrating and costly. The ideas in this course will transform your approach to learning and development, leading to beautifully-crafted training experiences that generate efficient and effective learning!",

      "description": "When mentoring young managers typically the most difficult skill to develop is dealing with conflict and having the conflict result in a positive outcome. Silent approval or conflict avoidance tends to contribute to employee conflict. but also intensifies the situation. These managers or leaders will either ignore the conflict or refuse to engage in the situation. managers being non-committal, withdrawn, ignoring or sidestepping the person or problem can execute avoidance. Rather than deal with the problem by evading or delaying the confrontation becomes a lose-lose situation for both parties. Although conflict management is a difficult skill to develop, it is essential that managers and leaders master the skill emotionally and professionally.\nOnly focusing on how a problem negatively impacted your team is the wrong way to approach resolving a conflict. Consider why the client is upset or disappointed in the relationship. Consider the implications for her team or even her job. Try to understand the motivations for the client being difficult. One way to create empathy in your team and the client's is to prompt everyone to consider a hypothetical situation that allows people to disconnect emotionally from the situation and consider a different perspective. this can put people in a new mindset and make them more willing to work through an issue.",

      "description": "The Employee and Labor Relations: Behavioral and Disciplinary Issues and Resolution course is the 17th of 20 courses developed as part of the Human Resources Certification Program.\nIn this course, the focus will be on examining problematic employee behaviors and performance issues, and the steps an employer can take to improve them. We'll also look at disciplinary process designed to give employees a chance to improve and help the employer avoid employment litigation.\nNext is a discussion of using alternate dispute resolution approaches as a way to prevent disciplinary actions and terminations from resulting in lawsuits. And finally, we'll look at the roles and importance of organizational policies, procedures, and work rules, and how managers and HR professionals can work to make sure that the employees understand and follow them. In topic 1, Organization Policies, Procedures, and Work Rules, you'll gain a better understanding of the importance of establishing, updating, and communicating workplace policies, procedures, and work rules and the significance of monitoring their application and enforcement to ensure consistency.\nIt's important to handle insubordination issues professionally and without making them personal. In topic 2, Workplace Behavior Issues, our focus will be on increasing your knowledge of workplace behavior issues and practices, including absenteeism, and performance improvement plans.\nNever rely on rumors or assumptions. In topic 3, The Disciplinary Process, you'll become more familiar with developing and implementing a discipline policy based on the organization's code of conduct and ethics, the importance of ensuring that there is no disparate impact of protected classes, and that disciplinary actions and terminations are handled lawfully.\nThe ADR process is generally more flexible than the court process. In topic 4, Grievance and Dispute Resolution, you'll gain a better understanding of how to develop, administer, and evaluate grievance and dispute resolution processes and performance improvement policies and procedures.\nThat’s it! Now, go ahead and push that “Take this course” button and see you on the inside!",

      "description": "There's an assumption that a company needs  1,000+ employees before it can even begin to think about justifying the cost of such a role.\nAnd that's not true. Which is why I built this class..\nAs you’ll soon see, I know that employer branding, when done well, is an absolute game-changer. In ways big and small, your employer brand determines who you can hire, how quickly and how dearly, and encourages people to stick around longer. It even gives your marketing team a whole new set of colors with which to promote their products and services.\nAnd that goes double for smaller companies. When you don’t have an army of recruiters, millions to spend on a cool tech stack, when your marketing team seems like it’s sprinting 24/7 just to keep from drowning, employer branding (and employer brand thinking) means every new hire can be a little better, a little faster, changing how your whole company looks at its own talent and what it can expect from itself as it grows.\nFor me, employer branding is democratic. It is useful for everyone. But the economics of employer branding means only big (and/or rich) companies can afford and leverage it.\nThink of this as the instruction manual for getting your employer brand up and running.\nThis course is designed to help every single company who wants to hire take advantage of their employer brand. To allow any company to compete for talent in any weight class. To allow you to get more hiring done with less.",

      "description": "The recruitment process in KSA largely aligns with global standards. It begins with identifying staffing needs and defining job requirements, followed by advertising through popular channels like online job boards, social media, and referrals. Candidates are then shortlisted based on their qualifications and experience, leading to face-to-face or video interviews. Successful applicants receive formal offers detailing their salary, benefits, and start date.\nKSA labor laws mandate written job offers that clearly outline the job title, salary, and benefits. For expatriate employees, employers are responsible for securing necessary work permits and residency visas. The country's labor law safeguards employee rights, covering aspects like minimum wage, working hours, and leave entitlements.\nDespite its advantages, KSA employers encounter several recruitment challenges. A notable issue is the shortage of skilled candidates, particularly in high-demand fields such as technology, healthcare, and finance. This often necessitates overseas recruitment, which can increase costs and administrative burdens.\nIn essence, recruitment in KSA is fundamental for attracting top talent. While it shares similarities with international practices, it also presents unique challenges like skill deficits and turnover. Adhering to KSA labor laws is paramount. Strategic investment in recruitment initiatives is key to successful talent acquisition and retention.\ngreytHR Academy offers a comprehensive explanation of the KSA recruitment process for both domestic and expatriate employees, highlighting the vital role of HR and recruitment executives in talent acquisition within Saudi Arabia.",

During the 1950s and 1960s, the multi-rater trend continued in the United States within the Military service academies.\nAt the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, the midshipmen used a multi-source process called “peer grease” to evaluate the leadership skills of their classmates.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, in the corporate world, organizations like Bank of America, United Airlines, Bell Labs, Disney, Federal Express, Nestle, and RCA experimented with multi-source feedback in a variety of measurement situations.\n360 degree feedback system provides performance data from multiple points of reference. It is more powerful, reliable and accurate as compared to traditional, single source feedback processes. The feedback tends to be more balanced and is also harder to dismiss due to its' broader range of inputs’.\nThis method employs a multi-source feedback method which provides a comprehensive perspective of employee performance by utilizing feedback from the full circle of people with whom the employee interacts: supervisors, subordinates and co-workers.",

More than half ( 56%) of the people in a recent survey. Lied on their resume, mostly around work experience, education, skills and job duties. While a small fabrication may not be a big deal in some industries it could be downright dangerous and irresponsible in others. Candidate omission can be just bad-if not worse- than simple stretching the truth. For instance someone with a recent history of violence may not be forthcoming about their past. An incident in the workplace could put customers and other employees in danger which could lead to negligent hiring lawsuits and permanent damage to the company reputation.\nIt's a best practice to implement background screening across your entire organization, but tailor the employment screening packages by position. For example you may wish to require credit checks for positions that manage money and driving record checks for positions that involve operating motor vehicles. Your background check policy should specify what types of information you will consider in employment decisions. It's considered a best practice to take into account the nature of the position sought the nature of the crime and the amount of time since the conviction occurred.",

The need to have a common agreement on terms is important, most parties intend different outcomes  in terms of timelines, consideration, performance etc. Negotiation plays an important part in getting the parties to agree at a common position so that each party is satisfied. A lawyer with good negotiation skills can turn around a loss into a beneficial compromise and therefore a lawyer must approach negotiation as not a competition but as a beneficial compromise wherein each party leaves with respect and satisfaction.",

      "description": "Business ethics, the application of moral principles in a business setting, plays a pivotal role in shaping a company's reputation and success. It entails adhering to values and standards that promote transparency, fairness and honesty in business interactions. A solid reputation, built through ethical practices, is invaluable for a company. It attracts and retain customers, investors, and partners. Conversely, unethical behavior can severely tarnish a company's image, resulting in financial losses and diminished trust. Today's consumers and stakeholders demand ethical conduct from businesses. They seek transparency and fairness in operations and their perceptions are often amplified through social media platform.\nA code of ethics outlines the general principles of ethical behavior that should guide decision- making, while a code of conduct provides specific guidelines for actions and behavior. Together, they form the cornerstone of a company's ethical framework, ensuring consistency in behavior and decision-making across the organization. Ethical decision- making in business involves evaluating actions based on moral principles and the potential impact on various stakeholders. Businesses often face ethical dilemmas in which the right course of action may not be clear. For example, a company discovering a flaw in its product post-launch may face a dilemma between recalling the product or risking potential harm to consumers. Strategies for navigating such dilemmas include consulting with external ethics advisors, engaging in stakeholder dialogues, and utilizing ethical decision-making frameworks.  To evaluate corporate codes of ethics ethically, you must apply universal moral standards like trustworthiness, respect, responsibility fairness caring and  citizenship to stages of content, creation, implementation and administration. Although many laws establish ethical standards it's primarily up to businesss to develop a comprehensive code of ethics.",

Focusing on the critical areas of Fire Safety and Workplace Safety, this course delves into the legal responsibilities of both employers and employees under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. We cover vital fire prevention strategies, including electrical safety, proper handling of flammable materials, and the importance of good housekeeping. Learners will gain a thorough understanding of fire dynamics, including the fire triangle, how fire spreads through direct burning, radiation, convection, and conduction, and common causes of workplace fires.\nThe training also provides detailed instruction on emergency procedures, ensuring that employees know how to raise the alarm, evacuate safely, and understand the roles of fire alarms, emergency lighting, and fire doors. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to fire extinguishers, covering different types (water, foam, dry powder, CO2, wet chemical), their appropriate uses based on fire classes (A, B, C, D, Electrical, F), and practical application using the PASS method. We also address post-fire procedures, emphasizing the importance of investigation, insurance claims, emotional support, and learning from incidents to improve future safety measures. This Fire Awareness Training is crucial for maintaining a safe work environment, protecting lives and property, and meeting legal obligations. By the end of this course, participants will be confident in their ability to prevent fires, respond effectively in emergencies, and contribute to a proactive fire safety culture.",

The value and effectiveness of treating employees and colleagues with respect and dignity are still not appreciated by many organizations that allow bullying and harassment to persist. This course highlights the significance of bullying and harassment in the workplace and provides guidelines on what to do to prevent them and to respond if or when they do arise.\nThere is much talk these days of a commitment to investing in health and wellbeing in the workplace, but issues around bullying and harassment – which are, of course, major obstacles to health and wellbeing – are often not considered as part of this.\nBut, even in the best-run organizations, such problems are not entirely absent. This course therefore explores what is needed to tackle bullying and harassment in the workplace. There are no simple or formula solutions – the issues are too complex for that – but there are steps that can be taken to keep such problems out of the workplace as far as possible.",

Are you interested in aligning innovation using data and customer experience to enhance the vision of your company? Would it be helpful to transform workflows and lead a digital transformation to help your business run more efficiently? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this course is for you!\nThe C-suite is responsible for not just leading but also defining the vision and culture of an organisation. With the business landscape evolving to accommodate leaner practises, organisations that want to compete in a highly competitive and diverse market should look to optimise C-suite operations and structures to benefit business processes. One way of optimising the C-suite is through the merging of modern roles that can have a positive impact on the business through decision-making and future-proofing the business, increasing transparency and accountability. This includes activities highlighting new growth opportunities through better business practises, restructuring the organisation for more efficiency and trying to streamline decision-making for positive project outcomes. A survey by American professional services firm McKinsey and Company showed that companies that implement strategic roles in existing C-suites are 44% more likely to secure better business positions. This statistic highlights that strategic vision and the ability to recognise and merge high-level roles can have a huge impact on the bottom line of businesses. This course is specifically designed to teach business leaders about leading change within the C-suite and how to optimise executive-level business processes for long-term growth in competitive markets.\nOver a series of short video lectures, we will provide a comprehensive exploration of the evolving C-suite, delving into the dynamic and interconnected roles of Chief Experience Officers (CXOs), Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and Chief Data Officers (CDOs). We'll examine how these roles are being redefined in the face of digital disruption and increasing customer expectations. You'll uncover the secrets to synergising these key leadership positions for optimal success, learning how to strategically align innovation, data and customer experience at the highest level to drive growth and competitive advantage. We'll delve deep into the world of the CXO,  analysing their growing influence on customer-centric strategies and providing you with practical frameworks to harness their expertise to build lasting customer relationships and brand loyalty. You'll gain a thorough understanding of how to drive digital transformation within your organisation, equipping you with the knowledge and tools to lead your teams into the future by embracing technologies like AI, machine learning and cloud computing. We'll explore the strategic role of the CIO, analysing how they identify emerging technological trends, foster a culture of innovation and implement robust cybersecurity measures to future-proof your business against disruption.\nFurthermore, you'll learn how to cultivate a data-driven culture within your organisation, mastering techniques to extract valuable insights from your data and utilise those insights to make informed strategic decisions with confidence and clarity.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to navigate the complexities of the modern C-suite and confidently lead your organisation towards a successful and sustainable future.
