From acute injuries and chronic pain to systemic disorders and fascial imbalances, this modality empowers you to help clients with issues you may never have thought possible.\n\n\nWhat Students Are Saying\n\"This was one of the best courses I have taken. Absolutely life-changing!\"\n\"Unbelievable course. I performed the neck moves, and it feels like all my tension is gone. Amazing!\"\n\"Exceptional. My tendonitis felt better after one session.

Fascial dysfunction can lead to misalignments, pain, inflammation, and organ issues.

      "description": "Come and journey with me into the amazing qualities of sound healing using tuning forks that can benefit not only you, but your friends, family & beyond!  Tuning forks are amazing gifts for humanity to heal at a deeper level.  Learn about sound healing frequencies beneficial for stress, anxiety, pain, depression, headaches, insomnia, increasing memory and mental focus, clearing blocked energy, nerve damage, wound healing, cardiac, neurological, reproductive and immune system health, EMF radiation protection, balancing metabolism, body temperature, sleep-wake cycles, increasing brain blood flow, stimulating cellular energy, Parkinson's, anti-ageing, muscle tension, autism, ADHD, multiple sclerosis, grounding, deepening meditation, DNA activation, and spiritual awakening.\nHave you noticed that many courses give a lot of fluff, but not enough detail, yet that’s where the magic and real healing lies!  Imagine being able to add in the science of frequency to your first aid kit to assist yourself, family, friends & add to any modality you offer with the beautiful healing benefits of sound\nWhat I would love you to leave with after doing this course, is knowing:\nSound is a faster and easier way of healing the body.  The ultimate bio hack!\nPrecise frequency equals faster healing results!\nHow you can trust your body to heal and empower yourself to become your own healer and others too!\nFor those interested in solfeggio frequencies, 111Hz is the main master frequency binaural beat/difference tone between two forks in a set of 6, 9 or the full 18 set of Zobet forks e.g. 285 and 396Hz or 417 and 528Hz (396-285  - 111Hz and 528-417Hz - 111Hz) etc and whilst I don't cover the indepth teachings of solfeggio frequencies in this course, I do cover the basic healing benefits of the 111Hz frequency.  To learn about Zobet frequencies indepth (where solfeggio frequencies actually come from), you'll find many DVD's/videos, eBooks, a 111Hz presentation (Why 111Hz & Why now?), a 111Hz masterclass webinar series and a solfeggio tuning fork practitioner course, together with many other practitioner courses on my website.\nThe psychic Edgar Cayce once said \"Sound will be the medicine of the future\".\n... and I do believe the future is NOW!\nLet’s dive into this awesome, safe, non-invasive, subtle, yet potent healing modality for our ever changing times together!\nI'm excited for you to join me on this journey!!!\nCOMING SOON: A brand NEW course recording with NEW Course topics which include:-\nAluminium vs. Steel Forks\nDoes precise frequency matter?\nFake forks and how to avoid them\nWhat instruments can transmit precise frequency\nOther healing frequencies; &\nWhy it's helpful to detox to support your healing & others too.\nN.B. Kindly note this is an Intro/Beginners course focused more on the theory of wholistic sonic science using tuning forks, rather than the practical application of tuning forks, as it's simply not possible to cover that in a beginners course of this length.  Practical application techniques onto key body areas and meridian points for personal self care and practitioner use for clients are however covered in depth in my many different certified practitioner courses on my website.  Thank you for your kind consideration.",

      "description": "In this course Manual Osteopath, Registered Massage Therapist and Yoga Teacher Michael Eric Everson is going to guide you through how to do facial cupping massage. Facial cupping therapy uses suction cups to stimulate skin, muscles and blood circulation. As a result, tension points and aches are relieved, inflammation is reduced, cell repair as well as lymphatic drainage are added benefits. Also, it’s been noted to help with bruxism (excessive teeth grinding or jaw clenching) and sinusitis.\nFacial cupping is meant to increase blood circulation and stimulate the facial cells that are responsible for collagen and elastin production. Which in turn, can brighten your skin, minimize the appearance of scars, fine lines and wrinkles, and tone your jawline, chin, and neck by decreasing puffiness. Also, unlike body cupping, facial cupping causes no bruising.\nThis course is perfect for professionals looking to have an add on treatment for either a massage or aesthetic service, knowing that this service can help you feel and look rejuvenated with the clinical benefits of clearing out the sinuses and helping with TMJ pain and tension headaches. It doesn't even take very long, only 10-15 minutes to feel incredible results.\nYou can study and complete this entire course in the comfort of your own home with lifetime access to the videos in case you need to go back, review and re-inspire yourself!\nIn this course you are going to learn:\n> How to facial cupping as a treatment you can use on clients for improved facial health\n> A practice sequence that you can do on yourself to get a feel for the amazing effects of facial cupping\n> Become a specialist in this craft which allow you to use it as an add on and increase your income\n> Learn about the reasoning and specific movements that will increase the effectiveness of your facial treatments\nEnroll now!

Change in attire, hairstyle (of the instructor) per lesson reduces boredom from a student perspective.\" Shiela Marie Penuliar\n\n\n\"Great. Have exercised for many years (jog, walk, swim, gym, yoga), yet posture not good. I started the Posturecise programs when I injured my shoulder. Posturecise has not only supported my recovery from injury, it has given me a much greater awareness of my own body and correct movement. My posture has improved significantly and I feel much more confident during activities.\" Thank you. Jan Hall\n\n\n\"I love this course. I the exercises are very well explained and demonstrated, easy to follow. I have struggled with posture problems and back ache for a while and incorporating these exercises into a daily routine have really made a difference for me. Thank you for this course!\" Ralitza Abadjieva\n\n\n\"Great Course! I work at an office job, and spend a lot of time commuting. This course was exactly what I needed. The course starts with measuring your posture, and then moves on to outline specific stretches, exercises, and massages to target key areas like forward head and rounded shoulders. Definitely recommend if you are willing to do the work to improve your posture.\"  Shannon Everett\n\n\n\"Posturecise has helped me release my upper back tension in a short time. It was amazing to see how a few simple, well structured and targeted exercises could make such a difference so quickly.\" Sabrina Colvin Sterling\n\n\n\"I've been looking for an easy to learn system for improving posture for a long time. And now I have found it.\" David Ed Wilkes\n\n\n\"Ive had posture problems for a long while now and much as I have struggled to correct it, I just haven't found the consistent technique that you taught here. Poor posture always left me feeling tired constantly and just doing a bit of your course helped boost my energy. I will endeavor to follow your 21 Day Challenge. Thanks again!\" Abrl Pglng\n\n\n_____________________________\n\n\nIn the early 90's, frustrated by years of pill-popping and chronic daily headaches, I took myself to a chiropractor. I was so amazed with the results, that I moved to the UK (from Toronto) to study Chiropractic.\n\n\nSeveral years after qualifying, I was horrified by a picture of myself. I had developed horrible forward head posture - I was embarrassed to be a healthcare professional with bad posture. I become obsessed with how to improve my posture. I spent years studying x-rays and trying new products and exercises. I later qualified with a fellowship in the physics of posture correction. I fell in love with posture!\n\n\nRegaining attractive, tall, confident posture takes time and commitment but a commitment to your health and well-being that you can learn to love, until one day you wake and look in the mirror and you see that you are oozing posture confidence – and boy, that will be a day to celebrate.\n\n\n_____________________________\nPosturecise (Level 2) - The advanced version of the original Posturecise course\n\n\nPosturecise (Level 2) is all about YOU and helping you regain attractive, youthful posture. Posture that you're proud of, posture that makes you feel confident.\n\n\nThe course includes my posture Golden Rules and includes a whole series of self tests that you can do to help you to determine where you are starting from and helps you monitor your progress as you move through the course.\n\n\nThe Posture Strengthening section of the course will help you target the worse posture areas by far (neck stabilizers, rotator cuff, abdominal core and pelvic architecture). This is a tough section.\n\n\nThe Posture Stretching section targets whole muscle groups - the muscles responsible for round shoulders, hunch back, the chronically tight lumbar region and the muscle tension in our necks due to our busy desk-based lives.\n\n\nA really exciting section of the Posturecise Pro course is an entire section on Self Treatment: You'll learn lots of self massage techniques and particularly how to remove painful muscle knots from your shoulders, back and buttocks.\n\n\nPosturecise Pro goes beyond creating a new habit. This course is designed to help you create attractive, youthful posture that will leave you thriving and practically oozing posture confidence!\n\n\n_____________________________\n\n\nWhat this course is not:\nA bust your gut boot-camp for fitness slaves that feel the need to pound their bodies and sweat profusely.\nA quick fix - I can not stress this enough.

Has sitting all day, made you feel sluggish, and zapped your energy? Has your sitting job created health problems for you like weight gain or pain in your body?\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions you are absolutely not alone! The vast majority of us sit all day long and have no real way to fix the issue. You may have recently heard that \"sitting is the new smoking\" and can cause all kinds of health issues. But what in the heck are we supposed to do? Many of us have tried exercise as a way to counter act the effects of sitting only to get injured. Fads, scary news, and the fact that life is just dang too busy can become extremely overwhelming, confusing, and stressful. At this point most people just give up because they have no idea where to start. Where DO you start? Who DO you believe? It all becomes too overwhelming to even start at times.\nSitting Solutions For The Busy Professional Make It Simple To Give You Mastery Over Your Body, Reverse The Effects Of Sitting, Reduce Pain, Lower Risk Of Injury, And Have More Energy!\nConfidently understand if sitting is affecting your body through an assessment system\nLearn if sitting truly IS the new smoking\nEasily find if you need to start at the 1. beginner 2. intermediate, or 3. advanced level\nLearn the 5 minute \"fix\" that will reverse the effects of sitting on your body\nBecome confident in what your body can do when sitting is not an issue\nIncrease your balance, strength, and coordination\nLearn the 30 second \"Pattern Interrupt\" that you can implement immediately to reset your body's patterns toward sitting\nThe Sitting Solutions For The Busy Professional, comes with the Udemy 30 Day 100% Money Back Guarantee. You have nothing to lose, EXCEPT THE STIFFNESS SITTING HAS CREATED!\nMeet your teacher:\nMy name is Dr. Michael Weir, and I am a wellness based chiropractor with over a decade in private practice, helping my busy, professional patients reach their fullest health potentials. My practice is in Bellevue, Washington home of Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, and the vast majority of my patients sit at a computer all day long, some for as many as 12 hours a day! I was recently asked what the main problem is that I help, and my answer was \"SITTING\".\nMy back ground and post-doctorate education is in the field of \"chiropractic neurology\" and postural restoration. Poor posture has become an epidemic in our culture creating problems such as headaches, low back pain, mid back pain, shoulder discomfort and hip pain. Sitting is the main issue creating poor posture in our current culture. Not only does sitting create the poor posture related to pain, these postures are unsightly, make us look fatter than we actually are and reduce our overall confidence.\nOne of the things that greatly separate me from some other teachers is that I am still in daily private practice working one on one with my patients just like you in the real world. These principles in the Sitting Solutions are the principles that I have been teaching my patients one on one, for the last 12 years. I understand the struggles of sitting, because I hear the struggles that my patients deal with on a daily basis.\nWhy did I create The Sitting Solutions for the Busy Professional?\nAfter over a decade in dealing with the struggles my patients have with sitting I found that each person who sits for too long deals with very similar issues. I have taken 1000's of x-rays of these patients and found that each person presents with varying degrees of the same problem. I have also found that the correction of these problems is also very similar in each of these \"sitters\". These patterns lead me to develop the specific correction plans that make up The Sitting Solutions.\nThis has become my expertise and I want to now give the gift of how to fix these issues to you. I have taken the education that I teach my patients on a one on one basis and recorded video of how to do each step of the process. This is a process that my patients will easily pay well over $1000 for. I want to make it accessible to anyone who sits the majority of their day.\n\nWhat is The Sitting Solutions For The Busy Professional?\nSitting Solutions is about demystifying the steps necessary to fix the damaging effects of sitting. You see it on Facebook, Twitter and even in the news now that sitting is bad for you, but they don't give you solutions for how to fix it. Some websites may give you a few ways to help with the sitting effects, but do not give the entire process which leaves you feeling \"half way put together\". Its four simple tools to help you fix your body in a simple, uncomplicated way. Sitting Solutions gives you the tools, the knowledge, and the motivation to make fixing your body a part of your life.\nWhy Sitting Solutions For The Busy Professional?\nI have found in over a decade private practice that if my busy patients did not make simple lifestyle changes there was no way that they would be able to 1) feel better and 2) even if they did start to feel better they had a terrible time sustaining those changes. That is why I wanted to make a program and a course that was easy to make into a life style. I wanted to make it something that you look forward to instead of dreading.These reutines should be very easy, take a short amount of time and be something that you need very little space for. It should also be something that you could do at the office with ease, and this is all what The Sitting Solutions does for you.\nDon't forget that with The Sitting Solutions For The Busy Professional, you have the Udemy 30 Day 100% Money Back Guarantee!\nIs The Sitting Solutions For The Busy Professional Exercise Program?\nNot in the traditional sense...The Sitting Solutions is more of a movement program designed to specifically counteract the effects of sitting on the body. There is no cardio, no weight lifting, but we will be doing some stretches, and some strength building to break the stiffness and muscle imbalances that sitting creates.\n\n30 Day Trial of Sitting Solutions For Busy Professionals\nYou really wouldn't believe how excited I am for you to join me in this course, and bring your health and fitness to its greatest potential!

      "description": "European Sculptural Facial Massage is one of the most popular and effective facial massage technique, which has won the hearts of beauticians from all over the world and has plenty of A-list fans.\nSculptural Facial Massage (also known as \"non-surgical facelift”) is a great treatment:\nfor tighten the skin and smooth wrinkles,\nreduce nasolabial folds,\nrestore firmness and elasticity,\ntighten facial contour\nand keep skin tone even.\nThere are quite a lot of varieties and approaches in sculptural facial massage (like the French technique of Joelle Ciocco or a number of techniques from Asia). Based on my many years of practice, I have selected the most effective massage movements that do not cause discomfort for the client and quite easy to learn.\nSculptural Face Massage is optimal for clients of all ages and skin types. It can be performed as a standalone treatment or as an addition to another procedure.\nThis technique will take its rightful place in your practice, increase your income and your customers will be delighted with the result.\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN? (spoiler: a lot)\nIn European Sculptural Facial Massage you will learn the most effective techniques that tighten the face contour and erase wrinkles even after the first treatment.\nDuring the course, you will learn six massage techniques:\n1 | The \"stroking\" technique.\nThe initial stage of sculptural facial massage. It has a significant tonic and calming effect. Improves skin respiration, enhances lymph and blood flow.\n2 | Lymphatic drainage technique.\nIt helps to stimulate the lymphatic system, accelerate the removal of toxins and excess fluid.\n3 | The \"rubbing\" technique.\nThe goal of this technique is to warm up the skin and increase blood flow by expanding the blood vessels. This is necessary in order to prepare the skin for the next more intense effect on the muscles.\n4 | The «pinching» technique.\nIn this part of our journey we will work with wrinkles.\n5 | Pinpoint pressing technique.\nIt is the impact on biologically active points. Pinpoint pressing helps to smooth out wrinkles, improves skin color and makes it more dense and elastic.\nAnd the final part of the sculpturing face massage: Facial Oval and Face Lift technique.\n\n\nEASY TO LEARN - EASY TO EARN\nThe practical part of the European Sculptural Facial Massage course is filmed in innovative first-person shots. From the video lessons, you will easily understand how to place your hands, hold your body and perform movements.\nTo make it easier to remember, each face massage movement has its own \"associative\" name (like Knot, Finger shower).\nEach module is split into three parts. In the first part, I describe the features of the technique.\nIn the second, I show all the movements slowly. In the third part you can repeat the movements after me.\nYou will also get a \"Workbook\" with a detailed description and photos of each movement.\nAfter the course, you will get an international certificate of completion, which will be a clear confirmation of your expertise in the field of sculptural massage.\n\n\n\nWHO IS YOUR TRAINER?\nKsenia is an international beauty trainer and founder of the first online academy of SMART aesthetics «Face Cult». In 7 years of practice, she have studied dozens of facial massage techniques (from French and Spanish to Japanese and Chinese), and performed many procedures.\nHave conducted over 100 online and live workshops in Switzerland, Australia, England, Spain and trained over one thousand students, including top beauticians and personal cosmetologists for the Hollywood actors from Los Angeles.\n\n\nEnroll now and start learning European Sculptural Facial Massage Mastery Course today!",

It is thought that a normalised body will be less prone to muscular-skeletal medical conditions and dysfunctions and it is also believed that Zhan Zhuang, when practiced for developing relaxation, will lead to a beneficial calming effect of the heart and mind.\n\n\nThis Qigong System offers a fast and effective means to recharge your energy, reduce stress, gain superior mental clarity and give you the ability to stay focused.\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL GAIN BY PRACTISING THIS QIGONG SYSTEM?\n\n\nAids in increasing vital energy in the body.\nDevelops strength and stamina.\nIt helps in calming and grounding the body.\nIncreases strength and flexibility.\nDevelops self-awareness, balance, perseverance and discipline.\nTreats digestive disorders.\nQuietens the busy mind and gives you a sense of purpose and direction.\nLearn this famous standing Qigong meditation exercise system.\n\n\nThank you for joining me on my course, please send me feedback, ask me any questions and please write a review.\n\n\nCheers,\nPete C",

She decided to see a chiropractor and was very surprised by how much better she felt. She felt so much better that she even moved from Canada to the UK to learn more about it.\nSeveral years after qualifying, Dr. Paula Moore was horrified by a picture of herself. She had developed horrible forward head posture and was embarrassed to be a healthcare professional with bad posture. She became obsessed with how to improve her posture and spent years studying x-rays and trying new products and exercises. She later qualified with a fellowship in the physics of posture correction and fell in love with everything posture related.\nPosturecise is the result of nearly 20 years of personal and clinical experience correcting her own posture and helping 10s of thousands of other people regain their posture confidence!\nThe 21 Posturecise movements in this course were designed to target your whole body and are safe and gentle enough to do every day.\n\n\nEvery single technique revealed in this course is easy to put into place in minutes - and can give you instant results:\n\n\nincreased spinal flexibility\nboosted energy levels\nfewer aches and pains\nimproved body image\nrenewed confidence\nWhile most exercise programs are rigorous, this course is so humane and realistic that many of the 21 Posturecise movements can be done while watching TV, sitting at your office desk, or even in your car, waiting for the light to change!\n\n\nThis course is not a bust-your-gut boot camp for fitness slaves who need to pound their bodies and sweat profusely.\nI emphasize that you need no prior experience. Posturecise is gentle and safe enough for all ages and abilities.\n\n\nYou'll Receive:\n21 video posture tutorials\n8 floor posture video tutorials (REAL ways to target your core)\n8 seated posture video tutorials (includes forward head)\n5 standing posture video tutorials\nInstruction from a qualified health care physician (not a trainer)\nA 21-minute routine\nThe 21-day Posturecise challenge\nAdvice on how to deal with common barriers\nTake the first step towards improving your posture and overall health by joining my course today!

      "description": "CURIOUS ABOUT HERBAL MEDICINE?\nStart making your first herbal remedy from day one. It is easier than you think!\nNo matter where in the world you live, you have easy access to valuable medicinal plants. Over 28,000 students have greatly benefited from this online herbalism course. For beginners, the course has been life changing. For those who already have some experience, it has filled in the gaps. Imagine everything you need to get started in one place!\nHere’s what students have to say:\n★★★★★ \"Wonderful course that is taught by an experienced herbalist. This is THE place to start when you want to be a herbalist.\" – Tessa H\n★★★★★ \"Very good information that I have not been able to find anywhere else. Very easy to understand.” – Carolyn E\n★★★★★ \"It helps to see the instructor really performing the tasks - a picture (or video here) is worth a thousand words. There are many helpful details that would not even occur to me to ask about. The Q&A section works great! I am immediately putting the new knowledge to practice, referring back to the lessons for details. Thank you!\" – Zdenka D\n★★★★★ \"This was an excellent beginner course for me! It provided a gold mine of information without feeling overwhelming. I greatly enjoyed the course. I enjoyed how the sections where clearly laid out making them easy to follow.” – Kodili C\n★★★★★ \"I have been wanting to learn herbs for a long time but have always felt intimidated. This course was so awesome. It gave me courage and I learned more from her in this one class than I have from anyone else.” – Cindy B\nThere is a growing movement in herbalism. You can be a part of it.\n·     You will gain better health by knowing which plants to use and how to use them.\n·     You will be more self-reliant without the need for many pharmaceuticals.\n·     You will take a central role in your wellbeing as well as those you love.\n·     You will never find better quality herbal medicine than what you make yourself.\nBy the end of the course you will feel confident in using plant medicines. You will not only understand which plants to use, but why they work in the way they do. With step-by-step instruction, there are no worries about being overwhelmed. You will also be able to refer back to the course material any time you like.\nYour instructor, Elizabeth Heck has 25 years of experience in working with plant medicines. She is by far, Udemy’s most qualified herbal instructor. Rest assured, you’re in good hands. With an extensive teaching background, she knows how to guide you through your herbal learning journey with ease. Even better, she is there for you throughout the course to answer any of your questions. That’s incredible value!\nPlants provide some of our most valuable medicine\n·     Herbs are readily available to everyone, whether you grow, harvest or purchase them.\n·     Herbs can be helpful for specific diseases, prevention, energy and vitality.\n·     Herbs can support other forms of medicine and ways of healing.\n·     Herbal medicines are easy and inexpensive to make as well as easy to use.\n·     Herbs are very effective and safe with good instruction.\nPlants have been successfully used as medicine throughout history. Currently, the World Health Organization states that more than 80% of people on earth use herbs as their primary form of medicine.\nDiscover this important mode of healing and learn how you can incorporate herbs into your life for optimum health.\nHere is what you’ll get from the course:\n·     Practical understanding of what herbalism is and how it works.\n·     Know how to make tinctures, teas, oils, salves, honeys, syrups, compresses and poultices.\n·     Details of over 20 of the most commonly used medicinal herbs.\n·     A necessary foundation if you decide to move forward with an herbal career.\nWhy is this course not Accredited?\nNearly every online course (unless it is a large university) that claims to be accredited, actually is not. These are simply fake accreditations from real-looking websites used as a marketing scam in order to sell more courses. Elizabeth, as with any experienced herbalist, teaches with ethics and integrity and absolutely will not be deceitful for marketing sake. Rather, her students are sincerely respected and honored. Therefore none of her courses claim to be accredited.\nMore of what students have to say:\n★★★★★ “I have always enjoyed making home remedies and seeing the effects of them on my family, and now that I’ve learned the different medicinal purposes for a few herbs and treatments here and how to use them in their proper context I can move on to helping my family feel and live better even the more. Thank you for the opportunity to learn with you Mrs Heck I enjoyed every moment of the class and felt like I was sitting in your kitchen and walking through your garden with you. For me that would be a sheer delight. Kindest regards” – Jaazer\n★★★★★ \"I found Elizabeth Heck to be very engaging and informative with this course. As someone who has experimented with herbal remedies, I felt that I have learned even more through her instruction. With her step-by-step demonstration on how to create different tinctures, oils, salves, etc. I have found it to be an improvement rather than stumbling around my kitchen trying to figure it out myself. I highly recommend her course and am looking forward to enrolling in more taught by Elizabeth Heck.” – Jodi C\n★★★★★ \"I loved this course. It really validated the interest I have in herbalism. After completing this course, I am now more than ever interested in becoming a herbalist. Thank you for this course.” – Anna S\nYou have lifetime access to the course so you can take as long or short as you wish to go through the material.

      "description": "This Is the Best Behavior Change Strategy In the World\nThe original Mini Habits book is in 17 languages worldwide. Its used by psychologists, doctors, and teachers and has improved the habits of thousands. Why? The strategy works. And now it's found the perfect application—weight loss.\nYou will never diet again.\nWeight Loss for Life With Mini Habits is not a new diet, it's a habit-driven solution for weight loss. If you can build healthier eating and movement habits, you will naturally lose weight. It's not only more effective than dieting, it's easier and more enjoyable!\nDid you know that dieting has been shown in long-term studies to cause weight gain, even over doing nothing? In a nutshell, dieting causes weight gain in the long run because it's unsustainable (for you, your body, and your brain) and triggers countermeasures. Mini habits are sustainable and gentle changes, so they don't have that unfortunate outcome.\nYou can build an ironclad habitual foundation to support a healthier lifestyle and weight for years to come.\nMini habits play by the rules of your brain and body. They slip under the radar of your change-averse mind, and don't trigger the metabolic countermeasures that extreme strategies like calorie restriction do. Not only that, but mini habits are fun, weightless, and shame-free behaviors that you can integrate into your busy life. We won't ask you to overhaul your life overnight, because that's an impossible (and very ineffective) strategy.\nPresentation Style: Awesome\nWhoa now... what's that? You thought this was going to be a talking head for 6 hours? Ha!\nOur previous course, Mini Habit Mastery, has over 14,000 students and is well known for being one of the most entertaining and useful courses on Udemy. We've taken it up three notches for this course, with better equipment, more content, higher quality editing, and enlisting professional voice actor Troy W. Hudson to help us out.\nWe don’t believe a boring course helps anyone to learn, so we are going to keep you engaged while delivering the most effective weight loss solution you’ve ever seen.\nWe have TEN different presentation styles: talks, demonstrations, skits, animated illustrations, comics, Coffee Break Wrap Ups to recap every module’s critical lessons, studies brought to life, discussion videos, the most entertaining slides you’ve ever seen, and of course, spoofmercials.\nPeople ask me why this course took 2 years to make, when a lot of other video courses are made in 2 weeks. The answer is creativity and quality. You'll see a marked difference between this and every other course on Udemy. We care about you and your experience, and want this course to be useful, relevant, and reviewable for you for decades. We want this to be the last weight loss course you take.\nScience: It's There, But Not Sleep-Inducing\nThere's quite a bit of science in this course, but you should know by now that we're not going to bore you too much with it. Nevertheless, it's important to know that this information isn't just my opinion. I analyzed hundreds of studies and paid extra attention to longer-term studies, which show real results. Any short-term study can show successful weight loss, but those don't consider how your body will respond over time.\nWeight Loss and Mini Habits: A Perfect Match\nI was fascinated to find that the body reacts to dieting just as the brain reacts to extreme behavior change—it tries to stop it. Mini habits are special because they won't trigger this neurological or biological resistance. Mini habits are the smartest way to lose weight for real.\nThis course is a wild, 6-hour ride that you'll never forget. We can't wait to see you inside!\nCheers,\nStephen Guise (with Co-Instructor Laura Avnaim)",

The major difference is that you will not be wrecking your thumb joints by having to do thumb walking as the technique. As you will learn in this course, thumb walking and finger walking are completely unnecessary in order to stimulate the reflexology areas of the foot. The foot massage that you will give to yourself or someone else will be both a joy to do and to receive."

Elizabeth Heck is a fabulous teacher who makes learning the business side of herbal medicine fun. Her presentation is well-researched, concise, organized and practical. While I have studied herbalism for a few years now, it seems that anyone with an interest could jump right in and get just as much out of this presentation.

I am inspired!\" – Amy B\nThe need for herbalists has been increasing steadily over the past 40 years. Recently the field of herbalism is growing by leaps and bounds. Today herbalists are very much in high demand.\nThere are more ways to be an herbalist then you can imagine, whether your passion is plants or people. Herbalists are the vital bridge between the two. This is truly meaningful work.\nThis course dives deep into a wide variety of opportunities including:\nWorking with clients\nHerbal products entrepreneurship\nMedicinal plant farming\nHarvesting plants from the wild\nTeaching\nWriting\nand more\nChoose whatever career opportunity suits you.

Therefore none of her courses claim to be accredited.\nMore of What Students Have to Say:\n★★★★★ \"Thank you so much for the given information.

      "description": "**UPDATED OCTOBER 2017** Called \"the most informative and practical course on SLEEP on Udemy\"\nDo you wish you had BOUNDLESS ENERGY?\nDo you wish you had more time to be productive and do the things you love?\nAre you curious about those people who seem to operate on far less sleep, but are still somehow able to be incredibly productive?????\nUmmmm yeah..\nThen join more than 8000+ people who've taken this course and gotten hours more waking time each week, while having more energy each day.\nThe Magical Tale of This Class (and my sleep hacking adventure)\nI used to spend an average of 7.5-8 hours a night sleeping....\nEven though by medical standards this was classified as a sufficient amount, I still found myself tired at times (ARGHH). I was frustrated which is why I started to study and experiment with sleep.\nThrough countless self-experimentations and optimizations over the past year, I've cut down my sleep time down to about 6 hours of sleep and have never had more energy. If you compound this difference over the course of a year, that's more than 4 weeks of additional waking time THAT I GET TO SPEND DOING THINGS I LOVE.\nDoes 4 additional weeks this year sound interesting to you? How would you spend them?\nI wanted to save everyone interested in having more time and energy the countless hours and mistakes I made so I decided to create a brief presentation on it to share with friends. Turns out some really interesting people thought it was pretty good:\n\"Good overview for my friends who have sleep difficulty\" -Reid Hoffman, Founder of LinkedIn\n\"Some novel ideas here, on getting a better night's sleep\" -Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn\nDon't believe me? See proof here!\nThe funny thing was I had only scratched the surface of what I'd learned in that presentation. So I decided to do a small private class to test out amongst some people who'd indicated interest. This is what they said:\n\"Over the course of the seven days, my sleep improved from four to five hours of actual sleep time during my eight and half hours in bed, to just over seven hours asleep! Scott, thank you, thank you, thank you for presenting this information in a succinct, informative matter\" - Dana M\n\"Scott provides a clear and applicable path towards a better sleep cycle. My habits have drastically changed\" -Sean C\n\"Good class to take if you are having trouble regulating your sleep. I feel more energy and less anxious since I am better rested and prepared for a long day. I didn't realize sleep could have such an affect. Scott s lessons are quick and easy to follow. All information is practical. Your body will thank you for it.\" -Aishwarya N\nI took the information and feedback from this class and expanded upon it to deliver the ultimate premium class here....\nIn this course you'll learn:\nHow to achieve a quality sleep so you can actually feel rested\nA bunch of simple (and weird!) stuff you can do with light to have higher energy and better sleep\nHow alter your activeness, consumption, environment to achieve quality sleep\nThe best ways to fall asleep, nap, and prevent yourself from waking up 6x a night (THE WORST)\nA blueprint to take action on everything I'll teach you so that you'll be sleep-hacking in no time!\nThe class is delivered in easy to follow video modules, and also includes PDF versions so you can go at your own speed if you prefer.\nNo matter who you are, I guarantee you'll learn at least one thing from this class (see the testimonials above for proof). Note* if you're a chronic insomniac you should seek some professional guidance instead of going to Udemy. Also, if you've been studying polyphasic sleep for centuries, you'll probably know a lot of this - managing expectations here peeps!\nI will personally respond to any questions you may have as you go through the material so there's no worry if you're not sure how to take all of the information and apply it to your life. So sign up now!\nTalk soon,\nScott Britton\nP.S. The $49 price is an initial offering to build the students and positive reviews.\nI believe getting days of your life back is worth far more than 3 DVDs so I plan on raising the price in the near future. If you want to take advantage of the initial price, I'd sign up sooner than later (Like now!)",

      "description": "RECEIVE AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED QUALIFICATION IN 'ACUPRESSURE THERAPY' UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS COURSE!\n*Internationally Recognised Qualification*\nAcupressure Facelift – This Acupressure treatment is performed by applying pressure with the fingertips into key areas of the face and neck.  This helps to stimulate blood flow and collagen production, while also balancing the whole body.  This results in firmer face muscles supporting the skin layer above in order to produce tighter facial tone and a more youthful appearance.\nStudies focused on this particular technique have shown significant and lasting benefit.  In one particular study of 300 cases 90% of those treated had marked beneficial results with only one course of treatment.\nFine lines may be entirely eliminated and deeper wrinkles diminished.  Bags under the eyes can be reduced, puffiness eliminated, droopy eyelids lifted and double chins minimised. Other likely results include: moisturising of the skin with increased local circulation of blood and lymph to the face, increased collagen production, muscle tone, tightening of the pores, brightening of the eyes, improvement of hormonal balance that can help treat acne and reduction of stress which can often be evident in the face.\nA course of treatment generally consists of 12 treatments administered once weekly.  A course of treatment holds its benefits for 2 to 5 years.  However, regular “top-up” treatments can be useful to extend effects and one-off treatments are often used by clients to achieve that bright, healthy glow for special occasions.\nAcupressure Facelift is a gentle non-invasive approach to looking younger.  Although ageing is a natural process, this therapy helps delay the visible signs of ageing and prevent further damage in the future by means of simple, natural and effective techniques.\nDuring the treatment, over ninety face and neck muscles are systematically worked. Acupressure points are activated, releasing deep-seated tension, freeing layers of muscle and connective tissue.  The technique used ensures that circulation is improved and the tissues can glide smoothly over the deeper layers of muscle and bone.\nTension can very easily build up in our facial muscles without us realising it.  Over a period of time, habitual thoughts and emotions can lock themselves into expressions on our faces – particularly around the eyes and mouth.  This can be exacerbated by additional factors such as excessive exposure to the sun, pollution, alcohol, smoking, poor diet, lack of sleep, the effects of gravity and every day stresses and strains.  Under such conditions muscles can actually “dry up” and contract, encouraging ageing and the formation of wrinkles as the face loses its muscle tone and elasticity and begins to sag.\nThe whole process has been described as a bit like ironing out the creases, making the skin feel smoother and softer and improving the complexion and skin tone.\n*This course is delivered via high quality video lectures and includes a face to face component via Skype/Zoom for assessment/exam purposes*\nSome common benefits you can expect from an Acupressure Treatment include:\nRelief from stress & tension\nA more relaxed body & mind\nIncreased blood circulation\nA faster removal of toxic waste\nAn increase in energy levels\nRelief from head, neck, shoulder & back ache and\nAn overall sense of well-being\nSo why not sign up today and see how quickly the positive effects of Acupressure can bring improvement to your life?",

Accupressure is exactly the same, except that pressure from the fingers, hands, elbows and even feet are used on the same pressure points.\nIn Chinese medicine, energy flows around the body are governed by, and can impact, various health issues and determine overall health. This practice can either unblock an energy path, or reduce energy flow if it is too much. Each meridian has a relationship to an organ in the body.\n#acupressure #beginners",

It is no secret that in these modern times, we have deviated slightly from a holistic perspective. What does that mean? That we have forgotten that we are all interconnected beings, not only with other humans, but with nature itself. What happens in nature, happens in us. We are the five elements. Learn what those five elements have to do with your health.\nThis topic and many more may be found in this course. Most people are looking for a way to lose weight and find their original weight; that is as a result of an imbalance. In this course you will also find a very thorough assessment so that you may better get to your perfect state of balance and discover in which area(s) you are out of balance.\nThis course is a comprehensive compilation of the most fundamental and basic topics of Ayurveda. Yet, don't be fooled that because it is a foundational course it is not powerful! The exact topics that you are about to learn are the ones that have kept me healthy for the past eight years without having to visit a doctor. I no longer suffer from any ailments that would blow up into a full manifestation of dis\"ease\".\nAyurveda is yoga's sister science, and they both act as an integrative system for healing, bringing awareness to your consciousness, and transformation to all levels of your existence. This is no small matter. The time has come to expand your horizons and explore what other methods of prevention have to offer. Invest in your most valuable commodity - your health.",

Madera is Spanish for wood.\nWood therapy or ‘Maderoterapia” is a body sculpting technique that employs sculpted wooden implements to improve the body’s size and proportions. It is a non-invasive treatment designed to mold the figure utilizing wood instruments designed anatomically to stimulate each body without causing lesions in their tissues.\nThis massage/technique is a superior alternative to a regular massage for patients with disproportionate, localized pockets of stubborn fat and cellulite.

      "description": "\"I loved this (aromatherapy acupressure)course. It was one of the best courses I have done on Udemy. Would recommend it to everybody!\"\nIn aromatherapy acupressure, you create a synergistic effect by selecting an aromatherapy essential oil that possesses the same function as the acupressure points to create an incredibly powerful healing technique that balances the body, mind and spirit.\nAromatherapy acupressure is a gentle, safe and profoundly effective treatment modality that combines the energetic healing qualities of aromatherapy essential oils with specific acupressure points in order to trigger energetic changes in the individual that will bring the person back to a state of emotional balance.\nMark is a Fully Certified Aromatherapist in Aromatherapy and an essential oil specialist, approved by The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA), and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists (AIA) – both leading governing bodies for educational standards for Aromatherapists.\nUsing aromatherapy acupressure results  in more significant clinical effects than using either aromatherapy or acupressure by themselves!\nThis course is designed so that you can use aromatherapy acupressure on yourself or on your family, partner or your clients.\nFor example, if you are suffering from anxiety, are worried, frustrated or stressed you will learn how to apply particular aromatherapy essential oils that are well known for their potent calming effects (such as Roman Chamomile or Lavender) to specific acupressure points such as CV-17, Yintang, or heart 7 acupressure points that have been used for thousands of years in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat these exact emotional imbalances.\n\n\n\"As an Aromatherapist I am always looking for other ways and areas to apply my knowledge to help people. This course does just that. Excellent in every way.\" 5 STARS\n\n\nLikewise, if you are fatigued, exhausted or would just like to have more energy, be more focused and increase your memory then you will also learn how to apply aromatherapy essential oils such as Rosemary that studies have shown to not only stimulate the body and mind but also increase people's memory by 65% and the apply that aromatherapy essential oil to acupressure points that are well known to energize the body, mind and spirit.\nYou can apply all of these aromatherapy acupressure skills to yourself, your family or your clients. If you are a therapist, this is a fabulous technique to add to your repertoire of treatment techniques to assist your client on a much deeper level. The aromatherapy acupressure treatments can be used as a stand alone treatment or as a beautiful way to help your clients with their emotional wellbeing.\n\n\n\"Aroma-acupressure had a greater effect than aromatherapy on agitation in patients with dementia.\"\n\"..aroma-acupressure was better able to improve agitation, inhibit the sympathetic nervous system, and activate the parasympathetic nervous system compared with aromatherapy\"\n(Study involving 186 patients of the comparison of the efficacy of aromatherapy acupressure compared to just aromatherapy  for the treatment of dementia-associated agitation)\nStart learning how to do aromatherapy acupressure today. It is simple, safe and incredibly effective!",

Do you have basil, oregano, cinnamon, thyme or garlic in your kitchen?\nIf so, you already have valuable and important medicine. If not, you can easily purchase them from any grocery store. These are just a few of the many herbs and spices covered in this course. We will talk about:\nWhat health conditions they are used for\nThe best ways to use them for effectiveness, ease and flavor\nHow they help keep you healthy in the first place\nHere’s what students have to say:\n★★★★★ \"WOW! I had no idea how powerful kitchen herbs and spices are and how well she explained everything. I am really thankful for the recipes. Very encouraging.” – Sam D\n★★★★★ \"Great introduction to herbalism as it applies to what most all of us have in our kitchen at any given time. Elizabeth Heck knows herbalism well and is engaging in her presentations. I have applied several of the suggestions and \"recipes\" for my personal use and have found the \"medicine\" invaluable this past cold & flu season! Highly recommend this course to any interested in improving your health naturally.” – Joanna H\n★★★★★ \"A lot of fun especially for a beginner with not much culinary background. Loved this segment especially the pickled garlic in Tamari. Delicious! Can't wait to try your chai.” – Penny C\n★★★★★ \"I absolutely love the short bursts of information that is so refreshing! The content, so far, is exactly what I was hoping for.” – A'Jay S\nCultures throughout history have effectively treated illnesses and injuries at home with herbs and spices.\nWe often think that spices and herbs are included in recipes for flavor, but actually many of them were initially incorporated into the food we eat for their medicinal and health giving qualities. Here are just a few examples of what you will learn:\nBlack pepper for colds, flu, digestion, memory and arthritis\nCinnamon for decongestion, immunity boost, antibacterial, blood sugar stabilization\nMint for nutrition, brain function, relaxation, digestion and nausea\nBasil for headaches, stress, insomnia, topical antibacterial and antioxidant properties\nGinger for joint health, colds, PMS and nausea\nMany more...\nUsing Herbs and spices as medicine is no more difficult than making an easy recipe or even simply steeping a cup of tea. For your own health and healing, you should use them often.\nYour instructor, Elizabeth Heck has 25 years of experience in working with plant medicines. She is by far, Udemy’s most qualified herbal instructor. Rest assured, you’re in good hands. With an extensive teaching background, she knows how to guide you through your herbal learning journey with ease. Even better, she is there for you throughout the course to answer any of your questions. That’s incredible value!\nWhy is this course not Accredited?\nNearly every online course (unless it is a large university) that claims to be accredited, actually is not. These are simply fake accreditations from real-looking websites used as a marketing scam in order to sell more courses. Elizabeth, as with any experienced herbalist, teaches with ethics and integrity and absolutely will not be deceitful for marketing sake. Rather, her students are sincerely respected and honored. Therefore none of her courses claim to be accredited.\nMore of what students have to say:\n★★★★★ \"I am learning more than I thought I would. Thanks for the recipes. I really enjoyed this course.” – Marcia D\n★★★★★ \"It is giving me information beyond what I already know. Interesting, fast enough paced that I don't get bored, yet slow enough to remember and learn.” – Lisa S\n★★★★★ \"Really great course and I learnt a lot which I can personally use. My family will benefit greatly from what I have learnt. Thank you heaps.” – Tina G\nYou have lifetime access to the course so you can take as long or short as you wish to go through the material.

If you have never met me before my name is Louise Anne Maurice. The thousands and thousands of people I have either coached, trained, consulted or taught over the past 30+ years have benefited from my Empowered Coaching Approach. I want you to benefit as well!\nHere are just a few of the reviews people, just like you, have shared about their experience before, during and/or after learning in the Holistic Wellness Health Coaching Certification Course. You can also scroll past the Instructor Profiles to read more reviews.\n\n\n“I have been very pleasantly surprised by this course. I purchased it earlier in the year and forgot about it. Having some spare time and a lot of frustration has brought me to take action. This program is simple yet deep. We tend to overcomplicate things and take ourselves down the rabbit hole never getting to what is truly holding us back. This keeps us in that spiral of despair and anxiety, never creating the life we say we want. I am doing this program as a self evaluation but also as an action step toward creating another form of income. I have very much appreciated how Louise has brought in the energy and chakra concepts as well as the tapping or EFT technique, all of which I know to be important and effective. We do not live in a black and white world, at some point all humanity's discoveries will have to be combined to get to those bottom beliefs that are keeping us from living a life to our full potential and freeing ourselves from the bonds that we have subconsciously created and attracted to ourselves. This is a \"whole\"listic approach and I am very happy that I selected this course and have decided to take the action of putting myself through it before the end of the year. I am ready to build MY life beyond my wildest dreams. Thank you Louise!!”\n“This is a very interactive informative course. The course is designed to truly give you the information and tools you need to be a good, successful coach. I look forward to taking more of the courses offered.”\n“The content and flow of this course are so organic and wholesome. I am so impressed with the positive and loving message that is spoken from the first lecture until the last. I am so looking forward to implementing the ideas and methods from this course into my own daily practice as well as into my business as a life and wellness coach. Thank you so much! Lisa of Four Leaf Reiki”\n“Amazing course with fantastic content and delivery. Thank you very much.”\n“Loving this course, its content and instructor. Thank you”\n“I have been doing a ton of research over the past 2 years and this program is incorporating a lot of what I have learned in a very easy digestible, doable format. I really feel it working for me and I feel like it will be possible and helpful for clients in the future.”\n“I enjoyed this so much. I can feel the compassion you have. Something I have which keeps me in mental healthcare. The relaxing segments are wonderful. I have been using similar techniques in my groups. Thank you for a wonderful course!

      "description": "Tsuboki Face Massage was created by myself to fill a gap in the massage market. I based it on Traditional Japanese Face massage - once the preserve of empresses! - but combined this with techniques that I created or discovered during my 30-plus years of working as a massage therapist.\nThe routine begins with a deep neck massage, followed by a detailed face massage with oil. You then work all of the acupressure points on the face, before finishing with some simple lymphatic drainage and grounding.\nYou will learn the background to this wonderful therapy and how it came to be.  You will learn the basics of Traditional Chinese Medicine, so that you have some understanding about why this massage is so powerful and how it works on several levels You will learn when not to massage, or when to adapt the massage to your clients' needs. And you will be able to locate and work on over 40 acupressure points on the face, may of which have rejuvenating and health-giving properties. It is given with the client lying - preferably on a massage table - and with the therapist sitting.\nYou will be taken step by step through all of the techniques with clear, concise videos, which you can replay until you are confident.  These are accompanied by PDF files with teaching points and reminders for each technique.  Each part can be used by itself, but when you have the complete routine at your fingertips, you have a therapy that is relaxing yet energising, accessible and nurturing.\nI have been teaching this course in person since 2003; it was the first course I ever created, and had proved extremely popular with students and clients alike.The Udemy platform enables me to reach students via an excellent quality online version.\nFROM STUDENTS:\n\"Anne is fantastically inspiring! She obviously enjoys teaching and it is a pleasure to learn with her - thank you. A great deal of content delivered superbly. I did not have any 'brain fog' or sense of overload. \"\n\"I get a lot of clients that already said my facials were the best ever, and they would never go anywhere else.. so it's been such a delight to add this and get an even more favourable response.  The difference on the face before and after is very visible, and for me even more important is the mood and energy change. Thank you again Anne\"\nVivienne T, facialist\n\nFROM STUDENTS about CASE STUDIES:\n“Skin looked glowing.  Cheeks looked plumped up.  Looked in a state of bliss and kept repeating how good she felt.  I feel very excited about this treatment!”\n“Best face massage I’ve ever had.  I felt a tingling sensation all the way down my legs to my feet”\n“Forgot what it was like to truly relax – this did it!”\n\n\n\n\nYou will be given a certificate on completion of this course.  Because laws vary in different countries and states, it is your responsibility to determine whether you need more training in order to practice professionally.  If you are not a qualified therapist, I recommend you only work on healthy people.",

      "description": "Longevity medicine is a fast-evolving field and it is currently outpacing the ability of the medical practice to internalize and implement the progress of related research. Modern advances in AI and machine learning, biomarker research and drug development have produced numerous tools for early diagnostics and prevention, which remain unknown to the global medical community. The paradigm of longevity and healthy aging as the top priority will undoubtedly greatly impact the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention rates. The Longevity Medicine Course (LMC) is a pivotal curriculum that provides medical professionals with most recent advances in biogerontology, geroscience and precision medicine, while teaching the ways to implement this knowledge in the clinical practice. The curriculum has been developed by interdisciplinary experts (physicians, academic biogerontologists, AI-experts, computer scientists, KOL in longevity), covering the necessary foundation and most recent scientific evidence. Here, you can find the Introduction to Longevity Medicine – the first part of the LMC, equipping with core definitions, clinical applications of recent advances in aging research, skills to evaluate the validity of biomarkers of aging and other biological age testing systems and knowledge of the available longevity therapies to tackle aging and age-related diseases, which are mostly based on senescence-related processes in the organisms. At the same time, we explore areas of non-clinical medical applications, which are largely unknown by physicians.\n***IMPORTANT***\nWithin 48h successful completion of this course, the instructor will send a personalised message to your Udemy account and email address with details of how to access your exclusive certificate from the Deep Longevity Team.

Wellness encompasses five dimensions of health.\nIt's not enough to eat healthy & workout, but in order to be truly well, ones needs to take into account other dimensions of health like mental, emotional, spiritual and even social!\nYes, even one’s income, level of education and social support are equally important when compared with one’s diet and training!\nLet me discuss the benefits that will accrue to you once you graduate from this course:\n-You will receive a CPD certificate (different from what Udemy provides)\n-You will be able to use titles like Wellness Coach, Health Consultant, Health Advisor etc after receiving the certificate from me\n-You will learn about different dimensions of health not just limited to Physical.\nLet me tell you what I have in store for you in this course:\nModule 1: Starters Pack.\nLearn about CPD, the titles you can use, about me and start by downloading the complete Training Manual for this course.\nModule 2: Introduction to Health & Wellness\nLearn about the evolving definition of Health.\nUnderstand what Homeostasis means\nLearn about Holistic Health/Wellness\nModule 3: 5 Key Bio-Markers that you need to get tested on\nThese 5 numbers that I am going to discuss in this module will give anyone an overall excellent idea on how healthy an individual is as these numbers can have a huge impact positive or negative depending on whether they are in the optimal ranges or not!\nModule 4: Mental and Emotional Health\nMental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. In this module, I will start off by providing you a questionnaire/sign that will tell you are mentally healthy a person is. You will be required to rate yourself/client on the scale of [1-5] and check your progress over time.\nAlthough, mental health is something that gets a bit technical (like physical health) and requires a specialization. Fortunately, the ways to improve one's mental health is related to one's diet, workout and the way that person thinks, and therefore I have provided many ways in which you can help yourself or your client to improve their mental and emotional health.\nModule 5: Spiritual Health\nWe are spiritual beings having a humanly experience.\nWe all are born for a unique purpose which is very specific to us. And once we find it and start pursuing it to the best of our abilities only and only then we can be spiritually health. Spirituality is a broad concept with room for many perspectives. In general, it includes a sense of connection to something bigger than ourselves, and it typically involves a search for meaning in life.\nNot only I will discuss 6 Spiritual Laws that I diligently follow in my life, but will also provide you an elaborate spiritual questionnaire that will help you move from a lower frequency/vibration (or whatever vibration you are at) onto to a higher existence of living:)\nModule 6: Physical Health\nPhysical health is also an important aspects of staying healthy.
