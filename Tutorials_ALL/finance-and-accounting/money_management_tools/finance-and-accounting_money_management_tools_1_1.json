Reconciling the bank account provided a MUCH larger scene of assurance that our financial data and the financial reports are complete and correct.\nWe will demonstrate the bank reconciliation process for two months in QuickBooks. The first month of operations is often the most difficult to enter because we must deal with the begging balance. The second month and thereafter is generally much easier to reconcile using QuickBooks software but something that takes some time to fully understand conceptional.\nWe will also run the bank reconciliation process using Excel worksheets, which will provide a more conceptual view of how the process works and how the bank reconciliation report is generated from the process.\nWho will we be learning from?\nYou will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together a curriculum.\nYou will be learning from somebody who is a:\nCPA – Certified Public Accountant\nCGMA – Chartered Global Management Accountant\nMaster of Science in Taxation\nCPS – Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\nCurriculum Development Expo\nAs a CPS and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\nThe instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives. Experience designing technical courses has also helped in being able to design a course in a logical fashion and deal with problems related to technical topics and the use of software like QuickBooks Pro.\nHow will we be Taught?\nThrough viewing and then doing. We will demonstrate the reconciliation process in the software in such a way that it can be applied to practice. Because QuickBooks Online does not allow for static backup files at this time we cannot provide the exact data to follow along with, but we will include Excel worksheets that can be used to follow the same process.\nBy seeing the process performed in QuickBooks and Excel and working the process in an Excel worksheet we will understand both the procedure and the reasoning for the procedure.",

Nossas despesas variáveis acompanham nossas receitas? E nossas despesas fixas são coerentes? O que está \"fora da curva\"?\n- Tomar decisões e agir.\n\n\nE irá aprender fazendo!\n\n\nVocê receberá um Caderno de Trabalho com exercícios de fixação dos conceitos e questões-problema para serem resolvidas. Todos com gabarito com as respostas certas.\n\n\nAlém disso, você irá receber uma planiha em Excel totalmente funcional e operacional para ajudar na compreensão dos conceitos, das práticas e treinar o seu DRE.\n\n\nE mais: se quiser até pode utilizar esta planilha na sua empresa (talvez com pequenos ajustes) porque ela é funcional e operacional.\n\n\nEntão, vamos lá?\nNos vemos na primeira aula.

Como já dizia Jim Rohn: \"O seu nível de sucesso raramente excederá o seu nível de desenvolvimento pessoal, pois o sucesso é algo que você atrai pela pessoa em que você se torna.\"\n3º Segredo: Modelagem ==> você deseja ficar rico? Então copie a maneira de pensar e agir das pessoas ricas e bem sucedidas. Se você deseja ser um excelente carpinteiro então aprenda com o melhor carpinteiro que você conhece. Se você deseja ser um médico ortopedista aprenda com o melhor médico ortopedista que você conhece. Então, se você deseja prosperar financeiramente aprenda com as pessoas que já são prósperas financeiramente...\n4º Segredo: Acreditar ==> o primeiro passo para a riqueza é acreditar e ter a fé de que você possui a capacidade de ficar rico. Você realmente acredita que ficará rico? Aprenda a técnica do \"ser\" antes do \"ter\".\n5º Segredo: Agir ==> ninguém fica rico por meio de um saco de dinheiro que cai do céu. É necessário tirar a bunda da cadeira e entrar em ação. Você já criou o seu plano de ação financeiro para ficar rico? Como está o seu planejamento?\n6º Segredo: Investir em Ativos ==> você sabe o que são ativos? Você sabe o que são passivos? Você está comprando mais ativos ou passivos? As pessoas ricas e bem sucedidas compram mais ativos do que passivos...\n7º Segredo: Multiplicar seu Dinheiro ==> de nada adianta você poupar todos os meses e investir o seu dinheiro na poupança. As pessoas ricas e bem sucedidas investem seu dinheiro com inteligência. Você está fazendo investimentos com inteligência?\n8º Segredo: Investir na Bolsa de Valores ==> a cada 10 pessoas ricas e bem sucedidas 9 utilizaram a bolsa de valores como ferramenta para prosperar financeiramente. Você investe em ações ou fundos de investimentos imobiliários na Bolsa de Valores?\n9º Segredo: Ajudar muitas Pessoas ==> se você ajuda uma pessoa você receberá o equivalente a 1. Se você ajudar 1000 pessoas você receberá o equivalente a 1000. Quantas pessoas você está ajudando no seu trabalho ou negócio?\n10º Segredo: Amar o que Você faz ==> Você ama a sua profissão? Você ama o seu trabalho? Você ama o seu negócio? Quanto mais você amar o que você faz então você irá fazer mais bem feito e consequentemente irá ajudar um maior número de pessoas e... ganhará mais dinheiro...",

Material Ledger and COPA functionalities, in SAP S/4 HANA. They should be equipped with the knowledge and skills to configure, analyse, and optimize the Material Ledger in various business scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nThe Material Ledger functionality in SAP is used for various purposes, including tracking material movements, actual costing, and working in multi-currency environments. In S/4 HANA , Material Ledger becomes even more central as it becomes a mandatory feature for inventory valuation. Here's a comprehensive understanding of each point mentioned:\nMaterial Ledger Configuration with Multiple Currencies:\nMaterial Ledger allows you to manage up to three currencies: Company Code currency, Group currency, and a third (hard) currency.\nConfiguration starts with activating the Material Ledger for specific valuation areas.\nDefine and assign currency types for each valuation area. Currency types could be legal, group, or hard currency.\nSet the update types for parallel valuation in Material Ledger, specifying how the values will be updated in each currency.\nMM Cycle Flow to Material Ledger:\nMaterial movements from MM (like GR, GI, transfer postings) have financial implications.\nWhen goods are received, their value is posted in all the currencies configured in Material Ledger.\nPrice differences arising from purchase price variances, for example, will also be reflected across the multiple currencies.\nProduction Cycle Flow to Material Ledger:\nThe production cycle includes raw material consumption, labor, and overhead costs.\nAs production orders or process orders are executed, the costs are captured in Material Ledger in multiple currencies.\nThis ensures that the inventory value of finished or semi-finished goods is accurately portrayed in all currencies.\nSales Cycle Flow to Material Ledger:\nUpon the sale of goods, there's a reduction in inventory value.\nMaterial Ledger reflects this change, adjusting the value of inventory in all configured currencies.\nTransfer Posting Cycle Flow to Material Ledger:\nTransfer postings, like stock transfers between plants or storage locations, involve changing valuation or ownership of stock.\nMaterial Ledger captures these changes, ensuring accurate valuation in all currencies.\nCOPC - Month End Closing:\nThe period-end process in Controlling (COPC) involves activities like assessment, distribution, etc.\nThese postings impact costs and, hence, the Material Ledger. It's important to ensure that these activities are properly reflected in the Material Ledger for an accurate valuation.\nCKMLCP - Actual Costing Execution:\nCKMLCP is a central step in Material Ledger’s actual costing run.\nIt determines the actual costs of materials for the period, considering all receipts and issues of the material.\nOnce the actual cost is determined, it can be compared with the standard cost to find variances.\nThis actual cost, then, becomes the starting point for the next period.\nWork in Process functionalities in Material Ledger:\nIf a product is not fully manufactured by the end of a period, its cost is determined as Work in Process (WIP).\nIn Material Ledger, this WIP is valued in multiple currencies, ensuring a consistent valuation across all reporting perspectives.\nCKMCCC - Manual Change of Actual Cost Component Splits:\nSometimes, it's necessary to adjust the breakdown of actual costs manually.\nCKMCCC allows users to manually adjust the cost component split of actual costs in the Material Ledger.\nThis could be due to reasons like adjustments for extraordinary items or corrections.\nThis overview provides a foundational understanding of Material Ledger with multiple currencies in S/4 HANA 1909. However, the real depth and intricacies come out during hands-on configuration and daily operations in the system.",

You HAVE to use circular logic in non-recourse debt and project finance modeling .\n\nWHY? Because it affects one of the single most important questions you and your work are being used to answer: HOW MUCH DEBT CAN A PROJECT RAISE???\n\nSo let me ask you....\n\nWhat would it be worth to you, to be able to do those tasks 5x faster...???\nLet's be clear... that means a 30 minute model run finishes in 6 minutes!\n\nWhat if I told you, you could calculate 10x faster...???\nYour 30 minute calculations complete in just 3 minutes!!!\n\nFor those of you using long-life models time and time again, these timesavings will be HUGE.\nThey will radically redefine the amount of time consumed by your work!\n\nThis course will cover industry-standard best-practice approaches\nThey are the same ones taught by top course providers like Mazars/Corality and EY...\nBut *this* course also adds the extra details that will help you use these techniques in the most efficient way possible!\n\nThis course will teach you mathematical secrets which will allow you to Solve circular models for any input!\nYes! You WILL be able to use this solution even in a models which have copypaste macros in them!\nYou will learn a method which is faster and more robust than running your model through endless copypaste-goalseek loops!\nBest of all, this method lets you keep a SIMPLE copy-paste macro at the heart of your model!\n\nThis course will go beyond best practice - if you can handle it!\nYou will learn advanced methods that go far beyond what they have time to teach you in standard courses.\nThis could be a real challenge but if you succeed, your models will:\nCalculate 10x faster or more\nNot need manually macro triggers\nYour models will work like a normal Excel file without circularity breaks\nYou will be able to use Excel's Goalseek to backsolve again\nYou will also be coached to use this knowledge responsibly with professional awareness\nYou'll learn how to understand and assess the tradeoffs that come with choosing between standard and advanced solutions so you can apply the one that is best suited to your current project.\n\nObviously, this is a highly specialised course, but if you model non-recourse debt or project finance deals, circular problems are probably the bane of your life...\n\nYelling \"I'M MAD AS HELL\" won't help you... but taking this course WILL!",

This is integral for controlling and for assessing profitability. Material Ledger enables actual costing and supports multiple valuations in parallel.\nProduct Costing Techniques:\nProduct costing by order (Make to Stock): Costs are determined based on manufacturing orders. It's suitable for non-repetitive production.\nProduct costing by Sales order (Make to Order): Costing is done for specific sales orders. Typically used for customized products.\nProduct costing with Sales order controlling vaulted stock with sale order controlling: When both anticipated stock and actual sales order-driven stock exist.\nProduct costing with sales order controlling non-vaulted stock with sale order controlling: For products produced directly against sales orders without anticipation.\nProduct costing by period: Periodic costing for products irrespective of orders.\nRepetitive manufacturing without reporting points consideration: Costs for products that are manufactured repetitively and without specific checkpoints.\nRepetitive manufacturing with reporting points (work in process) consideration: Costs are captured at different stages or checkpoints of the production process.\nJoint Production Process: Multiple main products are derived from one production order.\nCO-Product costing process and By Product Costing Process: Co-products are main products with similar value, whereas by-products have minor value compared to the main product.\nMixed Costing process- Split Valuation: When a material can be procured/manufactured in more than one way.\nSub-Contracting, External Operations Product costing process: Costs when a part of the manufacturing process is subcontracted to external suppliers.\nCross plants –Special Procurement product costing: Costs are determined when procuring from a different plant within the same company.\nAdditives cost estimation: The costs of additive materials in the manufacturing process.\nSAP CO S/4 HANA 2022 & 2023 -Material Ledger\nMultiple Currencies:\nCompany Code Currency: Primary currency for a company code.\nGroup Currency: Consolidation currency.\nGlobal company Currency: Company currency\nMultiple Valuations:\nLegal Valuation: As per local regulations.\nGroup Valuation: Consolidated valuation.\nProfit Center Valuation: Based on profit center reporting needs.\nTransfer pricing:\nInter Company: Pricing between different company codes.\nIntra Company: Pricing within the same company code.\nMaterial Ledger- Actual Costing Execution and CKM3: The CKM3 transaction provides a detailed material price analysis showing the evolution of material prices.\nCKMLCPAVR: Cumulative Actual Costing :\nThis overview provides a detailed but condensed understanding of the topics related to SAP CO: S/4 HANA 2022 in the context of Product Costing and Material Ledger.

Grants the ability to make informed decisions about how to allocate income, save for the future, and manage expenses.\nExpanding knowledge about paycheck details, including tax withholding, ensures that individuals comply with tax laws and regulations. It helps accurately fill out tax forms and minimize the risk of underpaying or overpaying taxes.\nSurveys and studies conducted by organizations like the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have shown that a significant portion of the population lacks basic financial knowledge. This lack of knowledge can extend to understanding paycheck in detail.\nAt the end of this lesson the student will be able to:\nCorrectly fill out Form W-4.\nRecognize the types of benefits provided by employers.\nMake distinctions between required and optional deductions.\nCompute net pay using payroll deductions and tax tables.\nDifferentiate electronic payment methods, like direct deposit and paycards.\nThis course is designed specifically for you, providing a friendly and easy-to-follow exploration of paychecks.

It is a complete step by step guide and I offer full support as well so if you get stuck on anything I am an email away.\nHaving your own cash flow and being able to visually see what your outgoings are each month can be life changing and it is also a great tool to see where you are \"unconsciously spending\" so you might find that you can start making savings now without anything else changing! I have also included some money saving tips that can help you to save money on your bills starting now.\nAll you will need is your last 3 months of bank/credit card statements, Excel (or if you do not have Excel I have included instructions on how to use Google docs and it's free!) and some time to go through the course and create your cash flow. Once it's set up I would recommend checking in with it each month to enter that months expenses and to check in to see if you're on track with your forecast.\nThis course is for people that are at a beginner level in Excel and want a cash flow that they can use to manage their spending, pay off their debt and start making savings.\nIt is a step by step guide on how to create your first excel cash flow that you can then use to manage your spending, start making savings and if you are in debt it can be used to clear your debt.  You will also enter your last 3 months of income and expenditure so that you can then create your \"forecast\" for the next 12 months so that you can use it to monitor if you're on target each month.\nThis course is for beginners, if you already have a good understanding of excel and already have your own cash flow this course is not for you.",

If you are looking at it, then congratulations to you that you are not only thinking about educating yourself but also taking significant step at looking at this course. As you will see in this course, the whole exercise is not difficult but just requires a little patience and time :)\n\n\nThis course is for you if have ever asked the following question - Are my current assets, liabilities, earnings, savings, expenses, goals set me up for a comfortable retirement? To use this course, you must be comfortable with using excel and use of basic math functions such as sum, average, divide, and power etc.\n\n\nThis course does not talk about where to invest your money, or how to build secondary sources of income and things like that. It just uses basic math to tell you where your current path of investments is taking you in the future.\n\n\nThis course does not focus on theory but on practical numbers and without wasting any time on small talk we will dive straight into the business of deriving those number through a concept called 'The Art of Modelling with Spread Sheets'. You will need to be comfortable with basic elementary Math & Excel to go through this course. It is just about patience to work through basic math calculations to derive the numbers based on which you will know your current path and you will be able to predict the future. It is an attempt to answer the question will I have enough to retire comfortably? Numbers are hard cold reality, and they do not lie.  Once you have that realization, then you can decide if any changes are required to your current road map to retirement.\n\n\nThis course aims to allow you to build your own tool as per your unique needs instead on relying on many such calculators available in the market which are hard to customize. Which you realize after putting in lots of hours that they either do not meet your requirements or are not producing the results you desire.\n\n\nRetirement is often viewed as the end of work, but it can also be a new beginning where work becomes a hobby rather than a necessity. This course, **\"Retirement Made Easy: From Dreams to Reality,\"** is designed to help you assess whether you are on the right path to achieving your retirement goals.\n\n\nThroughout this course, we will explore essential aspects of retirement planning, focusing on your current assets, future savings, and personal aspirations—such as vacations and home ownership. You will learn how to evaluate your financial situation by considering key parameters like return on investments, inflation rates, and tax implications.\n\n\nOur goal is not to discuss post-retirement work or alternative income streams; instead, we aim to provide you with a clear understanding of your financial readiness for retirement. By the end of the course, you will have the tools and knowledge necessary to make informed decisions about your financial future and ensure that your retirement dreams become a reality.\n\n\nJoin me on this journey to financial freedom and discover how to create a fulfilling retirement lifestyle that aligns with your personal goals and aspirations!",

      "description": "QuickBooks pro desktop bookkeeping business designed for small business clients or small businesses who want a simple cash basis format for entering data.\nThis course is designed for bookkeepers and is also useful for small business owners who want a simple system for entering financial data into QuickBooks for financial planning and year-end tax preparation.\nThe bookkeeping system we discuss will also describe the relationship between the bookkeeper, the business, and the year-end tax and financial statement preparers.\nWe will outline a cash basis bookkeeping system using QuickBooks, a system that will enter most transactions directly into the check register.\nThe course will discuss the responsibilities of a bookkeeper and the responsibilities of the business when a bookkeeping engagement in entered into.\nWe will work through a sample bookkeeping project in QuickBooks including the setting up of a new QuickBooks company file.\nThe course will practice entering data into the QuickBooks register directly from a bank statement. We will provide practice bank statements to use with the project as well as step by step instructional videos.\nAs we enter data directly into the check register from the bank statement, we will compare and contrast the cash basis system we are using to a full accounting cycle system. We will also review the financial statements periodically to see how QuickBooks is using the data to make reports.\nAfter entering data into the QuickBooks check register from the bank statement, we will perform bank reconciliations. As we perform bank reconciliations, we will discuss what a bank reconciliation is and the benefits a bank reconciliation provides.\nThe course will then discuss options for entering specific accounting data into QuickBooks including payroll, equipment, loan payments, insurance, credit card payments, and invoices. We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs.\nAs we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered.\nThis course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation.\nWe will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks.\nThe course will then compare and contrast our different bookkeeping methods and show how those different bookkeeping decisions reconcile to the same numbers after the adjusting entry process.\nFinally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so.\nIn addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\n•    QuickBooks Backup files\n•    Excel practice files\n•    Downloadable PDF Files\nThe QuickBooks backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose.\nExcel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.\nWho will we be learning from?\nYou will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\nYou will be learning from somebody who is a:\n•    CPA – Certified Public Accountant\n•    CGMA – Chartered Global Management Accountant\n•    Master of Science in Taxation\n•    CPS – Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\n•    Curriculum Development Export\nAs a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\nAs a CPA and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\nThe instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives. Experience designing technical courses has also benefit in being able to design a course in a logical fashion and deal with problems related to technical topics and the use of software like QuickBooks Desktop.",

      "description": "The topic of Mixed Costing, especially in the context of SAP, is a profound one. Here's an in-depth exploration:\nPurpose of Mixed Costing: Mixed costing allows companies to value a material using multiple alternative methods. This becomes crucial when sourcing raw materials or semi-finished goods from multiple vendors or produced using different manufacturing processes, ensuring an accurate representation of costs.\nRaw/Pack Materials: Purchasing Without Split Valuation: In this scenario, the system averages the prices from multiple vendors. This simplifies valuations, but may not always reflect the most accurate cost, especially if one vendor's price significantly deviates from the others.\nRaw/Pack Materials: Purchasing With Split Valuation (MM Point of View): Split valuation allows different stock quantities of a material to be managed separately based on different criteria (like vendor, region, etc.). In an MM context, this means each stock type can have its own valuation, ensuring accurate tracking of costs for the same material from different sources.\nSemi Finished Materials: Mixed Costing with Split Valuation: For semi-finished goods that can be either purchased or manufactured, costs can vary. Mixed costing, combined with split valuation, enables accurate tracking of these variances, ensuring products' cost reflects its actual production or procurement cost.\nFinished Materials: Mixed Costing with Split Valuation: For finished goods produced on different lines or plants, the manufacturing costs can vary. Split valuation captures these differences, and when combined with mixed costing, offers an accurate valuation for such finished goods.\nCreating Split Valuation: In SAP, this is achieved by defining valuation categories (like 'V' for Vendor) and then defining valuation types for each category. These types represent different stock categories for the same material (e.g., stock from Vendor A vs. Vendor B).\nPurpose of Separate \"Valuation Class\" for Each Valuation Type: Each valuation type can be linked to a different valuation class, enabling differentiation in G/L postings. It provides granular control over financial postings based on the source or type of material.\nPurpose of Separate GL accounts for Each Valuation Type: This ensures financial transparency. Different stocks, even of the same material, might have different financial implications. By posting to separate G/L accounts, companies can track, analyze, and report on these differences.\nOBYC Settings (FI-MM Integration): In the OBYC settings, automatic account determination is configured. This ensures that during material movements, relevant financial postings are made to the correct GL accounts, based on transaction type and valuation class.\nCost Component Structure Explanation for Split Valuation: The cost component structure breaks down the cost of a product into its individual components (like raw materials, labor, overhead). With split valuation, this structure can further differentiate costs based on valuation types, offering detailed insight into cost makeup.\nMaster Data for Mixed Cost Estimate - CK91N: Here, you define procurement alternatives for a material. This informs the system of different methods (like purchase or produce) available for procuring a material, essential for mixed costing.\nMixing Ratios - CK94: In this step, you define the proportion in which different procurement types or methods are mixed. It's a crucial step in mixed costing.\nComplete Product Costing Flow with Mixed Costing:\nMaterial Creation with Mixed Costing: Begin by defining the material with relevant procurement alternatives and mixing ratios.\nProduction Planning: Plan production considering the different procurement methods and their associated costs.\nProduction Execution: Actual production costs are captured, considering split valuation.\nProduction Order Settlement: Finally, the costs accumulated on the production order are settled to the relevant cost objects, like material ledgers or cost centers.",

I tried a handful of online budgeting tools, smartphone apps, and even considered paying for a professional service. But somehow, none of these avenues seemed to qualify for what I was in seek of.\nI’d start off enthusiastic on keeping good habits, only to find myself forgetting about the app after a couple weeks, being bombarded with ads and over-the-top notifications on every little movement in my account or billing schedule, and/or it requiring just as much effort on my end as if I were to just build a financial ledger myself.\nSo, I decided to do just that and build one my own way. And \"lo and behold\", I discovered that the easiest tool to keep up with, customize to my liking, encourage me to stay engaged in with my financial well accounts, and most importantly share with others is actually a plain old spreadsheet with a few simple, yet powerful formulas.\nI also discovered that by combining my homegrown spreadsheet with a basic cadence of regular check-ins, and a few additional resources, that I had built an incredibly solid foundation for truly understanding my financial situation.\nBeing able to see your entire financial world in one place helps you see the big picture. And from there, strategies start to come to life along with a deep sense of organization and confidence moving forward.\nAnd now I’m sharing this spreadsheet, and the overall process with you!\n\n\nDetails\nIncludes FREE access to an un-locked Personal Finance Spreadsheet from Google Sheets so that you can save on your own Google Drive\nThe Google Sheet will come pre-populated with the same fictitious data presented in this Udemy tutorial course\nThis course is for the purpose of learning how to self-manage your finances, and keep it as simple as possible\nThis course is not for the purpose building a complex budgeting tool that looks to allocate every penny you spend",

      "description": "Money is not just math. It’s psychology.\nWelcome to The Psychology of Money: Mastering Wealth, Habits, and Financial Freedom. This course is based on Morgan Housel’s timeless insights into money psychology and behavioral finance, designed to help you rethink wealth, savings, risk, and happiness from the inside out.\nMost financial education focuses on numbers, charts, and technical strategies. But here’s the truth: people don’t make money decisions on spreadsheets. They make them around the dinner table, in moments of fear, or under the weight of comparison. That’s why this course goes beyond formulas—it dives deep into the psychology of money.\nYou’ll learn why wealth is what you don’t see—not the car in the driveway, but the money you didn’t spend. You’ll discover how luck and risk shape financial outcomes, why “enough” is the most powerful financial word, and how compounding quietly creates extraordinary results over time.\nWe’ll explore stories like Bill Gates and Kent Evans, Rajat Gupta and Bernie Madoff, Warren Buffett and Ronald Read—real-world examples that prove financial success has less to do with intelligence and more to do with behavior. You’ll uncover why saving money is more powerful than chasing high returns, why freedom of time is the ultimate dividend of wealth, and why pessimism always sounds smarter than optimism in the media.\nThrough this course, you’ll not only learn about behavioral finance but also develop your own financial philosophy—a set of personal money rules grounded in your values, goals, and lifestyle. Whether you’re an investor, entrepreneur, or simply someone who wants to stop stressing about money, you’ll walk away with strategies that are practical, adaptable, and timeless.\nThis isn’t about making you a financial genius. It’s about helping you avoid the biggest mistakes, stay consistent, and build wealth that actually serves your life.\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nUnderstand the deep link between money and psychology.\nLearn why savings, patience, and humility outperform greed and genius.\nCreate financial strategies that reflect your values and lifestyle.\nStop chasing appearances and start building invisible wealth.\nBuild resilience against uncertainty, risk, and financial surprises.\nSo if you’re ready to rethink money, wealth, and success—join us. In just 120 minutes, you’ll gain insights that would take hours of reading to uncover. This course is not just about money—it’s about you, your choices, and your freedom.\nNote: While this course is based on research and timeless principles, it also integrates modern tools, visual learning, and AI-supported narration for accessibility and engagement.",

However, we can apply many of the concepts we discuss here to a home purchase decision too.\nLearners will learn how to make purchasing decisions related to a car and large appliances. We will also discuss warranties and how they impact our significant purchase decisions.\nThe course will cover the decision to purchase a car versus leasing a vehicle.\nThe course will include example problems to make concepts more concrete.\nIt will also have practice problems, including downloadable Excel Workbooks, which users may also open using Google Sheets.\nThe Excel Workbooks will generally have at least two tabs. One tab will have the answer key so learners can deconstruct the problem. The second tab is where we work the practice problem step-by-step along with the instructional videos.",

Após as instruções básicas, vamos passar para os tópicos fundamentais da Matemática Financeira: valor presente (VP), valor futuro (VF) e prestação (PMT). Será usado o sistema de capitalização composta (juros sobre juros). Porém nossa ênfase será na compreensão dos cálculos e não na execução, pois isso ficará por conta das funções do software. Um outro mistério que vamos abordar é a conversão de taxas, em regime composto. Como transformar uma taxa de juros anual em sua equivalente semestral, trimestral ou mensal? Vamos mostrar como criar uma planilha para fazer o cálculo das taxas equivalentes de juros (anual, semestral, trimestral e mensal). Depois disso, vamos passar finalmente aos sistemas de amortização, àqueles usados para financiamentos. Vamos construir exemplos de Tabela Price, sem e com carência.

Parece que se você aumentar o preço, não vai conseguir mais vender.\nE ainda tem a pior situação, a que você precisa ficar reduzindo seu preço, porque você não tem mais confiança de que consegue vender pelo preço original.\nIsso atrapalha muito seu processo de vendas… Mesmo que você ache que isso é “parte da venda”, você está perdendo tempo e dinheiro. O pior é que às vezes você nem sabe disso. Sim, você pode achar que está ganhando dinheiro, mas como não considerou todos os custos, no fim do mês tem prejuízo.\nMas não desanime. Muita gente também passa por isso todos os dias. Esse problema acontece por diversos motivos, principalmente porque existem variáveis de custos que a gente não considera na hora de pensar em quanto e como cobrar.\nIsso ainda gera uma insegurança na hora da venda, o que é o pior sentimento que um vendedor pode ter nesse momento. Tudo isso por não saber argumentar sobre a diferença entre valor e preço.\nPor isso eu criei esse curso. Para te ajudar na hora de montar o seu preço e vender. Infelizmente, não existe mágica de vendas, mas existem fórmulas e metodologias para facilitar o seu dia a dia e melhorar seu resultado.\nO mercado de vendas está cada vez mais agressivo. Então, cada dia que você deixa passar representa anos de atraso no mundo dos negócios.\nQuer descobrir como cobrar pelo seu trabalho e conseguir aumentar suas vendas?!

Whether you're just starting out or want to boost your financial health, this easy-to-follow program will show you how to build a strong credit profile, steer clear of common mistakes, and unlock exciting financial opportunities.\nI know firsthand how frustrating it can be to navigate the US credit system without a roadmap. When I first lived here, I had to pay six months of rent upfront, was overpaying significantly for my car loan and insurance, and had no credit cards for those unexpected emergencies. Then, years later, when I returned, my wife faced the same challenges. Luckily, I had learned a few things by then and could help us both build a solid credit foundation.\nThroughout this course, we'll break down what a credit score really is and why it's so important. You'll learn about the key things that affect your score – like paying bills on time and how much of your credit you're using – and we'll give you simple, actionable tips to improve or even repair your credit. We'll cover real-life stuff you might be dealing with, like managing student loans, getting ready to buy a home or car, and keeping your information safe from identity theft.\nWe also get that starting out in a new country can have its own challenges, like building credit for the first time or avoiding unfair lending. We'll explore beginner-friendly tools like secured credit cards and even ways to get your rent payments to count! You'll master the smart way to use credit cards, and by the end of our time together, you'll not only understand how to manage your credit like a pro but also feel confident in your ability to build a secure financial future here.",

      "description": "Discover how you can free yourself from the rat race and achieve financial freedom.\nOnce you are human, you can exit the rat race and take back your mind (and your money), allowing you to live the life of your dreams.\n\n\nDon't you wish you were a human instead of a rat?\n\n\nDon't you wish financial freedom is achievable?\n\n\nHowever, you are struggling with...\n... living from paycheck to paycheck,\n... unable to save, invest, or live comfortably\n... constantly working 9 to 5 but not earning enough\nOr\n... do you want to escape the rat race, but aren't sure where to begin?\n\n\nWell, if you will be open and dedicated to this course, then it is for you!\n\n----------\n\n\nWhen it comes to financial freedom or finance in general...\nMoney would be the first thought.\n\n\nNevertheless...\nPeople argue that money can't buy happiness and that you shouldn't be a sin just for money\nJustification was all they did\nPeople who say money cannot buy happiness should send their money to your account.\nSure, it's not everything, but everything needs money.\nMoney can buy you freedom!\nHow can you be financially secure if you are insecure financially?\n\n\nIn contrast,\nMost people believe that the more money you have, the happier you will be.\nSadly, this is not true.\n\nI'll tell you what? Money isn't everything.\n\n\nPerhaps you are confused now\n\nAllow me to explain\nEven today, many people believe that money is the root of all evil.\nMoney, however, is not a problem.\nIt is the greed of money, the love of money, and the fear of losing money that cause the problem.\n\n\nAs a result...\nFinancial freedom is not only about money.\n\nIt's true that money has its perks.\nWe need money every day to survive.\nThe wealth we possess, however, will not be of any use to us if we are not ready for it.\nEven worse, it can destroy you.\n\n\nNo matter what your situation may be, this course will help you manage your money wisely and achieve financial freedom.\n\n\nIn that case, what can we do to prepare for true financial freedom?\nWe all should recognize that we are trapped in the never-ending rat race\nTrying to survive paycheck to paycheck\n\n\nIn that case, the most logical and obvious way...\n....to get out of the race is by stopping, isn't it?\nYes, it certainly is!\n\nBut how do we stop?\nWith this course, you will learn how to stop by transforming your mindset from rat to human.\n\n\nTherefore, what is true financial freedom?\nTo me, it is not simply being rich and not having to work.\nMoney isn't enough, you have to feel abundant and have a purpose and the desire to give.\nWho is capable of being like this?\nYou bet! But did you know even the wealthiest people can't make themselves truly happy inside?\nIt's true that they can get almost anything they want with the swipe of a finger, but they're not happy outside either.\n\n\nAlternatively, you may come across a decent young man who is struggling to make ends meet.\nBoth of these people haven't achieved financial freedom.\nThey are similar in no way related to money.\nThe problem lies in the mindset that hasn't changed yet.\n\n\nIn this course, I hope to help you transform to a new mindset.\nLet me help you take the very first step toward financial freedom.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nWhat you will learn:\nIdentify the financial myths you have encountered or will encounter (which is very often; you may even have fallen into its trap already!) and how to tackle them.\nBeing able to understand your problems, yourself, and your life from a clear vantage point which enable you to make good decisions\nHaving the mindset to always feel abundant at your current stage and for the future (contentment is key!)\nThe importance of doing excellent work over being perfect (after all, who is perfect?).\nKnowing how and when to leverage (and the right one to use) to help you achieve financial freedom.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nIs this course worth enrolled in?\nThat's an excellent question.\nIt's good that you are critical enough to ask that question.\nIt's true that there are many other courses that can help you achieve financial freedom.\nHowever, you should know several things.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, we are not offering a “get rich quick” scheme.\nMoney can ruin you if you get too much before you're ready.\nIn spite of the fact that part of the framework we teach is actually teaching you how to be excellent and use leverage to achieve significant results\nOur aim is not to promote a \"get rich quick\" mentality.\nYour financial freedom depends on your commitment to the method used in this module.\n\n\nSecondly, this course focuses on the mind.\nIt is a topic with many facets, and there are many resources you can use to achieve financial freedom.\nBut where do you begin?\nAs cliche as it may be,\nYour mind is where you should begin.\nWhatever you set your mind to, you can achieve.\nThe aim of this course is to use the smart way to transform your mind from a rat to a human mind\n\n\nFinally,\nWe adopt a principle from the ancient king and arguably the wisest monarch in history, named King Solomon.\nIt is a principle that has stood the test of time.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nSo, Are you ready to switch from rat to human?\nWould you like to take the first step towards financial freedom and growing your wealth?\nWell, if you’re ready, Take the leap and ENROLL NOW!\n\n\nNote\nIn this course, I may link to affiliate pages.\nThese are optional for you to check.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nAbout Coach Nell\nI am the CoFounder and CEO of TheRatRaceExit, an entrepreneur, a transformed rat to human and True Freedom winner.\nLiving in fear and anxiety was my reality. One instance was the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis that led to a downfall in the stock market.\nI lost nearly 90% of my wealth and had to move to Hong Kong in 2009.\nBut then I had an epiphany...\nWhich led me to true freedom and a social mission to help single, young professionals to achieve financial freedom.\nSo that you can do it without decades of ups and downs.\nI designed the strategy so that you can have a starting point...\nA start to have the right wisdom and mindset...\nA start to build wealth...\nA start to stop money worries...\nA start of true freedom.",

      "description": "Steel manufacturing involves a plethora of steps, and product costing for this industry is intricate. SAP CO provides the necessary tools and functionalities to enable accurate product costing, aiding steel manufacturing enterprises in efficient costing processes.\nLet's elaborate on the SAP CO implementation for product costing in the steel manufacturing sector:\n1. SAP Implementation in Steel Industry: Implementing SAP in the steel industry requires an in-depth understanding of industry-specific processes. The complexity of the steel manufacturing processes requires a tailored SAP solution to ensure that the processes are efficiently mapped and executed in the system.\n2. Course Structure: This course, beneficial for consultants aiming to implement SAP in the steel sector, should be structured with practical live scenarios, taking into account industry best practices and the specific nuances of steel manufacturing.\n3. Manufacturing Processes in Steel Industry:\nIron Making:\nIron ore, limestone, and coke are processed in a blast furnace to produce sinter.\nSintering is a vital process as it provides a rich raw material for iron making while reducing waste.\nCoke, produced from different grades of coal, acts as a reducing agent in the blast furnace.\nPrimary Steel Making:\nThe produced hot metal is then combined with scrap steel.\nTwo primary processes are:\nBasic Oxygen Furnace (BOF): Uses hot metal from the blast furnace and steel scrap. This is a widespread method.\nElectric Arc Furnace (EAF): Uses Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) and scrap metal. This method is increasingly becoming popular due to its environmental benefits.\nDepending on the client's requirements, mixed costing processes might be utilized, combining both BOF and EAF methods.\nSecondary Steel Making:\nThis process forms SLABS, BILLETS, and BLOOMS, which are fundamental materials used in various applications.\n4. Month-end Closing in Costing:\nF-02: Book all the financial expenses to a common cost center. This captures all costs, ensuring they are allocated in subsequent steps.\nKB31N: Enter statistical key figures (SKF) data for production cost centers, which aids in accurate overhead allocation based on actual production data.\nKSU1: Create assessment cycles. These cycles define how internal costs are distributed among various cost objects.\nCPTD: Allocate actual overheads using templates. This ensures overheads are distributed based on predefined standards or patterns.\nKSU5: Run the assessment cycle. This step allocates the costs from sender cost centers to receiver cost objects based on the rules defined in the assessment cycle.\nKSS2: Split costs based on activities. This distributes costs based on actual activity consumption.\nKSII: Calculate actual activity rates. This updates the plan rates with actual rates, providing more accurate costing.\nCON2: Revaluate orders based on the updated rates. This ensures that order costs are aligned with the most recent costing data.\nCO8B: Settle the costs of co-products. Co-products often share production costs, and this step ensures that costs are distributed fairly based on predefined rules.\nKKS1: Calculate variances. This step identifies any differences between planned and actual costs.\nCO88: Finally, settle production orders. This moves costs from production orders to finished goods, closing the loop on the production costing process.\nOverall, implementing SAP CO for product costing in the steel industry provides an integrated approach to capturing, allocating, and analyzing production costs. When correctly configured and utilized, SAP CO enables steel manufacturers to get insights into their costs, thereby aiding in cost optimization and better decision-making.",

You may have heard of the every dollar budget as made famous by Dave Ramsey. We want to ensure that every dollar of income generated by your household has a purpose. That may be saving, investing, bills, or groceries. By fully understanding our inflows and outflows of household cash we can make more intentional decisions with our money.\nToo many Americans are living beyond their means. We want to live below our means so that we have a surplus of cash to save and invest. This is how wealth is built and how we can achieve financial independence. The more you earn, the more you reduce your budget, and the more efficient you are, the faster you can achieve financial independence.\nWhat's the alternative? Staying in debt? Losing your credit score, your car, or even worse, your house?\nHouseholds generate income, have expenses, and provide value to society. The highest performing businesses are those that generate significant cash flow. A zero-based budget is a proven way to improve efficiency and generate free cash flow in your household. This cash flow is what we use to pay down debt, save for emergencies, and invest in our long-term goals.",

This course will address those concerns.\nYou'll get worksheets to do your own financial plan, budgeting, and investing - starting with a review of all the basics.\nYou'll feel great about your decisions, knowing you did everything independently and in line with your values.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll know with certainty the next steps you need to take to manage your inheritance.\nReceiving an inheritance or financial windfall can open the door to new opportunities. It can also come with intense and conflicting emotions.\nI've worked with a lot of people who were really struggling to figure out what to do with their money - it's complicated and no one feels sorry for you! People don't know who to trust, they know they need help, but they don't want to get taken advantage of and they usually don't want to share some very private parts of the process.\nThis is why I created this course - so you can learn how to help yourself. It gives you a tried and tested framework so you can make decisions about your inheritance, find peace of mind, and move forward with confidence.",

The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.\nFinancial statements are the core tool we used to measure our current financial position as well as our past performance. The balance sheet and income statement are our major financial statements.\nThe balance sheet shows us where we stand as of a point in time. The income statement looks back for a period of time, usually a month or year, to measure performance, discerning how we got to this current position represented by the balance sheet.\nPersonal financial statements are similar to business financial statements but are less standardized. Personal financial statements are less standardized in part because there are fewer formal regulations restricting them and because our financial goals are different.\nThe primary financial goal for a business is revenue generation. However, our personal financial goals will include, but not be limited to, revenue generation, the revenue being a means to an end rather than an end in and of itself.\nLearners will know how to construct financial statements and how the balance sheet and income statement are related.\nOnce we have our financial statements, which map out past performance and our current position, we can use them as a basis to look forward, creating a budget.\nLearners well know how to construct a personal financial budget. We will also discuss common personal ratios used to measure performance.",

      "description": "This course will help you understand the concepts of retirement planning in Canada. When a person is working it is essential to save some money for the retirement objective through a regular contribution into various plans. Some plans are at the employer, such as registered pension plans, while some plans or accounts are at financial institutions such as a bank. As a resident of Canada, you are entitled to certain pensions from the Government of Canada. One such pension is the Canada Pension Plan where a certain percentage is deducted from your salary and the employer also contributes into it. The pension you receive in retirement depends on your contribution and employer’s contribution. The other government benefit is Old Age Security which depends on your years of residence in Canada. If you lived in Canada more than 40 years you will be entitled to the OAS payment. We discuss about these plans in detail and this course We will discuss about Government of Canada pensions such as Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security. We discuss about company pensions such as Defined benefit, defined contribution, Individual pension Plans and Deferred Profit-Sharing Plans. Personal savings such as Registered Retirement Savings Plan are a useful way to save for a future as the profit grows tax free and you can qualify for a tax benefit in the year of contribution. Tax free savings plans are useful since the contribution and growth can be withdrawn tax-free. I show you how saving a little over a long time can add up to meet the needs of a decent lifestyle in retirement.",

      "description": "Given the wide array of topics covered under the SAP S/4 HANA  Controlling module, providing a comprehensive, in-depth elaboration for each would be an expansive undertaking. However, I'll provide a high-level overview of the topics you've listed:\n\n\nA). \"Product Costing\" scenarios:\n1. Product Costing by Order (Make to Stock):\nCalculating product costs for stock-based manufacturing, using production or process orders.\n2. Product Costing by Sales Order (Make to Order):\nDirect costs associated with specific sales orders are captured.\n3. Product Costing with Sales Order Controlling:\nFor vaulted stock: Costs related to inventory kept under tight control or in a secure location.\nFor non-vaulted stock: Regular stock not kept under special control.\n4. Product Costing by Period:\nPeriodic calculation of product costs.\n5. Repetitive Manufacturing:\nWithout reporting points consideration: Focuses on continuous production.\nWith reporting points: Captures costs at specific points in the production process.\n6. Decoupling Scenario:\nIntegration between production orders and product cost collectors.\n7. Joint Production, Co-Product, and By-Product Costing:\nJoint production: Multiple products from a single process.\nCo-product: Main products with similar value.\nBy-product: Secondary products with lesser value.\n8. Mixed Costing and Split Valuation:\nConsidering multiple methods or sources of production or procurement for a material.\n9. Special Scenarios:\nSub-contracting, external operations, special procurement, and cross plants.\nAdditives estimation and different types of scrap costing.\nB). \"Material Ledger\" scenarios:\n1. Multiple Currencies and Valuations:\nRecording transactions in company code currency, group currency, and others.\nDifferent valuations for legal, group, and profit center purposes.\n2. Transfer Pricing:\nPrice determination for inter-company or intra-company transfers.\n3. Revaluation of Consumption:\nAdjusting consumption values based on actual costs.\n4. Material Ledger and Actual Costing:\nThe material ledger captures all material movements and valuation changes.\nCKM3 provides an analysis of material prices.\nC). \"Margin Analysis\":\n1. Account-Based COPA:\nIn S/4 HANA, COPA integrates seamlessly with the universal journal. This covers value flows and margin analysis.\n2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Price Difference Split:\nDifferentiating COGS components and capturing price variances.\n3. Predictive Accounting:\nCapturing potential future financial transactions based on preliminary documents.\n4. Real-Time COPA/Margin Analysis:\nReal-time profitability analysis without waiting for periodic settlement.\n5. Attributed Profitability:\nCapturing profitability elements without specific profitability segments.\n6. COPA Realignment and Assessment:\nAdjusting and redistributing COPA values.\nEach topic here is extensive and carries its own processes, configurations, and integration points. It would be essential to dive into each topic individually for a thorough understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Material Ledger in SAP enables tracking and management of material costs, which becomes increasingly essential in organizations with complex valuation and costing scenarios, like Transfer Pricing and Multiple Valuations. Here's a deep dive into the given topics:\nMaterial Ledger Configuration-Multiple Valuations:\nActivate the Material Ledger for specific valuation areas.\nDefine valuation approaches: Legal, Group, and Profit Center Valuations.\nConfigure parallel currencies, tying them to respective valuations.\nDefine and assign currency types for each valuation area, ensuring they correspond to the respective valuation approaches.\nStandard Costing with Multiple Valuations:\nSet standard costs for materials at the beginning of a period.\nThese costs will be maintained for each of the valuation approaches, giving rise to parallel standard costs.\nThe cost estimate procedure ensures that the costing variants consider all valuation-specific influences.\nTransfer Pricing Cycle:\nTransfer pricing pertains to pricing of transfers between related entities.\nUsing Material Ledger, this can be tracked through multiple valuations.\n3.1. Raw Material to FG material within the Same Plant: - The raw material's cost, considering the transfer price, will influence the finished good's cost. - Both legal and profit center valuations will reflect these costs differently, depending on intra-entity pricing.\n3.2. Plant to Plant Transfer: - When materials are transferred from one plant to another, it's similar to a sale-purchase event between two profit centers. - Transfer prices come into play, and these prices can be tracked using the different valuations in Material Ledger.\nDistribution Usage Variance Topic:\nThis pertains to variances that arise when allocating costs.\n4.1. Distribution Usage variance for Materials-CKMDUVMAT: - Occurs when the actual consumption of a material differs from the planned consumption. - This tool helps in analyzing the distribution usage variance for specific materials across different valuation views.\n4.2. Distribution Usage variance for Activity Types.-CKMDUVACT: - Relates to variances in activity types (like labor or machine hours) during production. - Variances might arise because of differences between planned and actual hours.\nActual Costing Execution -CKMLCP:\nCKMLCP is the central transaction for executing actual costing.\nIt determines the actual costs of materials for the period, factoring in all influences including transfer prices.\nThis results in a more accurate depiction of material costs across the various valuation views.\nExplanation of Material Price Analysis-CKM3 & Accounting Entries:\nCKM3 provides a comprehensive view of the material's price evolution.\nYou can see the price changes and associated accounting entries across all valuations.\nThis tool offers insights into factors contributing to price changes, like variances, revaluations, etc.\nPrice Adjustment by MR22 (Frequently happening in Live Environment):\nMR22 allows manual adjustments to material prices.\nIn scenarios where unusual events distort material prices, manual interventions via MR22 are needed to correct them.\nThe impacts of these adjustments are reflected across all valuation views in the Material Ledger.\nMaterial Ledger Help Desk Tool Functionalities:\nA tool designed to support the end-users by providing insights and analytics on various Material Ledger processes.\nHelps in troubleshooting, data consistency checks, and understanding the flow of values.\nOffers various reports and insights on valuations, price determinations, and variances.",

      "description": "You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of getting in SAP or more specifically, learning SAP FICO (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the SAP Functional Modules). Now that you have found this course, you have to look no further. I am an experienced SAP consultant and am very passionate to guide you through the journey of learning SAP FICO.\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to catch up is \"to work on it\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP FICO and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP FICO. Even though SAP FICO can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word \"SAP\" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).\nIn this course, I will walk you though SAP FICO Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the program SAP FICO, but also what the crux of programming is in terms of how we solve problems programmatically and harness the POWER of SAP FICO.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP FICO finance and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the most SAP Module: SAP FICO.",

Imagine making life decisions based on what you truly want, not just what you can afford.\nFinancial freedom means:\nHaving the ability to take time off work when you need it, without worrying about how you’ll pay the bills\nEnjoying life’s experiences, like traveling, spending time with family, and pursuing hobbies, without feeling guilty about the cost\nFeeling secure, knowing that if an emergency arises, you have the financial cushion to handle it\nBeing able to plan for the future with confidence, instead of feeling anxious about retirement, housing costs, or debt\nMost importantly, financial freedom gives you the mental and emotional freedom to focus on what truly matters—your relationships, your health, and your happiness.\nWhy You Should Enroll Today\nThis course is designed to help you break free from financial anxiety and start building a future where you are in control. You will not only gain practical financial skills, but you will also develop the mindset and confidence needed to achieve financial independence.\nThis is not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you’re looking for magic tricks or overnight success, this course isn’t for you. But if you’re ready to make real, lasting changes that will impact your life for years to come, then you’re in the right place.\nDan Munro, a bestselling author and experienced coach, has spent nearly a decade helping people change their financial habits and gain confidence in managing money. His background in psychology and behavior change gives him a unique approach to financial education—one that focuses on real-world application rather than just theory.\nRisk-Free Enrollment\nYou have nothing to lose. This course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it with confidence.\nStop letting money control your life. Enroll today and take the first step toward financial freedom.",

      "description": "Personal Capital is currently a free software that can connect to financial institutions, pulling in financial asset and liability balances, as well as transaction detail, into one location.\nThe strong areas of benefit of using Personal Capital software are its ability to provide net worth or balance sheet information, investment management information, and planning tools such as retirement planning and other large planning goals.\nThe Personal Capital software also downloads transaction detail and allows for the categorization or assigning of accounts and tags that can then be used to generate an income statement. It also has budgeting tools to help with shorter-term cash flow management.\nThis course will discuss how to set up the Personal Capital software and link to accounts. We will also discuss some reasons why the software may be offered for free and look over Personal Capital data security.\nWe will compare the Personal Capital software to other types of software that can connect directly to financial institutions and pull financial information, such software generally falling into the category of accounting software that uses the double-entry accounting system or financial management software.\nAccounting software using the double-entry accounting system includes packages such as QuickBooks, Xero, & Wave accounting. Although accounting software utilizes financial institution connectivity it generally does so differently than Personal Capital software, which falls into the financial management category. We will discuss the differences in software.\nOther financial management and budgeting software include Quicken, Mint, and Microsoft Excel, Excel actually having a template called Money in Excel that has financial institution connectivity.\nLearners will practice converting financial data into an income statement by downloading transactions from financial institutions, categorizing them, and then exporting them into Excel for sorting. We will compare the process with what would be done using accounting software like QuickBooks.\nThe course will discuss the benefits of the personal net worth or balance sheet functionality of Personal Capital software, the software pulling in assets and liability balances automatically for items such as bank accounts, investment accounts like 401(K), savings accounts, CD accounts, credit card balances, mortgage balances, and loan balances.\nWe will also discuss the benefit of the software providing more detail on our investment holdings and providing insights and suggestions to improve returns and reduce risk. The ability to pull investments into one place allows a more rounded analysis of the data than you may get from one brokerage account analyzed in isolation.\nLearners will be able to use the projection planner to help plan for retirement and other large investment items. The Personal Capital software utilizes sophisticated analytical tools including a Monte Carlo Simulation tool.\nWe will also explore the home appraisal tool offered by the software and we will practice adding non-financial institution assets and liabilities, making our net worth or balance sheet completer and more accurate.",

      "description": "We have asked Lisa, another young person who has now started at University, to share with you\n12 things about money, she wishes she was taught at school!\n\n\nBeing an adult and managing your finances can be a struggle for some of us. We all know that we should plan, budget and take care of money and our spending. But how many of us do it? We are supposed to rationalise each purchase and think upfront about whether we can afford something and whether we need the item we want to buy. Or is this purchase just a way of satisfying our infinite wants?\n\n\nMost of us wish we learned about money before our 20’s so by the time we are 30 we have some savings, investments and we understand how to manage the money.\nWe wish we didn’t make so many mistakes, didn’t waste hundreds of pounds on useless purchases. We wish they taught us more about money at school,\" says Lisa.\n\n\nFinancial education helps children learn how to manage their money now and in the future, choose the best financial products and services and protect themselves from fraud and exploitation.\nWithout high quality financial education, all children and young people are at some risk of having poor financial capability. This risk increases amongst more vulnerable groups, including disabled children and those with a long-term illness, children looked after, young carers and those from low-income households. It is particularly important to ensure that the approach to financial education in schools meets the needs of these and all children and young people.\"\nThe workbook accompanying this course has now achieved a Quality Mark from the Assocaition for Teaching Citizenship. It makes it suitable for youth workers and facilitators to use in UK schools.\nNow is your chance to learn the basics of money!\n\n\nWhat you'll learn:\nTips for saving money\nMoney terms you should know\nWhy we need to talk about money\nAbout savings, budgeting, debt, needs and wants, plus more.\nNewly added: wages, tax, credit and debit cards, banks, borrowing and a finance dictionary.\nUK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) : 10081110.",

Aside from that, as we were not taught financial literacy in school, many families has declared themselves bankrupt. It is truly a scary time. Having said that, those who saved money are less impacted and they are doing a little better at this very uncertain time.\nSo with that, I decided to share some insights on budgeting after being an accountant and a financial analyst for close to 20 years. In this course, you shall gain the following :\nPeace of Mind\nI like many weren't taught any financial literacy in school and with that we are not equipped to weather the financial uncertainties. But after reading books and working in the financial industry, today I have a better understanding of money and I would like to teach that financial understanding to you.\nA Fun Way To Learn\nLets face it, to pick a new skill up especially if we have to read a text book is hard !!! more so when a book is filled with numbers. So I think a video course on the subject of budgeting is the perfect solution.  Whereby, we will have slides and me guiding you in this learning process.\nActionable Steps\nI for one am guilty of reading many many books only to not take any action and I know the pain of not taking action even though we know what to do. So in this course, I have outline how to start a budget and cut our expenses in a simple to follow step by step format\nConvenient\nI know we live in a fast moving busy world, so learning a new skill has been made so much easier as you can now access this information through mobile devices or your laptop. Basically at any where and any time to your convenience.\nSo come and join us on this adventure of personal budgeting.",

      "description": "There are various types of risks that a business faces and to it important to deal with them correctly and in time. They require to be predicted and then controlled in a way that it does not affect their business. These tutorials will help you learn about liquidity and its management and also analyze the outcomes of global economic crisis.\nThe training will include the following;\nIntroduction\nHistory of Economic Crisis\nThe Great Depression of 1929\nThe Financial Crisis of 2008- Causes\nThe Financial Crisis of 2008- Impact\nThe Financial Crisis of 2008- Govt intervention\nLessons Learned\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity Management\nLiquidity Reporting\nLiquidity management is one of the main pillars of a company's financial management, because it ensures solvency. Here we show you why it is so important for companies, how it works in principle and how companies can implement it in practice. Investors, lenders, and managers all look to a company's financial statements using liquidity measurement ratios to evaluate liquidity risk. This is usually done by comparing liquid assets—those that can easily be exchanged to create cash flow—and short-term liabilities. The comparison allows you to determine if the company can make excess investments, pay out bonuses or meet their debt obligations. Companies that are over-leveraged must take steps to reduce the gap between their cash on hand and their debt obligations. When companies are over-leveraged, their liquidity risk is much higher because they have fewer assets to move around. Almost five years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the start of the global financial crisis, the global economy continues to feel the aftershocks. Policymakers continue to grapple with the policy response. The start of 2013 saw tail risks recede in the global economy, thanks to policy actions in the U.S. and euro area. While financial market conditions have improved markedly across the board for the last half year or so, the real economy continues to lag. We still are not seeing the levels of growth needed to drive a real global recovery, and we are not generating the jobs needed for the millions who have fallen into unemployment over the past five years.",

The decision-making process will estimate future cash flows and then apply our time value of money concepts to those future cash flows.\nThis course will take a step back in the process, providing tools to best estimate the future cash flows. To make the best decision we will need to estimate what the future cash flows will be and the likelihood of those cash flows, giving us numbers we can apply present value concepts to while also taking into consideration risk.\nTo help measure risk, the course will use statistical tools including the population mean, population variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.\nWe will provide a quick overview of these statistical concepts in general and then consider how we can apply them to measuring risk for investment and capital budgeting decisions.",

      "description": "Let me ask you this, do you envision yourself working for an employer for 40-years to retire at 65?\nMe neither!\nMost people were never taught about how to properly manage money and have no idea how to reach financial independence. People tend to operate on a mental money blueprint that was learned by default. Like the majority of society, they have been sold the idea that the only way to reach financial independence is to, \"secure a loan, go to college, get a secure job with benefits, invest in a 401k and retire at 65 with a sizeable nest egg.\"\nAlthough this strategy may work for some, it is too slow & risky. It depends on the performance of the stock market, it relies on a sole source of income and is based on an outdated strategy from the industrial age. Furthermore, if this method is successful and the stock market complies with your \"compounding interest\" plan, then you may be too mentally and physically worn out to enjoy your nest egg in your retirement years. Not only that to add insult to injury, you will likely live in fear of losing your nest egg, continue to hoard your money and be forced to live below your means instead of living the life you desire.\nHowever, this is not your fault! Unfortunately, financial education has been intentionally removed from the academic system and the secrets of the wealthy have been shielded for generations, until now!\nHere at The Financial Freedom Fastlane Network, we offer the most comprehensive finance & wealth building course available. This course provides alternative wealth building strategies that differ from the \"park-&-pray, retire at 65\" method of investing. This course will reveal how the wealthy approach finance and investing and how you can too!\nMost finance courses will emphasize, \"cut expenses, live below your means, avoid debt, and save for the long-term.\" This advice is largely from the industrial age and thus outdated!\nWe believe the best way to create prosperity is not to scrimp, save, and live below your means, but rather to expand your means!\nThis is not a get-rich-quick-scheme, it is a do-it-yourself guide to designing the life you desire!\nFind out how you too can approach finance and wealth building like a Fastlaner!\nIf you're wondering what a Fastlaner is, see the video below for a sneak peek! But beware, once you discover the secrets of the wealthy, you will not go back to the Slowlane.",

It deals with understanding the messaging that we have been bombarded with in our society that significantly impacts the way we think about money. It's about reconditioning our thoughts and attitudes to create new behaviors that will support our ability to achieve long term financial success. This course identifies specific items of action needed to reprogram our mentalities which are intended to cause a change in our behavior patterns. Understanding how to recognize a problem, what causes a problem, and what is required to fix the problem is the remedy that this course is offering to help people improve their financial well-being. The course focuses on fundamental and practical behaviors that must become new habits. It challenges beliefs and opinions that rule the day when it comes to governing our everyday thinking and believing in regards to the decisions we make relating to money. The course is designed to remove the guesswork from the question of what does it take to be financially successful, and provide a clear foundation of what to do and what not to do regarding our finances and how to get from an undesirable place to a desirable place.",

È nata così la finanza comportamentale, disciplina che, mettendo insieme il lavoro di economisti, psicologi e neuroscienziati, ha raggiunto un livello di maturità importante non solo nell'identificare e codificare gli errori di investitori individuali e professionali, ma anche nel suggerire strategie per minimizzare le conseguenze di tali errori, fino a trasformarli in alleati per ingenerare comportamenti virtuosi.\nQuesto percorso, creato da Gianluca Sidoti, Consulente Finanziario Indipendente e fondatore di TraDetector, affronta in modo divulgativo questi sviluppi operativi per gli investitori privati che vogliano migliorare la propria capacità decisionale.\nLa recente crisi che ha influenzato i mercati finanziari ha mostrato i limiti della finanza tradizionale e delle teorie economiche classiche, che partono dal presupposto della completa razionalità degli agenti economici. Di conseguenza, sono nati studi sui comportamenti degli operatori al fine di evidenziare gli errori legati a comportamenti irrazionali ed opportunistici, in modo tale da correggerli o evitarli. Il presente lavoro analizza le scelte degli investitori sotto il profilo psicologico descrivendo i principi della Finanza Comportamentale.\n\n\nTra gli argomenti del Corso:\nLA CORRELAZIONE TRA PSICOLOGIA E FINANZA\nQual è il presupposto necessario per fare buone scelte di investimento.\nPer quale motivo mantenere liquidità per troppo tempo sul conto corrente è un errore che può essere evitato.\nCome determinare la propria propensione al rischio.\n\n\nI PRINCIPALI ERRORI NEGLI INVESTIMENTI\nQual è il nemico peggiore dell’investitore.\nPer quale motivo conoscere gli errori principali di finanza comportamentale ci rende maggiormente consapevoli nelle nostre scelte di investimento.\n\n\nLA NOSTRA CONSAPEVOLEZZA FINANZIARIA\nQual è il vero significato della parola “investimento”.\nIl Piano di Investimento Programmato e di Accumulo (PIC e PAC): cos’è, in cosa consiste e perché è una modalità efficiente di investimento.\n\n\nFINANZA COMPORTAMENTALE NELL'INVESTIMENTO IMMOBILIARE\nPer quale motivo il mercato immobiliare è esattamente pari a tutti gli altri strumenti finanziari.\nIn che modo la finanza comportamentale impatta anche negli acquisti in ambito immobiliare.",

Fakat bunun için finansal okur yazarlığımızı arttırmalı ve çok okuyup, çok öğrenmeliyiz. Eğitimler borsanın olmazsa olmazıdır! Borsada temel ve teknik analiz olarak 2 ana eğitim belirtilse de,  borsada yatırım stratejileri yöntemleri çok fazladır. Örneğin temettü yatırımı, halka arz yatırımları, takas analizi, para giriş-çıkışı vb gibi. Günlük al-sat yapan traderler olduğu gibi, uzun dönem elinde hisse tutarak gerçek bir uzun vadeli yatırımcılığına soyunan kişiler de paralarını oldukça efektif bir şekilde değerlendirebiliyorlar.\nFakat ne olursa olsun, birilerinden hisse duyarak, tüyo alarak hisse seçimi yapmanız ve o hisselere yatırım yapmanız ciddi bir risktir. Riski minimize ederek olası kayıplardan en az etkilenmek sizin elinizde. Bunun için doğru analiz ve yakın takip çok önemli. Dolayısı ile daha borsaya girmeden bir strateji oluşturmanız gerekmektedir. Plansız hareket etmek kesinlikle doğru değildir ve sizin için büyük kayıplara neden olabilir!\nBu nedenlerden dolayı kursumuza ilk siz ne istiyorsunuz sorusu ile başlıyoruz. Siz kimsiniz? Nasıl bir profiliniz var ve nasıl bir yatırımcısınız? Bunların cevabını bilmeden herhangi bir para piyasasına girmek doğru değildir. Tabi ki  teknik analizin yanında, bir yatırım stratejiniz ve bir de yatırım planınız olmalı!\nBu kursun ÜCRETSİZ olmasının amaçlarından birisi de, sizin tüm bunlara hazır olup olmadığınızı göstermektir. Eğer gerçekten hazır iseniz, işte o zaman ücretli kurslar alabilir, kendinizi bu yönde geliştirebilir ve gerçek bir yatırımcı olabilirsiniz.\nKursu tamamladığınızda teknik analizin aslında ne kadar kolay olduğunu  anlayacaksınız. Her türlü para piyasası enstrümanına baktığınızda grafikler size  doğru kararlar verebilecek bir şekilde önünüzde olacak. Piyasalara karşı öz güveniniz yükselecek alım satım yaparken kimseden onay alma ihtiyacı duymayacaksınız. Başarılı olmanın sırrı çok çalışmaktır.",

      "description": "This course will teach you the fundamentals of financial statement and decision analysis, with a focus on the balance sheet. One of the most basic qualities in the corporate world is the ability to assess a company's results. And, let's be honest, it's not easy. It necessitates an in-depth knowledge of shareholder preferences, performance, liquidity, risk control, and operational quality. This course is designed to teach this dynamic analysis in the most straightforward manner possible. To get started, you don't need any accounting or finance experience.\nThe course explains the basic material of financial statements in a clear and important context by visiting a real enterprise and interviewing real business people. The course's aim is to leave students with a lasting understanding of what a balance sheet is and what it shows. This training is aimed at non-financial mid-to senior-level executives from all sectors and functional areas. This course would benefit executives in communications, distribution, human resources, manufacturing, or engineering, as well as general managers who have been advanced along these paths, through their knowledge of financial analysis. After completing the program, you will be better able to communicate the financial goals and performances of your department within your organization as well as to outside sources. So, at the end of this course, you won't just know how to read financial statements in general; you'll also know how to relate them to your own company's financial statements, giving you a much greater view of your own company's financial success and what you can/need to do to either sustain or enhance it.",

E allora eccoci, pronti a spiegarvele come si deve, illustrandovi le più tipiche formule assicurative che potreste vedervi proporre da un agente (o da un consulente finanziario): cosa coprono e, soprattutto, che cosa implicano.\nLa stipula di un contratto di assicurazione è infatti tipicamente frutto dell’iniziativa di un privato cittadino - o, su scala più ampia, di un imprenditore (piccolo o grande che sia), dello Stato o di un suo ente o di un'organizzazione internazionale - che, in presenza di un interesse da tutelare o un evento sfavorevole dal quale proteggersi, può decidere di rivolgersi a una compagnia assicurativa o, più comunemente, a un distributore che possa fare da \"intermediario\". Alla compagnia di assicurazione o al distributore è quindi affidato il compito di valutarne adeguatamente le esigenze assicurative e di offrire, di conseguenza, le soluzioni più idonee a soddisfarle.\nIn particolare, in questo percorso scoprirai:\nDagli elementi da considerare prima di decidere di assicurarsi agli aspetti contrattuali da verificare con particolare attenzione: come funziona la stipula di una polizza assicurativa\nQual è la funzione delle assicurazioni in una società moderna?\nCome funziona il mercato assicurativo, come operano le imprese assicuratrici?\nCome stabiliscono il prezzo di una polizza?\nLo spiegano in questo nuovo percorso dell'Academy di TraDetector Gianluca Sidoti, Consulente Finanziario Autonomo e Roberto Colizza, broker assicurativo ed Educatore Patrimoniale.",

Or maybe you set out some time ago, and are just realizing that maybe, just maybe, setting your finances in order would have been a good thing.\n\n\nIn this Course you will learn how to handle finances, money and your budgeting, from the beginning, detailing where to spend your money, how to spend your money, clear through to how to handle the money you earn. And you won't need to learn what EBITDA stands for, let alone recreate it for your financial statements.\n*\nSee what other students have had to say:\n\"I really enjoyed taking this course. I found it helpful - especially the section about tracking expenses - and would recommend it to anybody who is a freelancer and looking to learn more about the financial aspects of managing their own small business.\" - Cristiana La Selva\n\"As my major at school or my job experience don't have anyhing in common with the finance management, this course is actually exactly what I was looking for\" - Gulshat Turyszhan\n\"what an amazing course I learned a lot, it was so smooth and fun ...thanks a lot\" - Azez Althabet\n\"This course is a good starting point for those like me who are just starting out as freelancers and aren't quite sure about the options available to them. It kind of serves as an over all blueprint. Totally recommend!\" - Celia Toubal\n\"The course provides good advice on marketing strategies. It's nice to be forewarned about paths you may be tempted to take, such as just spending money on advertising in general when networking with friends, family and business contacts could be your first steps.\" - Cassandra Johnson\n\"Thank You, Robert, once again! Great course! Some things are known to me, but I always welcome different perspectives.\" - Martin Vargečko\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you register for this course:\n1. You will have lifetime access\n2. You will receive a certificate upon completion\n3. You can ask questions at any point and I will respond\n\n\nSee you in the course!\n\n\n\n\n- Robert G",

Então, sem a suficiente inteligência emocional ninguém atinge a prosperidade financeira.\nIgualmente ninguém sai do buraco do endividamento crônico, da carência permanente, da dificuldade que persiste ao longo da vida, se não resolver seus probemas emocionais. O que é certo é que a pessoa paga muito caro (e pessoas de seu relacionamento também) por não controlar suas emoções impulsos, por não cultivar os hábitos certos com o dinheiro.\nEm algumas famílias e em algumas culturas as pessoas aprendem desde cedo a cuidar bem de seu dinheiro, principalmente desenvolvendo a maturidade e a responsabilidade com suas finanças. Assim, vão muito mais longe em suas realizações pessoais. Finanças pessoais saudáveis, prosperidade sustentável, só acontece para pessoas muduras em termos de ideias, emoções e comportamentos. Vale dizer: a Inteligência Emocional, aquela inteligência que leva as pessoas a uma vida mais produtiva e feliz , é fundamental para o sucesso financeiro.\nE você? Como administra sua finanças pessoais? Como profissional ou como amador?\nQuer melhorar já e sempre na área do controle financeiro?\nQuer assumir o comando de sua vida ou quer deixar os desejos e impulsos complicarem seus planos, suas relações, seus projetos de vida?\nHoje já se sabe que a IE-Inteligência Emocional é aquela parte da inteligência humana que realmente pesa mais sobre a realização pessoal e profissional. Sabe-se também que ela pode ser ampliada, que as pessoas têm poder para transformar seu modo de ser decisivamente, assumindo o real controle.\nSe você pretende melhorar na área comportamental no trato com o dinheiro ou se pretende ajudar outras pessoas (como pai, amigo, colega, professor, coacher, psicólogo, orientador de carreira) este curso poderá ser de valia. Se for o caso, será um prazer receber você aqui.",

      "description": "SAP CO Product Costing, Material Ledger and COPA Scenarios in S/4 HANA\nThe Product Costing module allows organizations to determine the production costs of products. This is integral for controlling and for assessing profitability. Material Ledger enables actual costing and supports multiple valuations in parallel.\nProduct Costing Techniques:\nProduct costing by order (Make to Stock): Costs are determined based on manufacturing orders. It's suitable for non-repetitive production.\nProduct costing by Sales order (Make to Order): Costing is done for specific sales orders. Typically used for customized products.\nProduct costing with Sales order controlling vaulted stock with sale order controlling: When both anticipated stock and actual sales order-driven stock exist.\nProduct costing with sales order controlling non-vaulted stock with sale order controlling: For products produced directly against sales orders without anticipation.\nProduct costing by period: Periodic costing for products irrespective of orders.\nRepetitive manufacturing without reporting points consideration: Costs for products that are manufactured repetitively and without specific checkpoints.\nRepetitive manufacturing with reporting points (work in process) consideration: Costs are captured at different stages or checkpoints of the production process.\nJoint Production Process: Multiple main products are derived from one production order.\nCO-Product costing process and By Product Costing Process: Co-products are main products with similar value, whereas by-products have minor value compared to the main product.\nMixed Costing process- Split Valuation: When a material can be procured/manufactured in more than one way.\nSub-Contracting, External Operations Product costing process: Costs when a part of the manufacturing process is subcontracted to external suppliers.\nCross plants –Special Procurement product costing: Costs are determined when procuring from a different plant within the same company.\nAdditives cost estimation: The costs of additive materials in the manufacturing process.\nSAP CO S/4 HANA 2021 -Material Ledger\nMultiple Currencies:\nCompany Code Currency: Primary currency for a company code.\nGroup Currency: Consolidation currency.\nGlobal company Currency: Company currency\nMultiple Valuations:\nLegal Valuation: As per local regulations.\nGroup Valuation: Consolidated valuation.\nProfit Center Valuation: Based on profit center reporting needs.\nTransfer pricing:\nInter Company: Pricing between different company codes.\nIntra Company: Pricing within the same company code.\nPhysical Inventory count integrated with Material Ledger/Actual Costing: Actual stock valuation as per physical count.\nDistribution Usage variances: The differences between planned and actual usage of materials and activity types in production.\nActivity Types: Quantitative measures of services provided by a cost center. Adjustments made for variances between planned and actual activity provided.\nMaterial Ledger- Actual Costing Execution and CKM3: The CKM3 transaction provides a detailed material price analysis showing the evolution of material prices.\nCKMLCPAVR: Cumulative Actual Costing :\nThis overview provides a detailed but condensed understanding of the topics related to SAP CO: S/4 HANA 2022 in the context of Product Costing and Material Ledger.

      "description": "Budgeting: A Roadmap to Financial Clarity and Success\nBudgeting isn’t just a practice for accountants or those facing financial difficulties—it’s a powerful tool that anyone can use to achieve financial clarity and success. At its core, budgeting is about creating a plan for your money, ensuring you can cover your essential needs while working toward your financial goals. Whether you’re saving for a down payment on a house, planning a vacation, or simply aiming to avoid overspending, a budget serves as your roadmap.\nSteps to Start Budgeting\n1. Assess Your Financial Situation\nBegin by gathering information about your income and expenses. How much money do you bring home each month? What are your recurring expenses? Understanding where your money comes from and where it goes is the first step in creating a budget.\n2. Set Clear Goals\nWhat are you budgeting for? Your goals could range from short-term objectives, like saving for a new laptop, to long-term plans, like building a retirement fund. Clear, achievable goals give your budget purpose and help you stay motivated.\n3. Categorize Your Spending\nBreak down your expenses into categories such as housing, transportation, groceries, and entertainment. Categorization helps you identify areas where you can cut back and allocate funds more effectively.\n4. Choose a Budgeting Method\nExplore various budgeting methods, from the envelope system to modern budgeting apps. Select one that aligns with your lifestyle and stick with it to track your spending and compare it to your budget.\n5. Review and Adjust Regularly\nYour budget isn’t set in stone. Review it regularly and make adjustments as your financial situation or goals change. Flexibility is key to maintaining a successful budget.\nBudgeting is a fundamental skill that empowers you to take control of your finances. By understanding where your money goes and planning how to use it wisely, you create a foundation for a secure financial future.\nStart today and adjust as needed—the benefits far outweigh the effort.",

Essa percepção se traduz no Custo de Oportunidade e na Taxa Mínima de Atratividade (TMA) de cada investidor.\nUsando planilhas do Excel, você vai entender o conceito e aprender a calcular facilmente o Custo de Oportunidade e a Média Ponderada do Custo de Capital (WACC) de um projeto. A partir disso, você vai construir uma projeção do Fluxo de Caixa de um projeto. Vai então aprender a calcular o Valor Presente Líquido (VPL) e a Taxa Interna de Retorno (TIR) do fluxo de caixa projetado. Na sequência, vai construir cenários para o projeto e calcular os valores esperados da análise de viabilidade. Assim você terá as ferramentas necessárias para iniciar a análise de viabilidade financeira e criação de valor de um projeto de investimentos.\nAs ferramentas apresentadas neste curso servem tanto para avaliar empreendimentos já em funcionamento, quanto para avaliar projetos de investimento ainda não iniciados. Você vai aprender até a estimar o valor criado pelo projeto para um investidor.\nA abordagem é simples e intuitiva e as estruturas de cálculo estão prontas nas planilhas do curso.

Peki kitaplara ulaşmak için illa yüksek meblağlar harcamak mı gerekiyor?\nCevap: Hayır.\nBen 8 yıllık bir sahafım. Yüz binlerce kitap elime geçti, on binlerce kişiye kitap ulaştırdım. Bu süreçte fark ettim ki, Türkiye'de kitaplara çok daha ucuza ulaşmak mümkün. Ama bu bilgileri kimse sistemli bir şekilde öğretmiyor. Çünkü çoğu kişi, bu bilgileri ya kendine saklıyor ya da kıymetinin farkında bile değil.\nİşte bu yüzden bu kursu hazırladım.\nBu eğitimde size kitaplara ücretsiz ya da düşük maliyetle nasıl ulaşabileceğinizi adım adım gösteriyorum. Takas gruplarından kütüphanelere, dijital arşivlerden sahaf tüyolarına kadar uzanan geniş bir strateji sunuyorum. Üstelik bu yöntemlerin büyük bir kısmı hemen uygulanabilir ve herhangi bir teknik bilgi gerektirmez.\nEğer kitap okumayı seviyor ama maddi engeller yüzünden vazgeçmek zorunda kalıyorsanız, bu kurs size yeni bir pencere açacak.\nKitaplara ulaşmak artık bir lüks değil, bir strateji meselesi olacak. Kitaplara erişiminizi kolaylaştırmak, bilgiye açılan tüm kapıları aralamakla eşdeğerdir.\nBu kursu tamamladığınızda:\n- Daha az harcayarak daha fazla kitap edinebileceksiniz.\n- Kitaplara ulaşmak için izleyebileceğiniz 10’dan fazla yasal ve sürdürülebilir yöntem öğreneceksiniz.\n- Kendi kitap edinme sisteminizi kurabileceksiniz.\nOkuma alışkanlığınızı yeniden canlandırmak ve kitaplara gerçekten ulaşmak istiyorsanız, bu kurs tam size göre!",

It goes a lot deeper than that.\nIf you were told Godly people can’t be rich, it’s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, or you don’t make enough money to save and invest, and nobody ever taught you how to create wealth, then this book is for you.\nGod has set principles for the universe to function, but did you know that He also has principles put in place to gain success? Everything He created was made to thrive! The sun shines, plants grow, birds fly, EVERYTHING is made to succeed.\nYou and I are made in God’s image, so we are also wonderfully created to succeed in each facet of our lives, including our finances.\nIf you want to be financially free, build wealth, and live life without the worry of having enough for retirement, this course will help you discover God’s design to:\n• Build an abundance mindset\n• Improve your overall financial IQ\n• Learn how to command your money and have it work for you\n• Get out of debt, save properly, use credit correctly and invest wisely\n• Start using money like the wealthy\n• Plus, learn what schools don’t want us to know and gain a deeper understanding of wealth\nIt’s time to use the laws of God to learn how to break free from the rat race and become financially free",

Let's delve deeper into the process.\n\n\nSAP CO: Product Costing in Cement Manufacturing with Process Orders\nFor cement manufacturing, as a process industry, the costing is carried out through Process Orders (PP-PI) as opposed to discrete manufacturing where Production Orders are more suitable.\nProcess Flow for Cement Manufacturing:\nLimestone Mining:\nExtraction of limestone from quarries.\nIn SAP, this could be represented by a process order capturing the costs associated with mining activities including equipment maintenance, labor, and other overheads.\nLimestone Crushing:\nThe extracted limestone is processed to obtain crushed limestone.\nThis process order would capture costs like machinery wear and tear, electricity, and labor costs.\nRaw Meal Preparation:\nAdditives like clay are mixed with crushed limestone to create raw meal.\nThe process order here would account for the proportional costs of the additives, mixing and blending costs, and any associated overheads.\nClinker Formation:\nThe raw meal undergoes heating in a kiln, resulting in the formation of clinker.\nCosts such as fuel for the kiln, maintenance of the kiln, and emissions controls would be accounted for in this process order.\nGrinding:\nThe clinker is mixed with gypsum and ground to obtain cement.\nHere, costs would include the wear and tear of grinding machinery, labor, and other overheads.\nPacking:\nThe cement is either packed into bags or loaded in bulk, depending on the facility's capabilities.\nCosts captured would be packaging materials, labor, and machinery maintenance.\nMonth End Closing Sequence in Product Costing:\nF-02: Booking of all Financial (FI) expenses to a common cost center.\nCaptures all financial postings that affect costs.\nCPTD: Actual template allocation for other overhead expenses.\nDistributes overhead costs based on pre-defined templates.\nKB31N: Entry of Statistical Key Figures (SKF) to production cost centers.\nThese figures are used as a basis to allocate costs later.\nKSU1: Creation of Assessment Cycle and related Cost Element.\nHelps in redistributing costs among cost centers.\nKSU5: Running the Assessment Cycle.\nThis action redistributes the costs.\nKSS2: Cost Splitting by activity type.\nAllocates costs based on the activity performed.\nKSII: Calculation of actual activity rates.\nDetermines the actual costs of activities.\nCON2: Revaluation of process orders.\nUpdates process orders with the actual activity rates.\nCO43: Overhead calculation.\nComputes the overheads based on pre-defined rates or percentages.\nKKS1: Variance calculation between planned and actual costs.\nIdentifies deviations between what was expected vs. what was incurred.\nCO88: Settles the costs from process orders to financial accounts.\nFinalizes the costing process by posting costs to financial accounting.\nAll these steps ensure accurate capturing, allocation, and finalization of costs associated with the cement manufacturing process in SAP. Implementing this in the SAP S/4 HANA or ECC environment would provide businesses with deep insights into their production costs, helping in pricing, profitability analysis, and cost control.",

Should I save it, pay off debt, or invest it?\nDo you ever look at your bank account and wonder - where did all of my money go?\nDo you look at your savings and think - how I am ever going to buy a home? Or retire someday?\nIf you said YES to even one of these questions, then this is the course for you.\nManaging your money is a skill you need to learn and practice. Unfortunately, most of us aren't taught this at home or at school. It’s something we learn mainly by trial and error, for good and for bad. As a result, many people today, regardless of income, live paycheck to paycheck.\nDoes this sound like you? If so, that’s ok, but know that you can 100% change that. This course is specifically designed to give you the tools and confidence you need to break the paycheck to paycheck cycle.\nGrowing up I saw the good and bad of money management. I saw the impact of losing one’s business, home, and financial security. With that, I learned the tools and money mindset I needed to create financial security for myself and my family - and so can you.\nAs a financial coach, I’ve taken the many lessons I’ve learned and created my 6 Step Financial Priority List. This framework will give you the necessary skills and tools you need to tell your money where to go each month and reach your goals. No more wondering how to save for vacations and for your future. Or wondering, what to do first - save or pay off debt?\nInstead, by the end of this course, you will develop a new money mindset and a new set of money tools. In this course you will:\nGain a clear understanding of your paycheck and where your money is going each month\nMake a clear monthly budget that gives each dollar a job that is aligned with your goals\nGet a clear roadmap for how to prioritize savings and reduce debt\nDiscover 2 effective strategies for paying off debt quickly\nLearn tips for becoming a super saver\nUnderstand the benefits and risks of different saving account options\nFigure out how much you need to save each month to reach your retirement goals\nFeel empowered to make confident financial choices as you pass through different phases of life\nAlong the way, I will provide examples, practice activities, tips, and tools to help you build a financial plan that’s right for you.\nNow is the time to take control of your finances and your future.

Но 30 лет жизни в капиталистическом обществе научили россиян тому, что поиск виноватого вовне не приносит пользы, рассчитывать на щедрую пенсию не стоит, а строить свое финансовое будущее необходимо самостоятельно.\nОсновной проблемой на этом пути является низкий уровень финансовой грамотности. Советская, а затем уже и российская система образования не учит нас базовым навыкам обращения с деньгами, способам инвестирования, основным экономическим понятиям.\nЗаполнять этот пробел можно по-разному: попытаться найти того, кому можно доверить свои деньги; уверовать в советника-гуру, способного предсказать будущее; учиться самостоятельно или с помощью наставника.\nЕсли Вы чувствуете, что пробел в экономических знаниях и умении обращаться с деньгами - это про Вас, то поздравляю, Вы нашли подходящий курс для развития финансовой грамотности!\nПостановка финансовых целей, ведение бюджета, инвестирование в разнообразные финансовые инструменты - все это Вы найдете в данном курсе. Только самое важное, и только с ориентацией на практику\nВы научитесь разбираться в самых распространенных видах инвестирования - банковские депозиты, акции, облигации, драгоценные металлы, инвестиционные фонды, недвижимость, инвестиции в бизнесы\nВ результате прохождения курса Вы сможете:\n- Выбрать брокера и открыть счет (в том числе ИИС)\n- Определить оптимальное соотношение активов (вклады/облигации/акции/золото/другие активы) в вашей ситуации\n- Проанализировать текущее состояние бизнес-цикла, используя макроэкономические показатели\n- С помощью мультипикаторов определять наличие перепроданности/перекупленности акций эмитента\nУзнаете, как не только сохранить капитал, но и преумножить его, обогнав инфляцию\nСформируете представление о рисках различных видов инвестирования и самых распространенных ошибках\nКурс не требует предварительной подготовки, и рассчитан на массовую аудиторию. Курс построен по схеме \"от простого к сложному\", логически упорядочен и может быть освоен в комфортном темпе.\nВперед!",

      "description": "Salah satu pilar dari keberlangsungan bisnis suatu perusahaan adalah pengelolaan dalam aspek keuangan. Uang diperlukan untuk mendanai sebuah usaha, baik untuk kebutuhan operasional (material, tenaga kerja dan overhead) maupun kebutuhan investasi atau pengembangan usaha. Bagaimana sumber-sumber keuangan tersebut, menjadi suatu tantangan bagi manajemen perusahaan untuk mendapatkannya sesuai tujuan perusahaan, yang tentu saja dalam hal ini juga harus memperhatikan apakah tujuan tadi berdimensi dalam jangka pendek ataukah berdimensi dalama jangka panjang. Apabila tujuan keuangan berdimensi jangka panjang, maka sumber perolehan sebaiknya juga berdimensi jangka panjang, demikian sebaliknya. Keterbatasan sumber daya uang yang dimiliki perusahaan menuntut manajemen memiliki kemampuan pengelolaan keuangannya dengan baik. Oleh karena itu, proses pengelolaan keuangan menjadi aspek penting juga guna mencapai tujuan perusahaan secara maksimal, yaitu meningkatkan kesejahteraan pemilik perusahaan.\n\nManajemen keuangan memberikan panduan bagi pengelola yang harus mengambil keputusan di bidang keuangan perusahaan. Langkah-langkah pengelolaan keuangan perusahaan adalah langkah-langkah bagaimana mencari pendanaan (keputusan pembiayaan), bagaimana menanamkan dana yang dimiliki secara layak (keputusan investasi) serta bagaimana mengelola dan mengatur pembagian laba yang diperoleh dari usahanya (keputusan dalam hal dividen).\n\nSelama kursus, peserta akan mempelajari konsep dan prinsip dasar dalam pengelolaan keuangan perusahaan. Mereka akan memahami pentingnya mencari sumber pendanaan yang sesuai dengan tujuan jangka pendek dan jangka panjang perusahaan. Peserta juga akan diajarkan tentang pentingnya melakukan financial forecasting untuk merencanakan kebutuhan keuangan perusahaan di masa depan.\nSelain itu, kursus ini akan membahas tentang bauran modal perusahaan. Peserta akan belajar bagaimana menentukan struktur modal yang tepat, termasuk penggunaan utang dan ekuitas, untuk memenuhi kebutuhan keuangan perusahaan. Mereka juga akan mempelajari konsep pengelolaan aset keuangan perusahaan, termasuk pengelolaan arus kas, investasi, dan pengaturan pembagian laba.\nSelama kursus, peserta akan diberikan studi kasus dan latihan praktis untuk mengasah kemampuan mereka dalam menerapkan konsep-konsep yang dipelajari. Mereka akan belajar bagaimana melakukan analisis keuangan, menginterpretasikan laporan keuangan, dan membuat keputusan berdasarkan informasi keuangan yang relevan.\nDengan menyelesaikan kursus ini, peserta diharapkan dapat memahami prinsip-prinsip pengelolaan keuangan dalam konteks perusahaan. Mereka akan mampu melakukan financial forecasting, menentukan bauran modal yang sesuai, mengelola aset keuangan perusahaan, dan memahami dasar-dasar capital budgeting. Peserta akan memiliki pemahaman yang lebih baik tentang bagaimana pengelolaan keuangan yang efektif dapat berkontribusi pada keberhasilan dan kesejahteraan pemilik perusahaan.",

By understanding and applying leverage effectively, businesses can accelerate their growth and financial success. Throughout the course, we will explore the concepts of operating leverage, financial leverage, and combined leverage, providing practical practice problems that reinforce these critical concepts.\nBreak-even analysis is a fundamental tool in decision-making, enabling us to assess the point at which costs and revenues are in equilibrium. You will gain a deep understanding of break-even analysis, including the categorization of costs as fixed costs and variable costs based on their behavior. This approach, though different from the traditional functional categorization, allows us to assess cost changes in relation to production levels and make informed projections for the future.\nWe will guide you through the calculation of the break-even point and the cash break-even point, offering insights into nonlinear break-even analysis. You will develop proficiency in utilizing these tools to evaluate financial performance, assess risk, and make strategic decisions.\nThroughout the course, you will encounter numerous practice problems, many of which include downloadable Excel worksheets. Each Excel worksheet will consist of at least two tabs—one with the answer key and the other preformatted to facilitate step-by-step practice along with instructional videos. This hands-on approach will enhance your learning experience and provide practical application of leverage and break-even analysis concepts.\nJoin us on this dynamic journey to master leverage and break-even analysis in corporate finance. Enroll today to develop the skills to optimize decision-making, leverage resources effectively, and evaluate financial breakeven points for growth and profitability. By the end of the course, you will be equipped to make informed decisions that drive financial success in a competitive business environment.",

      "description": "Welcome to the first ever Udemy course on the primary topic of Money Management!\nThis course will perhaps be viewed by some as Personal Finance Management, but the way this course addresses various aspects is very different, and we think the term Money Management fits the topic more accurately.\nThere are roughly 200 courses here in Udemy whose primary topic is personal finance. These courses cover a wide range of topics, from everyday budgeting and small savings habits to complex investment strategies and estate planning.\nWhile one course focuses on saving, protecting and making money, another covers budgeting, saving and investing, retirement planning, insurance, and tax planning.\nYet another course provides tools and knowledge on how to grow income, reduce debt, budget effectively and invest wisely.\nWe Understand our Money in our Own Way\nThese topics are quite important, but perhaps many of us don’t quite think about our money this way at the outset. For instance, if you are an employee who depends on a salary, it means you receive money - say at the beginning of the month - you will spend some of it, save some of it and perhaps invest some of it. While you try to keep track of your money, you may really not know where your money goes!\nMany of my friends and colleagues find themselves in such a situation. They've tried various ways to keep track – some ideas have worked, but some haven’t worked as expected, and some haven’t worked at all.\nThis was the situation for my wife and I many years ago before we embarked on money management. We gradually realized that because we understand our money in our own way, we needed something that helped us manage our money in our own way!\nGetting the Big Picture\nThis is where the course Money Management for Beginners comes into play. This is meant for people like us – someone who understands a bit of money, some financial terms, tracks it here and there, and feels the need for the larger picture, and a way to tie various things together.\nOnce you get an overall picture and a bit of structure around managing money, you will see how much easier it is to holistically track your money flow, because you intuitively can understand topics like expense tracking, budgeting, saving, investing, retirement planning, insurance, and several other topics, and how they fit together in the big picture.\nWhat you'll Learn\nThe Money Management for Beginners course first talks about what money management is and paints a picture of your money world. You will then learn and understand a simple Money Tracking Framework which shows various ways you can track your money, and the merits and demerits of each.\nIt then talks about the kinds of financial activities you do on a daily basis, and why it is important to achieve a certain level of familiarity with tracking these activities to understand better how your money flows.\nThis naturally leads to a Financial Planning Framework which intuitively helps in understanding your financial needs. You will then understand a simple concept which helps specify your needs and the ways to achieve your goals. Afterwards, you will learn about the various investment options available, how to track each investment you make, track how they are performing, and determine if it is the right time to withdraw / book profits.\nAll these can help you make informed financial decisions.\nExamining the Needs for Different Personas\nTo show how the Money Tracking and Financial Planning frameworks work together seamlessly, the course examines the financial needs of three different personas with varying needs, develops their financial plans and shows how money can be managed in a simple way, and how one can make informed financial decisions.\nYou will then see that all of these elements fit together to form the Money Management Framework. In fact, you can easily extend the framework to cover your specific needs because by this time you would have understood the larger picture and how various pieces fit in!\nWealth Advisors\nThe course lastly talks about wealth advisors briefly, the way they view your money (not the same as how you view your money) and how they work with you, how they can play a role in your financial plans and provides some pointers on how you can avail their services. Most importantly, how you can retain control because you understand the big picture.\nTake away\nThe way you view your money, and how someone else views your money is not the same. By taking this course, you will realize that you must take the trouble to understand your money because your money is unique to you.\nOnce you get a holistic picture, you can engage a wealth advisor or can take any specialized personal finance course that you need, use any app and yet retain control since you will understand your money far better and because you have an intuitive reference point.\nThank you for considering this course!\n*** Note ***\nMuch of the content is general, but some specific content in this course considers the financial setup in India. Similar setups exist across the world; it is a matter of a little bit of copilot / ChatGPT or googling to get specifics for your country.\nAbout Us\nMy wife and I are very passionate about finance, and on the side, the hobby that we have nurtured over the years is to gain an understanding of how money flows through our family by virtue of our spending, saving and investing habits. We would like to share our experiences and method so that people can make informed financial decisions.",

        "Those who want more clarity about where their money went.",
