      "description": "Welcome to the course on \" How to Take Care of Your Hands & How to Get Soft Hands\"\n\n\nWhether it's with a handshake or a friendly wave, your hands can make a very strong first impression. That's why you want them to be soft, smooth, and as healthy as possible. Taking care of them may seem easy, but you want to be sure that you're using the right products to wash and moisturize them so the skin doesn't get dry and cracked. It's also important to protect your hands from things that can irritate them, such as the sun, water, and household chores.\nCold temperatures and frequent use can have your soft skin looking like the Grand Canyon in the middle of winter -- though, your hands can get rough in any season. To get soft hands regardless of the time of year, you'll need to treat existing dryness with lotions, natural oils, sugar scrubs, protective coverings, and the occasional deep-conditioning salve. You should also prevent your newly softened hands from getting rough by switching to gentle hand soaps, avoiding hot water, staying hydrated, and wearing gloves to avoid exposure to drying elements. Soft hands look and feel fantastic, and are easy to get for nearly everyone willing to put in the effort.\nWhen you have dry, rough hands, lotion and cream alone may not be enough to heal your skin. Using a hand mask can deliver more intense hydration and allow soothing ingredients time to really calm irritated skin. You don't need to purchase an expensive mask from the store, though. Make your own at home with ingredients that you already have in your kitchen. You can create a simple mask with just two ingredients, mix up one that helps lighten age spots and other discolorations, prepare a highly moisturizing mask with avocado, or use oats to create an exfoliating hand mask.\n\n\nSo, Let's get started!",

The “Duck Hunting for Beginners” course is just for you.\nMany duck hunters have spent hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on hunting supplies and hours driving around, setting up decoys but then having ducks fly by without even taking a 2nd look or not seeing any ducks at all.  Unfortunately, that is the experience that many duck hunters have.\nWhether you are new to duck hunting or you have been duck hunting without much success, “Duck Hunting for Beginners” can get you bagging more ducks FAST!   We would all like to shoot more ducks. The trick is to know how to use the wind to your advantage, the most effective ways to setup duck decoys, when to go duck hunting, how to find where the ducks are and how to make proper shot placement. “Duck Hunting for Beginners” can help you with all of these common issues.\nYou see, the problem is most other educational duck products and duck hunting books speak to you as if you have been hunting for 50 years and are written in a way that expects you to already have duck hunting knowledge so they leave out the details that you could really learn from.\nIn addition, most duck hunting products do not provide actionable tips meaning they often tell stories about how their duck hunting trip went and who they went hunting with so they are more of a story based product leaving you with little if anything actually learned…\n\nThis “Duck Hunting for Beginners” course is completely different where you will get detailed steps on how to improve your duck hunting skills without the fluff like “here is what my duck hunting trip was like back in 1969.” You see times have changed and people do not always have someone who is willing to show them how to duck hunt.\nAdditionally, many experienced hunters hold back sharing their “secrets” as they feel that you should have to struggle to learn on your own.  Unfortunately, that is not good for you or the sport of duck hunting.\nThat is why I created this \"Duck Hunting for Beginners\" course so you can simply watch these easy to understand videos and quickly get a good grasp of many of the duck hunting basics. Then you can keep learning and gain years worth of duck hunting knowledge in just a short period of time. In this course you get detailed yet simple to understand videos that show you exactly how to setup your decoys, how to effectively conceal yourself and how to use the wind and sun to your benefit.\n\nI explain each duck hunting tactic in detail so you can understand the exact strategy used every time.\nSo if you are looking to jump start your duck hunting success, learn some new tactics or get a refresher on effective duck hunting strategies then join \"Duck Hunting for Beginners\" and get the knowledge you need to start bagging more ducks!\n\n\nHere are the topics that are covered in “Duck Hunting for Beginners”.\nSection 1: Duck Hunting for Beginners: Duck Hunting 101, The Basics\nUnderstanding Wind Direction\nConcealment & Blind Placement\nGear\nShotguns\nShotgun Shells\nShooting Techniques\nSelecting a Duck Call\nBasic Decoy Spreads for Ducks\n\n\nSection 2 : Duck Hunting for Beginners: Duck Hunting 102, Supercharging Your Success\nHow to Find Ducks\nWhat time to go Duck Hunting\nUnderstanding the Duck Hunting Seasons\nShooting Distance\nDecoy Spread Size\nGetting the Ducks to Come in Close\n\n\nSection 3: Duck Hunting for Beginners: Duck Hunting 103, Advanced Decoying Strategies & Duck Hunting Decoy Tips\nDecoy Types\nAdding Confidence Decoys\nHunting Without Decoys\nImpact of Weather on Decoy Setup\nProper Distance Between Decoys\nFacing Your Decoys Effectively\nAdjusting your Decoy Spread\nHow to Hunt From Standing Crops",

      "description": "Do you know what colors work for you? When you’re shopping for the ultimate dress the color can really make a difference. But do you pick a color, fabric or pattern that suits you as a person? Or is the reason for buying your new favorite item because it has a color or pattern that you didn't have yet? Wouldn’t it be great and make your life a lot easier when you know what colors suit you well, and which colors to avoid? We have all had a moment when a friend is wearing something that doesn’t bring out the best in her. The color she is wearing is not bringing out the best in her, but it's taking the attention away from her face. Or worse; it makes her look older or tired. The point of knowing your colors is that your face will be the center of your outfit. People will look at your face, the message you are sending and your energy. So people won't say; ''what a great dress''; but; ''you look really well rested, fresh and radiant!''.\nStyling an outfit can be daunting. You see people on Instagram or Pinterest and you wonder; how do they come up with these ideas? Do you have to be extremely creative to create a fun outfit? Ofcourse, there is a certain level of creativity involved in creating your perfect outfit. However, there is a science behind it as well. I’m a very practical person and I would like to give you tools, tricks and tips to really dive deep into this subject.

Maybe you choose this course because you would like to expand your knowledge about styling for your profession or pursue it as a passion.\nYou can see this course as investment in yourself. This information which will help you gain insight into the colors that work best for you.

      "description": "Tulpamancy is the art of creating a sentient, separate consciousness using the power of the mind through focus and intention. The modern practice of tulpamancy emerged in the first decade of the 2000’s over the Internet, with individuals taking meditative and spiritual practices and employing those methods to create autonomous entities existing within the mind of the practitioner. These “tulpamancers” created independent and separate consciousness that act alongside their own thought process. The community of tulpamancers continues to grow today, pushing the definition and understanding of identity and what it means to be conscious.\n\nBy combining research, psychological theories and anecdotes of a tulpamancer, this class allows students who are new to the practice or experienced in tulpamancy to explore the psychology that allow tulpas to exist as separate and independent conscious beings as well as the history, validity and positive impact of the practice felt by all tulpamancers.\nThis course walks the student through the process of creating a tulpa from brainstorming to full development.\n31 lectures with additional materials, exercises and questions!\nThis course covers many topics including: The history of tulpamancy, Modern tulpamancy, Mechanics of tulpamancy, Pertinent psychology, Defining consciousness, Creating a tulpa, Personality, Appearance, The Wonderland/Mindscape, Switching, Fronting, Mindvoice, Tulpish, Studies on Tulpamancy, Imposition, Personality deviation, Disagreements between tulpa and host, Differences between DID and tulpamancy, Meditation, And other topics",

Creating a hair care routine is easy and involves maintaining the health of your hair and applying beneficial products to your hair. Luckily, your hair doesn't always need attention every day, and many things in a hair care routine can be done only once or twice a week.\nAnd Curly hair requires some special considerations when it comes to care. Curly hair tends to be drier and more prone to tangles than straight hair, so you'll have to be careful about washing, conditioning, and styling your hair. You should limit how often you shampoo, and use products to keep your hair moisturized. When visiting a salon, make sure you request a dry cut and only cut your hair when necessary.\nNatural curls look amazing if you wear them the right way. Curly hair takes a lot of care, but looks great when you're finished. So put away the flat iron and embrace your curls.\nGetting volume at your roots is a great way to take your hair do from flat to fabulous!

It covers the topics of fine dining, wine knowledge, hosting private dinner parties, dining etiquette and table manners (5 lessons), and English Afternoon Tea etiquette.  The course focuses on fine dining. However, one can apply these etiquettes to all dining occasions.\nMany people are not aware that when sitting down at a dining table, it is not only a test of one's table manners but also his/her communication skills and poise. Dining is not eating, whether at home or at a restaurant, it is social, involving some social skills, interaction with other people and servers. Nowadays, some interviews are conducted in a restaurant because employers want to hire people with excellent communication skills.\nEnglish afternoon tea also falls under the category of fine dining so we have included it. Afternoon tea expert Ms Ellen shares tea etiquette and demonstrates how to enjoy your cuppa elegantly. This section is really a treat and a demonstration of the beauty of the British etiquette and the British culture.\nSo the course is not only teaching how to use a knife and fork,  it is indeed a lesson of communication skills, poise and elegance.",

It is, however, survival spec, and as of today (current), significantly enhances your prospect of surviving even the most horrendous survival situations. No survival can be guaranteed, even for the best, but as said, this course provides you with the latest and greatest knowledge of Urban Survival within the industry.\n\n\n- This course is designed as a Survival System, and is intended to be undertaken in the order it has been composed in. Of course, no Survival Situation presents itself as a system, but rather, a unique event or set of events that requires you to conform and adapt your skills and knowledge accordingly. Again, it is just this course given to you as a Survival System for the purpose of learning effectively, but survival will only ever require that you use that system to incorporate its unique approaches and methodologies to any situation you may face, which situation will always require a special approach.",

      "description": "Genealogy is such an absorbing pastime that most of us don't get organized until we’re buried in information, legends, vital statistics, phantom relatives, and all of the vast hodgepodge of documents we find.\nIn \"The Organized Genealogist,\" one of our \"Everything Olde is New Again!\" series of genealogy courses, you'll learn how to navigate through the obstacles most of us run into sooner or later. In this course, you'll unravel the maze of forms and fundamentals to help you organize your research.\nGet and keep your genealogy research under control whether you are just starting this adventure, or a seasoned family historian.\nWhen two pieces of information disagree, you'll have a way to determine which is more likely to be correct? You'll know where you found your ancestry information and have a better idea of it's accuracy.\nGet organized and stay organized with:\nFamily data tracking forms\nCommon searches to find basic genealogy evidence\nWhat to look for on primary and secondary evidence\nHow to spot errors, even on official documents\nWhat's a third cousin twice removed\nGenealogy filing systems\nAncestral numbering systems\nEasy citations\nCopyright violations to avoid\nSpend your time researching and discovering, not retracing\nAvoid wracking your memory. You'll have your research all written down, and nicely organized. You'll be able to find those sites you didn't think you'll ever need again.\nYou'll have access to examples of the types of inaccuracies you might come across, even in official documents. But YOU won't get discouraged by these because you'll know how to manage that information. More importantly, you'll learn techniques for analyzing conflicting information, or how to uncover previously elusive information (or ancestors.)\nContent and Overview\nI designed this course because I learned, personally, what a mess all these documents and artifacts could become.\nYou'll learn:\nWhere to find forms at no cost, including one interactive set designed in Excel\nHow to fill out the forms using common records.\nWhere to look for records\nHow to distinguish between primary, secondary and best evidence\nWhat is considered proof\nHow to connect the dots between different pieces of evidence\nHow to make use of incorrect information found on official documents\nWhat numbering systems are and how to use them\nWhy you don't mix your mom's family photos with your dad's\nHow copyright law affects your decisions to share what you find\nYou'll, also, get a full 53-page textbook with links to every site we visit, downloads and assignments for practice and discussion.\nAnd you will learn enough to be able to determine whether or not you really are related to Kevin Bacon. Isn't everyone?\nWhat my classroom students say about my genealogy courses ~\nExceeded my expectations. Micki was a wonderful instructor who came to class with years of research experience which she shared with us. I found her to be very encouraging and very helpful and was generous with help even when class wasn’t in session. ~ Allenda Elam\nLearned useful ways to approach brick walls. ~ William Sadler\nWonderful Class. I’d like to take it again. ~ Nancy Copple\nThe course was great. ~ Anonymous\nI am very pleased with the guidance course materials and helpfulness of the instructor. ~ Glen Crain\nReally appreciate your research, printed and DVD package. ~ Bonnie Sadler",

In fact, you should be teaching this course instead of me."

Hi rents, expensive mortgages, loss of income and so many other things are catapulting many into uncertainty and worry. I found myself in the same boat as so very many others, looking for alternative ways to not only survive but thrive. As a former city lover and semi bourgeois diva it was no small thing for me to decide to buy land and live rurally. The call was strong and my need for rest and release from the hustle and bustle was acute. It became quite apparent that the American dream was no longer truly attainable nor sustainable. From a wellness perspective, working dead end jobs and laboring endlessly and tirelessly in the name of material goods is no road to true happiness. My health mentally and physically was taking a beating from the constant stress to achieve \"success\". You will learn in this course that there is another way, another road to joy and freedom. Buying land and establishing some level of sovereignty is I've found the answer to many of our prayers. I know that it might seem foreign but I assure you our ancestors lived on the land, took care of the land and the land took care of them. Not to mention technology is such now that it can only assist in the designing of a newer lifestyle that is filled with ease and solace. This course simply invites you to explore the fundamentals of buying land and creating a rural lifestyle and how this can change your future for the better.",

Is your horse coming back from rest and you need exercises to ease them back into their riding routines? Or maybe you want step by step guidance as to how to correctly warm up your horse to prepare for your next show.\nIf any of these sound familiar then the Perfect Warmup Workshop is for you!\n\n\nIn this course you will learn:\nwarmup exercises for lazy and hot horses\nfun games to play with your horse to get them loosened up, stretched, relaxed and in a positive attitude ready for your main session, dressage test, jumping course or show.\nwhy the warmup is so important and the biggest mistake many riders are making\na unique way to warm up with step by step instruction no matter where in the world you live!\nFinally put an end to the most agonizingly predictable part of your rides... the Warm Up!\n\n\nWhat is the Perfect Warm Up Workshop?\nA few months ago, I hosted a very special 2 Day Virtual Workshop for my students found in my programs with The International Equestrian. This was a live in-class training (Just like a Clinic but done virtually from home) which I hosted for my students and it was such a success that now I'm sharing this same workshop with you here!\nWhy you should enroll in the Perfect Warm Up Workshop?\nRight now, the amount of “noise” and mixed information on your news feed is greater than ever before, and with new \"online horse guru's\" and different social media platforms on the rise… it’s getting harder and harder for equestrians to know who the real experts are and what training methods to use.\n\nThe equestrian industry has never seen such an overflow of instant information and it doesn’t matter if you’re trying to master not bouncing in the saddle or perfecting 5ft fences and canter pirouettes, the inconsistent information online has reached an all time high.\nLet's be real though.\nEven in \"normal times\" horse riding has never been easy! It requires a lot of balance, mental strength, training, fortitude, determination and skill.\nMastering the Art of Riding can be\nINTIMIDATING\nFor most people, riding is both exhilarating and terrifying.It’s a mixed bag of feelings…\n… if the stars and planets align, your horse and you feel like \"one.\"… if they don’t, your lying face down in the dirt wondering what went wrong.\nIt feels a bit like gambling with your emotions.\nSome days you're on top of the world, others you're questioning your abilities and why spend so much time and money on a hobby that doesn't seem to love you back.\nIf you've been riding horses for more than a day, you know how hard it can be to get it right.\nWhich Is Why I Created this Perfect Warmup Workshop for You! To break the glass ceilings, unravel the misconceptions and give you the knowledge and tools you need to succeed.\n\n\nThere are HUNDREDS of micro-decisions we have to make every single time we step into the saddle.\nIs my leg too far forward?\nIs my horse on the correct bend?\nShould I do another circle?\nIs this a good rhythm to approach the next jump?\nAre my hands applying too much pressure?\nWas that a good enough half halt?\nIs my horse pushing from behind?\nThese are the Million Dollar Questions!\nBecause they can be the difference between a horse-rider combination that \"CLICKS\"… and one that takes forever to warm up and find your stride.\n\nWith so much potential for…\nfailed dressage tests or jumping courses, rails down, and expensive training fees,\n…who wants to bet their whole ride on doing the same old same old, hoping that today's ride things MAY OR MAY NOT work?\nIf the thought of losing time, energy, and draining your money on gadgets and things that clearly don't work, leaves you feeling helpless, vulnerable, and a little nauseous...\n\n\nI CAN HELP!\nMy name is FEI II Coach, Krystal Kelly.\nWith over 17 Years Experience Coaching My Private Clients… Riding & Training Horses worth well over $100,000…\nAnd teaching over 10,000+ horse owners how to successfully get sticky butts in the saddle, master the art of speaking the horse language and progressing in their riding. I promise, I’ve seen and done it all!\n\n\nMy methodology is a mixture of:\nSCIENCE & BIOMECHANICS + MINDSET + MUSCLE MEMORY DEVELOPMENT\nand once you’re in the International Equestrian Club, you’ll get the benefit of all the wisdom and knowledge I’ve developed over the years!\nSo what are you waiting for?

When I was 12 years old I got my first Fly Rod (the WalMart Special) and after spending hours online and on YouTube I discovered that there was far too much scattered information and the videos on YouTube were too disconnected to make sense of as a whole.\nThe Fly Rod went into storage for almost a decade. When I moved next to a Blue Ribbon River (in other words a really good fly fishing river) a few years later I decided that I was going to tackle it once and for all. I went out on the river all by myself, every day, for three weeks straight and didn't catch a single thing! I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Finally I ran into a few guides on the river who were kind enough to show me some basics and I have been fly fishing ever since.\nI promised myself that I would pay forward the kindness of those guides and that's why I have made this course. I hope you will enjoy learning the art of fly fishing and pay it forward as well!",

        "This course is for begining to intermediate fly fishers.  You do not need to have any previous fishing experience or gear. We will teach you all of that here.  If you think fish are \"icky\" or think fly fishing is stupid this course is probably not for you."

People who watch children should be professionally trained.\"\nIn this course you will learn how to become a great babysitter that any child will love to have and that parents will want to keep calling back again and again.\nCourse Description\nDo you think babysitting for years is all that it takes to be great? Unfortunately the answer is A BIG NO. Experts just simply don't agree to this analogy at all. As per child safety experts, having raised one's own children is no criteria for being good at babysitting other children. Babysitters must be professionally trained.\nThis is what we kept in mind while designing this course for you in the most professional manner. It's just two hours of training that will turn you into the most loved and called for babysitter.\nWhat Are the requirements\nAudio understanding of spoken English.\nWhat Do you Get from This course\nThe course has been designed to prepare a baby sitter for any eventuality, situation or contingency in babysitting. The content is the outcome of extensive research by our panel of childcare, pediatric and child safety experts. The course delivers to you:\nOver 16 lectures and 1.5 hours of content!\nProvide basic first aid to children and teenagers,\nCare for multiple children at once,\nWhat is the target audience?\nNovice or amateur babysitters desiring to turn professional.

The course is predominantly video based, with detailed descriptions and demonstrations of all the operations you will need to perform to understand your saw and keep it in top working order, whatever duty you put it through. The course will take about four hours to view all material from start to finish but it is designed to be modular so that you can use each individual lecture as a \"how to\" before you go ahead and perform each job on your own saw yourself. The course is split into five main teaching sections and introduces you to a course overview, the right Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), how to select the tools for your job, each individual maintenance process on the saw and a specific section devoted to chain care, maintenance and sharpening. There are quizzes in each section to help you check your progress and by the end of the course you will have covered a syllabus which professional chainsaw operators have to fulfil to successfully pass a UK industry standard assessment in chainsaw maintenance. Over the life of a saw, this knowledge will save you more money in maintenance than the saw costs to buy new and will ensure you are capable of extracting the highest cutting performance, accuracy and quality possible from your machine.",

Equally the course is ideal as a brush up for anyone with existing maintenance skills.The course is not for anyone with a non running machine and there are no pre entry requirements. If you can hold a spanner, this course is for you."

Best of all you: DON'T need any fancy equipment or a lab and you can make salves with ingredients you may already have or that are cheap and affordable and with equipment you definitely already have!\nMaking your own salves, creams and lotions is easy and doesn't need to be intimidating, I'll share my knowledge starting from the history of salves and teach you everything from the successful creation of salves and even go onto teach you how to create a business selling salves, balms and ointments just as I have.",

      "description": "'I have lots of clothes but I prefer wearing few of my favorites over and over again'\n'I don't know how to mix and match which is why I end up with the same looks'\n'I am not sure which colours suit me better'\n'I don't have a clear differentiation between my social and work wear'\n'My clothes don't flatter my body type'\n'I spend money on my wardrobe but still my clothes don't make me stand out'\n'I have no clue which styles suit my personality'\n'I have never bothered about my dressing so I'm on ground zero'\n'My wardrobe is outdated and boring'\nIf any of these statements sound familiar to you, then this course is for you.\nWhat if I told you that people don't just dress for style, but also for psychological reasons? In this course, you can expect to learn the art and psychology behind styling and creative dressing. Why do some colours look good on us while some others don't? Why do some clothing styles flatter our body type while others make us look unappealing? What is personal style and why is it so important to understand our own style in order to learn dressing? Is it possible to do a wardrobe revamp at home without spending any money? All this and much more learning coming your way through this course.\nOften times the problem is not getting information, but it is the overwhelming and conflicting information that confuses us while trying to self learn dressing techniques. What's worse, appearance playing a significant role in our lives is not taught to us during our early foundational years. So my main aim in this course is to provide you with a step by step learning mechanism so that you understand styling the organic way. I have also designed this course with an assumption that you are excited to first explore your own wardrobe and shop as many looks from your own closet, before venturing out shopping!\nI am known for styling one garment in multiple interesting ways because it satiates my creative impulses, and I love sharing my mantra with others because the spark I see on their faces when I create stylish looks from their own wardrobe is truly a heart warming sight!\nThis course is divided into 5 specific modules:\n1. Identify your personal style through a perfect personal style analysis\n2. Learn how to do your own professional wardrobe audit\n3. Learn the science and art of colours in clothes, and identify which colours suit your skin tone\n4. Identify your body shape and dress exactly as per your body needs\n5. 5 step process to learn how to mix n match and convert your simple clothes into the most exciting outfits suiting all your lifestyle occasions\nFor the first time in this course, I am disclosing my secret mantra on how to literally triple your wardrobe with a limited set of clothes.\n+ BONUS\nBy the end of module 5, I have shown a real client's wardrobe and how I helped her shop from her own closet using  my 5 step clustering process. So yes it works!\nMy goals for you are crystal clear:\nBy the end of this course, you will:\n- Identify your personal style range and start dressing appropriately according to your lifestyle occasions\n- Filter your complete wardrobe and divide it into clear categories and approach all these categories accordingly\n- Learn the best colors that suit your skin tone\n- Learn about a variety of colours and their characteristics for more informed choices while dressing up\n- Identify your own body shape and avoid making mistakes that highlight your problem areas\n- Guaranteed! Get three times the looks from a limited wardrobe if you follow my 5 step clustering process to create multiple looks\n- Have outfits for all your important regular lifestyle occasions\nThis course is for anyone who wants to learn how to take complete charge of her wardrobe and styling needs!",

Experience the benefits of yoga combined with those of qigong! After over twenty years of doing yoga, I increasingly added in qigong and energy medicine movements to my yoga asanas to achieve amazing results in my well-being, serenity, and bliss. Now I want to share my unique yoga qigong fusion with you.\nEach video contains yoga poses combined with qigong movements to increase the flow of positive energy: through your body, around you, and within you. Gentle yet potent, each practice opens your body up to more self-healing, health and wellness. Practice a qigong yoga fusion video daily with deep, slow breathing to see the best results. When you breathe in, feel the belly become bigger and then your lungs to expand. Inflate your lungs like balloons- forward, backward, and into your side body as well. Deepening the breath and maintaining a deep breathing pattern while doing the movements takes time and attention. Be patient with yourself and keep returning your attention to your breath, eventually linking breath with movement.\nThe practices become very meditative and increase in their potency with repetition.\nOver time, as you repeat the practices and become more comfortable with the movements, you can close your eyes and bring your attention more and more to the energy flowing. You will quiet the mind, increasing first your body awareness and then your connection with your higher-self or 'soul essence'.",

      "description": "\"Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward. For there you have been, and there you will always long to return.\"\nLeonardo da Vinci.\nFlight Training can be very slow and expensive. Whether you fly as a student or fly as an experienced pilot, every hour of flight costs you loads of money. You don’t have much control. Well with VR Flight sim you gain the control. You set yourself up once and practice whenever you want and for as long as you want. Let me be your guide into the VR World. Start learning what you need to know.\nThe USAF train their jet fighter pilots with the VR headset and the controllers. If it is good enough for the airforce it must be good...and it certainly is.\nThe World really is your affordable oyster with your computer and flight sim programme. Today the airforce flies drone attack aircraft anywhere in the world from base stations thousands of miles away. Anyone can now afford to learn fly anywhere in the world day or night in real time conditions including the weather. A pilot has to plan his or her route, assessment of weather conditions and terrain clearance. This course teaches you what you need to know to navigate your Cessna 172 around the world VFR. It goes far beyond the abilities of the pocket for flying in the real world. Also you are flying the latest brand new Cessna 172 with state of the art Avionics, not some rattling old noisy rental plane with minimal equipment.\nWhy spend thousands at a flying school when you can learn for free? This course helps you to decide on spending huge amounts of cash on a pilots licence or not!\nFor this beginner course you will need a computer and a joystick, (rudder pedals are not necessary but are also recommended) and a flight sim programme such as a cessna 172. Microsoft flight sim and X plane 11 are good ones for example.\nIt also teaches you things that can catch you out in total safety.",

      "description": "Emotional Intelligence is more than just a popular concept; it is one of the most critical skills you can develop to succeed in every aspect of life. While IQ and technical knowledge may help you get started in your career, it is your emotional intelligence (EQ) that will determine how far you can go in your personal growth, your relationships, and your professional success. In this comprehensive course on Emotional Intelligence, you will learn step-by-step how to recognize, understand, and manage emotions, while also building the essential communication and interpersonal skills that today’s world demands.\nThis course is built around the five key pillars of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. You will begin by developing self-awareness; understanding your emotional triggers, your strengths, and your blind spots. From there, you’ll move on to self-regulation, where you’ll gain strategies to manage stress, control negative emotions, and respond instead of reacting impulsively. These lessons are not only vital for personal development but also for maintaining balance in high-pressure environments.\nNext, you’ll explore the role of motivation and how intrinsic drive can help you stay focused on your goals, even during setbacks. You’ll also learn how to cultivate empathy, one of the most powerful emotional intelligence skills, which allows you to understand others’ perspectives and build trust in both personal and professional relationships. Finally, we will focus on social skills and communication, helping you strengthen relationships, resolve conflicts, and inspire others through authentic leadership.\nWhat makes this course especially practical is its focus on real-world application. You will see how emotional intelligence improves workplace performance, enhances leadership, and supports team collaboration. You’ll gain tools to handle difficult conversations, give and receive feedback effectively, and manage conflict with confidence. Whether you are a manager, team leader, entrepreneur, or simply someone who wants to improve your personal relationships, these lessons will help you thrive.\nEmotional intelligence is also essential for mental health and stress management. In this course, we will cover practical techniques for staying calm under pressure, building resilience, and developing a positive mindset that supports long-term success. These tools will allow you to perform better in your career, while also improving your personal well-being and happiness.\nThis course is designed for anyone who wants to improve their communication skills, build stronger relationships, and achieve personal and professional growth. It is especially valuable for business professionals, managers, coaches, leaders, entrepreneurs, and anyone in customer-facing or people-oriented roles. No previous knowledge is required—just a willingness to learn, reflect, and practice.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a clear understanding of emotional intelligence and how to apply it in everyday life. You will walk away with practical strategies for developing empathy, improving communication, resolving conflicts, and becoming a more confident, resilient, and effective leader. With these skills, you will be able to build stronger connections, make smarter decisions, and unlock your full potential in both your career and personal life.\nNow is the perfect time to invest in your emotional intelligence.

I will tell you how not to lose hope and how your feelings will help you cope with any difficult situations that may happen to you. I will help you learn to control your emotions, feel your inner feelings and fears and overcome them. And I will also help you focus on your inner feelings and all the needs that you need. Identifying emotions involves recognizing and labeling the emotions that you experience. It is the first step in becoming emotionally aware and understanding the impact of emotions on your life.\nTo identify emotions, you can focus on the physical, behavioral, and cognitive signs that accompany them. Some common physical signs of emotions include changes in heart rate, breathing, and muscle tension. Behavioral signs can include changes in facial expressions, body language, and actions. Cognitive signs can include changes in thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes. This is my course about the victory of light over darkness. A course called How to manage your feelings in a difficult life situation. I will talk about how quickly a person adapts to different situations and what great potential he has.

      "description": "Shinrin-yoku or forest bathing is a japanese practice discovered in the 80’s that started as a scientific investigation about the effects of nature on humans. They discovered a lot of benefits on human immersions in nature, and as a consequence this practice has become a therapeutic exercise. Today in Japan there are more than 60 certified trails and between 2 and 3 million people practice Shinrin Yoku on a regular basis.\nJoin Manuela Siegfried in Sensoria Costa Rica and let us introduce you to the world of forest bathing in a unique way. Immerse yourself into the jungles of Costa Rica with Sensoria Life Courses. Manuela will guide you through everything you need to know about this practice. You will gain another perspective about nature and the relationship we have with it.\nThis course includes a theory chapter that explains what this practice is, the history, the benefits and more. In the next chapter Manuela will guide you through Sensoria Costa Rica doing a demonstration of how forest bathing is practiced. Forest Bathing in sensoria is considered as top 20 things to do in Costa Rica according to Timeout. And last chapter is about doing forest bathing on your own from anywhere at anytime in the world.\n\n\nAbout Manuela:\nManuela Siegfried was born and raised in this beautiful, bio diverse country called Costa Rica. Having a biologist as a father, made contact with nature an intrinsic part of her life. This passion led her to work as a naturalist tourism guide for 3 years. She came across the concept of Shinrin-Yoku and the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy and immediately felt inspired and related to it.\nManuela was trained and certified in 2018 and has been guiding very actively since then. She is passionate about helping people awaken their senses and slowing down in a natural setting so they can reconnect with themselves and the more than human world. Falling in love again with the natural world helps to rediscover our intimate, personal relationship with the forest and we become aware that we actually ARE nature.\nManuela is also a mentor and trainer of guides with the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy and is absolutely committed and in love with her job.",

During the course, you are expected to perform the skills and practice maneuvers after examples are given. You are also given the option to upload your flight videos for the instructor to comment. You will be expected to buy a flight stick (joystick) or flight yoke and Flight Simulator X or 2004 to be able to practice the skills for flying an airplane.\nEverything from startup checklists, taxi to the active runway, maneuvers in the air and land without crashing is covered. At the end, a PC Pilot Solo Certificate is issued by the Instructor. There are two follow-on courses after this, Intermediate and Advanced, where you will get your PC Pilot Certificate.\nSkills learned here can be used to accelerate your real pilot training progress.",

      "description": "A step-by-step guide to Instagram for over sixties (or anyone looking for Instagram lessons that just make sense!)\nWe’re Danni and Ané, and our parents used to ask us questions about Instagram almost weekly. 'How do I post a video?' 'How do I share a post in my story?' 'What’s the difference between a post and a story?' 'How do these people make these beautiful reels?' 'What on earth is a reel?'\n\n\nThat got us thinking: are we taking our Instagram knowledge for granted?\nWe asked around, and the answer was a hard YES. We realised that a lot of the golden oldies around us are hearing about Instagram, or even looking through it, and are longing to learn how to use it.\nTheir kids have busy lives and don’t have the time or patience to teach them.\nOur first thought? That’s an absolute shame. Because you have been alive for a long time, which means two things:\n1. You've put  off making your mark on the world for a long time\n2. You have magnificent stories to tell (and only you can tell them!)\nSo we put together this course for you. Now, instead of asking your kids or your grandkids to teach you how to use Instagram, you can surprise them with a beautifully crafted short film (read: reel) and smile coyly when they’re astonished.\nListen, here’s what we know to be true: you see the world through a unique lens. And you deserve to tell stories through that lens, even if it’s just for you. Even if it’s just to learn something new. Even if it’s just to make your loved ones proud of you.\nActually, even if it’s just to make you proud of you.\n\n\nNow, you might be saying one of these things:\n\n\nI don’t have time for a course\nOh, but you do! It’s just under an hour long, and each lesson is under 4 minutes (well, except one that's just under 5 minutes). And you can take as long as you need – in fact, we encourage it!\nI’ll feel out of depth with such young teachers\nWe promise you won’t. We crafted each lesson with you in mind, so no technical jargon leaving you going “huh”? The syllabus is intuitive and easy to follow, plus we’re both old souls at heart.\nI don’t think I can truly learn anything through a computer screen\nOh, but you can! Because we have designed all of it so you walk away with real, actionable knowledge. This is not a bunch of theory we’re throwing at you. Each module has an assignment (with three difficulty levels) that you’ll post to Instagram, where we’ll see your creations and where you can join the community of everyone doing the course.\nPlus! the beauty of an online course is that you can go back to lessons over and over until you've mastered them. No time limits!\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be able to:\n– Navigate Instagram with ease\n– Post to Instagram with confidence\n– Meaningfully engage through the app\n– Join a community of people who are embracing social media in their golden years\n– Practice all of this in a safe space, with us as your guides\n\n\nWhy start today?\nBecause the best time to start was years ago.\nNo, but really: start today because it’s never too late to learn a new skill (especially one that leads to increased confidence and better, stronger connections with loved ones and like-minded people).\nRemember: Udemy offers a 30-day 100% money back guarantee. So if you do the course and decide it isn’t for you, you get your money back without hassle.\nThe only question now is: will you choose yourself today?\n(Pssst! The correct answer is ‘YES’!)\n\n\nWe can’t wait to connect with you in the course!\n– Danni and Ané",

My love butterflies opened the door for my creative juices to flow and instilled dreams for me in such things as the desire to learn to fly, to be a poet, and to be an artist.\nMy friends and family call me the butterfly lady because I have all kinds of butterfly-related items everywhere. I wear butterfly T-shirts, jewelry and anytime I see a piece of clothing with butterflies, I just must buy it. They laugh at me and keep asking, “Aren’t you sick of those butterflies yet?” I always answer, “Never!”\nEver since I was a little girl growing up in the countryside outside of the Twin Cities in Minnesota, I’ve been in love with butterflies. I would run after them as they fluttered away showing off their beautiful wings and I would wonder why I couldn’t have wings like that. Being a very shy and sickly, child I felt like having wings would give me confidence and power. I wanted to be a pilot so I could be up in the sky with the butterflies. If that wasn’t possible, I wanted to be a writer or artist as I loved to write poems about them and draw them.\nAfter growing up I met a man who was a flight instructor and he taught me how to fly. Somewhere between the take-offs and landings, we fell in love, got married and had 3 kids. My dream of learning how to fly came true, but I didn’t pursue it as a career because my ears are too sensitive to the air pressure and flying caused me a lot of pain. So, I continued working as a typist and then as administrative assistant, which eventually led to me learning computers. After a career of over 30 years of typing, setting at a desk all day, and dealing with stressful deadlines, I developed back problems. I retired early and fulfilled another dream of starting my own business called the Butterfly Connection. I was eventually able to fulfill two other dreams—being a writer and a monarch advocate.\nBeing a monarch advocate doesn’t mean you have to have a degree. My knowledge comes from years of reading, studying and watching monarchs as well as being passionate about them. I have taken online courses on the monarch and received a certificate from the Monarch Lab at University of Minnesota.\nThese are other books I have written that are on Amazon:\nBe Like a Butterfly—10 Steps to Help You Make Changes in Your Life (a self-help book)\nOne Last Flight Lesson (Memoir)\nMy Book of Poetry—46 Poems on Love, Life, and Butterflies (Poems)\nThe Dolphin and the Butterfly—A Lesson in Kindness (Children’s book)\nLove Over Power—A Medieval Mystery (my first novel)\nThis Course Will Teach…\nMain reasons why monarchs are special\nWhy they cause a “Butterfly Effect?”\nWhy we and the ecosystem need them?\nWhy they have economic value?\nWhat science uses them for?\nTheir magical metamorphosis\nTheir magnificent migration\nThe monarchs are disappearing\nMany ways you can help\nMake a pesticide free zone\nParticipate in local/national events coming up\nSend plants instead of flowers for special occasions\nPlan an event such as a fundraiser or garden party to educate others\nWrite to government officials asking for their participation\nPlant a butterfly garden/register it as a Monarch Waystation\nGet educated—take free online courses on monarchs\nRaise monarchs in your own home/become a monarch farmer\nEncourage careers that will help the monarchs\nDonate funds different ways/places\nMake nominations with monarchs in mind\nTeach children the power of dirt & the fun of gardening\nBecome a monarch advocate\nVolunteer for monarch programs\nBecome a Citizen Scientist\nNow that you know what this course is about, all you need to do is click the link below.\nGet the video course started so you can learn how to TAKE ACTION for the sake of the monarch butterflies and you.",

Commercial tires are engineered for specific applications, and it is important to use the right tire for your needs. Tire tread depth, groove geometry, tread compounds, and other engineering factors affect how the tire will wear under its designed application.\nTire bead seating/assembly: If the tire is not seated properly to the wheel flange area, the tire and wheel assembly will have an ‘out of round’ posture, which creates wear. If the tire bead doesn’t fit into the wheel properly, it will not properly center onto the wheel flange. This prevents the tread from lying flat as the tire rolls forward and backward, and causes uneven wear on the shoulders of the tire.\nHigh speed on wide-base tires: New generation wide-base tires have a tread mass that is much larger than the tread mass of a traditional tire. This causes the tire to crown at high speeds, causing a tire wear pattern similar to that seen on mismatched tires. This type of wear can be avoided by respecting the maximum speed posted by the tire manufacturer.\n\n\nAnother reason you should check alignment. Road hazard/impact: Premature damage to a tire is often caused by a road hazard or impact. However, the impact frequently goes unobserved until the tire is removed. Impact damage can almost always be identified on a demounted tire. Visual clues can show that impact has occurred, including radial splits, condition of the rubber after failure, the way the reinforcement wires come apart and indications of heat generation.\nSave your tire and truck a truck that is out of alignment will cost you money and could damage your truck. Uneven tire wear is usually caused by improper alignment, overinflation, underinflation, or a worn-out suspension. Regardless of the reasons, it is very important to have your truck check and aligned when you start seeing premature wear on your tire.",

      "description": "Glasgow began to develop as a port and industrial centre from the late eighteenth century. Opened in 1790, the Forth and Clyde Canal was built from the River Forth near Edinburgh through to Glasgow and brought some coal to the growing industries in the area - but not enough. From 1794, the Monkland Canal gave direct access to the coalfields around Coatbridge but businesses in Glasgow soon became dissatisfied with the monopoly they held over the supply of coal. In 1826, the Monklands and Kirkintilloch Railway was built to transport coal from the Monklands coalfields to the Forth and Clyde Canal and thence to Glasgow. From 1831, the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway brought the coal directly into Glasgow. These lines would introduce the earliest steam locomotives in Scotland.\nCharles Tennant, the inventor of bleaching powder, opened a chemical factory beside the Monkland Canal in 1799. By the 1830s this was the largest chemical factory in the world consuming vast quantities of coal. Concerned with the monopoly the Monkland Canal had over the supply of his coal, Tennant became one of the sponsors of the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway. Several railway lines into Glasgow converged in this area of Glasgow known as St Rollox, and it would become one of the most important manufacturing centres for steam locomotives and carriages. The famous St Rollox Works, Cowlairs Works, Hyde Park Works and Atlas Works were all concentrated in an area no more than 2 miles across. That story is told here too.\nFinally, as a bonus, I tell the story of the Ballachulish Railway in the Highlands of Scotland. Open in 1903, this line served the famous Ballachulish slate quarry, but it soon became a popular tourist line too. It is a very scenic railway with an interesting history.\nI hope you enjoy the history!",

You'll see why \"aiming off\" makes such good sense. And you'll see why dividing your trip into numerous legs, each ending at a \"checkpoint\" can help you find your may across great stretches of terrain.\nWe'll go over the time-honored navigation practice of dead reckoning, and how to use it under conditions of limited visibility, such as at night, or when you're fogged in or \"greened in\" by thick foliage.\nWe'll also cover USGS topographical maps, including how to read contour lines, measuring distance on the map, and interpreting depictions of terrain features.\nYou might be asking yourself \"Why do I need to know all this stuff if I have a GPS?\" And the answer is \"While GPSes are great, they should supplement, and not replace good low-tech backup navigation skills based on the proper use of map and compass.\"\nBesides the course lectures, students will receive in the form of downloadable PDF files, two books I've written on land navigation. These books supplement the Udemy lectures.

Here you will learn how to:\n- Write poetry from beginning to end and do a good job of it.\n- Learn about different types of poems and their origins.\n- Discover how you can get started, including what tools and equipment to use.\n- Develop the confidence and high esteem needed to create quality poetry.\n- Accept that you are creative (even if you do not believe it).\n- Apply easy poetry writing processes and skills.\n- Go from being shy about sharing your poetry to being fearless in presenting it publicly.\n- Meet other poets like yourself…and accomplished poets, too!\n- Compile a portfolio of your own original poems.\n- Adopt habits that will help you write your poetry.\n- Deal with stress by having a constructive outlet for it.\nEverything you need to begin writing poetry is included in this guide, and it is simple. By the time you finish, you will have a worthwhile hobby that can morph into a wonderful gift or talent! Take advantage of this offer today! The achievement of healthy self-expression is an advantage that will serve you for the rest of your life.\nAbout the Expert\nDeidre Simpson is the author of two books of poetry. During her teen years, she wrote often and was an avid reader as well. Writing poetry kept her balanced and gave her an excellent outlet for her emotional personality. She later became a member of a creative writers’ group at her high school. When the group decided to publish a magazine, she gladly contributed by writing poems and inviting other students to submit their work. In her senior year, she entered a poetry contest held by a local university and received Honorable Mention for her poem.\nReceiving two diaries for her 10th birthday is what started her writing career. Fiction novels and studying poetry in her middle school English class helped her hobby grow. Her worst experience was having to memorize a favorite poem by a famous author and recite it on video. She was petrified, but her poetry skills were advancing. One of her best memories is of two local poets that visited her creative writing class.\nAccording to her, doing what you truly love is the definition of work. Writing is one of the best ways to say something, even if it is only to the self. As she puts it, “Poetry is like a firecracker. It is small and has one form when unlit, like when the poem is finalized. Then when you share it with someone or a group of people, much like lighting it, it shoots into the sky and becomes a huge, beautiful, untouchable cloud after the rain.”",

      "description": "This guide seeks to take the reader on a journey. Starting with the history of the violin, it moves on to offer various lessons and techniques to help those new to the violin learn to play the instrument. It also seeks to teach something new to those already seasoned in violin playing.\nThe violin is an instrument with a very long history. The first known string instrument using a bow was called the ravanastron and was created in India thousands of years ago. More recently, the violin was an instrument born of the fiddle, rebab and the lira da braccio. Once considered a lowly instrument, the violin started to gain status when, among other things, it was used in operas by famous Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi. The violin is certainly one of the more well-known instruments used in “Classical” music. It has a familiar shape, like that of the cello and viola, except it is smaller. Its flat, pear-shaped wooden body is minimally decorated with purfling and perforated with F-holes. Great skill and dedication went into perfecting the instrument. Some of the greatest violin makers included Antonio Stradivarius as well as members of the Guarneri family, especially del Gesu. It was during the time in which these and other luthiers were creating violins in Italy that violin-making reached its zenith. In fact, today, many luthiers still use the patterns created by some of these craftsmen to make their instruments.\nSkill and dedication is required to not only create violins but also to play the instrument. Starting with beginning lessons using simple songs from the Müller-Rusch violin method book, “How to Play Violin” progresses to the more challenging exercises like the Rode Caprices. The book has not only musical exercises and examples, but also pieces and excerpts by Bach, Schubert, and Beethoven, among others. Lastly, a very brief discussion on playing techniques during the various eras of “Classical” music is given, as well as some statements about some other genres of music in which the violin is featured.",

His heart yearned for enlightenment, sparking a journey that would challenge, teach, and ultimately transform him forever. Thus, the adventure into the heart of Buddhism began.\n\n\nThe Search for Answers\n\n\nIn the heart of the bustling village, Kiran felt a growing emptiness. His questions lingered like shadows, Driving him towards the mountains. There, he sought wisdom, Longing to uncover truths That lay beyond the veil of existence.\n\n\nDiscovering the Four Noble Truths\n\n\nIn the dense forest, whispers of truth beckoned. Through silence and reflection, the four noble truths emerged: suffering exists, its origin lies in desire, the cessation of suffering is possible, and the path leads to liberation. A profound realization began to unfold.\n\n\nThe Path of the Eightfold\n\n\nThe Eightfold Path illuminates the way to end suffering and achieve Nirvana. By cultivating Right Understanding, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration, seek harmony and enlightenment.\n\n\nMeeting the Wise Monk\n\n\nIn a serene grove, Lila encounters a wise monk. His calm presence radiates wisdom. With gentle words, he unveils truths, teaching the essence of mindfulness, fostering deep understanding, sparking transformation within her heart.\n\n\nThe Lesson of Suffering\n\n\nSuffering, a universal experience, teaches resilience. Through moments of pain and loss, we discover truth, ultimately leading to compassion—both for ourselves and others. Embracing suffering opens the path to liberation and understanding.\n\n\nMindfulness in the Moment\n\n\nIn the embrace of the present, the protagonist discovers the power of mindfulness. Each breath becomes a bridge, connecting heart and mind, inviting clarity and insight, transforming ordinary moments into pathways of profound awareness.\n\n\nEmbracing Impermanence\n\n\nIn this chapter, we explore life's fleeting moments. Through understanding impermanence, we learn to appreciate each experience. Letting go of attachments opens doors to deeper truths, cultivating resilience and embracing the beauty of change.\n\n\nThe Nature of Compassion\n\n\nCompassion is the heart of Buddhism, binding us to all living beings. It transcends mere sympathy, fostering understanding and connection. Through acts of kindness, we nurture our shared humanity, recognizing that in helping others, we ultimately heal ourselves.\n\n\nFinding Inner Peace\n\n\nIn the depths of silence, a gentle voice emerges, guiding the heart towards tranquility. With each breath, let go of chaos, embracing stillness. Find the sacred space within, and discover the true essence of calm.\n\n\nThe Challenge of Attachment\n\n\nIn the realms of the heart, attachment creeps quietly, binding us to desires. To let go is to embrace freedom, yet its challenge lies in finding strength to release what we cherish, transforming pain into peace.\n\n\nThe Power of Meditation\n\n\nIn the silence of stillness, a sanctuary unfolds. Meditation reveals the mind's depths, transforming chaos into clarity. Through breath and awareness, one discovers serenity, cultivating compassion and wisdom on the path to enlightenment.\n\n\nCultivating Wisdom\n\n\nIn the tranquil glades, the young seeker learned that wisdom flourishes through understanding, reflection, and compassion. Each encounter with nature revealed the interconnectedness of all beings, nurturing a deeper insight into life's profound truths.\n\n\nThe Ripple Effect of Kindness\n\n\nIn a small village, one act of kindness sparked a journey of transformation. As smiles spread, hearts opened. Through compassion, connections deepened, echoing the teachings of Buddhism—kindness begets kindness, creating ripples that can change the world.\n\n\nA Journey of Self-Discovery\n\n\nThrough trials and triumphs, the traveler unearths hidden truths. In the stillness of reflection, insight blooms, revealing the essence of self. Buddhism's teachings guide the path, illuminating the way to genuine understanding and inner wholeness.\n\n\nLessons Learned and Shared\n\n\nThe traveler gathered friends, sharing insights from the journey: compassion breeds kindness, mindfulness nurtures peace, and wisdom flourishes in openness. Together, they sowed seeds of awakening, transforming lives through shared experiences. An enduring legacy began.\n\n\n17. Returning Home Transformed\n\n\nReturning home, she carried a heart full of peace, wisdom illuminating her path. With each breath, she embraced every moment, compassion flowing through her. Transformed, she shared her journey, spreading the light of Buddhism to others.\n\n\nThe Ongoing Quest for Enlightenment\n\n\nIn the labyrinth of life, each step reveals a pathway. With every lesson learned, we uncover deeper truths. The quest for enlightenment is not a destination, but a continuous journey, inviting us to explore the essence of our being.\n\n\nYou can find instructions for further development and how to transform this into a certificate or, if you wish, a University Diploma or Post-Preparatory Diploma within your course.",

Around 90% of autistic people, across the spectrum, have sensory sensitivities (hypo and hyper sensitivities) which can impact how we are able to manage stress and anxiety.\nMany autistic people struggle with the daily sensory bombardment 21st century life presents. Harsh lighting, overstimulating patterns, strong unnatural smells, rough/cold textures, loud noises and so forth can make daily life a challenge. This coupled with uncertainties and the unpredictable nature of the world can create a sense of isolation and anxiety.\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way in your space! By making some small (and very reasonable) adjustments you can make your space much more friendly. In this course we will learn how to do just that!\n-\nAbout the author:\nTimothy Sproule has been working with autistic children and adults for 13 years using martial arts to help with their development.

I will be focusing on the fundamentals of minimalism, including what it is and how it differs from frugality. Many people confuse the two concepts, but in this course, you will learn that minimalism is not just about saving money or cutting back on expenses. Instead, it is a mindset that emphasizes simplicity, mindfulness, and intentionality.\nThroughout the course, we will also discuss the potential downsides of minimalism, including feelings of deprivation and guilt. By addressing these concerns, you will learn how to approach minimalism in a balanced and healthy way.\nOne of the key components of the course is providing practical tips and strategies for introducing minimalism into your life. This could include decluttering and organizing your living spaces, creating a budget, and setting goals for mindful consumption. By providing concrete steps, you will be empowered to take action and make positive changes in your life.\nFurthermore, we will explore how minimalism can change your life in profound and meaningful ways. From reducing stress and increasing productivity to improving relationships and enhancing overall well-being, minimalism has the potential to transform your life in ways you never thought possible.\nFinally, we will also discuss the circular economy and how it ties into the minimalist lifestyle. By embracing a circular economy, you can reduce waste, save money, and contribute to a more sustainable future.\nOverall, this course is an excellent opportunity to learn about minimalism and how it can positively impact your life.

They turn to sometimes unreliable sources to find information on how to help but without understanding the fundamentals, these concepts are difficult to grasp, especially when every move you make affects the ones you love the most.\n\n\nThat’s EXACTLY why we created this course to help you understand the gender spectrum, and the science of being trans, get advice from trans experts, know your rights, and help you or your loved ones find their gender easier. We even help you overcome common debates like trans people using restrooms and being on sports teams.\n\n\nOur highly accredited TV show, Powered By Rainbows™, and award-winning host, Matt Haslam (aka Professor Pride™) teach you everything you need to know about being transgender. We hope this course will help you better understand yourself and better accept those around you.

True, the circular economy – as demonstrated on examples in the course – offers hope...\nBut there is too much focus on recycling and single-use plastics – both important, but not the most important variables in the waste-reduction equation.\nLearn the priorities of waste management, not “nice-to-haves”.\nReduce waste that matters, especially waste that contributes to climate change!\nFollow the reduce – reuse – recycle hierarchy, in that order.\nSee how you can implement models, e.g. Triple Bottom Line and the SDGs, in your organization or home in a way that saves money, creates local jobs and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.\nGet a resource that’ll help you get others on board with your sustainable waste management practices. Get other resources that’ll help you reduce waste-organics and generate your own free and organic liquid fertilizer, whether you are in a house, apartment, or an office.\nWhether you are an individual who wants to reduce your own waste at home or with your family, or if you’re are responsible for waste management at work – either directly, e.g. cleaners, facilities managers, small business owners, or indirectly, as a teacher, operations manager, cook or nurse … whether you want to reduce pollution, costs, material and resource use, or improve efficiency, become sustainable, and improve your environmental footprint through better waste mgmt - this course is for you.",

Over 40% of participants surveyed said they participate in family history research on a regular basis! Have you ever been curious about your roots?\nThis course, created by a college professor of family history research, is a comprehensive guide to creating your family tree and finding your ancestors using genealogical databases (such as Ancestry, Family Search, and American Ancestors), as well as gathering important family documents and records through offline research. We will cover the different genealogical databases that are out there and how to use them, how to create a family tree, how to submit names to the temple for ordinances if you're LDS, how to locate and use important records containing family information, how to find famous ancestors (such as European royalty, Mayflower passengers, American Revolution ancestors, religious figures, or celebrities), how to join lineage societies (such as the DAR or Mayflower Society), how to use DNA kits to guide your research, how to preserve your own family history documents, and how to write and publish your family history, among other topics. Helpful step-by-step video tutorials will show you the ropes and have you finding your ancestors in no time!\nYou may feel hesitant, but I can assure you that anyone can learn how to do genealogy. The only pre-requisite skills are knowing how to use a computer and the internet. I went from having only three names on my family tree to nearly 1,200 in just 30 days. With the tools and techniques in this course, you can do the same! THIS IS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE GENEALOGY COURSE AVAILABLE ON UDEMY.\nIt helps to have subscription to Ancestry prior to beginning this course. While you won't need it to complete the course, I've found this site the most helpful in finding records and gathering information, which you'll no doubt want to do after you complete the course.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to effectively utilize several different research methods and databases, as well as create a family tree and understand more of your cultural and ethnic heritage.

Participants will engage with evidence-based insights on brain development, habit formation, and attention ecology, paired with practical tools they can use in everyday settings—whether parenting, teaching, collaborating, or simply living more deliberately.\n\n\nGrounded in both self-compassion and systemic awareness, the course empowers learners to move from passive consumption toward intentional engagement. They’ll explore strategies for boundary-setting, tech/life balance, and relational tech use, ultimately crafting their own stewardship plan for sustainable screen habits. Whether you’re navigating your own relationship with devices or supporting children and students in theirs, this course offers a framework for digital decision-making that honors humanity over algorithms, and possibility over default. It’s not about perfection—it’s about choosing, noticing, and evolving with intention.\n\n\nParticipants will be exposed to diverse resources and a variety of tools to support their own development of a practical and personalized guide to their own screen time stewardship guide.",

Also have added symbols, holy places etc. At the beginning I have a lesson about the Baltic tribes(Latvians & Lithuanians), and how they are split or  called before they merged into modern day countries. Also maps about which parts tribes are located in. After that I am explaining how the gods are split into different levels, for example, some are considered cosmic gods residing in the sky, representing the starts, sun and the moon, but there are gods living in the underworld. Besides gods other beings like wizards or house spirits are considered as lower level beings to them.\nSo this course is for students, who have interest in Latvian culture or mythology in general. Some gods or creatures are also mentioned in Lithuanian or Slavic folklores as well. Besides the maps the course is also filled with illustrations of all deities and other beings, so it's easy for students to have a clear understanding how the deity or a being looks like.\nThe benefits can be to learn a new aspect of Baltic culture like knowing gods & goddesses, that where worshipped. Also to recognise the symbols, and to know what each of them represent.",

      "description": "Jane Austen is a figure who fascinates people. The spinster aunt who was also a literary genius, the intellectual who is also a pop culture icon, the literary realist who eschewed sentimentalism yet her novels are beloved love stories. Perhaps you are a Janeite (an Austen fan) or are reading her work as part of a literature course. Whether you already love her work, are puzzled by it or just want to know more, this course is for you.\nFollowing the success of my best selling English Literature., World Literature and Understanding Shakespeare courses, I decided to enter the world of Austen and discover the woman and her work. By the end of the course, you will be conversant with the literary trends of Austen’s time and how she responded to them and subverted them, her role as one of the instigators of literary realism, the historical and political context of her work in their own day and the movements which embrace her today and her ability to use free indirect speech to portray relatable characters.\nFor each text we examine there will be a publication background, synopsis, discussion of themes and criticism of the text plus questions to help you examine the text and your own response to it.\nTexts covered:\n· Lady Susan\n· Lesley Castle\n· Sense and Sensibility\n· Pride and Prejudice\n· Northanger Abbey\n· Mansfield Park\n· Emma\n· Persuasion\n· Sanditon\n· The Watsons\n· A Memoir of Jane Austen by James Edward Austen-Leigh\nI am looking forward to joining you on this enthralling journey through the life, mind and times of a brilliant woman.\nYou can enrol today risk free due to Udemy’s 30 day money back guaranteed.",

      "description": "Hello Parent,\nHave you ever thought about or asked these questions?\nHow can I get my kids to behave?\nHow can I get some time for me, before I lose control?\nWhat can I do to protect my child from all terrible things including failing class or bullying?\nWhy do I do all parenting work? How do I get my Co-parent to be more of a parent?\nHow do I get help from a world that doesn’t prepare us to be parents?\nHow can I make certain that my kids will grow up with all the tools in life to be happy, successful and fulfilled?\n\n\nThese are some of the many questions you may have as a mom or dad. Have you ever written out a list answering these questions?\nWhat are your biggest concerns about parenting?\nWhat are your greatest desires for your family?\nWhat do you worry about most about your children?\nWhat are your wishes for your children?\n\n\nWell, before we continue…WHAT IF there was a ONE STOP, does it all PARENTING the best way possible, solution that easily answers and shows you how to proceed to resolve every question listed above, would you be interested in having that know how?\nWhat about solutions to unforeseen yet to be asked questions that will come up on your parenthood journey, would you like to have that kind of readiness, preparedness to deal with all the unknowns of parenthood & childhood?\nWhat about the knowhow to deal with all your concerns, worries, struggles and challenges you may have about, your children, your parenting skills and all things family related, would you be interested in having that knowledge?\nWhat about having what amounts to a CHILD HANDBOOK that is complete from time of birth until time they become independent adults, would you be interested in that Knowledge?\nWhat about all of the above with resources available as needed for today, tomorrow and throughout the entire parenthood experience, would you like that?\n\n\nOptimal Parenting The complete “Help me I’m a Parent” series is the CHILD HANDBOOK that parents never receive. At least until NOW!\n\n\nThe “Help me I’m a parent” courses are one of the most popular and effective set of courses available anywhere in the world. Individually they are selling very well but more importantly they are helping parents. These courses were set up to help parents at different stages or with specific areas of need.\n\n\nHelping parents;\n…get ready for the parenthood journey with a well defined checklist. So they can choose to continue with my series or get the help from somewhere else.\n… understand the mindset that is needed to be an Optimal Parent.\n…gain an Understanding of their current levels of parenting through a variety of assessments.\n… develop a MAP and setting goals to help them take the long adventure known as the parenthood journey.\n…with the realistic time parameters of when current habits, methods and behaviors can change and deal with unrealistic expectations.\n…HACK the behaviors of their children so they understand their, every growing and changing, child in the best possible way.\n…with powerful and effective communication skills to have great parent child relationships\n…with family structure discipline rules policies to keep the parenthood journey moving towards the family goals\n…with a series of effective strategies that will help you achieve all the goals and phases of the parenthood journey.\n\n\nThese course individually have been successful but 2020 has opened my eyes to a number of things.\n\n\nOne: Time is not a guarantee in that we don’t know for certain what we have left. So time is an unknown yet extremely import commodity.\nTwo: My mission is to help 1,000,000 families by 2030 and Covid has made this goal more difficult due to the financial impacts and more importantly loss of life we have faced.\nThree: Parents need more help than ever before with Covid impacting home-school learning and work from home policies. The once easy divided portions of a day are now blended causing confusion and added stress to an already challenging parenthood journey.\n\n\nSo I thought to myself, “How can I help?”\n\n\nI noticed that several students of mine took more than two three or even four of my “Help me I’m a parent” courses. Now with folks needing financial help more than ever and even more important the skills to get through these tough times to build better and stronger bonds with their families, I figured I would take my series of 10 courses and mash them together into ONE GIANT MASTER course. I took the best parts of 9 of the 10 courses to create this course. The only one I didn’t include was the Urgent I need help Now course, which as I highlight in that course is a bandaid course. It will help deal with many issues quickly but the methods that are taught by most parenting coaches are merely short term solutions to a much bigger problem.\nOptimal Parenting is\nall about doing the best thing for the short, medium and long term. Optimal Parenting is about getting to know what you bring to the table prior to your parenthood journey. What style, roles, and strategies will you adopt? Where, what, how and why is your family going on this parenthood/childhood journey?\nunderstanding your ever changing child’s mind so that you can best relate, teach, communicate and love your child.\nlearning skill sets that will make you better as an individual, as a person in a relationship, as a leader, better organize with better management ability, better focused on what really matters and the means to establish and reach goals for yourself, your family, and your children.\nabout putting your family in the best position to be successful, happy and fulfilled.\nabout preparing your child to become inter-independent with the ability to sustainably thrive in life.\nabout effective communication skills and learning all the ways in which we actually communicate to each other.\nlearning to do those things most parents cringe just thinking about, like discipline, conflict issues, arguments and the art of governing the family.\nlearning how to effectively teach your children what they want and you want them to learn\nand much more.\n\n\nThe Optimal Parenting course is the complete best of the best of the Help me I’m a Parent series. Optimal Parenting is the most comprehensive parenting and childhood understanding course ever developed. There simply isn’t anything close to this level of Parenthood Training.\nThis is true because not only do you get what most are teaching to some degree or another but you get it all plus you get frameworks and techniques unique to Star Family Coaching.\n\n\nThe information in this course is the result of over two years of collected works from the biggest names in the world of parenting and childhood development like Gordon, Ginott, Siegel, Bryson, Gottman, Faber, Baumrind, Piaget, Erikson, Kegan, Lovinger, Massey, Havighurst, Levin, and more.\n\n\nYou’ll get over 290 lectures\nOne full color course work\nOne black and white print friendly workbook complete with all the exercises assessments and activities required to complete this course.\nOne black and white print friendly course notebook for you to take notes in that run in sync with the lectures\nTwo additional lecture specific workbooks\nOne Parenting Agreement\nAudio file version of each lecture\nLifetime access to this MASTER course\nCoach Hall, is a Life Mastery Practitioner Specializing in the Parenthood Journey.

We most understand that every species has their own unique way of living in this planet, some animals can fry, others can swim whilst  others can do both, some animals even walk slowly other can run very fast. How animals behaves are determined by a lot of factors such as the way they life, forage for food, defend themselves, attract mates and built their own shelters etc. A lot of animals are also under the mercy of predators and they must develop survival skills to ensure that they live with all the challenges. We must also understand that all animals have their own individual unique features that carefully help them to survive in any situations that they find themselves in.\nSome animals, like wolves and many big cuts have territories that they defend from other animals that they see them as competitors, this make this animals hunt on this areas and make it more likely for them to survive, because animals that are not strong enough do not survive in that same area. Some animals mark their territory using urine and simply patrolling the resources to ensure that no other animal comes there or by driving their competitors away always. Prey animals also develop a survival strategies so that their predators will not killed them for food. We must also understand that mother animals teach their children how to hunt for food so they too can survive in the environment. Human pollution and destruction of the environment all have a very big effect on the animals survival.",

      "description": "This Yachtmaster course is designed to help you pass your RYA Yachtmaster shore based chart work exam with confidence and as an aide memoire prior to taking the practical Coastal Skipper course and exam and the Yachtmaster exam.\n\nAt Yachtmaster level we always allow for Deviation and we will have to Compute the tidal rate. We will also be expected to work more quickly through the navigational disciplines than we did at Day Skipper level.\nThis course is taught by Duncan Wells, RYA instructor, features writer for Yachting Monthly, Sailing Today and Sail Magazine, author of Stress-Free Sailing, Stress-Free Motorboating, Stress-Free Navigation and Stress-Free Mooring and creator of the safety aid, MOB Lifesavers.\nYou will have a lifetime access to these videos not just from you computer but also from your tablet and mobile phone (Android and iOS).  And so the videos will help you as you take your Yachtmaster shore based theory and as a refresher when you come to do your practical courses out on the water.\nThe discussion feature will allow you to ask questions directly,  which can be answered either by other students or by us at Westview Sailing.\nWe suggest that you start this course well in advance of your exam and that you watch each video until you really understand the concept. Whether it is Advanced Estimated Position, which may include a 2 hour plot and the need to compute the tidal rate, plus an allowance for Magnetic Variation, Deviation and Leeway, or a Secondary Port question. By the way if you have found Secondary Ports tricky, the video on this course will make them as plain as day and nothing to fear. And if you want to find out how to do 'Secondary Port Calculations in your head', get in contact. It is just a question of becoming familiar with the concept of each navigational discipline and then exam questions will be a breeze.\n\n\nWe have also just added a section on weather which will give you a good grounding in weather and allow you to predict weather for yourself. Look at the pressure, look at the synoptic chart, look out of the window and marry the three up. Very soon you will be able to tell what will happen just by looking at the synoptic chart. Everything you need to sail through your yachtmaster weather paper is here.\n\n\nIf you are not satisfied with the course after the purchase please do contact us, if we can not solve the problem we offer a thirty (30)-day, no-questions-asked money back guarantee.\nFinally, we wish you good luck with your RYA exam and the course. These videos are also used by students studying for their MCA exams.\n\n\nFair winds,\nDuncan Wells\nWestview Sailing",

      "description": "AIRPORT BOOT CAMP is the FIRST step to launching your AVIATION LIFE, whether on the ground or in the air. It is THE solid foundation to build the rest of your career on.\nWhether you want to become a pilot, mechanic, flight attendant, air traffic controller, airport ramp worker, airline refueler, hot air balloon chaser, air rescue crew member, flight nurse, military aviation trainee, aircraft dispatcher, air cargo handler, flight planner, customer service rep, gate agent, TSA agent, avionics tech, aircraft detailer, flight caterer, airport firefighter, policeman, FAA, Young Eagle, Civil Air Patrol cadet, or virtually ANY other aviation position...AIRPORT BOOT CAMP is for YOU!\nAIRPORT BOOT CAMP will help you become familiar with aviation before you show up as the NEWB. The newbie. The new guy. My course helps reduce some of the 'newb pain'. My book, the AVIATION NEWB SURVIVAL GUIDE (included with this course), complements it and will help you grow in your knowledge and understanding as you pursue your aviation goals and dreams. Having a general familiarity of things before you start can ease the \"newb\" stigma or anxiety that we all feel when entering a new world or workplace. A little knowledge goes a LONG way!\nAviation is a unique, special world. It has a cool language. I will teach it to you. Aviation keeps time differently. I will teach it to you. Aviation uses special equipment, can be dangerous, is challenging, irritating, rewarding and yes, even fun. This world is made up of a unique group of people. An aviation tribe. MY tribe. YOUR tribe. I will help you transition in.\n\n\nAIRPORT BOOT CAMP is built around the following 6 CORE areas:\n﻿\n1. THE AIRPORT ENVIRONMENT\n2. COMMUNICATIONS\n3. AVIATION SAFETY\n4. DRIVING AIRPORT VEHICLES/EQUIPMENT\n5. AIRPORT SECURITY\n6. PEOPLE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE\n\n\nI will help you transition into your NEW AVIATION LIFE today, as well as equip you with the tools (my included AVIATION NEWB SURVIVAL GUIDE) to grow as you progress into whatever aviation life you are pursuing. This is a life transition. It's everything you need to know to successfully launch your aviation life!\nI went fairly deep in my book, information-wise, and although it's a book for 'newbs', the amount of reference information I included will help you long after you complete the AIRPORT BOOT CAMP course! It's over 200 pages, with lots of pics, simple diagram, reference charts, a 400+ word practical glossary of aviation words (including unofficial 'insider\" words), and so much more. EVERYTHING you need.  It's optimized for mobile so you can always have it on you and available. It's THE book I wish I had when I first started.\nJust a quick mention in case you're wondering what my 'creds' are. I was an airport kid.  We lived one mile from runway 33 at Bradley Int'l Airport (BDL) and my extended family all lived in the same area. Many of them worked at BDL in one capacity or another.  Everyone's outdoor furniture, cars, and playscapes were blanketed with a thin coat of jet exhaust residue and I loved it.  I spent many a day on my bike eating ice cream and watching planes land and takeoff. Back then the ground would shake and rumble as the jet engines roared, popped, and screamed as they launched into the sky. Before engine 'hush kits' were developed.\nAs a teen I spent my days in the local Civil Air Patrol squadron at my airport, always enjoying the aviation 'spirit' in general. Top Gun came out during this time and that only enhanced my experiences.  Once I became work-age legal, I continued my aviation 'education' working on the ramp in different capacities, including owning a couple aviation small businesses. I have trained many newbies. I always strived to make the training as smooth and 'fun' as possible so as not to discourage them in an environment that can be overwhelming at times.\nI took notes through all those years. Literally. Ideas for better training. Things I might change or make more interesting.  I remembered the awful training videos I was tortured with through the years, only to check a box in my 'training' file to remain 'certified.'  I mean, I watched the same BORING, (and hate to say it), sometimes INCORRECT training videos even though I had many years of ramp experience. I knew someday I would have to make my own training course, or at the very least a good BOOK for new people. Fortunately I was able to do BOTH.\nAIRPORT BOOT CAMP isn't your dad's or your grandpa's old-school training course. This is outside the boring 'norms'.  It is intentionally unconventional...I push the envelope in some of the modules, risking embarrassment, but knowing it will at least be memorable. With that, hopefully you will retain a bit more than you would by falling asleep watching the same videos I probably watched.  My hope is that educating with a little entertainment thrown in will help you remember what was taught a little easier. It really doesn't have to be painful. This is a training REVOLUTION, or something like that. Because I really do care.\nThis is a 'CERTIFICATION' course. Because I said so. I successfully trained many people on the ramp and through 30 years of actual experience, developed AIRPORT BOOT CAMP. If you take this course and pass the exams, you will receive a digital certificate through Udemy. Boom. Certified. But keep learning with my book. Maybe someday MY course will spread as being THE certification to have. At the very least you paid for it which shows interest and initiative and will have a credential as an Airport Boot Camp graduate.  Are you ready to begin your journey? Your aviation life begins now!\nSee you on the ramp,\nMarc",

Childcare is not an easy task, as many would assume it to be. It takes time, effort, hard work, and a lot of heart to care for young children.\n\n\nAs parents continue to take on demanding jobs and resume working from the office, their young children need to receive some form of childcare in their absence.\n\n\nThis has resulted in an increasing and lucrative gap in the market: a rising demand for excellent childcare services. Starting your own daycare center may seem like a lot of work to begin with, but with this course and insight into how to start and run a daycare facility, you will be able to learn and explore new ideas to become confident about your plans for building and sustaining a daycare. From making activity plans for children to dealing with noisy tantrums, we will teach you what goes on in building a successful daycare business.\n\n\nDaycare centers can be small home-based businesses or part of a large commercial project. This flexibility in investment budget can enable budding caretakers to take their small businesses to new heights.\n\n\nThere are a lot of options for customization and flexibility in terms of the kind of daycare you want to run. You can determine which activities to offer, the business hours of the daycare, and the niche you will be targeting. All of this will depend on the needs of the parents and children in your community.\n\n\nYou will have to develop childcare programs to enhance the mental and social growth of the children in your facility. Parents expect their children to receive proper nurturing and educational enrichment at your organization.\n\n\nEffective communication with parents is key in developing trust, which is why your staff, your operational and educational plans, and your services should reflect transparency and excellence.\n\n\nIn this course, you will also learn about the business side of running a daycare: how to create a fee structure, handle invoicing, file taxes, license your business, and more importantly - how to market your business.\n\n\nThis course will not give you a fixed blueprint to follow. Instead, you will be equipped with the tools to plan and run your business your way. Guidance and questions in this course will help you determine the needs of your community and build a prosperous daycare business, full of gleeful children.",

      "description": "Introduction Course Teaching You Quickly And Concisely How To Make & Build With This Amazing Forgiving Insulating Building Material\n\n\nFirst, What is AirCrete?\nAirCrete is cement inflated 6 times in volume. This creates a beautiful forgiving, carvable, structural building material that also insulates. It allows you to put a the structure & insulation for $8 to $9 dollars per square foot; depending on where you live and the cost of local building materials.\n\n\nIts my goal to move you as quickly as possible to understanding how to make AirCrete and how to stack it into a dome for a home, studio, or storage building. I am not going to give you 25 hours of video or mix the subject with other subjects, like stacking dirt bags.   I focus on the elementary components of the process and show you every step of the way.\n\n\nIf you want THE most recent updates & best pricing please visit tinygiantlife [dot] biz/build-your-own-aircrete-home/\n\n\nWhen Complete you WILL be capable of building your own structures shell.\n\n\nMy Story:\nSome years ago I got involved in permaculture. It is a agraculture design science that can build a permanent culture or society.  In that I saw the beauty of a life without the rush of our current society.  This got me to start thinking about applying an intentional design process to the way I live.\n\n\nOver the course of many years of building and testing every idea under the sun. I was able to create a lifestyle that lets me work on things I love 40 hours or so per month in various construction trades. Yes I said month.  I am able to travel the world and stay out of the country for 3 months at a time. I have used my abundant time to follow a path of self growth. Eventually, I grew enough to follow my passion for the money I need.\n\n\nHow This Story Applies To This Course:\nI have worked in construction for over 30 years.   I have tried every alternative building type: Earth ship, rammed earth, adobe, cob, straw bale, light clay straw, truss wall, and conventional.  AirCrete is the single best way I have found to quickly build a beautiful elegant artful home.  It requires a hand full of tools, cement, water, and power. All of which can be thrown in a truck or delivered anywhere. For $38+ per square foot, with appliances, a single person can have a starter home shell up in 14+ days.\n\n\nI believe everyone, at any income level, is entitled to have a home and live well. Thriving, not surviving. Infact, a highly committed and self disciplined person making minimum wage can have a tiny starter home on their own lot in as little as 1 year.  Setting you free from rent and mortgage for the rest of your life. What would you do with the extra money from rent or mortgage if it was in your hand to spend right now? Buy nice things? Save up and travel? Work less? Start a business?  You see its this very thing I am passionate about.  Building your own home gives you the step one from which you can move your life in the direction of your heat! Its the foundation.",

Many years ago I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and stress all at the same time and was given a prescription for medication which fortunately I never filled.\nInstead I went on a journey of discovery and growth to find out what these conditions were and how I could recover without medication. Now I'm sharing all the information I found and used to help myself with you so that you can do the same.... so that you can recover from depression naturally and without the need for medication.\nDo you want to feel 'normal' again? I know that's what I wanted.\nIf you could, what emotions would you want to feel more of on a daily basis?\nWhat would being free of depression feel like, look like and sound like to you?\nPlease allow me to share with you all of the tools, strategies and processes I used to help myself feel better and that I now use to help others feel better and recover from depression. I would love to be your guide, your mentor, your coach on the journey out of depression and into a life that you want, a life on your terms.\nDepression isn't something you just have to 'cope' with or 'deal' with and people telling you to 'cheer up' or 'man up' is never going to help. The people who say that simply do not understand how it feels - I do!\nClick the button, enrol in the course and let's start this journey to freedom, to happiness and back to normality together.\nI look forward to seeing you in the course, how will you feel when you don't have to deal with depression every day?\nMy Very Best Regards\nGraham",

      "description": "During this course you will be introduced to the beautiful world of essential oils and their amazing mood boosting, skin clearing, pain relief, sleep aid, emotional balancing and healing properties. I have merged both my passion for essential oils as well as my passion for DIY (do it yourself) projects to tailor a unique experience where you will learn how to make 7 personal products, toxin-free, cruelty-free and poison-free. Most people that learn about essential oils tend to get overwhelmed with what to do with the information. From my personal experience of providing a multitude of introductory lectures on the subject, I realized that it was hard to retain the practical uses of essential oils on day-to-day circumstances, which is why this course uses essential oils for self-care, specifically to make your own natural products (beauty and home), to ground these concepts and lifestyle changes in a very practical, entertaining and simple way! Join me for storytelling and fun DIY recipes to expand on your self-love, fire your self-healing codes and raising your consciousness.\n\n\nAlthough you will learn about oil uses and how they can help us cope, heal and transcend states and limitations, this course will be centered on self-care and making it fun. That means you don't have to be an expert whatsoever, simply a curious mind tapping into alternative ways of honoring yourself and the fullness of who you are. We will mainly focus on the practical side of incorporating the oils in your routines with the use of the recipes, which I encourage you to modify and experiment with in order to find your favorite scents, once you get more fascinated about essential oils. The recipes are simple enough to follow and also to modify and remember. We also use products you can easily afford or find around your home, and then your oils. That was my main goal here, to make it fun! To make self-care a habit that also engages our creativity, our senses and our intention. I want to show you how easy it is to start a lifestyle shift, deepen into natural self-care practices and balancing emotions and mental stress. I want for you to witness the joys of making your own handmade goodies, awakening your intuition and learning how to make self-care a creative process.\n\n\nBecause this course is centered around self-care with the use of essential oils, we won't be going too deep into dilution rates, types of carrier oils, specific guidelines for pregnancy, babies, children, pets or any specific conditions you may have, which require you to consult your doctor before adding a new component to your lifestyle. You will need to do your own research about what brands to get and learn about what a legit oil should have on the label, as well as confirm that your brand can be used topically (not just on a diffuser) and/or internally as a supplement. You will rather learn how to use basic, specialty and citrus oils, and how to make some of your own beauty and personal care products. Why? Because the second goal of this course is to raise awareness about product toxicity, to educate you about alternatives that are holistically inclined and empower you about becoming conscious not only about taking charge of your own wellness, but to be conscious about the commercial products you use and what you put in your body.  #selfcare #essentialoils #aromatherapy #relaxation #crueltyfree #naturalproducts #diy #selflove #holisticliving #holistichealth #selfesteem #motivation #inspiration #diyproducts\n\n\nAbout me: I'm a Life Coach focused on Shadow Work, Usui Reiki Master, certified Holistic Lifestyle Advocate and Essential Oil Specialist, with courses in Aromatherapy Level 1 and 2, Chakra Healing with Crystals and Clinical Aromatherapy. I help people navigate their personal underworlds where deep trauma is stored, and I greatly enjoy educating everyone about transitioning to a more wholesome lifestyle involving natural products and guilt-free choices.\n#essentialoils #essentialoilcourse #selfesteem #divinefeminine #homeremedies #selflove #selfcare #selfcarerituals #selfcarecourse #healing #selfhealing #naturaldeodorant #naturalperfume #diyrecipes #beautyproducts",

      "description": "Coyotes are some of the most fascinating creatures native to the North American continent. Most people haven’t had much opportunity to learn about what makes this species so unique, and this has fueled strong negative feelings that have persisted for thousands of years. Now that public opinion is shifting further in favor of enforcing more humane animal welfare protections, the time is ripe for reconciling our relationship with the ‘yotes, and encouraging better relationships between humans and the infamous Song Dog.\nIn this book, we go through the basics of coyotes and get to know them as an animal just like any other species native to North America. From learning more about their infamous howl, to how they overcome the challenges of living in an urban environment, you’ll get to know the coyote on a deeper level and break through the narrative of fear you’ve been exposed to for so long. The intention of this book is not to force you to love coyotes as the author does (but it’s great if that’s the result!), but to help you grow past the myths that have been passed as fact since the 1800s. Learn to live with the coyote peacefully, and see it not as a “wiley” villain, but as just another animal that is trying to survive like you and me!\nAbout the Expert\nJazmin “Sunny” Murphy is a Master’s student studying Environmental Policy and Management, with a concentration in Fish and Wildlife Management. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and aims to make STEM research and education freely available to the public through her platform, Black Flower Science Co. Jazmin’s ultimate goal is to repair relationships between scientists and laypeople, and all of her writing is a part of this big picture. Wildlife has always played a central role in her life, and her hope is that everyone would come to love the organisms of the natural world in the way that she always has.",

Kabbalah is a universal wisdom that anyone can study, regardless of background, gender, or belief system.\nWhy Kabbalah? Deep down, we all want to understand the meaning of our lives, and the purpose of our existence. Kabbalah answers many of these questions and gives you practical tools and techniques to bring more fulfillment to your life.\nHow will I learn? Beyond receiving knowledge through our videos and written texts, MyKabbalah will encourage you to take action and experiment with what you have learned.\nThis Course is a paradigm-shifting course that reveals the secrets of kabbalistic teachings, the golden rules you can master if you seek more fulfillment in your life. Kabbalah explains that there is the world that we see (the physical world) and a much larger realm, just as real, that is unseen (the spiritual world). We are souls from the spiritual world living in bodies of the physical world. The wisdom of Kabbalah explores both, explaining the spiritual laws of the universe to improve and enhance our life experience in this world.",

      "description": "Anger Management Technique to Eliminate Anger Fast with EFT\n1. What is EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique)?\nEFT, also known as tapping, is a powerful self-help method that combines ancient Chinese acupressure with modern psychology. It involves tapping on specific meridian points on the body while focusing on an emotional issue to relieve stress, anxiety, and anger.\n2. The EFT Tapping Points\nEFT utilizes key meridian points, including the top of the head, eyebrow, side of the eye, under the eye, under the nose, chin, collarbone, under the arm, and the karate chop point on the hand.\n3. EFT Tapping Points & Connected Energy Meridians\nEach tapping point corresponds to a specific energy meridian connected to different organs and emotions. By stimulating these points, you help release emotional blockages and restore balance.\n4. Setup Phrase\nThe setup phrase acknowledges the negative emotion while affirming self-acceptance. Example: \"Even though I feel this anger, I deeply and completely accept myself.\"\n5. Reminder Phrase\nThe reminder phrase keeps you focused on the issue while tapping. Example: \"This anger I feel.\"\n6. The Breathing Exercise\nA deep breathing exercise after tapping helps integrate the shift in energy and promote relaxation.\n7. What is Anger and How It Affects You\nAnger is a natural response to perceived threats, but when uncontrolled, it can lead to stress, health issues, and damaged relationships.\n8. EFT Using SUDS on That Anger\nThe Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) helps measure the intensity of anger before and after tapping.\n9. EFT Using a Color and Shape on That Anger\nVisualizing the anger as a color and shape helps make it tangible and easier to release during tapping.\n10. EFT Using a Color and Shape on That Anger\nThis step continues the previous technique, ensuring deeper emotional processing.\n11. EFT Using Past Tense on That Anger\nShifting the language to past tense (\"I used to feel angry\") reinforces emotional release and resolution.\n12. Mopping Up with EFT\nA final round of tapping ensures any lingering anger is addressed and neutralized.\n13. Mopping Up Any Remaining Feelings with EFT\nChecking for residual emotions and tapping on any that remain ensures complete emotional freedom.\n14. Mopping Up and Being Okay Now with EFT\nEnding with positive affirmations and acceptance: \"I now feel calm, at peace, and in control.\"",

      "description": "Schools don't teach people how to choose a life partner, manage money or buy a house.  We  simply learn by doing...often with devastating results.  Online learning is such a great resource and offers those with experience and knowledge a platform to help others.  This course contains the wisdom I would share with my younger self if that were only possible.  Over the years I have made both good decisions and poor decisions on house purchases.  As a real estate Broker in California I have helped hundreds of people buy a house and I understand the way we all think during this exciting and demanding life choice.  Take these lessons to heart and it will change the course of your life.  I guarantee it.\nThis is a fast paced and easy introduction to how people view the purchase of a house and how you can view it more realistically and productively.  Most of are raised to want to buy a house and feel safe, secure and settled.  I can tell you from personal experience, buying the wrong house will leave you feeling unsafe, insecure and unsettled while you lie awake at 3 AM feeling a crushing sense of dread.  Been there, done that.  While I am truly an advocate for home ownership, it really is only viable at the right time, under the right circumstances and with the right house.\nBuying a house is only one part of building the home you dream of living in.  Dream homes are about people, relationships, experiences and creating memorable moments.  If you are not living happily now, a different house is not the solution to your problem.  Spend too much and commute too far and your life will change in ways you never imagined.\nThis is a starter course to introduce students to where we go right and wrong when buying a home.\nWhile many of us have a romanticized image of finding our 'dream home', the reality is life comes with challenges.  Anticipate and plan for them.  The Social Security Administration says that only 5% of workers at retirement age will be financially independent, Bankrate has documented that 76% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and half of all marriages end in divorce.  It's not the regular latte's that do the most damage, it is getting the big decisions completely wrong wreak havoc on the lives of unsuspecting house shoppers.\n\nBuying a house is a big and exciting transition, and is particularly important for launching each of us on the right path for a happy and successful life.  House choice has a large impact on your family's future, both personally and financially so this is something you want to get right.\nI teach and coach home buyers across the country on balancing a house purchase with life goals.  As such I seek one of three outcomes.\n1) You cheese not to buy a house.  If it's not the right time or circumstances, don't do it now.  Wait until the time is right for you.\n2) You buy a different house.  Most home buyers overspend or add too much to their travel time.  I encourage people to buy a house that leaves money and time for more important things in their lives... like people and experiences.\n3) You buy the same house, but you are different.  Choosing to make a house a priority is just fine as long as everyone understands and anticipates the challenges and sacrifice this will call for.  Go in eyes open and informed and you will better prepared for a happy home life.\nIf you're thinking about a house, take this course...you'll know right away that this is life changing wisdom.",

      "description": "My name is Dr. Meredith Goodwin. I am a Board-Certified Family Physician who has been in practice for over 30 years. Like nearly everyone else in my medical school class, when I first became a physician, my goal was to help people. At that time, obesity and diabetes were relatively rare, and we had only a few drugs to help.\n\nDon’t take this wrong, but I HATE obesity. I grew up in the 1960s when nearly everyone, including my parents, was trim. As I hit my teen years, I started gaining some weight. The weight gradually increased through high school, college, and medical school. But I’m a doctor, right? There must be a drug that would help. Well, nothing really worked long-term. Medicine treated weight loss as a reflection of a person’s inability to have self-control. Remember that? It took a long time for obesity to be regarded as a disease process.  Eat less, exercise more, right? Not only did that not work for me in the long term, but it also did not work for my patients.\n\nMy goal for this course is to help learners understand how we got where we are today - overweight, obese, and diabetic.  We will then look at the current theories of obesity and figure out what actually causes it.  What works for weight loss, what doesn't, and why.  Then we'll apply what we have learned to get us turned around and on the right path to regaining control of our health.  Ready to join me?",

      "description": "The story of waste sorting reveals a paradox: despite being one of the simplest and most effective steps towards a sustainable future, waste segregation remains largely overlooked. Even with existing regulations in place, the practice often gets reduced to a mere requirement rather than being embraced as a meaningful path to environmental improvement. This disconnect prevents meaningful progress, transforming what could be a powerful tool for change into just another  checklist.\nIn our daily lives, waste management is more than just following rules—it's about creating a sustainable future.

      "description": "Welcome to \"Meditation for Stress Reduction and Mindfulness\", a transformative course designed to help you reduce your stress levels through meditation and breathing.\n\n\nIn our fast-paced world, stress has become a common companion that affects our mental, emotional and physical well-being. This course offers a gentle and accessible introduction to mindfulness practices, allowing you to cultivate a sense of calm, resilience and balance in your daily life.\n\n\nI'm Nadya, the creator of this course. Before becoming an instructor, I worked at a bank as a risk analyst. Sitting at a desk all day, working on weekends, not eating neither sleeping well, not training my body with respect. All of these things made my life and emotions unbalanced and chaotic. I was constantly on the search to better organize my day. Scheduling sweaty sessions at the gym to help me get rid of the heavy emotions and tensions. But I was too tired, my body was too exhausted to accomplish all my plans. If I knew that it was not necessary to work as hard to feel better, if I knew that the key to the \"success\" I was looking for was always hidden in me. That's why I'm happy to share my experience with you. Hopefully, it will help you discover your way to living a healthy and conscious life.\n\n\nThroughout this course, you will explore various practices including mindful breathing, body scan meditation, breath, loving-kindness meditation, and more. The course also includes a short session to help stretch the body and release all tension. I have prepared short and long sessions so you can choose the practice according to your energy level and willpower, remember - each day is different.\nWhen passing the course for the first time, I suggest you follow the order. And then you can practice the techniques learned when you need them.\n\n\nI hope you find something useful in this course.\n\n\nThank you ,\n\n\nNadya",

During the course, students would be introduced to early flight experiments, early aeronautical technologies, and the Wright brothers' conquest of the sky. Subsequently, the course would cover the first and second world wars, analyzing the role of aviation in these two historical eras and how it allowed to revolutionize war strategy.\n\n\nThe course would also explore the impact aviation has had on society and culture, for example considering how the aircraft has become a symbol of progress and how the growing ability to fly has led to the spread of new forms of transport and commerce global. In addition, students could examine historical aircraft, analyzing their design, the technology used and their importance in the history of aviation.\n\n\nDuring the course, students would have the opportunity to learn the technical terminology used in aviation, understand the principles of flight theory and the dynamics of a moving aircraft. The course may also examine the evolution of commercial aviation, from the introduction of the first long-haul jet aircraft to the creation of national airlines and the growth of air traffic.\n\n\nFinally, the aviation history course may also explore military aviation and the impact of the Cold War on aviation technology. Students could examine the evolution of combat aircraft, the introduction of medium- and long-range missiles, and the role aviation played in the arms race during this historical period. In summary, a course in aviation history would provide a comprehensive and exciting insight into a technological sector that has revolutionized the modern world.",

      "description": "Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) is a psychological approach that involves analysing strategies used by successful individuals and applying them to reach a personal goal. It relates thoughts, language, and patterns of behaviour learned through experience to specific outcomes. Proponents of NLP assume that all human action is positive. Therefore, if a plan fails or the unexpected happens, the experience is neither good nor bad—it simply provides more useful information.\nThe key with children, especially at such a tender age, is to simplify the concepts and use engaging, relatable methods.\nThis course covers the following techniques:\n1. Reframing\n2. Anchoring\n3. Visualization\n4. Metaphor Use\n5. Modelling\n6. Belief Challenging\nIn addition – and this is what differentiates a ‘course’ from a series of one-way YouTube videos -  the course includes:\nHow you can offer parental support\nSpecific NLP techniques to try at home\nHow you can measure your child’s progress.\nYou are then invited – as is implicit throughout the course – to give feedback, suggestions and comments on the techniques, their effectiveness plus any other ideas.\nPlus…..numerous Case Studies are included – in the Resources section to enable you to print them out for discussion. The Case Studies include discussion questions and you are encouraged to post your responses in the Q/A and to discuss with others.\nThe instructor is highly active and so all discussions, all experiences, all comments – good, bad, confused, indifferent – are welcome.\nThis is a course to be actively involved – far more than simply watching!",

Get to the known facts about the power of positivity and the flow of ideas towards excellence via a positive mindset and peace of mind. Explore Positive thinking as a mental and emotional attitude that focuses on the bright side of life and expects positive results through the modules in an effective manner. Cheers.\n\n\nFun in classrooms is a requisite. As teachers, we must not use technology as a silicon coating but harness the power of technology to connect with our students. No more, it is about copying and pasting, which we have had been doing over the years. To control corrupt politicians, PowerPoint corrupts the teachers if it has just slides and no explanations. For a matter of thought and intelligence, the platform should share for show rather than expecting it to be the only parcel for knowledge delivery. There is a specific need to implement a new way of teaching through technology, and hence a digital pedagogy is required the most. The teachers need to introspect how children may learn in this networked environment. We can’t simply take a textbook and deliver it digitally; somewhat, the need here is to explore the power to harness the best via connectivity and creativity to connect.\nWe can’t think and re-discover the chalkboard and make it an intelligent board to deliver knowledge. What is required is a novel mindset of love, care, and delivery of priorities for our children within classrooms. We ultimately need a different paradigm for teaching, a different pedagogy that talks about creation, control of chaos, connection to correcting, and consumption to creation. The teachers need to change their thinking of how they are going to use technology in education.\nHave great learning. Cheers.",

Each process is brought down into step by step methods and demonstrated with multiple examples from real graffiti on walls.\nThere is also a heavy emphasis on practice, developing one’s own original style and drawing in the course.\nGraffiti can be confusing to new starters, who often don’t know where to begin with piece construction.

      "description": "What is Cardistry?\nCardistry is the performance art of card flourishing, where a normal deck of playing cards is manipulated with cuts, pivots, spins, twirls, and other creative movements to create beautiful displays and visuals.\n\n\nWhy should you start learning Cardistry?\n- It is very enjoyable.\n- It teaches you to be disciplined and dedicated.\n- It makes you creative.\n- A great way to de-stress and relax.\n- It makes you proud of yourself once you started getting good.\n- It is a beautiful skill to perform to your friends and family.\n- A cheap and portable hobby that can be practiced anywhere as long as you have a regular deck of cards.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\nYou will be learning twelve fundamental moves that every person starting Cardistry should know. Some of the moves are easy and others are a bit more challenging. You do not need any experience with handling or shuffling a deck of cards as I will be breaking down each move into simple, easy to learn steps.\n\n\nWhat will you need to begin?\nThe only thing you will need to start is a regular deck of cards. However, I highly recommend brands such as Bicycle, Bee, Tally ho, or any other brand by the United States Playing Card Company as they are the best quality.\n\n\nAbout me:\nMy name Ali, and I have been practicing Cardistry for the past 9 years. It is my passion, and there is nothing more I enjoy than practicing this craft and teaching it to other people. Cardistry is a very fun skill to practice, and it can be very rewarding once you master a move and perform it to your friends and family.",

      "description": "Overview\nThis course has recently been updated to add three new lessons... It is Deborah's desire that every student enjoys learning how to share a great foot massage.\nOver the past few years stress and tension have become endemic. Helplessness, worry, anxiety and fear play a huge part in the experience of stress and tension, so too feelings of frustration, irritation, anger, and possibly rage can also become an unwanted experience.\nFoot massage is one wonderful way in which to help the body begin to relax, this effects the mind emotions, bringing calm and peace. In this state of relaxation we can begin to let go of the causes of tension and begin to see a way in being able to adapt to current matters.\nHi I'm Deborah and I've been a professional massage therapist for the last 2 decades and I've received messages from clients about how to help loved ones to relax and unwind from built up stress and tension. I recorded some videos to show how to share a relaxing massage, taking them through what items they need, some simple foot anatomy and demonstrated how to apply foot massage.\nMy clients found this a great way to help themselves and their loved one and passed this along to their friends. The feedback was amazing so I got to thinking maybe this could be something to share people far and wide and so I began to create this class, and now it is here, ready to share with you.\nIn this class I show you how I provide foot massage to my loved ones in easy to follow instructions. I've created a supplementary booklet for you to download to support your goal of sharing relaxation foot massage with your loved ones.\nI suggest you watch through the demonstration videos a few times and then you can practice on your loved one, friends and family. They can learn along with you and return the favour so you too can experience great relaxation, peace and calm.\nAt the end I have shared my personal mantra meditation that I listen to each day and supports a sense of freedom in a time of great restriction.",

You answered that too didn't you?\nUnderstanding and using, these simple mechanical principals opens doors to personal mastery, that you may previously have believed was available only to Monks and Yogi's.\n95% of our reactions to life happen in this way, that is a way that is triggered by a stimulus. Like the question, your mechanical mind is set in motion and your conscious mind has very little or no control over the process.\nYou see we are habits, a big fleshy bag of programs, these habits are virtually impossible to remove, but surprisingly easy to replace.\nThat is what The P.R.T Method does.\nWe have developed system that is so beautifully simple and effective that is works for everyone who uses it, regardless of education or social background.\nIt is never what a person says that offends us, it is our interpretation of what they say. How our mind processes it, so while we cannot change the information that we are receiving, we can change how it is processed instantly, and live free of excessive emotional responses to people to ourselves and to the world around us\nTry it out. Find a person who speaks a language that you do not, ask them to hurl insults at you, guess what, you wont feel a thing.\nThe words have no power over us until we assign our own understanding and importance to them.\nJoin the growing Tribe who have earned the key-ring, and now live with a clearer understanding of emotions and have a powerful and simple system that allows them to be in control of mood swings, negative thinking, fear, anger, stress, anxiety and know how to build deeper and stronger relationships.\nThe one that says\nP.R.T, Has set me free.",

      "description": "The Hive and Steem blockchains are referred to as the ecosystems because of the diverse activity that they support. Bloggers, photographers, artists, vloggers, developers, researchers, crypto-enthusiasts, alternative media, entrepreneurs, and many more have found their homes in the either the Hive or Steem Ecosystems. Unlike many other types of social platforms, Hive and Steem reward those that contribute to them. The power of reward distribution lies in the hands of the community.\n\n\nWhen I created this course in 2019, the Hive blockchain did not exist. In March 2020, Steem was Hard forked splitting into two separate blockchains. The original Steem Blockchain remained and a new blockchain Hive was created. The two blockchains are very similar in terms of what they offer (e.g. rewards for creating and curating content). The biggest difference between the two blockchains is control. Steem is a centralised blockchain controlled mostly by a single entity (i.e. Steemit). Whereas, Hive is run by the community and is considerably more decentralised. The videos in this course are explained in the context of Steem but they are more relevant to Hive. Additional resources and slides have been provided to show the equivalent Hive interfaces, DApps, and tools. Many of the DApps have either migrated from Steem to Hive or operate on both blockchains.\n\n\nThis course takes you on journey through the Steem and Hive Ecosystems. The course is broken down into 5 core sections and an additional section which will be updated with information regarding new developments. These sections are as follows:\n\n\n- Getting Started\n- Navigating Steem and Hive Frontends\n- Becoming a Steem or Hive User\n- Behind the Scenes\n- The Wonders of the Steem and Hive Ecosystems\n\n\nThe ‘Getting started’ Section introduces the Steem and Hive Ecosystems and provides a quick overview of some of their key features. This section explains what the blockchain is and provides some basic information about how the Steem and Hive blockchains operate. This section also explains how someone can sign up as well as buy and sell Steem or Hive.\n\n\nThe ‘Navigating Steem and Hive Frontends’ Section introduces several of the Hive and Steem User Interfaces. These include Steemit (Hive Blog on Hive), SteemPeak (Peakd on Hive), and Busy. The user interfaces enable users to post content to the Steem blockchain as well as access content posted to the blockchain.\n\n\nThe ‘Becoming a Steem and/or Hive User’ Section explains several key categories of users. These categories broadly include content creators, investors, curators, developers, gamers, readers/viewers/listeners, and those that want to try everything. This section demonstrates how to post content, vote for content, support projects and developers, and how to earn rewards as an investor in Hive or Steem.\n\n\nThe ‘Behind the scenes’ Section explains how the Hive and Steem Ecosystems operate and how they support all of the activity that takes place within them. This section is the most technical but is essential to explaining how the blockchain makes everything we see possible.\n\n\nThe ‘Wonders of the Steem and Hive Ecosystems’ Section explores many of the amazing features available in the Hive and Steem Ecosystem. Such features include the decentralised applications, which includes video platforms, games, photography applications, mobile applications and even a fitness application. Other features include numerous tools that can help navigate and analyse the ecosystem. The Hive and Steem Ecosystems even enable users to create their own tokens as well as tribes/communities.\n\n\nIf you are curious about what you have read so far, this course will provide you with all the information you need to make a decision about joining either Hive or Steem or both.\n\n\nIf you are already part of the Hive or Steem Ecosystems, this course will provide you with more information as to how you can further enhance your experience.",

      "description": "For thousands of years across every continent, spiritual traditions have taught us that when we become out of balance with the elements, and thereby the world around us, we suffer and feel disconnected. To feel connected to the world we inhabit internally and externally is key to our enjoyment and happiness in life. When we are connected we can feel whole and present and in our power. This teaching on how to work with the Five elements is drawn from the Tibetan Bon tradition and perhaps dates back beyond five millennia. The idea of this practice is to bring the natural world alive, and animate it both within and without us, focusing on unity beyond separation.\nThis course will teach you how to use a variety of simple but very beneficial and powerful healing techniques involving sacred seed syllable sounds for each of the five elements, hand gestures (mudra) and visualisations that add focus and additional power to your healing potential. The course focuses on simple heart essence, and inspires simplicity and direct communion with the elements.\nWorking with balancing the five elements inside and outside of us with no sense of separation creates the harmonics of joy and deep inner peace. You will learn to cultivate a beautiful relationship, a living participation with the world around you that leaves you feeling grounded and earthed in the now and flowing with all nature.",

There are some social and psychological tricks as well that you can use to make sure you're disciplined in your preparation.\nUse the strategies given in the course in one subject out of two. Calculate the improvement in your score in the one you applied the strategy and the subject you didn't apply the strategy to. For example, I was able to get from 69-100 in one subject applying the strategies.

I talk about what the best graphic novels are, so you know which ones are considered great, and are definite must reads. I talk about the various genres, whether you prefer science fiction, fantasy, action, thriller or just original stories. I also talk about what the various graphic novels are and how to collect them.

This enables you to fly any plane through almost any kind of weather and fly like the pros do. We focus on the Cessna 172 with a G1000 panel in MSFS (FS2020), although any simulator and airplane could work. You will eventually transition up to faster planes including the Beech Bonanza, The Cessna Citation Mustang TwinJet, and the CJ4.\n\n\nThis real-world curriculum starts with holding patterns. First without wind correction nor any kind of fix. Then we add more complexity to the scenario. Holding with wind correction, holding on NDBs, VORs, VOR intercepts and GPS fixes. Moving on to learning chart reading and interpretation, we learn about approaches to airports and missed approaches.\n\n\nTransitioning to deeper topics, we cover more details about SIDs and STARs, complete with explanations and demonstrations. IFR radio communications are broken down to be easily understood. Using the G1000 glass cockpit, found in many planes both in real life and in the simulator, you learn to manage all aspects of the panel along the way.\nWe eventually move on to faster planes that still have the G1000 such as the Bonanza and the Cessna Citation Mustang.\nAs a final tip in the course, we learn the basics of an FMS system in the CJ4 twinjet.",

In every section of the course I suggest practical steps you can take to move your own tree forwards. Each source of data that we explore is a step forward in building your own family tree.\nIn this course I'll give examples from how I built my own family tree, with parts back to the 16th century. I'll outline some of my own research and give a chance to \"meet\" a few of my ancestors. Their stories inspire me to continue my own research.\nThe main focus is on UK records, although the course will also be useful or anyone with ancestors who trace back to the UK or of general use to anyone learning about genealogy.\nWhat you need\nA computer with internet connection\nI recommend a subscription to ancestry .com as a tool although I do explore other tools.  Free time-limited subscriptions may be available.",

      "description": "The course attempts to help the student to grow in a relationship with Jesus. It presents a brief introduction about the Beatitudes followed by lectures dedicated to each Beatitude, amongst which the student learns of how the Beatitudes can be lived in our daily lives and equips the student to be a witness of Jesus to the people he meets each day.\nAs the Beatitudes according to the Gospel of Matthew are the ones that are the most commonly known, this course will focus upon this version as indicated in Matthew 5:3-10. Furthermore, as each Beatitude consists of two phrases: the condition and the promise, this course will explain each of these two phrases in separate lectures, so that to emphasise that the Beatitudes presents a new set of Christian ideals that focus on a spirit of love and humility.\nOverall, the aim of the course is to increase the students’ knowledge about the Beatitudes and most importantly to empower the student to have a living experience of the Beatitudes. As the course will cover the eight Beatitudes which Jesus taught during the Sermon on the Mount, by the end of the course, students are expected to appreciate the beauty of life through the blessings of the Beatitudes.\nHope you enjoy this course, and if you have time, take a look at the other Christian courses of mine.",

This course allows a novice to understand sigils and utilize them for their goals and allows more advanced practitioners a deeper understanding of how to utilize sigils and appropriately activate them.\nSigils are powerful symbols in magick that can evoke great amounts of power through their programmed energy and associations. They are artistic representations of intent that are empowered by the magickal practitioner for specific goals and desired outcomes. Power Words are linguistic symbols that magicians can use in their workings to invoke great power as well. In this course, you'll learn how to create power words from statements of intent and desire, how to translate them into sigils for magickal use, and how to create sigils that suit your individual desires and needs through three different methods.\nThis class discusses:\nHow to formulate statements of intent for focused spellwork.\nHow to create power words from those statements of intent.\nHow to create sigils from power words for work in magick.\nHow sigils influence the subconscious.\nHow the subconscious is our antenna for magick.\nUnderstandings from the discipline of psychology that speak to the efficacy of sigil magick and power word magick.\nMeditation skills to enhance your magickal practices and focus in overall life.\nActivation of sigils and power words.",

If you know quite a bit about fly fishing but want to improve your knowledge and skills, then this course is for you.\nI am Tom. I have been fly fishing all my life. At one point I was in your situation. I saw others on the river who were catching fish over and over. I wanted to be like that. From that point on I have devoted my life to learning the art of fly fishing.\nYou can spend countless days and hours researching what to do. There is so much information online that sometimes learning can be quite confusing.\nThat is why I created this course. I am giving you a couple of hours of EVERYTHING you need to know on how to start fly fishing. Don't waste days sifting through garbage on the internet. Don't get me wrong, the internet has amazing information on fly fishing, but one method may be taught 10 different ways so it can be hard to decide what is right.\nThis course will give you thousands of dollars of value and years and years of experience.",

Not drop shipping, not affiliate marketing, THIS.\n\n\nOver the past year, we’ve reached out to more than 250,000 influencers. Here’s our biggest takeaway:\n\n\nFollowing your passion is easier said than done. You need a structure and a strategy to do that. So we worked closely with 4 mega influencers and put together a complete, effective strategy to influencer success!\n\n\nThe exciting truth is that thousands of totally regular people we’re working with, who have no special skills or talents, are already living the dream as influencers. Brands are lining up, cash in hand, ready to pay them - just for posting on their page!\n\n\nYou might think you need to be Kim Kardashian to get paid by a brand. But the truth that most influencers have figured out is that brands don’t only care about that.\n\n\nYes, they do work with big influencers. But they need small influencers just as much. That means they love influencers with 3,000-20,000 followers.\n\n\nWhy? Because what they REALLY want is content for their advertisements, and word of mouth. And these are things you can provide right now, without needing 1m followers.\n\n\nThe training will teach you exactly how to reach out to these brands, even big ones like Forever 21, and strike deals which you will piggyback on.\n\n\nYour instructors will be Aubrey, Ciandra, Ray, and Aurora. Combined, they have over 1 million followers.\n\n\nBrands pay them anywhere from $250 to $1,000 just to get a post or story feature.\n\n\nThese influencers are just normal people. But they spent years of blood and sweat figuring out how the game works.\n\n\nThe good news? You don’t have to spend the same time and effort, or make their mistakes. You can just watch their training, learn what they did, and apply it to start growing immediately.\n\n\nSkeptical? Here are their profiles. Go see for yourself! @aubrey_red_ @mrjunho3 @aurorabowkett @love.ciandra.\n\n\nThis training contains 6 lessons on every aspect of the influencer journey.\n\n\nYou will learn (in detail) how to develop the right mindset for succeeding as an influencer, how to define a niche that you love AND connects with people, how to grow followers organically and stably, how to find brand collabs and reach out to them, and finally, how to keep growing consistently with Ciandra’s 14 viral tips.\n\n\nSince we started working with Ciandra a few months ago, she grew by almost 40,000 followers. In short, these methods work.\n\n\nSee you inside!",

      "description": "Hello “every body”,\nCreativity is far from being confined to the artistic world. Rethinking your life, reinventing your relationship, relaunching your career, sublimating the present and life ... everything in existence is associated with the creative dimension. No profession excludes it. In 2030, 70% of jobs do not yet exist, so they will have to be created.\nThis course has the virtue that it is practical, offering a hundred exercises on which to work while having fun and opening you to endless perspectives which you will be amazed... Also, if you play the game, thanks to a good mindset and some discipline, your life will change drastically. I can assure you in advance that you will do wonders and the Great Book of Life will prove to be even more interactive in its daily reading and co-writing.\nThus, I have the pleasure to offer you this very rich course (over 10 hours) offering in a pragmatic way, in a fun form more than a hundred tools and exercises in order to stimulate one’s creativity consisting of the master key for a more harmonious life. There is no field, discipline, or subject that does not require creativity. It is necessary for transcendence in order to solve problems and generate new perspectives, new ideas.\nAs Albert Einstein said: \"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\" However, we are in a period of transition where we are all invited individually and collectively to be inventive and creative with regard to our human condition. However, we will do it with joy and good humor, having a good time. Einstein also said, \"Creativity is intelligence having fun.\"\nI assure you that this course aims to change your perception of Life by inviting you to inject color into a life that is sometimes somewhat black and white.\nThis course has been offered in the biggest business and fashion schools of various prestigious schools around the world for very different profiles: MBA, Masters, BBA ... as well as here at the orphanage in Bali where I teach it.\n\n\nLast but not least, I share with you my YouTube channel\nJust type “Aurelien Millot Master Key(s)” you will find it.\nIn all humility, it tries to raise many existential questions: the meaning of life, happiness, the power of the present moment, Epicureanism, the Hereafter, energy, space-time, consciousness, the multiverse, reincarnation, spirituality in general, to modestly help to give keys for people to open themselves embodying their own master key, find themselves their own voice and access to fulfillment. This is like everything I do, trying to build up a momentum of lucidity, optimism, and pragmatism...\n\n\nSee you soon\nSincerely yours,\nAM",

I could have improved much faster but I didn't have a course like this. So my promise is that you will improve much faster than I did. In this course I will teach you how to build discipline, how to build aesthetic physique, how to improve sleep, how to be more productive and much more. I did my best to help you guide you through your self-improvement. This course is for young men but it doesn’t matter whether you’re young or old.

So, when we give equal importance to everything, our energy is wisely distributed without causing any imbalance between our inner and outer worlds.

I was introduced to reiki just over three years ago when i was sick and in the hospital.  A kidney stone was blocking a duct in my gull bladder. This was a common occurrence amongst the women in my family. The doctors in the hospital wanted to remove my gull bladder but i was not okay with this.  One of my friends offered to perform reiki on me and within a few hours all the pain I had been experiencing for days was gone. Upon a new ultrasound the doctors could see the stone had dislodged and dropped back into the gull bladder.\nThis was when i knew that i needed Reiki healing in my life. I began my journey of studying level 1 reiki and fell in love with it, Over the next year and a half i studied level 2 and eventually level 3. Now i do my best to incorporate reiki into as many areas of my life as well as the lives of those i love.\n\n\nI am a trained medical aesthetician, nurse, reiki teacher, coach and student counsellor. I run two business, Pink Candy Co. a medical aesthetics company and Inner Harmony Life Services, a Coaching, Healing and Counselling company.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns please reach out to me via my company email and not udemy as the majority of the time the messages do not come through.\n\n\nThe course is 3 hours in length and notes will be mandatory to help you study and learn. With that being said good luck and i hope you enjoy the course.",

It also emphasizes the importance of God's role in Mankinds life and how it can greatly define the outcome of one's ultimate destiny by understanding the spirtual journey completely that guides to enlightenment. It also shines the light on the dark characteristics that tend to trap us and offers a solution to battle evil with that which is good through the power of light within.

Take a stand against chemicals in ecosystems, bodies and homes and find freedom from what marketing tells you you need for beauty & cleanliness.

Knowledge is power! So inform yourself and equip yourself with the alternatives. You will never go back!\n\n\nBesides the health & ecosystem benefits, learning these solutions saves you TONS of money. We did the math on surface spray and listen to this. The ingredients to make 5 liters of bioenzyme concentrate, which after dilution becomes 50 liters of surface spray, cost $1 USD. An average store bought surface spray is $4 USD and about 500 ml. That means that 50 liters of store bought surface spray would cost $400  and we are making it for $1!\n\n\nWe could do the same math for all of these products to soon realize that one year of DIY products can save $1,000 USD or more! Now if that isn't an incentive to make the switch, I don't know what is.\n\n\nNote: two sections in this course 'Soapnut' & 'Shikakai' are products that are readily found in India, where we live. In those sections I give great alternatives for other saponin-rich plants available for use as liquid soap in Western countries and around the world.",

The learning has to be on and executable with the march of time and tide.\nFun in classrooms is a requisite. As teachers, we must not use technology as a silicon coating but harness the power of technology to connect with our students. No more, it is about copying and pasting, which we have had been doing over the years. To control corrupt politicians, PowerPoint corrupts the teachers if it has just slides and no explanations. For a matter of thought and intelligence, the platform should share for show rather than expecting it to be the only parcel for knowledge delivery. There is a specific need to implement a new way of teaching through technology, and hence a digital pedagogy is required the most. The teachers need to introspect how children may learn in this networked environment. We can’t simply take a textbook and deliver it digitally; somewhat, the need here is to explore the power to harness the best via connectivity and creativity to connect.\nWe can’t think and re-discover the chalkboard and make it an intelligent board to deliver knowledge. What is required is a novel mindset of love, care, and delivery of priorities for our children within classrooms. We ultimately need a different paradigm for teaching, a different pedagogy that talks about creation, control of chaos, connection to correcting, and consumption to creation. The teachers need to change their thinking of how they are going to use technology in education.\nHave great learning. Cheers.\nThe priority in particular at large!",

Parking buildings and car parks can be full of hazards like poles and kerbs; parallel parking scares some people so much that they drive around and around trying to find a space they can pull into forwards; even basic reversing is tricky for some, let alone if you have a trailer.\nThis course is presented by 20-year veteran driving instructor Duncan Seed of 2 Drive Safe. He's been an Approved Driving Instructor in the UK and is an I-endorsed driving instructor in New Zealand. He's a member of the Institute of Advanced Motorists and is accomplished in driving and instructing drivers of all types of vehicles. He'll take you right from the basics of recognising blind spots and setting your vehicle up correctly right through to analysing complex situations where you have to reverse into narrow spaces with multiple hazards. You'll also learn how to reverse a trailer and how to use a spotter.\nWhether you want to pass your practical driving tests more easily, you're a company driver who wants to improve their skills behind the wheel, you've bought a trailer and you need to learn better techniques for moving it, or you're just an interested member of the public that doesn't want a huge bill for repairing an annoying dent, this course has you covered.\nIn this course we drive on the left (the same as the UK, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Japan, etc), but the techniques and tips are equally as valid in countries that drive on the right such as the USA and Canada.",

If you can fly the Cessna 172 you will easily be able to fly the RED HAWK. A truly amazing aircraft, you can even do air to air refuelling and land on aircraft carriers with this.\n\"Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward. For there you have been, and there you will always long to return.\"\nLeonardo da Vinci.\nFlight Training can be very slow and expensive. Whether you fly as a student or fly as an experienced pilot, every hour of flight costs you loads of money. You don’t have much control. Well with VR Flight sim you gain the control. You set yourself up once and practice whenever you want and for as long as you want. Let me be your guide into the VR World. Buy this course and learn everything you need to know.\nThe USAF train their jet fighter pilots with the VR headset and the controllers. If it is good enough for the air force it must be good...and it certainly is.\nStart in the Cessna 172 one of the best trainers in the world and learn to fly the easy way then go on to learn multi engine or tail wheels even helicopters. Flight simulators for PC and Mac are great fun to play with, but do you seriously want to learn how to fly? Have you got the money or the time? are you too old? do you have a medical condition that would stop you? My course is designed to teach you everything you need to know so that at the end you will know whether to commit thousands and thousands of your cash to a flying school, or simply enjoy the pleasures of proper flying on a flight simulator going anywhere you like anywhere in the world. Do something impressive, Learn to FLY! I got my pilots licence in 1996 and regularly fly the flight simulator because I can learn to fly aircraft I would never be able to fly in real life through lack of money or opportunity.\nFlying with the VR headset is awesome. It is better than flying the real thing in my opinion because it is free and safe.\nThe Cessna 172 Skyhawk is a four-person, high-wing single-engine aircraft manufactured by the Cessna company . The Cessna 172 is the most manufactured aircraft in history and probably the most popular training aircraft in the world.\nThe first models manufactured were delivered in 1956 and it continues to be manufactured, with the number of devices manufactured at more than 43,000 units until 2012 . 1 The Skyhawk's main competitors have been the Piper Cherokee , the Beechcraft Musketeer and the Grumman Cheetah (the latter two are no longer manufactured), and later on the DA40 Star and Symphony SA-160 .\nThe early 172s were virtually identical to the Cessna 170s , with the same stern shape and the same high landing gear bars, though later versions incorporated a revised landing gear, lower rear, and stern window. Cessna advertised this modification as \"Omnivision\". The definitive structural development, reached in the mid -sixties , consisted of the glue still used today. The profile of the plane was hardly modified since then, mainly undergoing updates in the avionics and motorization including (especially in 2005 ) the glass cabin Garmin G1000. Production stopped in the mid- 1980s, but it was resumed in 1996 with the Cessna 172R and Cessna 172SP models with respectively 120 kW (160 hp) and 135 kW (180 hp) of power.\nThe old Skyhawks were delivered with a 110 kW (145 hp) Continental O-300 engine, while later versions mounted 135 kW (180 hp) Lycoming O-360 thrusters , although the 110 or 120 kW O-320 versions are more common. In addition there are a few units that mounted 164 kW (220 hp) Franklin engines.",

A car that is unfit for purpose, unreliable that ends up costing you hundreds if not thousands of pounds to fix. When your car is an absolute necessity i.e. you intend to use it for commuting to work, or if you have small children, the thought of it constantly breaking down on you is an inconvenience and frustrating experience that you want to avoid.\nCars are the common don’t judge a book by its cover story. Sometimes you see a car that looks great structurally, the body looks all intact, clean and in good order; but appearances can be deceiving and quite often doesn’t tell you what could be hiding under the bonnet. This car could have serious and persistent mechanical issues that you will only become aware of when you have parted with your hard earned cash possibly never to see the seller again.\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way.\nIn this course, you'll learn a simple, easy to apply inspection routine from an experienced mechanic. This is the same routine that he uses to inspect cars for himself and clients. Along the way he throws in a few tips and tricks of the trade. The best part is, this vehicle inspection can be completed in as little as 10 minutes! These insights and hacks could save you thousands of pounds by ensuring that you avoid buying cars that are certain to break down.

You may have questions like, why is the recycling symbol on this if I can't recycle it? Or simply, is this recyclable? What do I do with batteries and lightbulbs? etc. In this course you will learn the history of trash in America and why it is so opaque. You will learn how recycling works, what plastic resins are recyclable, why we need clean streams of recycling, and why we should care about recycling. You will learn about wishcycling, and how to avoid it, what is recyclable, and ultimately answer the question: is recycling worth it. Then you can share all of this important knowledge with your friends and family!\nI started this recycling training for the food service industry and soon realized that this information would be very helpful to the public at large. I received my AS in Recycling and Resource Management and interned with the U.S. Plastics Pact, a non-profit committed to assisting large brands to reduce their plastic footprint. I have been trained as a TRUE Zero Waste Advisor, and recently started my own non-profit, Recycle Right. I hope you enjoy this course!",

Among the many methods of magick are sigils, upon which I derived the handy sigil magick method, incorporating many disciplines to create something new and useful to any magickal practitioner.\nIn this course, I present my personal method of activating sigils. Built from astrological correspondences, palmistry, elemental correspondences, kinesic magick, sigil magick, deep visualization and empowered energy work. The Handy Sigil Magick method can be used by anyone from novices to advanced practitioners to deepen their practices in magick to create and activate sigils for short-term and long-term goals.\nCall forth the energies of the universe through kinesthetic sigil magick. Sigils are symbols that activate charged will, creativity and imagination, allowing magicians to communicate with beings and manipulate energies. Traditionally, sigils are activated through various techniques, from the recitation of a word of power, visualization, or undeterred focus. Explore how to create sigils and activate them in spellwork through a structured system of gestures and movements that activate intention and will throughout the mind, body, and spirit. By pulling from astrology, palmistry, and psychology, Handy Sigil Magick presents a new way of working with sigils for any magician to use in their workings.",

I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the you personality in it. It's good because it doesn't seem as if I'm reading another boring lecture, but instead, genuineness...and so I learn. I love how you ask questions throughout that allows room for reflection. I don't see anything that can be improved because everything is perfect as is.\"\n\n~ Diana, Florida\n************\n“Allowah is bringing a beautiful teaching – learning – sharing experiencial platform of equality and self-growth.

      "description": "Hello \"every body\",\nThe goal of this free course is to reach HARMONY and also to aspire to an eternal AWAKENING with 30 advice which is simple and operational for your daily life. These tools are supposed to be clearly explained, to put in practice immediately and change your life straight away.\n\n\nThis awakening should occur at any level, at any scale, necessary for the future, in order to individually and collectively build a new paradigm, an era in which humans and nature take precedence over profit and then proximity, kindness, tolerance sew up the global worldwide social fabric...\n\n\nEveryone needs everyone, but as Gandhi said: \"Be the change you want to see in this world\". Consequently, the work begins with oneself, working on one’s vibrations, possibly cleaning and shaping one’s philosopher's stone and then reaching out and going forward without resentment but to resend a new momentum of hope with balm at the heart...\n\n\nNB: In addition to that, as a kind of bonus and for free, I share with you my YouTube channel\n\n\nJust type “Aurelien Millot Master Key(s)” you will find it. It is for opening your mind, discovering new perspectives of life in general for those who are on a certain quest for the meaning of life… If I detail a bit, in all humility, it tries to raise many existential questions: the meaning of life, happiness, the power of the present moment, Epicureanism, the Hereafter, energy, space-time, consciousness, the multiverse, reincarnation, spirituality in general, to modestly help to give keys for people to open themselves embodying their own master key, find themselves their own voice and access to fulfillment. This is like everything I do, trying to build up a momentum of lucidity, optimism, and pragmatism...\n\n\nWishing you an amazing inner/outer eternal journey!\n\n\nWith Light & Love\nAM (Aurélien Millot)",

You may wish to do this all in the morning, or even watch the short video the evening before then complete your workbook and activity the following day. The main thing is to stay committed to your practice.\nDon't worry if you find some things easier or more enjoyable, that is completely normal.

      "description": "Welcome\nThank you for joining us today. I wanted to create a personal program where you could engage in online acting classes and learn from the convenience of your own home at your own personalized and designed pace. Online acting classes are not always the easiest to come by, nor are the choices out there always so easy to decide upon. So I made it my goal to put out a program that was easy to decide on, leaving any confusion or hassle to deal with at the door. I also wanted to make the program affordable for actors, because I know how tight money can sometimes be, so I put the program at a targeted price that you couldn't find anywhere else, nor would you find the guaranteed return policies that I made sure to include. I did this for the actor, so there would be no worries to decide upon this course or not. This course offers over 10 hours of acting knowledge from some of the best and most trained actors I've had the privilege to work with. I mentioned all of the benefits above, but here's what I didn't tell you, there's still so much more to be offered through this course that hasn't been talked about. If you see the benefits of enrolling in online acting classes and having the ability to work from your own home at your own personalized and designed pace, than I can tell you with the deepest confidence, that you're on the right track.\nMany of you may already know who I am, depending on how you found me, but for those of you who don't, I'll take a moment to explain. Trust me when I say this, in the beginning, my acting wasn't anything to be admired, it was horrific, if I'm being completely honest, the initial training I received, made it that much worse. Nothing was working for me, but I truly had something that NO other actor around me possessed... work ethic. As I mentioned before, my acting didn't start out being anything special, but I sought to make a change and not let where I started be a definition for what I could achieve. So I did what I believed I had to do, because I really wanted to be the best. I didn't want to settle for mediocrity or just being \"okay,\" so I sought out to get the best instruction in the world. I acquired a new set of mentors to guide me on the successful path and through this journey I discovered what truly worked and what didn't. I found out what acting nonsense I could get rid and only kept in what truly mattered. My goal was to break everything down to the bare essentials. I don't care for having to spend 20 hours creating a character when I know I could easily achieve the same results in two or less. From this journey, I really started to question everything and asked myself, \"Why is acting made out to be so complicated... Why must I learn a thousand approaches in order stand up and talk in a given moment with a given circumstances?\" If we can break acting down simply, it becomes much easier to comprehend and much smoother of a process to work on/develop.\nMy mentors have come from Julliard, Harvard, Yale, RADA, and A.C.T, I also took it upon myself to work with phenomenal actors who NEVER went to drama school (we call them Street Actors) to see what commonalities they all shared. As I began to learn what those things were, I took it upon myself to create an easier way to working, which then brings us to this course.\nThroughout this 10hr experience, I will only be giving you what works. All the random nonsense instructors have tried to teach you in the past, stays at the front door. I do not want to hear how you have previously worked or the poor training you have obtained from your instructors, because I've heard it all before and I know what they've been teaching you. I DO NOT work with random ideologies, it does not get us anywhere, it will only slow your process down and force you to over exert yourself unnecessarily. My approach, is the practical one. If it's not practical or reasonable for the actor, I won't teach it. Through this course, I will give you all I know.\nI hope to see you soon.",

      "description": "If you’ve been thinking about your life’s purpose, this course is for you. At a certain point in our lives, and it happens at different times for everyone, we start questioning the meaning of life and what all of this is about. When this occurs, it is really a kind of awakening, seeing that there is something more to life than meets the eye. If you pay attention to this pull, and lean into it, there is an opportunity for tremendous growth. The thing is, there’s no one answer, and there’s no one person who can tell you the answer. You have to find it for yourself.\n\n\nEspecially now, with everything that is going on in the world, many of us are looking at our purpose anew. We’re having to reinvent ourselves, to somehow fit in with all the changes going on all around us. It’s a natural time to be questioning, and a natural time to look within and make our own changes.\n\n\nWe are not born by accident. We are here for a very specific reason. Over time we start to see that, and when we understand how the process works then we can participate in it more fully. One secret is that finding our purpose is one of the great purposes of our lives. And that purpose is probably something different than you think it is.\n\n\nOur life experiences are pointing us towards it all the time if we just pay attention. But there are so many distractions in life that it’s easy to lose focus, to get off-path. The ancient wisdom of the four yogas, or the four dharmic paths that lead us to our purpose, are there to guide us, to give us a very clear direction to take. These four paths, or dharmas, are Bhakti: The path of love and devotion; Karma: The path of work and service; Jnana: The path of knowledge; and Raja: The path of meditation.\n\n\nIn this course we take a deep dive into each of these paths, and into the meaning that they can bring to our lives.\n\n\nKnowing your purpose can help guide you to the right and perfect occupation for yourself. And, if you’re feeling like the job you’re in is not the one for you, it can help you to see your purpose in it anyway. You can live your purpose in any occupation. It’s not just about what you do, but more importantly it’s about how you do it, and what you learn from it.",

      "description": "Welcome to my Udemy course with a primary focus on the role of occupational therapy in diabetes management.\nParticipants will explore the role of occupational therapy in diabetes care and self-management. This course was designed to provide diabetes-related information to occupational therapists, individuals with diabetes, and healthcare professionals in order to support and empower individuals with diabetes. At the end of this course, participants will develop a deeper understanding of diabetes and the important role occupational therapists can have through the diagnosis. By the completion of this course, healthcare professionals including occupational therapists will learn about the diagnosis and how they can be involved and support all individuals following a diabetes diagnosis. Individuals with diabetes can learn strategies to implement in their daily routines in order to support their journey with diabetes.\nI completed my doctoral capstone project at Clarinda Regional Health Center, a rural hospital. I had the opportunity to work with an occupational therapist and a diabetes educator to determine the current challenges and interventions. From this, I was able to create educational handouts and advocate for OT in diabetes management. I look forward to sharing this information with you. I have created all the content and handouts based on research and clinical experience while completing my capstone.\nThank you for your interest in this course. Please send me a message for further questions or discussion on this topic. I hope you enjoy the course!",

While science has revolutionized the way we live, it has almost nothing to say about consciousness, spirituality, or happiness. We will delve into why this is so and explore how the concepts of science can be extended to a living universe.\nWe will re-establish spiritual connections to the basic principles of physics and chemistry, and see that the laws of science are consistent with the concepts of animism. By extending science in this way, we open up the possibility of studying the spiritual and emotional layers of life.\nIn addition to exploring the spiritual dimensions of science, we will also examine the social and political implications of these ideas. By touching on Marxist theory, we will gain new tools for understanding cultural revolution and the ways in which science can be used to empower marginalized communities.\nOverall, this course offers a unique perspective on the relationship between science, spirituality, and culture. Throughout this course, students will gain a deeper understanding of the limitations of science and the possibilities for extending it to encompass a wider range of human experiences",

However, this undeniable nugget of wisdom is just the tip of the millionaire’s iceberg.\n\nThe harsh reality is there is a careful balance of wealth and poverty in the world. If you act in one way you will become rich and have everything you desire. Act another way and you will stay among the majority who struggle to cope with never quite having enough.\n\nThe truth is it doesn’t matter who the president is, what the economy is doing or any other peripheral element that could be used as an excuse. People become millionaires regardless of the external environment.\n\nNo matter what changes on a political or economic level the balance of wealth and poverty will remain the same. The 80% majority will remain poor and the 20% elite will keep getting richer.\n\nThe question is, which group do you want to be a member of?\n\nPeople in the 80% will never buy this book, ever! Why? Because they will read the blurb on the back and immediately decide that ‘it sounds too good to be true’.\n\nMeanwhile people in the 20% understand that extreme levels of wealth have nothing to do with life being fair, luck or even hard work. Becoming a millionaire is a question of mindset and religiously following a precise system.\n\nThe blueprints for a house are not suggestions but rather exact steps to be adhered to. If followed to the letter you will get what you aimed for. Likewise, this book is a blueprint for extreme wealth and abundance. Over 50,000 people are testament to the results of following the Millionaire University program, and they are all in the 20% of life.\n\nAre you the next?",

All of this is broken down into simple terms, and easily understandable.\nThe meditations are designed to allow you to go deeper into the practice effortlessly. I have specifically designed the meditations using mindfulness techniques, breathwork and mantras to assist you into a lifelong habit of daily meditation practice. You will practice from 8 minutes to 21 minutes over the course of 21 days.\nMeditation is a wonderful tool that I wish for as many people as possible to practice. So many people are under the illusion it's too hard, it's for other people, they can't do it. I am going to dispel these thoughts, and allow you to realise that this practice is for you.\nNot only in this course do I teach you about meditations, I take you through guided meditations, where we explore different styles and techniques. You will experience different methods in a very simple manner.\nWe also explore breathwork. Again I guide you through the techniques, and give you an introduction to the benefits of this practice. Breathwork is a particularly beneficial tool to use in meditation, and one you can take into your day as well.\nThis really is a complete meditation package, and one I am sure you will benefit from greatly.

In 2020, over 2,000 students enrolled in this course. I think what made it a success was its simplicity, so I am honoring that, but I needed to take the budget and record keeping into the 21st century and better serve the students I'd gotten to know through such a universally rocky time. I hope you enjoy the new and improved 5 Week Personal Finance Transformation!\nMy original worksheets will still be made available in the course, but now you can create a digital budget in a spreadsheet that grows with you! Each month, you'll create a new tab so you can make a new 'Financial Snapshot' each month and track your progress! I'm also giving you an awesome solution for holding yourself accountable in your 'Flexible Spending' categories.\nHave debt? We're going to create a plan for that, too. After we've secured enough in your Emergency Fund, of course.\nIf you've ever felt un-empowered or dis-empowered financially, those days are over.\nI'm going to teach you what you need to know now and plant seeds for future studying. You'll walk away from this course in control of your finances, knowing exactly where you are between 'Stability and Abundant Wealth'. I'll give you tips for celebrating and tell you why milestones are important. Finally at the end, you'll start breaking down some of the false beliefs commonly held around money and the reality that will transform your relationship with it for good.",

For there you have been, and there you will always long to return.\"\nLeonardo da Vinci.\nFlight Training can be very slow and expensive. Whether you fly as a student or fly as an experienced pilot, every hour of flight costs you loads of money. You don’t have much control. Well with VR Flight sim you gain the control. You set yourself up once and practice whenever you want and for as long as you want. Let me be your guide into the VR World. Start learning what you need to know.\nThe USAF train their jet fighter pilots with the VR headset and the controllers. If it is good enough for the airforce it must be good...and it certainly is.\nPilots often take 2 sides on what is the best training aircraft, the Pa 28 or the Cessna 172. The answer is they are both very good at what they do. They both have pluses and minuses, however it is really down to personal preference. I learned to fly and got my pilots licence on the PA 28 161 warrior, so I am very fond of them however out of the two I would rather fly the C 172. It is not because it is better it just suits my needs better. In this course I will explain everything.\nLearning to fly in VR is better in my opinion. much cheaper and safer than in real life, then at the end of the day you can decide if you want to spend over 10 grand on a licence of not.",

You'll ask yourself: What is that object? Why is the sky moving? How can I understand the cosmos?\nWhen you look a the same sky with knowledge, being able to name objects, explain their movements and look deeper into the spaces between the stars, your curiosity will take over. You will want to learn more, see more, discover the universe.\nThis course you will get started.\nDiscover what you can see without a telescope.\nLearn how to identify what the objects are, a star, a planet, even galaxies and nebulae.\nFind your dark sky so that you can see more, and go deeper into the universe.\nAbout your host\nI'm Lisa Harvey, host of Everyday Astronomers and this mini-course. I wanted to create a place where people could unleash their curiosity and discover new things about the universe, meet like-minded people and share the joy of discovery.\nI've been watching the stars for decades and my telescope has taken me to the most beautiful places in space.\nI've spent a lot of time creating online communities and online courses and now I can combine this experience with my passion for amateur astronomy.\nAbout this course?\nAfter founding Our Wide Sky a few years ago, many people have asked for beginner tips and information. There is very little available that takes the approach of curiosity and wonder. Most are highly technical, with a lot of science, which does not always suit a beginner.\nThis course was created with the real beginner in mind. Someone, like you who does not want complicated models and diagrams. Someone, like you who wants to understand a small amount and then choose to move on\nThe course is videos with transcripts, some text lessons and resources such as checklists and workbooks.\nThis course is designed for people who know only that they want to know more about the night sky.\nBe a Knowledgeable Stargazer\nThis is a mini-course, and not intended to go into depth about subject matter. Other Everyday Astronomer courses will take you deeper into your astronomy knowledge. But you will get enough information to be able to identify objects, know about what you can see and explain how the sky moves above your head.\nThis is a quick introduction that gives you a place to start with your visual, naked eye observing.\nYou'll learn:\nLearn how to observe without a telescope.\nDiscover how the sky moves.\nUnderstand why the stars are different in Summer and in Winter.\nFind out what you can see from where you are.\nLearn the easy ways to identify the objects you see.\nFind the best place for you to view the stars.\nJust looking at the stars is a moving experience. Imagine how much more satisfying it can be if you know just a little bit more.",

Most people erroneously think about crystals and feathers when they hear about Native American mindfulness, but few know the best-kept secrets of Native American philosophy. Medicine wheels are keys that open the door to understanding human psychology. The most important medicine wheel of all is the Wheel of Life. It's a key to understanding all of the others, much like the key on a map. Native Americans before 1492 shared this information widely, and now you can learn this ancient technique. Nothing will be able to throw you off balance when your happiness comes from within. This is an introduction to the Native Strength system. The Native Strength system will leave you feeling empowered, motivated, and in control of your destiny.  Understanding that our self-esteem must come from within and learning to hear the voices of our inner elders sets us free from the fear-feeders. These fear-feeder voices simply feed on our fears. The more we listen to the voices of our inner elders and inner children, the harder it is for the fear-feeders to be heard. This course will help you hear your inner elders' voices clearly, filling you with self-esteem and the inspiration you need to succeed.",

      "description": "The most detailed survey of global faiths.\nThe varied assortment of global religions serves as an example of humanity's rich and complex spiritual interactions. Religion, a durable and long-standing part of our cultural history, has undergone significant changes throughout time, resulting in the creation and demise of different belief systems as well as the formation of new spiritual identities. The study of religion is increasingly important in light of the problems and possibilities given by the twenty-first century, as it provides a vital knowledge of the intricate network of religions, rituals, and social institutions that shape human life.Silbermann, 2005.\nThe fundamental goal of this inquiry is to recognize that religion functions as a \"meaning system\" (Silberman, 2005), a unique framework that not only meets the need for purpose but also impacts the well-being of both people and communities. The deep and complicated relationship between the desire for meaning in life and religious faith has been widely acknowledged, with several studies demonstrating religion's ability to offer a sense of purpose, understanding, and psychological support. Furthermore, the historical record shows that religion played an important part in the growth of human civilization, laying the groundwork for systematic learning, the founding of libraries and universities, and the cultural foundations of communities across the globe.\nHowever, the religious story is not without of complexities. Our ancestors' ideas and actions developed alongside those of the global society. Some religions have gone extinct during the last five millennia, while global faiths like Islam and Christianity have grown in popularity. Furthermore, new spiritual identities that defy traditional classification have evolved.Krok (2014) Silberman, 2005.(Jackson et al. 2021).The source is listed as (Jackson et al., 2021). Because religion is fluid and dynamic, it is critical to understand the factors that drive religious change, which include the impact of scientific and technological advancement as well as sociopolitical changes.\nOur comprehension of the many spiritual interactions among people is not the only advantage of studying the complex interweaving of global faiths; it also gives useful ideas that may affect our tactics for personal and social wellbeing in the current day. According to Baker et al. (2020), academics are looking at how the adoption of \"social distancing\" and the disruption of conventional religious activities affects the role of religion in the lives of people and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "description": "This course will give you the information and confidence you need to make high-quality, customized carbon-fiber/epoxy tubes that are used in international competition rocketry. This was used by the USA team to win the silver medal in the 2021 World Space Modeling Championships held in Romania. The key to winning was having ultra-lightweight rockets made from carbon-fiber that had a low-drag surface which was a result of being a customized shape and being glass-smooth. This is the latest cutting edge in technology!\nThese are primary objectives of the carbon-fiber tubes made in this course:\n\n\nLight weight tubes - lighter than anything made from fiberglass cloth/epoxy\nDurable - strong enough to handle rough handling, and the forces of a high velocity rocket launch\nSuper smooth surface finish - so that the tubes look good and have a low skin friction drag coefficient\nAir Tight - The outer shell holds air pressure, which is needed in order for the ejection charge to push out the recovery device\nConsistency - We want each tube we make to have the same properties\nEase of manufacture - We don't want to have to be a skilled artist to make these tubes. Everyone should have success!\nThe keys to achieving these objectives comes down to these items:\nKnowledge - You have to know what is important during the process, and what isn't. That is why you will find this course invaluable, because it offers you the information that isn't available anywhere else. Having this wisdom will save you an enormous amount of time and frustration.\nTools - Unfortunately, there is one tool — the \"mold\" — that is absolutely critical to making the carbon-fiber tubes. We'll describe this in detail so you can have it made to the correct specifications needed for success. Additionally, there are a number of assembly tools that will be needed in order to complete the construction of these tubes. You'll learn what they are, and how they are created.\nMaterials - The basic materials required for making these tubes are two types of carbon-fiber and epoxy. But that by itself doesn't give you a high-quality tube that meets the primary objectives. There are other \"secret ingredients\" which are also necessary for success. In this course, you'll be shown what they are and why they are absolutely critical to making tubes successfully.\nProcess - An example of a \"process\" is baking a cake from the individual ingredients. Even if you have all the correct ingredients, you have to follow a specific sequence of events and specific techniques of putting things together. What you'll see in this course are the unique techniques that aren't available anywhere else.\nThe result from this course is you'll be able to make tubes that are as lightweight and smooth as anyone in the world. You'll also come away with skills that you can use in other hobbies as well, like building lightweight carbon-fiber model airplanes. They can also be scaled up to make larger hobby rockets as well.",
      "target_audience": [
        "Rocketeers and hobbyists that want to learn the cutting edge techniques and strategies that will yield a tube that is so lightweight that it seems to float as it descends to the ground. You don't have to have experience building model rockets, but it certainly helps."
