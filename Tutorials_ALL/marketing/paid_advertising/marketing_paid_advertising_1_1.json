Lets keep reading!\n\n\nNow you might be wondering \"How do I know all this stuff and I don't\"\nWell let's just say I have had my fair share of experience and knowledge in the corporate world, and have applied such techniques in marketing and media so I am pretty qualified for this subject.\nNeuroscience is a growing topic where Universities are finally starting to connect the dots with how our minds function, what makes us tick, and what humans truly desire. Corporations pay these neuroscientists ALOT of money, just so that they can use these tactics to influence their audience more by pressing the \"Buy Button\" in our brains. Thus fueling emotional desires.\nIts just the human obsession to look good and gain quick satisfaction. Companies fuel these desires and lock us in a emotional loop hole of obsession for materialistic things that don't truly benefit us.\n\nWell I think im gonna stop talking now..... if you are still not convinced, I am offering a '100% 30-Day Money Back Guarantee' if you feel this program did not reach your expectations.\nBut if your ego still says 'no im good' then thats fine, not everyone is able to handle the truth about the world, which is why only the select few actually finish this program before they start denying the material.\nBUT! If you are confident you can handle the truth, and you want to walk around with confidence that you are making your own decisions, Go ahead and Order Now, and receive your program Today!\nP.S. Understanding corporate manipulation can give you the confidence that you are making the right buying decisions, and so you are not locked in a world that 99% of people are trapped in.

      "description": "What if I told you that you can run profitable ads WITHOUT paying for them? You'd probably think I'm crazy right?\nWell, I must inform you that this is 100% possible and it's done by offsetting your cost per acquisition.\nFor example, you sell personal training sessions. Before running your ads, you will have to find out how much it costs to acquire a new customer.\nLet's say you sell your sessions for $100. If your cost per acquisition is $20 then you will want to offer a \"bump offer\" or small end product before your potential customer signs up for a full price session.\nWithout doing this, you'll only end up profiting $80 per initial session. However, as an example you could sell cheap meal plan for $19.99 and it's a 1 time offer. When you generate a lead for your personal training session, you're offering this low cost item first which will offset your cost per acquisition.\nIn simple terms, you're using small end products/services to offset the cost of acquiring a new customer.\nWhen you do this with running profitable ads, you will see exactly how much it costs to acquire a customer from your paid ads. This is called Cost Per Conversion.\nThis course dives deep into how to set up a successful Ads account. You'll end this course knowing exactly how to master Google Ads.\nSome of the best lessons in the course include:\nSetting up KPI reports\nSpying on competitors ad performance\nFinding high quality keywords\nSetup remarketing ads\nBreaking down ad performance\nSetting up highly profitable ads for your small business\nThis course is designed for all small business owners because it was built by a small business owner. When you understand how paid ads work, you have the ability to completely dominate your online marketing. That is what you will learn in this course.\nI hope to see you on the inside of this jam packed course.",

The online advertisements appear as sponsored results on Google search engine result pages or display ads on websites and mobile apps in Google’s Network. The platform assigns each ad a page position based on the bid's size combined with the advertisement’s quality (determined by Google’s Quality Score metric). The business then pays via a Cost Per Click (CPC) model for the number of clicks the ad receives. Within the Google Ads platform, businesses can view their online ads' metrics and performance, set goals for their advertising efforts, and set audience targeting parameters.\nDo Google Ads work for small businesses?\nGoogle Ads can work well for small businesses when optimizing keywords and targeting relevant online audiences. Since millions of consumers use Google every day to search for products and services, advertising through Google Ads can be a great way for a business to get in front of consumers searching for similar offerings. The success of Google Ads for a small business often depends on the nature of the products and services, the keywords the business chooses to bid on, and their methods for targeting the right customers online. Google Ads is a good fit for small businesses that operate primarily or entirely online, businesses with a high customer lifetime value (LTV), and businesses that can benefit from targeting their customers geographically or by online search interest.\nHow successful are Google Ads?\nWith the right advertising strategy, Google Ads can be very successful in helping a brand get its products and services in front of more consumers online. The success of Google Ads often depends on a business strategy for targeting the right audience and the quality of its ad content. Google Ads are more likely to be successful for businesses that conduct keyword research to optimize their bids on relevant keywords that they can rank highly for within their budget; and those that produce high-quality ad content, including graphics and landing pages that offer real value to their audiences.\nWhat is the difference between Google Ads and Adsense?\nGoogle Ads is the platform businesses use to advertise online, while Google AdSense is the platform websites use to host those online ads in exchange for payment. Google Ads is an online advertising platform where businesses pay to have their ads displayed online. Based on a business’ advertising budget, Google Ads will place the digital ads on the pages of Google results or on websites that belong to Google’s Network. Google AdSense is a program that anyone who owns a website can join, to become a part of Google’s Network. Through Google AdSense, the website owner allows Google Ads to automatically display relevant advertisements on their site and receives payment based on the number of views those ads receive.\nStep-by-Step Way\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have a firm understanding of the how to make money with apps.

      "description": "The practice of advertisement has being with us for so many years, good companies understand that they cannot light a candle and put it under the bed, any company that feel that they are doing something better want to come out and tell they people, possibly customers about what they have, this concept have necessitated the need for advertising because every company wants to show what they have. In identifying a very good advertising agency should be based on their track record which is a very through assessment of their professional competence, because in this day and age advertising has being very expensive and even once a company come out with a poor advertisement it becomes a very big poor tag on the image of the company so an advert can make or break the company. Management by all standard must do due diligence to ensure that they select a very credible organization that has being try and tested to ensure that they can deliver a very credible advert that will meet modern standard and industry standard.\nWe all know for a fact that when a company down a good adverts the consistency in satisfying the customer now depends on a very credible sales force who will work to ensure that they are able to meet demand from the customers and not disappoint the customer to they will not become dissatisfied, l have seen a lot of companies that did not prepare well in advance before advert so the demand became more that the supply that the company can handle and this situation really affect the reputation of the organization. My advise is that before advert companies must put down contingency measures to ensure that they can handle or situations and be able to satisfy their customers on time.\nIn seeking the services of external agencies its sometimes a recognition of the fact that the task ahead cannot be than alone by internal agency or the internal agency do not have the expertise to conduct and manage the task that has being assigned to them. external agencies must often have more competent skilled workers than internal agency because they may have expertise in various different disciplines in the advertising business hence the need to go in for their services. Writing a personal advertisement can be nerve-racking if you do not know where to begin. You may feel the need to hide your flaws lest you will scare off that special someone.",

Generate organic & paid traffic to your product listing page. Find out who your competitors are and which keywords to target yourself. Which keywords to use in which campaign (broad, phrase or exact)? Many times, we're wondering why we're never on the first page for these keywords, we'll see why during this process.\n\n\nModule 2 - Product Listing & Conversion Rate Optimization Like A Champ\n\n\nChoosing the best keywords/search terms is the key for these 8 critical areas of the product listing to outrank your competitors. We'll get Amazon to index your product page with top competing keywords to increase your product relevancy and ranking.\n\n\nConversion Rate optimization is the single best way of increasing sales without spending a dime, but when you are spending money on ads, you want to make sure your ads convert at the highest level.  If you do the math for your account, what is an additional 1% mean for you in terms of monthly revenue?",

It is hard to generate qualified B2B decision-maker leads on a regular basis. That's where I come in. My name is Brenden and I eat, sleep, and breathe paid ad campaigns. In this course, I personally walk you through setting up your entire campaign from start to finish. I also go over how to properly optimize your campaign to start converting more and costing less. If you are looking for more qualified B2B leads through your Google Ad campaigns, this is the course for you.\n\n\nMy career began with freelance clients 7 years ago. I now work for a larger agency maintaining all our client's paid media campaigns across all platforms. I have taken campaigns from 0 to 35:1 ROAS. B2B campaigns are a bit trickier and I can see how less experienced marketers or business owners could get tripped up and discouraged. This course was made for the people wanting to get more out of their B2B campaigns and scale them profitably.\n\n\nBusiness to Business ad campaigns have to be tailored using only long-tail keywords. Broad-match keyword types typically hurt your performance more than it could help. Google offers a lot of useful features to narrow your targeting down to in-market segments and other affinity audiences. Narrowing down your targeting helps only spend your ad budget on your most sought after prospects.\n\n\nGetting your ads in front of the right people is only half the battle. Your ad copy has to be compelling to earn their click. Your landing page has to load fast to capture the page view. Then your lead form has to be easy to navigate for the user to submit all their information. Each one of these steps could make or break your campaign. In this course we go over how to analyze your campaign's performance to identify where a drop off is happening and how to fix it.",

Agency refers to the Business you setup around your Blogging Business.\n\n\nALSO NOTE: This COURSE has nothing to do with LOADING (AdSense loading); if that is what you are looking for, I am sorry to disappoint you; it's not in my course, nor do I practice it.

If you are here for the purpose of picking out these errors rather than learning from it, enjoy yourself.\n\n\nI'M NOT A SALESPERSON; EVERYTHING YOU'LL EVER READ ON THIS PAGE IS MY WORDS AND THEY ARE THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH!\nI HAVE PROMISED NEVER TO TALK TOO MUCH, MEANING THIS PAGE WON'T CONTAIN MANY WORDS OR MEDIA.

      "description": "※2025年8月更新\n\n\n◆◇業者に頼らず自社で少額運用を目指します◇◆\n\n\nGoogle広告（旧：グーグルアドワーズ）リスティング広告を\n学べば代理店に丸投げせずに自社（自身）で運用もできるし、\n逆に代理店に指示できるようになります。\n\n\n\n\n機械学習していく最新のGoogle広告（グーグル広告）の仕組みと使い方を覚えれば\n少額で半自動的に見込み顧客を集め続けられ\n結果、少額で爆発的な収益を見込めるようになります。\n\n\n\n\n自社サービス＆自社商品、中小企業や零細企業にとって\n小資本で売上を上げていくにはWeb経由の問い合わせや\n成約、購入、申込みを狙っていきたいところ。\n\n\n\n\nそんな中、業者や制作会社に頼むにもお金がかかってしまうため、\n依頼がしづらく、かつ、自分で作成していくにしても\n何から手をつけたらいいのかわからない、、、\n\n\n\n\n一昔前の、プロモーションや集客は実は\n一個人でヤフーやグーグルのサービスを使って\n適切なターゲット層に情報を届けられるって知っていましたか？？\n\n\n\n\n自分のサービスがまったくWeb経由で問い合わせがない、、、\n自分の商品がネット経由でまったく成約、購入がない、、、\n\n\n\n\n\n\nこんなお悩みを持たれている方は是非ともこちらの講座をご受講下さい。\n\n\n\n\nそもそも、なぜリスティング広告を学ぶ必要性があるのか？\n\n\n\n\n自分のターゲットとなる顧客はどこにいるのか？\n顧客属性を明確にし、そういった顧客が能動的にどのような\nキーワードを打ち込むのか？\n\n\n\n\n「毎月レポートを渡されるだけで、実際にどのように運用されているか分からない」\n「現状の代理店のパフォーマンスに不満だが、どう改善していいのか分からない」\n「報告されている数字が正しいのかどうか確認する方法がない」、、、などなど\n\n\n\n\nグーグル広告で成果を出すにはまずベースとして\n基本的な設定がしっかり為されていることが必須の条件となります。\n\n\n\n\n逆にシンプルかつ基本的な設定をしっかり行うことで、\n成果が倍増するようなケースも多々あり、非常に重要なポイントとなります。\n\n\n\n\nそこで、本講座では基本的にスライドで説明しながら\n基礎編や概論など知識提供型の講座となっております。\n\n\n他の「Google Ads（グーグル広告）設定＆運用ガイド　最新・保存版  」コースでは\n実際に広告の管理画面での説明を行いながら設定の仕方や\nターゲティングについて説明しておりますので、合わせてご購入頂きご参考頂けたら幸いです。",

Sure, Google Ads is complicated and can be very expensive.\nIt’s a tough nut to crack, but not impossible.\n\n\nA Constant Source Of Traffic\nThe reason why so many online marketers like Google Ads is that it provides a constant source of reliable traffic.\nThere’s no SEO involved or the need to tweak web pages.

While Google Ads may be expensive, you don’t have to worry about fraudulent clicks.\nThis in itself makes paying extra all that much more worthwhile. You’ll be able to avoid the pitfall of paying something for nothing.\nMany people lose faith in pay per click advertising because they buy traffic from companies that don’t screen it properly.\nWhen this happens, you end up paying for something and getting nothing in return.\n\n\nIt’s All About The Cost\nYou're not looking for just any traffic here. You want the cheap stuff that converts.\nMany of you reading this right now will think that it’s not possible to buy cheap traffic and make money from it.\nThe key to doing this is by understanding how Google Ads works.

We’ll show you the ins and outs of the entire process.\nYou’ll be able to quickly and easily discover new keywords that can be bought for next to nothing.\nThese keywords, in the end, will be what makes or breaks your business. Stay ahead of the competition by being more profitable than they are.\nThe way you do that is by paying less for clicks and by being able to buy more of them.\n\n\nSign up for this training today and make your future as bright as it possibly can be.\nMany people that try to figure things out on their own end up wasting a lot of time and get frustrated and end up with nothing.\nThat’s because they spin their wheels, follow bad advice, and just don’t get the right roadmap to success.\nThis video series will prevent that from happening… When you invest in this training today, you watch as I do it… and you replicate it.\nIt’s THAT simple...\n\n\nCourse Description:\n\n\nMost people do not know how to get started with all the Social Media products online today. With this Fast Track Training course designed to take you to the Advanced level, you will be up and running in no time using Google Ads to the Advanced level with confidence.\n\n\nGoogle Ads (Advanced): Fast Track Training is a straight to the point, step by step training course to get you started immediately.\n\n\nSee the course subjects below:\n\n\nGoogle Ads (Advanced): Fast Track Training\n\n\nSection 1: Course Overview\n1 - Overview\n\n\nSection 2: Setting Up\n2 - Ad Variations\n3 - Using the Forecast Planner\n4 - Connection to Google Resources\n\n\nSection 3: Connections Part-1\n5 - Connection to Autoresponders\n6 - Connection to Zapier Resources\n7 - Connection to Facebook through Zapier\n\n\nSection 4: Connections Part-2\n8 - Connection to LinkedIn through Zapier\n9 - Connection to WordPress through Zapier\n10 - Connection to Twitter though Zapier\n\n\nSection 5: Adwords and Audiences\n11 - Adwords and Audiences - Part 1\n12 - Adwords and Audiences - Part 2\n13 - Adwords and Audiences - Part 3\n14 - Store and Retail Ads\n\n\nSection 6: Live Examples Part-1\n15 - Live Example - Part 1\n16 - Live Example - Part 2\n17 - Live Example - Part 3\n\n\nSection 7: Live Examples Part-2\n18 - Live Example - Part 4\n19 - Live Example - Part 5\n\n\nSection 8: Conclusion\n20 - Conclusion",

      "description": "Dear friend,\nIf you are a business owner with a Facebook fan page, you already know how important it is to build trust, engagement, and authority if you want more leads, sales, and profits.\nThe truth is, likes and engagement act as social proof. When prospects see that others are following, liking, and interacting with your page, they immediately view you as more credible. That trust can be the difference between choosing you or going to a competitor.\nThe challenge? Building that social proof can be expensive. In countries like the U.S. or U.K., a single like can cost up to $1 or more. Testing content, images, and messaging can drain your budget fast.\nSo the question is: how can you build authority, grow your following, and increase engagement without spending thousands of dollars just on testing?\nThis course is designed to answer exactly that.\nIntroducing:\nHow to Increase Social Proof and Engagement on Your Facebook Fan Page\nIn this step-by-step video course, I’ll take you behind the scenes and show you proven strategies to quickly boost your social proof, increase engagement, and convert more prospects into leads and paying customers.\nHere’s what you’ll discover inside:\nIntroduction and Quick Overview\nGet a clear picture of what to expect from the course and how the process works to increase your engagement and conversions.\nWhy Targeted Likes Matter\nUnderstand why targeted likes go far beyond vanity metrics, and see a real fan page with over 20,000 likes built using this exact strategy.\nWinning Out of the Gate\nLearn how to use tier 2 and tier 3 countries to cheaply test content and images before scaling to tier 1 markets.\n5-Minute Content Strategy\nSave hours by learning a simple method to create fast, effective content that keeps your audience engaged.\nTwo Birds with One Stone\nDiscover the approach that boosts both social proof and engagement at the same time.\nSetting Up Your Ad Campaigns\nStep-by-step instructions on how to set up your page likes campaign, ad set, and ads for maximum impact.\nThis course gives you practical tools and strategies you can implement immediately, even on a small budget.\nAnd with Udemy’s 30-day money-back guarantee, there’s no risk in getting started.\nLet’s start building your authority together.

Parabéns ao super profissional! - Carla M. P. de Moraes\nIremos aprender do BÁSICO até o AVANÇADO\nPartiremos do absoluto ZERO (portanto, você não precisa de experiência prévia) e iremos chegar até o nível PROFISSIONAL, onde você será capaz de realizar a gestão completa de suas campanhas e, mais do que isso, obter resultados reais com os seus anúncios.\nSe você já tem certa experiência com o Google Ads, não se preocupe!

Incrível, não?! Não é a toa que milhões de empresas têm usado a plataforma em suas estratégias de marketing digital, para assim, aumentar vendas, gerar tráfego para sites, aumentar o reconhecimento de marca e garantir a retenção de clientes.\nE, se ainda assim, você não conseguir conquistar sua persona de primeira, a plataforma ainda conta com um sistema incrível para trabalhar com campanhas de remarketing.

Seja para aumentar suas vendas ou aprimorar o seu currículo, garantindo uma excelente valorização profissional.\nOverview/resumo do curso\n\nDifícil resumir 13h em apenas algumas linhas, mas vamos lá! Ao iniciar o curso você irá ver os conceitos básicos e dar os seus primeiros passos na plataforma, criando a sua conta e entendendo como funciona a interface do Google Ads. Após esse primeiro momento, iremos aprender como \"preparar o terreno\" para receber o tráfego dos seus anúncios. Ou seja, vamos fazer todas as configurações necessárias antes mesmo de criar a nossa primeira campanha, incluindo configurar conversões na plataforma. Com isso, passaremos a ter controle sobre os resultados de nossas campanhas.\nCom isso feito e organizado, partiremos para a parte prática de criação de campanhas, onde vamos primeiro entender como funciona a estrutura das campanhas no Google Ads e, logo depois, vamos criar uma campanha do zero, passando por todas as suas etapas (palavras-chave, grupos de anúncios, anúncios, etc.).\n\nApós isso, iremos partir para um conteúdo mais aprofundado sobre otimização de palavras-chave (Keywords). Você vai aprender sobre correspondência, palavras negativas, pesquisa de volume e concorrência (Google Keyword Planner) e também vai conseguir ver quais são os principais termos que ativam o seu anúncio.\nApós, vamos aprender a otimizar a performance dos nossos anúncios, conhecendo os princípios por trás do índice de qualidade do Google e criando extensões de anúncio que vão auxiliar no seu objetivo de campanha. Indo adiante no curso, vamos aprender algumas técnicas para a otimização de campanhas como um todo. Aqui você vai aprender a usar estratégias de lances automáticos para facilitar a gestão de suas campanhas, conforme elas crescem!\nObviamente, não adianta apenas realizarmos a criação das campanhas e não mensurarmos os resultados. Portanto, após tudo isso, você irá aprender a analisar a performance das suas campanhas, conhecendo as principais métricas da plataforma e aprendendo a realizar cálculo de ROI e ROAS, respectivamente, o retorno sobre o investimento e o retorno sobre o investimento em publicidade. Com isso, teremos fechado um ciclo e você estará pronto para conhecer as demais redes do Google Ads, começando pela Rede de Display e Discovery.\nNesse momento, você irá aprender a criar uma campanha passo a passo da rede de Display e outra da rede de Discovery.  Com isso, você vai conseguir criar anúncios gráficos e segmentados de acordo com o seu público-alvo, que vão ser veiculados em sites parceiros do Google, Gmail e Youtube!\nComo se não bastasse tudo isso, você ainda terá pela frente aulas completas sobre Remarketing. Resumindo, irá aprender a configurar listas de remarketing para aplicar em suas campanhas e ainda vai conhecer segredos e técnicas aplicadas por especialistas da área.\nUfa! Terminei. Espero não ter sobrecarregado você com termos da área. Não se preocupe! Tudo isso será visto de forma detalhada e conforme o seu ritmo, afinal de contas, o acesso ao curso é vitalício.

      "description": "We are currently undergoing the greatest shift in advertising since the invention of the TV.\n\nAnd it’s all because of Pay-Per-Click Advertising, also known as direct response marketing.\n\n\nPPC/direct response advertisements on Google & Facebook are by far the cheapest, most effective and best way to grow customers for any product, good or service.\n\n\nIt helped me build a website to 1 million page views PER DAY and sell it to famous tech entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. Now I'm teaching you what I learned in this 5-part, 1-hour course.\n\n\nThe introduction & 5 modules of the course are broken down like this:\n\n\nIntroduction\n• Who is Jim Weber?\n• Testimonial from famous tech entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk\n• What is Pay-Per-Click/Direct Response Marketing?\n• What will I learn from \"PPC 101\"?\n\n\nModule #1: PPC Case Study\n• How Zingerman’s Deli used PPC to build a $15-million, mail-order business.\n\nModule #2: Sales Flow\n• The PPC Sales Funnel & how to generate sales leads.\n\n\nModule #3: PPC Math\n• Elementary school-level formulas you need to know and how to calculate.\n\n\nModule #4: Success Stories\n• Successful uses of PPC to grow businesses, products or services across industries.\n\n\nModule #5: Campaign Managers\n• Everything you need to know about finding & hiring PPC campaign managers.\n\n\nConclusion\n• Quick recap of the most important things you learned in Modules #1-5.\n\n\nWHAT THIS COURSE IS *NOT*\nThis course is NOT a \"how to\" guide to creating and monitoring Google & Facebook ads. From my personal experience, it takes months to not only use these PPC platforms but also master them to a point where you make a positive Return on Investment. Unless you are planning to run Google & Facebook ads as your profession, it is a more efficient use of your time and money to hire a trusted campaign manager and pay them either on commission or a percentage of your PPC ad spend (30% or less).",

      "description": "** Last Update - April 2024 **\nA top rated Google Ads course designed for anyone wanting to improve digital marketing strategies & practice!\nThe Google Ads course is designed as a handbook and guide for building and managing a successful Google Ads campaign.\nWhether you are beginning your journey in digital marketing or have a couple of years experience and want to upskill and become more professional, this course is for you!\nThe course covers everything you need to know to be great as a Google Ads marketer. We start from a basic level all the way up to covering advanced strategies.\nHow Is This Course Different?\nMost courses teach you a lot of the ‘what’: 'what are CPC’s? What is a campaign?'.\nSome courses teach you a bit of the ‘how’: 'how to set up an account, how to adjust bids and other technical aspects'. But even these courses tend to focus on account setup only. (don’t take my word for it, look through the course curriculums!).\nThis course is different...\nIn this course we will cover both the what and the how.  And not just how to setup an account, we show you what you should be doing on an ongoing basis. This is what we actually do when we manage an account in our agency.  We show you how to create an account that is both technically and strategically excellent.\nA great account requires two levels of greatness:\nTo be built and run with technical precision, with all the technical aspects implemented according to best practice.\nTo be strategically excellent, where the account is an embodiment of the marketing strategy implemented in practice. We show you how to translate strategy into the framework and tactics of Google ads. (I believe that 90% of marketers practicing today, still do not understand this discrepancy between strategy and tactics, in the course we explain this difference and how it greatly affects the way you use Google Ads.)\nBy the end of this course you will have a thorough understanding of Google Ads including all the key concepts within the platform and have the practical tools and skills to manage an account. This will be taught as a practical guide for setting up and running a successful account both on a basic, strategic and advanced level.\nThe course can be used as a handbook for you to apply to your own campaigns or your own clients. Practicality and usefulness was our guiding principal in writing the course.\nWe start by providing a strong understanding of Google Ads concepts and then focus on practice and application, giving you the tools to manage your own account. We show you how we manage our own successful accounts, which you can use as a blueprint to running your campaigns. This includes planning, research, account builds, basic and advanced optimisations.\nLot's of Course Materials!\nWe provide a range of free course materials throughout the course.  This includes calculators, guides, forms, templates, scripts and more.  All of this available for free to enrolled students via our marketplace 'byMarketers'\nAdded Bonus: All students also receive a 30% discount on all other products our digital marketing marketplace 'byMarketers'\nWhat Students Are saying:\nIoannis Vaganof wrote:\n\"Mark was excellent in this couse, as he was very to the point, mentioned many advanced tactics and techniques, and very important that provided concepts and tips for strategy of the Google Ads. Value for money, as well as for the time investing! Good addition the extra videos updated with the recent changes. Thank you Mark!\"\nBirgit Hettler wrote:\n\"This course was all I had hoped for and more. I already have some experience with Google Ads, but never went deeper into the topic of Google Ads/PPC Ads. This course gave me a refresher on the theory as well as a lot of useful tips on practical application.\"\nCarlos wrote:\n\"Fantastic introductory course. Mark gets really into the application and walks the talk with this. Very good segmentation of the knowledge and touches with ease everything you need to know at a first level, and even goes further. Don't think about it, do the course. Really recommended for people that are just started with Google Ads, or even rookies.\"\nFabian Ketz wrote:\n\"This course helps me to understand how and why Google Ads are working. Amazing. I highly recommend this course.\"\nPatricia Cristel Vázquez Rosado wrote:\n\"Is really good for beginners, some of the technical words I do understand and some others not, but is not that complicated to understand later with more of the information. Amazing.\"\nBeth Westwood wrote:\n\"This is super insightful already! I knew the very basics of Google Ads and this has already taken my knowledge levels up. Thank you.\"\nBill Dermody wrote:\n\"It was very well done. I especially liked that he had the green screen with the interface of Google Ads behind him.\"\nKab wrote:\n\"This is my 5th course about Google Ads. This course is the only one with a marketing strategic approach. It is a course completely different from the others. It teaches how to think, which is very rare. About the practical part (the \"how to do\" part), this course highlights specific technical points that (for some of them) I never heard of in the other Google Ads courses. And about the technical points I already knew about, they are presented here in a very different way that helped me to go in-depth. I am very grateful for such a course as I feel more confident : I have now a very professional framework, a clear methodology that I can apply on any Google Ads account. I know how to structure the account, plan my actions, forecast the results, control the budget, debug. The course explains also in gread details how to run an experiment and gives the steps to follow. And I have also a clear idea of what and when to optimize. I also have a clear idea of the most important technical things I have to focus on, to do a lot better than an average practionner (yes !!!). At the end of the course, I feel \"organised\" in my mind. However, as I do not have any experience, it has been hard work for me to grasp everything, as there is a lot of information in the course ! And I am wondering if this is the best course to start with, if you do not know the Google Ads platform at all.\"\nLeigh wrote:\n\"I am an SEO Specialist, work at a branding and dev agency, and understand where ads fit into the marketing process. This is the 4th or 5th course I've tried after not really feeling like others did enough, or put everything into perspective. It's very important to be able to think about ads and reporting the results, and most instruction will just show you the interface of Ads and explain a thing or two. This instructor goes beyond that. It's really good content and well planned, and perfect if you want to run ads in a professional setting and plan to prove your work and learn how to improve and check yourself.\"\nWhat we cover:\nThe course is divided into 8 sections. Sections 2 & 3 are designed mostly for beginners. For students with some background in Google Ads, we recommend starting from section 4.\nIntroduction\nBackground to Google Ads\nKey Terms & Concepts\nPlanning, research & Strategy Generation\nCampaign Build Stage\nFundamental Optimisations\nAdvanced Optimisations\nCommon Issues we Troubleshoot",

To date I’ve taught over 8,000 students in 130 countries on my other courses.\nHere are some reviews from other courses:\n------------------\nDigital Advertising & Marketing 101\n★★★★★ “The real-world examples almost makes it self-explanatory. Professionally done and author speaks with authority - i.e. he knows what he's talking about and it shows.” - AJ Du Toit\n★★★★★ “Thought this was an excellent introduction course. Working in the industry without a huge amount of experience in this area, it was a great way to familiarize myself with topics in ongoing conversations internally and externally. Will be taking 201 to further my understanding.” - Jocleyn Armour\n★★★★★ “It is advertised as a 101 course and it did exactly that and very well, touching on the building blocks of Digital Advertising and Marketing. Good job Ben.” - Jean C\n\n\nDigital Advertising & Marketing 201\n★★★★★ “When combined with Ben's 101 course, the two classes make for a thorough and well-organized primer on digital media today. Perfect for marketing people and agency folks (creative, account) who are not immersed in a media agency. It will give you a foundation for how digital media is structured, a clear explanation of the jargon and acronyms you'll hear bantered about, and a better understanding of the opportunities available. The 201 course goes into important detail about some of the key changes that have taken place in digital advertising recently. Ben explains the concepts clearly and succinctly. Definitely worth the time investment.” - Shawn E Fraser\n★★★★★ “This course is amazing. I do affiliate marketing and always wanted to learn about programmatic advertising and this course me taught that. I completed this for an interview and the employer was really impressed by the knowledge I had. Hope there is another in-depth version of this course. Where he goes into ad platforms or ad servers and teaches the real world applications.” - Suryameet Singh\n★★★★★ “Comprehensive overview...detailed!” - Kaithlean Crotty-Clark\n\n\nIntroduction to Programmatic Advertising\n★★★★★ “I'm in advertising sales and have been looking for a clean easy way to explain and also test my root knowledge of the programmatic ad space. It was very helpful and simple to understand which is hard to do with this topic.” - Raul Bonilla\n★★★★★ \"Being an advertising agency media planner and buyer, having this hands on information helps when we face a decision to go into the digital advertising space. Your 101 and 201 was extremely informative and truly like your overviews in a very simplistic explanation. Thank you and look forward to your future courses.\" - Diane Tody\n------------------\nSign up for this course today and take your Facebook advertising to the next level!",

      "description": "Dear Friend,\nAdvertising on Google Ads can cost you an arm and a leg. It can drain your bank account before you even know it.\nYou wouldn’t be the first to blow your entire budget in a matter of hours, if not days.\n\n\nPeople do it all the time, and even seasoned professionals find themselves stuck in this mess.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. Sure, Google Ads is complicated and can be very expensive.\nIt’s a tough nut to crack, but not impossible.\n\n\nA Constant Source Of Traffic\nThe reason why so many online marketers like Google Ads is that it provides a constant source of reliable traffic.\nThere’s no SEO involved or the need to tweak web pages. It’s just a matter of buying the traffic and converting it.\nSEO is a time-consuming method to get traffic, and some people don’t want to wait for it.\nYou may have a time-sensitive product that you’re promoting.\nIf this is the case, then the only way to get traffic is by using Google Ads.\n\n\nAbuse And Fraud Are Closely Monitored\nGoogle backs Google Ads, and they have measures in place to make sure you’re buying real targeted traffic.\nOther places sell questionable traffic. While Google Ads may be expensive, you don’t have to worry about fraudulent clicks.\nThis in itself makes paying extra all that much more worthwhile. You’ll be able to avoid the pitfall of paying something for nothing.\nMany people lose faith in pay per click advertising because they buy traffic from companies that don’t screen it properly.\nWhen this happens, you end up paying for something and getting nothing in return.\n\n\nIt’s All About The Cost\nYou're not looking for just any traffic here. You want the cheap stuff that converts.\nMany of you reading this right now will think that it’s not possible to buy cheap traffic and make money from it.\nThe key to doing this is by understanding how Google Ads works.

We’ll show you the ins and outs of the entire process.\nYou’ll be able to quickly and easily discover new keywords that can be bought for next to nothing.\nThese keywords, in the end, will be what makes or breaks your business. Stay ahead of the competition by being more profitable than they are.\nThe way you do that is by paying less for clicks and by being able to buy more of them.\n\n\nHere’s What You’ll Discover Inside This Course:\nGet started with Google Adwords and understand how it can help you.\nLearn how to quickly configure your settings for maximum exposure.\nUnderstand Google Adwords features and how it works.\nUnderstand how Google Adwords works and spy on competitors.\nHow to get visibility and what kind of content they look for.\nHow to attract people to your ad easily and get more clicks.\nLearn how to use images to boost your clickthrough rate.\nDiscover unknown tricks gurus use to boost conversion easily.\nLearn the feature you can use to track your campaign easily.\nAnd so many more...\n\n\n***************************************************************************************\n30-Day Money Back Guarantee - Risk-Free!\n****************************************************************************************\nUdemy has 30 day money back guarantee so there is no risk.\nYou have a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nLets start success together!

      "description": "Hello and welcome to the Easy YouTube Ads Academy!\nI created this course because running ads can be extremely stressful, frustrating and discouraging if you are not careful.\nI bet no one lay it out for you as clear as this before but these are the steps you need to take… when running a YouTube ad campaign.\nStep 1, you have to create a Google Ads Account and a new YouTube Channel. You want to create a separate channel specifically to run ads so as not to effect the organic reach of your regular channel.\nStep 2, you have to do research on the different keywords, placement, and topics you want to target for… that is related to your products and brand.\nStep 3, it’s time to create your video Ad! Most people do this before they do research and that’s a mistake because your ad, needs to be filled with keywords that resonates with your potential customers. And you figure what those keywords are during your research.\nStep 4, is to create the Landing Page design that you will be sending the traffic to once you start running the ads. The website design needs to reflect the actual video ad that people are seeing.\nStep 5 is to setup tracking tags so that every click, every visitor, and every conversion is recorded in your google ads account, to keep your data accurate and for future re-marketing campaigns.\nStep 6, is to finally setup your ad campaign! It’s an exciting step but also the most stressful because there are tons of variables to consider, such as what should your starting budget be? Which countries have higher conversion rates and which should you target? Where should you exclude your video ads from being seen? Which devices should you target and are they all created equal? What frequenting capping should you use to make sure your ads don’t burn out that fast? Which demographic should you target to get the maximum bang for your buck? What’s the best Cost Per View to start off with and more.\nStep 7, is to look at all the data and optimize your campaigns… which is just a fancy word for ditching losers and scaling winners.\nThis is what confuses the most people because just look at all the data. How do you know what to look for? How do you arrange the columns of data so that you are looking at only the stats that matter? How do you compare the view rate with the Click through Rates to decide if an ad is working or not? How do you determine which video, which keyword, which placement ads to keep pouring money into and which ads to cut off right away?\nRunning ads is almost like betting on horse racing. Each horse is your campaign. Which one should to cut from the team and which one should you continue to invest in and let them run to continue to make you money?\nThere’s like a million questions right? And the people who have figured it out have an unfair advantage over their competitors. They can afford to continue running ads and grow their business while their competitors is forgotten. In business, if you don’t have a constant supply of traffic… your business will die and be forgotten.\nIf all this sounds discouraging to you. Don’t worry. I was sitting in your extract seat years ago.

      "description": "This course provides an introduction to Google Ads, specifically focusing on the implementation of Google Ads retargeting strategies.\nRetargeting involves displaying ads to individuals who have previously visited your website. These individuals, having shown interest in your site, are considered warm leads. Targeting warm leads is more effective than targeting cold leads, as those who have engaged with your website are more likely to interact with your business and are typically more cost-effective to reach.\nThe course is designed to be concise, allowing participants to set up their retargeting campaigns in a single day and commence running ads promptly.\nThe instructor is responsive and committed to providing excellent support to students. With a commitment to addressing 99% of student queries within 24 hours, the instructor emphasizes care and responsibility to ensure students derive value from the course, distinguishing this support from experiences where other instructors may not be as responsive.\nRetargeting serves as a crucial strategy, considering that the majority of websites generate leads and sales from only 5% of their traffic. The course highlights the significance of retargeting to re-engage past website visitors, encouraging them to return and, ideally, make a purchase. Many businesses employ retargeting because it has proven to be effective, often yielding the highest Return On Investment (ROI).

Have you considered advertising on Quora?\nWhy advertise on Quora?\nQuora is unique in that it offers advertisers the ability to build credibility in the eyes of a prospect during the hella important research phase.\nQuora is a public forum that showcases questions and answers posted by an active community. Like Reddit, questions and answers are voted as helpful or not by other users. The more users who upvote a question or an answer will have that post showcased more often.\nWith Quora pulling 200 million unique monthly visitors, now is a good time to investigate its advertising platform. We’ll look to see how Quora’s ad platform is used, and learn about some of its best practice.\nQuora ads is a self-serve platform where advertisers can create ads and target active Quora users. This platform enables advertisers to target specific topics and questions on Quora (contextual targeting), as well as create and target audiences based on pixel data (behavioral targeting). Advertisers can create text or image-based ads.\nUnlike other advertising platforms, Quora lets you place ad copy between posts in a relatable way, while targeting potential customers.\nYou can launch the ads in minutes!",

      "description": "*** Aggiornato a maggio 2025 con le ultime novità e nuove lezioni! ***\nWhatsapp ha enormi potenzialità per le attività locali e le piccole imprese.\nSiamo abituati a utilizzare Whatsapp a livello personale, per comunicare con amici, parenti e familiari (e con gli amati e odiati gruppi), ma questa diffusissima app ha anche enormi funzionalità di marketing e comunicazione, ancora poco conosciute e utilizzate, che permettono di fare promozione della propria impresa/azienda in maniera gratuita ed efficace.\nHo provato, testato e utilizzato questi strumenti per diversi anni nella mia attività prima di realizzare questo corso e sono convinto che Whatsapp sia una risorsa straordinaria per il marketing delle piccole aziende e imprese locali.\nIn particolare l'app apposita di Whatsapp per il business (che si chiama appunto Whatsapp Business, disponibile gratuitamente per Android e Ios) ha una serie di funzioni pensate proprio per le piccole imprese, in particolare attività  commerciali (negozi, bar, ristoranti), liberi professionisti, artigiani, attività individuali sia locali che online.\nCosa si può fare con Whatsapp e Whatsapp Business? Quali sono i vantaggi in termini di comunicazione e marketing? Grazie a questi strumenti è possibile avere un contatto veloce, diretto e pratico con clienti, inviare comunicazioni di offerte e promozioni, essere trovati e contattati in maniera efficace, catalogare le chat con le diverse tipologie di clienti.\nMa anche VENDERE direttamentr su Whatsapp, grazie all'ottimo strumento del catalogo prodotti, e alla sempre più grandi interazioni con Facebook e Instagram\nPerchè Whatsapp funziona? Perchè diversamente dalla mail i messaggi inviati da smartphone hanno tassi di apertura altissimi (siamo tutti \"schiavi\" da notifica\") e se mandiamo le comunicazione giuste possiamo raggiungere tutti i nostri contatti o determinate liste di contatti in un istante. Questo si può fare attraverso lo strumento delle liste broadcast, diverse dai gruppi perchè permettono privacy e comunicazione che appare come one to one con il cliente. Vanno utilizzate nel modo giusto e con una strategia efficace, ed è quello che imparerai in questo corso.\nInoltre il corso affronta tutte le potenzialità di Whatsapp Business, che permette di:\nRegistrare Whatsapp anche con un numero di telefono fisso (cosa molto importante per le imprese locali)\nPersonalizzare il profilo aziendale che appare su Whatsapp con descrizione categoria, posizione sulla mappa, link a siti web o indirizzo e-mail\nImpostare gli orari di apertura\nInviare in automatico un messaggo di benvenuto, con informazioni specifiche, a chi ci contatta con Whatsapp\nInviare un messaggio di assenza (se veniamo contattati al di fuori degli orari di apertura o determinati periodi)\nPreparare risposte rapide per le domande più frequenti\nEtichettare i messaggi e le chat e suddivivderli in diverse categorie\nCreare un catalogo prodotti/servizi con foto, prezzo e descrizione, visibili sul profilo e facili da inviare ai clienti\nUtilizzare Whatsapp su più dispositivi e smartphone con lo stesso account\nGrande spazio nel corso è dato alle liste broadcast, strumenti che permettono di inviare messaggi a molti utenti contemporaneamente (liste di 256 alla volta) e in cui le comunicazioni arrivano one-to-one (a differenza dei gruppi, in cui tutti vedono chi è presente). In diverse lezioni vediamo come utilizzare le liste broadcast, come differenziare gli utenti e quali tipi di messaggi promozionali o pubblicitari possiamo inviare.\nNel corso vengono affrontati anche gli aspetti di marketing relativi agli aggiornamenti di stato, ovvero le \"Stories\"per Whatsapp. E' uno strumento molto simile alle Stories di Instagram o Facebook (Whatsapp fa parte della stessa famiglia ed è di proprietà di Mark Zuckerberg) che permette di dare molta visibilità agli elementi che vogliamo pubblicare. Possiamo utilizzare gli aggiornamenti di stato per far conoscere i prodotti, la nostra attività, per raccontare quello che accade in negozio/azienda, o in base alla nostra strategia.\nUna sezione apposita del corso spiega come utilizzare Whatsapp su più dispositivi utilizzando lo stesso account e anche come usarlo su PC (o MAC), per rendere ancora più veloce la comunicazione e poter gestire le chat con comodità (grazie all'uso della tastiera)\nUltimi, ma non meno importanti, gli strumenti a supporto: come integrare la comunicazione con Whatsapp e gli altri social (o il sito web), una lezione specifica su Canva, sito e app gratuito per creare velocemente grafiche, coupon promozionali, volantini, ecc, che poi possiamo inviare con Whatsapp, oltre ad altri suggerimenti utili per sfruttare al meglio le potenzialità di questa app.\nE' il corso per te se:\n- hai una piccola impresa, un'attività locale (negozio, bar, ristorante, hotel, ecc), sei un libero professionista (geometra, architetto, medico, avvocato, ecc), artigiano, e vuoi avere uno strumento molto potente per comunicare con i tuoi clienti, inviare promozioni e informazioni commerciali, dare un'immagine professionale alla tua comunicazione.\n- lavori come social media manager o come consulente marketing digitale (web marketing) e vuoi utilizzare le importanti potenzialità di Whatsapp e Whatsapp Business per i tuoi clienti\n- hai un'impresa online e vuoi rendere più veloce e pratica la comunicazione con i tuoi clienti",

      "description": "Remarketing (retargeting) is the process of “following up” with your prospects or clients in the digital world.\n\nThis is an Advertising Strategy used by the best marketers and business owners out there.\n\nFUN FACT: Only 2% of people will buy the first time they find out about your company. Which means, that all the people you send to your Facebook Page or Website, only 2% will buy the first time…\n98% of sales will happen in the next 2 to 7 interactions with your brand or business.\nRetargeting – Remarketing is the cheapest yet most effective form of advertising if done correctly.\nThis is why you need to do Retargeting (remarketing)\nOtherwise, you are leaving money on the table and your ROI will decrease. Imagine being able to double your sales just by applying this principle of retargeting (remarketing)… All your hard work and all the money you spend on traffic bringing people to your site or Facebook Page will finally pay off.\nAcquiring customers through traffic without retargeting is basically leaving money on table, and it is very expensive.\nIf you have a business, you probably have a Facebook Page. You may also have a Website.\nBut it is not necessary to have a website to do Retargeting (remarketing).\nYou need to assign a small budget to follow up with people where they left… You will show ads to specific people to remind them to take the next action.\nWhat if you were able to push 5, 10, or 20% MORE people to the next step of your funnel?\nMost marketers are leaving BIG money on the table because they don’t follow up with a prospect after they’ve left their funnel.\nBut today it’s easier than ever to follow up using ad retargeting.\nI will teach how to EASILY Create those “Remarketing Audiences” and Create “Remarketing Campaigns” on Facebook to follow up with them without breaking the bank.\nThis is all about converting more people into customers, and making your current customers buy more from your company…",

You have all the knowledge required to set up your own business now.\nTechnically you have all the know-how of setting up and running your own business online. Most others would tell you at this point \"Great job! I wish you all the success\" and that would be it. And that's okay too. But I'm not one of them.\nIt's true you have learned all that you need to know about creating and building your business but there's more that you should know to have the kind of success you really want. I want to show you how to get constant business and grow that into a recurring income flow.\nSounds great, doesn't it? Well, it is. I want to show how to target people and make them want to come back for more to avail your offers. This is not as easy a thing to achieve but it's not rocket science either.\nWhat I'm about to talk is called ‘traffic'. Now most of you using the internet have heard of this term and if you haven't that's fine too. You'll soon see what I'm talking about. Basically, I'm going to be talking about the people who are going to view, reach and ultimately access your offers. These people are a bit tricky to get. A lot of online businesses with tremendous ideas fail because they cannot get the required traffic.\nMy goal here is to give you a heads up on the guaranteed biggest road block towards success. Some have overcome this block using tenacity and years of hard research, others fell on their face and quit.\nI don't want you to quit. And you don't have to do the years of intense research either. This is why I decided to come up with my second and in all probability the last upgrade. There's many more tips and tricks of the trade but this one I know is indispensable and the road to success.\nThese courses take a lot of time, money and effort to create and hence this might be the last upgrade I can offer. So make sure to grab this opportunity and not miss out on the chance to find out how to grow your business in a sustainable and profitable way.\nOk, so let me explain what I'm really offering here.\nI have created this course called Traffic Overdrive and in it, I'm going to cover six all important strategies for traffic and lead generation. It'll explain how you can lure quality leads to your offers and how to make them keep coming back for more.\nThere is a ton of information about each one of these strategies and I decided to stretch them out over a period of 6 months. I'll be sending one strategy each month, so you have time enough to learn thoroughly and develop the skills.\nSo what will the course include? As I told you, there's a lot of information to cover in the course, so here's a brief overview of what I'll be talking about.\nIn the first month, we'll talk about the first and foremost traffic source which is Facebook. I'll show you how to become a wizard of the social media platform. You'll learn how to get people to come visit you, engage with you and how to effectively use Facebook ads.\nnext we'll do an assessment of PPC or Pay-Per-View advertisement. PPC is a highly efficient yet cheap way to advertise your offers and send paid traffic to your sales page.\nHere we will talk about alternate sales channels. What this means is that there are dozen other marketplaces where you can branch out. I'm going to show which marketplaces are right for you and which ones proved the most profitable for me.\nLast but certainly not the least, I'll teach you how to become your own boss. You'll learn how to create your own website, how to get traffic to it and how to sell your products without paying any commission to platforms.\nSo that's what I have in store for you in brief. You'll learn a lot more than you can comprehend and I'm excited for you to find out. I'm incredibly proud of the decisions you have made so far, for being part of the amazing business. I trust you will recognize the significance of this course and treat it as an investment into your future. You really can't afford to miss this and regret later forever. Simply click on the checkout button below to receive your final upgrade.\nI'm sharing this with you because I am and I want to stay your guy next door.

Every time a user clicks on a PPC ad, the advertiser will get charged, hence the term pay-per-click.\nAdvertisers pay a set fee every time internet users click on a PPC ad. Essentially, advertisers pay for site visits instead of attracting clicks through organic traffic. This cost-per-click (CPC) can rise or fall depending on various factors in your campaign.\nA PPC campaign is a well-defined advertising strategy that sets out to achieve a specific goal, known as a conversion. The most common conversion goals include generating more leads and getting customers to make a purchase.\nAdvertisers must select keywords – user search queries - and create ads with these keywords to ensure their ads perform well in search engine results pages. Your ad can show on the search network when someone searches for terms that are similar to your products and services.\nYou can set up a PPC campaign on advertising platforms, using these dedicated systems to create, publish, and promote your ads to a specific target audience. The main platforms for PPC marketing are Google and Bing, but Google Ads is definetely the platform to choose.\nAs the front door to the online world, Google is the dominant force in paid advertising, owning almost 80% of the market share. You can use the Google Display or Search Network to post your PPC ads, which will reach more people on Google compared to any other platform.",

We walk through how to actually go live with your first social media ad campaign after selling it through to a client.\n\n\nOver the past 5-10 years advertisers have shifted budget from traditional media (TV, Radio, Print, OOH) to digital solutions. During that same time frame consumer habits have shifted to spending more time on digital devices than traditional media.\nMedia professionals have had to adapt to these changing trends by not just changing their sales pitch, but starting to offer new digital products in order to compete.\nHowever, if you don’t work for a digital company it can be confusing to figure out how to start selling digital ads. It’s not enough to just know about them, you need a plan to actually add these products to your sales tool kit.\nIn this course I’ll walk you through digital advertising basics and show you how you can start selling and executing digital ad campaigns TODAY. I’ll then show you how you can scale your local clients to regional and national deals, and how to take advantage of whitelabeled third-party solutions to scale your digital advertising sales.\n\n\nCourse Subjects:\nIntroduction: What we’re going to cover in this course\nMedia Trends: Review changing consumer and ad spending trends and how some major companies have adopted\nDefine Digital Media: Review each media type and their Pros and Cons\nSocial\nDisplay\nVideo\nSearch\nOTT\nAwareness vs. Direct Response: How to identify the type of campaign your client needs to run\nTargeting Options: How can we find our audience in a digital setting\nBehavioral\nContextual\nDemographic\nLocation\nData Platforms: What companies actually collect and sell data to digital advertisers\nKPIs & Success Metrics: How should we define success for each campaign\nPricing Models: How to buy and sell digital ads (No more points and GRPs)\nBenchmarks & Building a Proposal: Using Performance Benchmarks to determine client budget and create a proposal\nFinding Clients: Who can benefit from digital advertising\nStarting a Conversation: Open the doors with new clients and address their questions and concerns\nThree questions that you can use to build a plan\nCommon Client Questions & Answers and how to respond\nExpanding Your Reach: Get those first clients to increase reach and spend by scaling to regional and national deals\nSelf-Serve Platforms: Start executing campaigns with self-serve platforms TODAY\nGoogle Adwords\nFacebook Power Editor\nGroundTruth Ads Manager\nGoing Pro: Using white-labeled solutions to really scale your business and offer more solutions to your clients.\nThank You: Recap and additional resources",

C'est la base d'une bonne stratégie digitale. Le site doit permettre de convertir les visiteurs en prospects ou clients. On met donc souvent tout son coeur dans la réalisation de son site web et une immense joie nous envahie lorsque le site est enfin en ligne.\nSeulement, l'euphorie s'arrête brusquement lorsque l'on constate que notre site est très peu visité. En effet, avoir un site sans trafic revient à donner un coup d'épée dans l'eau.\nIl existe plusieurs manières de faire de l'acquisition de trafic et dans ce cours je vais justement vous montrer comment booster la croissance de votre entreprise grâce à la publicité en ligne.\n\n\nLa publicité en ligne présente plusieurs avantages :\n1⃣ Elle permet de générer du trafic instantanément, contrairement au SEO par exemple qui met plusieurs mois)\n2⃣ Elle permet de cibler très précisément les internautes les plus susceptibles d'être intéressés par nos produits et services\n3⃣ Elle est mesurable, on sait exactement pour quoi on paye. Tout l'inverse de la publicité \"off-line\" !\n\n\nLa publicité en ligne est aujourd'hui accessible à tous. Pas besoin d'avoir un budget pharamineux et les outils d'aide à la création des publicités ne nécessitent pas d'importantes compétences techniques.\nSeulement, il serait très dangereux de se lancer dans la publicité en ligne sans un minimum de connaissances.\nBeaucoup de personnes ont dû vous dire des choses comme :\n\"J'ai essayé Google Ads, j'ai dépensé tout mon budget en quelques clics et je n'ai eu aucune demande de contact\"\n\"J'ai essayé la publicité Facebook, c'est de l'arnaque j'ai eu beaucoup d'impressions, j'ai touché beaucoup de monde mais quasiment personne n'a cliqué sur ma publicité\"\nC'est normal, même si la publicité en ligne parait simple et abordable, elle nécessite quelques prérequis. C'est ce que je vais vous apporter aujourd'hui grâce à cette formation.\n\n\nGrâce à ma formation, vous allez apprendre :\nQuelles sont les opportunités et les avantages de la publicité en ligne\nLe fonctionnement de la publicité en ligne, quels sont les acteurs, les moyens techniques utilisés\nQuels sont les différents supports publicitaires (car ils sont nombreux)\nComment bien préparer sa campagne publicitaire ceci est INDISPENSABLE !\nGoogle Ads : comment lancer sa campagne publicitaire sur le réseau de recherche de Google ?\nFacebook Ads : comment lancer sa campagne publicitaire sur Facebook ?\nIl y a donc une première partie théorique et une partie pratique. La théorie est souvent mise de côté. Pourtant, elle est indispensable si l'on veut avoir une vision 360 de la publicité en ligne. La théorie permet également de limiter les risques de gaspillages, en évitant les erreurs classiques.\nAprès avoir suivi la formation, vous serez capable de lancer vos premières campagnes publicitaires.\n\n\nPour qui est fait ce cours ?\nQue vous soyez :\nUn responsable marketing souhaitant se lancer dans la publicité en ligne ou souhaitant confier la gestion de ses campagnes un prestataire\nUn entrepreneurs souhaitant faire la promotion de ses services sur internet en recherchant des leviers d'acquisition de trafic efficaces\nUn e-commerçant souhaitant acquérir de nouveaux clients en ligne grâce à la publicité\nCette formation est faite pour vous.",

No matter what your title or role is, you recognize the value of placing your business online and how that directly affects how much revenue and profit your business makes. I want to share with you this course “Mobile Traffic: Perform 4- 5 Times Better than Online Ads\".\nWhen it comes to advertising online you are probably using some paid methods like Google/Facebook Ads. I applaud you because you are doing what it takes to get your audience before an active audience. If you are like me, the problem you may have faced is that you want to get massive amounts of valuable and targeted traffic to your website without breaking the bank. You want a massive bang for your buck! You may be paying high rates for the visitors and conversions that you want. In addition to that, the amount you pay per click is high (compared to mobile advertising which is as low as $0.05 per click). In addition to that you may not be able to fully target your audience as you'd like. You also feel the pressures of massive amounts of competition on Google or Facebook. I have a solution for you! Helping other people to get started in their own businesses and growing their business sales and revenue is one of the main reason I started to create courses on Udemy. The other reason is that I've also been where you are.\nI want to introduce you to this course on mobile traffic generation. We both know that there was a point when the internet's growth exploded. There was another point, where advertising on Google also exploded business growth. Then there was Facebook. There is another wave that is currently building – mobile advertising. In this course, I will share with you how to get in an ad network/industry that we undeniably know will explode with tremendous possibility – the mobile market; the world of tablets, mobile phones, wearables and other handheld devices.

Your business would be poised to grow. Your revenue would be poised to grow.\nThis course will teach you how to get in front of the millions of people that are everyday using more and more of their mobile devices as oppose to their desktop. Statistics has shown that people are spending more and more hours daily on their phones to their desktops. They are more mobile devices now than desktops in the world and people are rarely ever a few feet from their devices. This means they are only a few feet away from your product, offer or service if you master what I share with you in this course!\nI share with you how to take your product, mobile optimize your web presence and share with you the top mobile advertising platforms. I also share with you a demo on how to set up a mobile ad campaign. By taking this course, you will be a lifetime member which comes with my commitment to share the best networks, the best strategies as the market grows, the best tools to ensure you are positioned before your audience as best as you can.\nWhen you complete this course, you will be able to position your offer on all the mobile web providers and in mobile apps. You may place text ads or you may place banner ads. These ads can be full page ads built into the apps your target market uses obsessively for maximum exposure. This is a market of tremendous possibility and potential. I want to guide you and your business into this mobile industry.\nThis course is constantly being updated. I want it to be a resource you come back to weekly or even monthly so you can see the lastest techniques and strategies that work right now! I will be adding content on the traffic component of your business but also on optimizing your website for the best appearance for your ads, increasing your sales conversion rate and communicating with your captive audience.\nI want you to enjoy this course and of course your business to see massive returns on this investment.\nIf for any reason, you don't find this information valuable, you may request a full refund of your month up to 30 days after your purchase.

      "description": "Googleリスティング広告コースの概要をご覧いただきありがとございます！\nこちらのコースはUdemyでは珍しい講師2名体制＆顔出しでの進行です。\n\n2人の掛け合いでしか生まれない分かりやすさや、裏話、余談などもコースの魅力です。\nぜひ、お役に立てれば嬉しいです。\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n■こちらのコースは短期間で広告運用を身につけるために、実演形式です\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n広告運用を難しくしている理由は、画面操作の複雑さです。\nリスティングの仕組み自体は決して難しくありません。\n\n\nそこで、PC上でリスティングの設定や操作をする手順の解説動画をたくさんご用意しました。\nこれで、書籍やネット記事を読み込んでも「広告画面を見た瞬間に心が折れた...」とはなりません。\n\n\nすぐに広告運用をはじめたい！早く試してみたい！という方にオススメのコースです。\n\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n■ワークショップを進めると、リスティング広告運用の準備がすべて終わります\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n各セクションの最後には広告運用のプロが実際に使っている運用シートを使ったワークショップがあります。\n・Google広告に登録して、タグの設置を確認する\n・アカウント設計シートに記入して、入稿するテキストを作成する\n・アカウント設計チェックシートを見ながら、ミスがないか確かめる\n・数値管理シートで広告運用のシュミレーションを作成する\nなど\n\n\n課題のための課題ではなく、広告スタートのためのワークを進めるので、時間の無駄がありません。\n\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n■デジタル広告の経験が無くても、リスティングで売上は伸ばせます\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n大手企業のマーケティング担当でも、実際にリスティングの運用経験がある人は少数派です。\nほとんどの広告運用者は知識ゼロからスタートします。\n\n\nそれでも、リスティング広告で売上は伸ばせます。\nなぜならリスティング広告は、最も費用対効果が高い広告だからです。\n今でも、日本の広告運用額の50%以上をリスティング広告が占めていることが証拠です。\n\n\nまずはリスティング広告。次にInstagram広告などのSNS広告を進めるのが、広告活用の王道です。\n\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n■社内のマーケティング担当を助けたい\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n「リスティングをやれと言われているけど、相談できる人もいないし、広告代理店に依頼する予算もない」\nと困っているマーケティング担当を助けたいという想いでコースを制作しました。\n\n\nSNSやブログを使ったマーケティングならともかく「プライベートにリスティング運用してました！」という人はいません。\nまた、広告運用は経験を積むだけでもお金がかかります。\n\n\nそのため「とりあえず、やってみる」がとても難しい領域ですが、\n本コースで指針を立ててから始めれば、無駄なお金を浪費してしまうことを避けられます。\n\n\nまた、上司や社内でリスティング運用を提案をする際にも、体系立てた説明と準備を事前に用意できます。\n\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n■集客に困っているフリーランスを助けたい\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSNSやブログでの集客に限界を感じているフリーランスも、リスティングが突破口になります。\nフリーランスなら企業ほどの売上は必要ありませんから、配信対象を制限して少ないコストで的確な集客ができます。\n\n\nどの広告メニューであれ、予算がかかることは避けられないのは事実ですが、\nTwitterやInstagramの投稿を作っている時間もフリーランスにとってはコストです。\n\n\n月数万円〜のリスティング運用ができれば、毎日SNSをがんばらなくても継続的な集客が可能です。\n\n\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n■コースを受講すると身につくこと\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nリスティング広告のはじめ方と運用手法が身につくのは当然として\nリスティングができることの幅と、便利さに驚く人が多いです。\n\n\nリスティングって専門的な知識と経験が必要で、複雑な設定を乗り越えなくちゃいけない。一部の専門家だけの道具だよね。\nこんな想像をしている方が受講すると「え？これだけで終わりなの？」とびっくりするかもしれません。\n\n\nぜひ、続きは講座にて解説させてください。\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n■コースには安心の返金保証付き\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nこちらのコースには30日間の返金保証が付いています。\nどうぞご安心して購入してください。\n\n\n詳しくはUdemy内の【Udemy】→【購入/返金】→【返金】よりご確認ください。",

      "description": "UPDATE: Einführung in Programmatic Advertising gibt es jetzt auch auf Deutsch! Schalten Sie einfach die deutschen Untertitel ein, wenn Sie das Video starten, und sehen Sie, wie der gesamte Kurs ins Deutsche übersetzt wird. Hallo an meine Freunde aus Deutschland! (Now available in German!)\n\n\nHave you heard the term Programmatic Advertising before? What about RTB? Maybe you've heard of an SSP or a DSP or an exchange. But do you really know what these terms mean and what these companies do?\n\n\nIn 2020 programmatic advertising was a $65B a year industry, or about 20% of all digital ad dollars. By 2022 90% of all digital ads were transacting programmactially, totally nearly $200 Billion. An industry of this size, with such explosive growth requires a lot work by many different companies. It also requires a complex system that results in benefits for all parties.\n\n\nIn Introduction to Programmatic Advertising you'll be taken through the process of a programmatic ad buying, the ad-tech companies involved, and the benefits for both advertisers and publishers. I'll breakdown the ecosystem piece by piece in order to clearly explain what \"programmatic\" actually means.\n\n\nBy taking this course you'll be joining over 50,000 students that I've taught to date in over 130 countries. My classes on digital advertising have received hundreds of 5 star reviews from seasoned media professionals, to recent college grads. I know you'll not only learn something from this course, but you'll enjoy the experience.\n\n\nOverview: Get immersed into the world of programmatic advertising. In this introductory level course, designed for those with an intermediate understanding of the digital marketing space, I'll explain exactly what programmatic advertising actually is, and how it's executed. I use simple visuals to illustrate complex systems, and provide clear definitions for industry terms and short-hand. It is perfect for anyone who is interested in advertising their business online, looking for a job in digital media planning, wondering how major brands decide to place an ad online, a student focusing on marketing and advertising, or those who are generally interested in how the ads you see online are created and served to you.\n\n\nCourse Subjects:\nDefine Digital Advertising - What is considered digital advertising\nAd Sizes & Standards - Which ad sizes and units are actually covered in a programmatic buy\nCommon Pricing Models - What are the common pricing models and the formulas to calculate\nAd-Tech Companies - There are lots of different companies that handle programmatic, but they all have different traits that make them unique and valuable\nPublisher Integrations - How does a publisher like a website or mobile app, actually go about working with a programmatic tool\nProgrammatic Process - We'll visualize the actual process of executing a buy\nUsing Data to Inform Buys - Data is the new oil and that's no different in programmatic. We'll discuss how companies can use data to enhance their buys\nProgrammatic vs. RTB - These two terms are used together a lot, but they are not the same thing\nPricing The Bid - How do both publishers and advertisers decide how much to price their bids\nAuction Types - To execute a bid there must be an auction, but there are multiple kinds to review\nReporting - What information is reported with a programmatic buy and why is it important\n\n\nReal-Life Student Reviews:\n★★★★★ “I'm in advertising sales and have been looking for a clean easy way to explain and also test my root knowledge of the programmatic ad space. It was very helpful and simple to understand which is hard to do with this topic.” - Raul Bonilla\n★★★★★ \"Being an advertising agency media planner and buyer, having this hands on information helps when we face a decision to go into the digital advertising space. Your 101 and 201 was extremely informative and truly like your overviews in a very simplistic explanation. Thank you and look forward to your future courses.\" - Diane Tody\n\n\nReviews from Other Courses\n\n\nDigital Advertising & Marketing 101\n\n\n★★★★★ “The real-world examples almost makes it self-explanatory. Professionally done and author speaks with authority - i.e. he knows what he's talking about and it shows.” - AJ Du Toit\n★★★★★ “Thought this was an excellent introduction course. Working in the industry without a huge amount of experience in this area, it was a great way to familiarize myself with topics in ongoing conversations internally and externally. Will be taking 201 to further my understanding.” - Jocleyn Armour\n★★★★★ “It is advertised as a 101 course and it did exactly that and very well, touching on the building blocks of Digital Advertising and Marketing. Good job Ben.” - Jean C\n\n\nDigital Advertising & Marketing 201\n\n\n★★★★★ “When combined with Ben's 101 course, the two classes make for a thorough and well-organized primer on digital media today. Perfect for marketing people and agency folks (creative, account) who are not immersed in a media agency. It will give you a foundation for how digital media is structured, a clear explanation of the jargon and acronyms you'll hear bantered about, and a better understanding of the opportunities available. The 201 course goes into important detail about some of the key changes that have taken place in digital advertising recently. Ben explains the concepts clearly and succinctly. Definitely worth the time investment.” - Shawn E Fraser\n★★★★★ “This course is amazing. I do affiliate marketing and always wanted to learn about programmatic advertising and this course me taught that. I completed this for an interview and the employer was really impressed by the knowledge I had. Hope there is another in-depth version of this course. Where he goes into ad platforms or ad servers and teaches the real world applications.” - Suryameet Singh\n★★★★★ “Comprehensive overview...detailed!” - Kaithlean Crotty-Clark",

Celebrity endorsements are often followed by marketers to allow brands get liberated from the communication clutter but then merely resorting to celebrity endorsements for brand promotion is not enough. First and foremost a marketer needs to understand whether or not a brand requires a celebrity. If yes, then there has to be absolute prudence in not just short listing a celebrity for a brand but also the conceptualization of the endorsement plot. Lack of effectiveness on these counts will do more harm to a brand through endorsements rather than any good.\nThe course thus takes the students through various important aspects related to celebrity endorsements like the science behind celebrity selection, contributors and outcomes of endorsements have been explained. Also how to manage endorsements across industry verticals so as to enhance company profitability and brand preferences.\nAlthough the course carries examples based on Indian market, the designing of the curriculum is globally relevant and applicable. It is expected that students after undertaking this course will emerge as wise and effective brand communication professionals to offer brands greater visibility and mileage.",

      "description": "\"To advertise your products on Google, you need a Merchant Center Account\" - this is a direct quote from Google.\nThis course teaches the student how to setup a Google Merchant Center Account, enter product information into it, verify and integrate the Merchant Center with your website, integrate it with Google AdWords and create powerful AdWords pay per click adds that will separate you from competitor adds. If you want your products to be advertised within the Google world so people can find your products and site, this is a process you must complete and implement. I will also show you within this course how to implement and integrate Google Express which will allow people to easily view, purchase and get shipped the products you have uploaded to your Merchant Center account.\nAugmenting this training that will show you how to set up your Merchant Account environment, I have included three key lectures on improving the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) that I previously published in another of my courses on the Udemy platform. These three SEO lectures will give you some great tips that will allow you to fare significantly better in having the Shopping Pages on your website rank within the Google Search Engines.  In fact, by completing these additional tasks described within these three lectures, you will be able to do your Google AdWords pay per click at reduced cost per click rates, saving you money each time someone clicks on one of your adds so do not fail to implement these additional steps.\nGoogle does have a significant amount of textual help within its training environment that you can also refer to but it is a lot of reading and piecing together of this content that you will need to go through in order to understand it all and complete the required setup and integration tasks. What I have done is learned their system and have created these videos to provide you with more of a step by step visual and audio narrative of what you need to do to get up and running. This course you will find is easier to digest and will save you time in the learning and it will be a less frustrating experience for some.\nSo if you have not as yet integrated the Google Merchant Center with your online shopping site or store, I encourage you to take this course and do so.\nI look forward to seeing you on the inside.\nBest wishes,\n- Dan Grijzenhout - Course Creator",

Going by the Zenith Media programmatic marketing forecast, published in November 2018, about 65 percent of digital media spends in 2019 will be programmatic.

It’s an in-demand skill that will help you take your career to the next level and this course will help you accomplish that!\n\n\nIn this course, we’ll begin with an understanding of what programmatic advertising really is. I will then take you through the fundamentals of the digital advertising auction, for those of you who are not familiar with it.

We will go through the entire process to build and publish the iPhone sticker app.\nThen we will go through all the steps to create the Facebook Ad campaign, and how to understand and analyze the perfect target audience.\nOther courses like these cost between $500 to $1000 dollars.

Dans cette formation, je vous explique en détail, en mettant tout en pratique devant vous, toutes les étapes de la recherche d'une audience (ensemble de personnes correspondant à vos clients potentiels). Je réalise des recherches d'audiences que j'utilise dans la suite de la formation pour faire des publicités, en direct, devant vous ! Je vous fournis 2 stratégies redoutables qui vous permettront d'avoir de très bonnes bases de travail. Même si vous êtes complètement novice, vous y arriverez.\nVous saurez tout ce qu'il faut savoir pour créer tous les types d'audiences (sauvegardées, personnalisées et similaires) que propose Facebook. Ces audiences constituent un véritable \"trésor\" si vous savez bien les utiliser. Pour être plus clair, Facebook est capable de rassembler les caractéristiques communes de vos meilleurs clients afin de les utiliser pour trouver des milliers d'autres personnes qui présentent des caractéristiques similaires. L'utilisation de ce type d'outil vous permettra d'exploser littéralement vos résultats.\nLa troisième difficulté lorsqu'on débute est de se constituer cette base de clients pour que Facebook puisse vous en trouver d'autres. La stratégie 5PC que je vous propose dans cette formation vous permettra de vous créer cette base de clients et cela de façon mécanique. Encore une fois, je ne fais pas que vous expliquez comment faire, mais je le fais devant vous sur une vrai boutique en direct. Mon but est de vous partager le raisonnement qui accompagne l'application de la stratégie 5PC sur des publicités et des clients bien réels.\nQue vous soyez un débutant complet ou que vous ayez déjà mis en place quelques publicités mais sans grand succès, cette formation est faite pour vous.\nVous aurez une vision d'ensemble très claire, la compréhension des meilleurs outils publicitaires actuels et surtout un plan d'action précis et concret à appliquer dès aujourd'hui.\nPour commencer tout de suite, il vous suffit de cliquer sur le bouton \"Acheter maintenant\" et je vous retrouve dans la première vidéo. Je vous attends !\nLionel",

Everything is practical as far as advice. It isn't for novices, which I like. It is really hard to find any SEM courses that doesn't cater to an introductory level.

I have been looking EVERYWHERE for REAL advanced Google Ads strategies that are current and I found a very short detailed eBook with a few very solid strategies. I was so impressed that I reached out to Mark personally via email and that lead me here to his course packed with even more advanced strategies! Take this course it is worth it's weight in gold!\"\nLaura Manenti wrote:\n\"Really useful, clear and something handy to easily put in practice. I liked also that you were showing in practice how to apply the concepts explained.\"\nMalvika Jain wrote:\n\"Excellent course. I was using Adwords in-depth 2013-15 and now wanted to get back to it. Seemed a herculean task but the pace and depth of this course was perfect at 2x speed. Looking fwd to trying many of the things mentioned here, and trying other courses by this instructor. The GA part was great.\"\nErdjan Remziev wrote:\n\"He absolutely amazed me by the knowledge he has.

Thank that's really advanced course.\"\n\n\nMore About the Course:\nThe course covers specialised Ad reports like the organic & paid interaction report, remarketing strategy, machine learning functionality, competitor research, Google Analytics and so much more.\nAnother module contains a free Google Sheets template which automates budget tracking for multiple accounts.  Simply connect to Google Analytics and track multiple budgets, never log in again to multiple Ad accounts.  It is also gives results as to spend per day to meet monthly planned budgets.\nI've also included a 30 minute Google Ads Audit, which takes you through step-by-step inside Google Ads from an account level to an AdGroup level all kinds of key issues that often I have found occurring inside accounts.  I have completed 100's of Audits, I use this experience to show you common pitfalls and things you should be looking for.\nThe course is module based and not run to a particular order, so you can choose a module or technique that seems useful to you, learn about it and apply it to your own practice.  All the techniques taught can be applied to almost any Google Ads account, they have been chosen for their practicality and usefulness.  I will also be adding more modules into the course with time as I record them.  I hope you enjoy the courses!",

      "description": "Hi, I'm Isaac Rudansky and welcome to my complete remarketing / retargeting course where you're going to learn how to profitably re-engage with your abandoning website visitors to get them to come back to your site at the right time and with the right message.\nThis course pulls from a huge variety of experience managing hundreds of unique retargeting ads campaigns for a broad range of clients in almost every vertical out there.\nOur clients often ask me, \"What is retargeting and how does it work?\"\nRetargeting, which is also referred to as remarketing (they're the same thing) is any digital advertising campaign that targets ads promoting your products and services to people who had previously bounced off your site.\n95% of your website visitors do not convert (or take any revenue-generating action) on their first visit. I am going to teach you the art and science of retargeting so you can have a chance to convert the vast majority of your visitors that simply weren't ready to convert on their first visit.\nRetargeting is the most effective way to bring those users back (through your actual, live retargeting ad campaigns), at the precise time that they're ready to convert.\nI'm going to explain exactly how retargeting works from a technological perspective, and I'm going to show you how the technology has matured and advanced through the years. Simply put, retargeting is accomplished through dropping cookies on your visitors' browsers which allows your retargeting platform to follow that user around the internet.\nCookies are dropped on your visitors' browser through a little piece of code that you put on your site, often referred to as a pixel. If you're remarketing with AdWords, then AdWords is going to supply the pixel for you to place on your site. If you're remarketing with Adroll, then Adroll will supply their cookie for you to place on their site.\nAll this talk of cookies, pixels and tracking codes may sound complex, but in fact it's really easy to learn once you get the hang of it. The technology isn't the important part of this course .... what I teach you about understanding your customers psychologically and how to actually configure, develop and optimize profitable retargeting campaigns is where the true value lies.\nRetargeting remains one of the most effective forms of online advertising, and it's used by your competitors to convert the majority of their traffic. Experts predict that within the next few years, most if not all display ads inventory on the web will be remarketing and retargeting ads.\nRetargeting is so effective because it helps you stay in the forefront of your customers' minds and enables you to bring them back to your website when they're actually ready to convert. Every time your customer engages with one of your retargeted ads, you increase your brand recognition and make it all the more likely that that shopper will eventually become a customer of yours.\nRetargeting campaigns typically see much higher click through rates and conversion rates than traditional search and display campaigns, which further illustrates how important it is that you have the knowledge and skills to develop your own successful remarketing and retargeting campaigns.\nUsing Google AdWords Remarketing campaigns, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and more, I will teach you step by step how to finally get the maximum value out of your website visitors with highly successful retargeting campaigns.\nFor much less than the price of one dinner out with the family, you're going to get over 10 hours of video lectures, access to our student discussion forum, and the ability to ask me any questions you may have as you progress through the course.\nOn top of all that, you get lifetime access and a 30 day, 100% money back guarantee!\nZERO Experience Required\nIn this course you will learn:\n\nWhat retargeting and how does it work?\nWhat are remarketing campaigns in Google AdWords?\nThe technology behind retargeting and how \"follow-me\" ads actually get served\nThe history of ad exchanges and ad networks\nHow to look at your website visitors from a psychological perspective\nHow to plan and develop your remarketing lists\nThe concepts of the buyers funnel and how to determine where in the funnel your visitors are\nThe concept of engagement and how to use intent signals to your advantage\nHow to use Google Tag Manager to track advanced audience segments like scroll depth tracking and on-site session timers\nHow to deploy your tags and variables through Google Tag Manager\nHow to use Google Analytics to track the most important metrics and data\nHow to set up, optimize and manage your remarketing campaigns inside Google AdWords\n... and much, much more!\nSo what are you waiting for?\nClick the \"take this course\" button now, or feel free to preview some of the lecture below.\nEither way, I really appreciate you taking the time to check out this course, and I can't wait to see you in a couple minutes on the other side!\nCheers,\nIsaac",

How to get people to talk fondly about you to their friends, family, coworkers and social media contacts. Word of mouth advertising is free and the best advertising there is because it's other people, highly satisfied customers recommending you to people they know. Advertising is more effective when customers speak highly of you and if done the right way can lead to increased sales and increased growth in your business. How to get customers satisfied so they speak highly of you and get more customers to come to you. I teach you strategies to get your customers to talk highly of you. Here's to our success!\nIn today’s day and age, word of mouth is so powerful because of social media. In the past, one satisfied customer can maybe tell a handful of friends, family and coworkers about the great product they bought and the amazing place they shopped at. Now people can reach thousands of potential customers through social media and tell them how much they liked or disliked a store or a product. This makes word of mouth more  important than ever.\nIn the course I’m going to get into how to sell to customers so that you get the maximum amount of good quality word of mouth to grow your business.",

With more than 2 billion active users, there’s never been a better time to get your business on the world’s second-most popular social media platform and reach a new audience.\nYouTube is also the world’s second-largest search engine, right after Google, which makes it fertile ground for free organic marketing.\nBetween Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin, and all the other social platforms, it’s hard to know where you should invest your time. While it’s never bad to be present on all platforms, setting up a YouTube channel for your business should be your top priority.\nWhy? Video dominates social media, and YouTube is the largest platform entirely dedicated to it.\n\nThe number of marketers and consumers already using the platform speaks to its power. Oberlo found that 8 out of 10 marketers consider YouTube to be the most effective video marketing platform.\nLikewise, of its 2 billion users, Google found that 90% of people use YouTube to discover new products.\nSurprisingly, YouTube is a relatively untapped platform for small businesses. Only 9% of small businesses have signed up for it, which suggests there’s still plenty of space left for your business.\n\n\nYouTube is the second largest search engine in the world\nYouTube is used by 55% of marketers\nPeople watch over 1 billion hours of YouTube video content each day\nYouTube is available in over 100 countries and 80 languages\nOver 500 hours of video content is uploaded to YouTube every minute\nViews on videos targeted at “beginners” increased 50% in 2020\nYouTube is the most widely used social platform among US adults\nYouTube generated over $5 billion in advertising revenue in Q3 2020\nSource: Sproutsocial\n\n\nBrands advertise on YouTube because it’s the world’s second most popular website, drawing 2 billion logged-in visitors a month.\nIf you’re deciding how to allocate your video ad budget, YouTube has the vast reach and powerful targeting capabilities that make it an undeniably valuable platform across the customer journey.\nBut let’s be upfront: YouTube ads aren’t the most intuitive part of your social media advertising strategy.\nRest assured that taking a bit of extra time to learn the fundamentals now is going to pay off in your ROI later.",

      "description": "OVER 1,900 INSPIRED STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN THIS COURSE\nHow Would Your Business Change If You Could Get In Front Of Millions of People Weekly Without Breaking The Bank?\n\nNow You Too Can Discover How to Quickly and Easily Get the Traffic You Need… No Experience or Fancy Tech Skills Required!\nThe most common challenge I hear from business owners is the lack of website traffic. Many have shared with me that they have lost a significant percentage of search traffic over the past year or two, and are continuously looking for new ways to drive relevant traffic to their site. They have also shared with me that because they don't get traffic they often don't get the sales they need.\nAs a business owner, you need 'traffic' to really win. Visitors to a site of your choice (whether it is one that you own or one you promote as an affiliate) is one of the most crucial parts needed to win.\nWithout traffic, you don't cross the finish line. You don't collect the winner's check. You don't get the result you're working hard to achieve. You fall back in the pack while those with full tanks pass you by and take what could have been yours.\nIf you want to significantly increase your revenue, you need to significantly increase your web traffic.\nThis is true no matter what business model you're using.\nIt doesn't matter if you're selling your own product at your own site.\nIt doesn't matter if you're promoting someone else's product as an affiliate.\nIt doesn't matter if you're trying to get people to click on AdSense ads.\nIt doesn't matter if you're blogging, flipping sites, coaching or anything else.\nIt doesn't matter if you're promoting business offers or non-business offers, low-cost offers or high-ticket offers, the point is:\nYou won't make a dime unless you get eyeballs in front of your offers.\nYou will not – cannot – make money without traffic.\nBut not just any traffic will do.\nYou need responsive traffic. People who are interested in your particular offer, in fact eager to buy your offer because it's exactly what they want.\nThe question is:\nHow do you get this traffic?\nNobody has to convince you that you need traffic, right? You got this figured out by now. You know that it's a numbers game … the more people who come to your site, the more sales you make.\nIt's simple math.\nThe reason other sites make great number of sales is because they get a great amount of traffic to their sites. All things being equal, the one who gets the most traffic gets the most orders.\nIn essence…\nTraffic that is converting = money in the bank.\nPreaching to the choir, right? You already know this. What you probably don't know is how to fuel up. What you probably don't know is how to get the maximum amount of traffic to your site with the minimum amount of effort and the least amount of money invested.\nI've got GREAT news for you…\nThere is a way to get in front of millions of people per week starting at a couple hundred dollars. This is using an offline traffic method that you can completely dominate because your competition is being distracted by the next new shiny ball.\nThat's right, these are the proven strategies and now I'm going to share them with you. These are the strategies you'll wish you started using ages ago! This traffic strategy is proven and time-tested. These are the ones that work today and will work tomorrow. They're reliable, predictable… and profitable!\nTop 5 Reason Why This Traffic Rocks!\nReason 1: No going broke trying to learn the ropes!\nReason 2: These strategies level the playing field between you and the big dogs in your niche!\nReason 3: These traffic avenues are surprisingly powerful, targeted and profitable!\nReason 4: It's easy to get started – you could be implementing your first traffic strategy in just minutes from now and get in front of your audience in a week!\nReason 5: These strategies are just as good if not BETTER than many forms of paid advertising, so you'll enjoy great results without breaking the bank in advertising costs!\nNow listen, these traffic strategies may not be all glitzy and new. But these are the reliable workhorses. These are the ones that will attract traffic to your website day after day after day…\nEnd result?\nMore money in your bank account to buy those little extras and do those things you've been talking about.\nMore free time enjoying friends, family and hobbies (and less time at your computer). And…\nMore opportunities that arise from running a successful online business\n\n\nCheck out what you will learn from this course in the “What am I going to get from this course?\" section.\nIf all of this sounds good, then you're check out the preview lectures and take this course!\nThe Better than Money Back Guarantee\nOf course there is a 30 day money back guarantee. However, I want to present to you tremendous amounts of value. If you don't like this course or don't see how your product/service/offer can effectively convert more visitors to sales, I demand that you get 100% of your money back. In addition to getting your money back, you can keep this course for free! I will also give you access to one of my future courses I create as a parting gift – two of which will be on mobile traffic and video ads.",

I've built the only Facebook Ads course you will ever need - now updated as of September 2016!\nWhy should you trust me with your Facebook Ads education? Well, I've worked with some pretty awesome clients like John Lee Dumas of EOFire.com, Target Corporation (yes, that Target), Leadpages, and over 30 small e-commerce, info marketing, consulting, and local service businesses in the last 2 years. I've also spent well over $1MM on the platform, so I've got a pretty good idea on what works and what absolutely doesn't.\nIn this course you'll learn how to finally set up your Facebook Ads for success without any of the guesswork. The best part? I've designed the course to be completed within about 90 minutes. Do you have 90 minutes to skyrocket your leads and sales? Thought so.\nThe course is taught almost entirely through video and will be updated as new developments and features arise with Facebook Ads.

Offline is how you treat your guest when they arrive at your Airbnb (check-in, house manual, amenities, etc.). Online is how you present yourself and your Airbnb listing to the FPG. This course focuses on the online aspect, but because the offline aspect is so important, I touch on the most important parts that flow directly into your online listing (ie, reviews).\n\n\nYou will learn about:\nProper photo arrangement\nDo photo captions really matter?\nWhy + HOW to respond to guest reviews (both positive and negative)\nHow to use behavioral psychology principles to complete the text in your listing and your profile\nA pricing trick that virtually gaurantee you more listing views\nA title trick that will get more eyeballs on your listing from the start\nHow to properly fill in all of your text sections (even if you don't know what to say)\nWhat makes a good house rules section\nHow cancellation policies affect your occupancy",

Gib mir ein paar Sekunden und ich erkläre dir, wie du vom Thema \"Copywriting\" profitieren kannst:\nFür jeden da draußen, der ein funktionierendes Business sicherstellen oder aufziehen möchte, gibt es zwei Möglichkeiten:\nMan springt ins kalte Wasser und hofft darauf, dass man schwimmt.\nMan lernt, wie ein gelungenes Marketing die Zielgruppe anspricht und die Produkte verkauft, die man selbst anbietet.\nUnd genau bei zweiter Punkt kommt das Thema \"Copywriting\" ins Spiel: Nur mit richtig guten Werbetexten, Ad-Texten, Werbemails, Copys für's e-Commerce erreichst du deine Zielgruppe.\nNur, wenn du online verkaufen kannst, wirst du erfolgreich sein.\nNur, wenn du weißt, worauf es bei Werbetexten und Verkaufstexten wirklich ankommt, wirst du dein Business skalieren können.\nDarum: Lerne noch heute in nur über zwei Stunden alles, was du für eine erfolgreiche Praxis in Sachen Werbetexten benötigst. Lerne alles, was dir andere vermeintliche \"Coaches\" in Wochen oder Monaten vermitteln wollen – und setze es bereits morgen um.\nPlus: Als guter Copywriter tust du nicht nur dir selbst und deinem Business einen Gefallen. Du kannst daraus auch ein Geschäftsmodell aufziehen und das Copywriting, das du hier im Kurs lernst, als eigene Dienstleistung für eigene Kunden anbieten. Auch darüber sprechen wir im Kurs.\nNatürlich hast du bei all dem, wie gewohnt, eine 30-tägige Geld-zurück-Garantie. Plus einen 24/7-Support von mir persönlich hier auf Udemy sowie via E-Mail.\nAlso – bist du gleich dabei?\nIch freue mich auf dich im Kurs!\nDein Alex Schreiner",

      "description": "Now known as Google Ads for search, it is an online advertising platform. Here, you can pay Google some amount of money to show your ads on Websites, Google Search Results, YouTube, and inside some apps using keywords. It works on a PPC or Pay Per Click basis; here, you will only pay if a user clicks on your ads. As the name suggests, most ad types on AdWords are textual with a headline and some descriptions with a link to the advertiser’s website.\nIn a nutshell, it works on a bidding basis. These bids are done on keywords. Meaning, if you want your ad to appear when someone searches for “Buy Laptops,” you will bid some amount, and it will be compared to other advertisers’ bids. If your bid is the most relevant in the competition, your ad will be shown. When the user clicks on your ad, he will be taken to your website, and you will be charged. Now, just to be clear, when deciding what ad to show to a visitor, Google also looks at ad relevancy, user preferences, location, and some other factors, but typically, Bid Amount is a big factor.\nNow that we have discussed how Google AdWords works and its uses, it is necessary to understand that it is not the only Ad Platform available on the internet. Bing Ads, Media dot net, etc., are also ad networks that support advertising.",

It can drain your bank account before you even know it.\nYou wouldn’t be the first to blow your entire budget in a matter of hours, if not days.\nPeople do it all the time, and even seasoned professionals find themselves stuck in this mess.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. Sure, Google Ads is complicated and can be very expensive.\nIt’s a tough nut to crack, but not impossible.\n\n\nA Constant Source Of Traffic\nThe reason why so many online marketers like Google Ads is that it provides a constant source of reliable traffic.\nThere’s no SEO involved or the need to tweak web pages. It’s just a matter of buying the traffic and converting it.\nSEO is a time-consuming method to get traffic, and some people don’t want to wait for it.\nYou may have a time-sensitive product that you’re promoting.\nIf this is the case, then the only way to get traffic is by using Google Ads.\n\n\nAbuse And Fraud Are Closely Monitored\nGoogle backs Google Ads, and they have measures in place to make sure you’re buying real targeted traffic.\nOther places sell questionable traffic. While Google Ads may be expensive, you don’t have to worry about fraudulent clicks.\nThis in itself makes paying extra all that much more worthwhile. You’ll be able to avoid the pitfall of paying something for nothing.\nMany people lose faith in pay per click advertising because they buy traffic from companies that don’t screen it properly.\nWhen this happens, you end up paying for something and getting nothing in return.\n\n\nIt’s All About The Cost\nYou're not looking for just any traffic here. You want the cheap stuff that converts.\nMany of you reading this right now will think that it’s not possible to buy cheap traffic and make money from it.\nThe key to doing this is by understanding how Google Ads works. You can comb through all of the niches and find some pretty good deals.\nThe reason why most people don’t see these deals is that they’re too lazy to look for them.\n\n\nIntroducing…\nGet Cheap Traffic With Google Ads\nWe’ll Show You How To Keep Costs Down\nThe price you pay for traffic is important because it will determine your profit margin.\nIt will also decide whether you’re able to continue with the advertising campaign.\nAfter watching our videos, you’ll be able to keep costs to a minimum.\nThis will produce higher profits and enable you to run your ads for more extended periods.\nThe key to conversions is exposing your offer to as many people as possible.\nThis can’t happen if you’re spending big bucks and getting little results from it.\n\n\nTake The Guesswork Out Of Google Ads\nWe’ve been advertising on Google Ads for quite some time. We’ll show you the ins and outs of the entire process.\nYou’ll be able to quickly and easily discover new keywords that can be bought for next to nothing.\nThese keywords, in the end, will be what makes or breaks your business. Stay ahead of the competition by being more profitable than they are.\nThe way you do that is by paying less for clicks and by being able to buy more of them.\n\n\nSign up for this training today and make your future as bright as it possibly can be.\nMany people that try to figure things out on their own end up wasting a lot of time and get frustrated and end up with nothing.\nThat’s because they spin their wheels, follow bad advice, and just don’t get the right roadmap to success.\nThis video series will prevent that from happening… When you invest in this training today, you watch as I do it… and you replicate it.\nIt’s THAT simple...\n\n\nCourse Description:\nMost people do not know how to get started with all the Social Media products online today. With our range of Fast Track Training courses designed for beginners, you will be up and running in no time and surfing the web with confidence.\n\n\nGoogle Ads (Beginners & Advanced): Fast Track Training is a straight to the point, step by step training course to get you started immediately.\n\n\nSee the course subjects below:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGoogle Ads For (Beginners): Fast Track Training\n1 - Overview - Beginners\n2 - Account Opening\n3 - Account Reactivation\n4 - Setting Up Your Billing\n5 - Allowing Team Access\n6 - Data Protection Contacts\n7 - Keyword Planner - Part 1\n8 - Keyword Planner - Part 2\n9 - Keyword Planner - Part 3\n10 - Campaign Creation - Part 1\n11 - Campaign Creation - Part 2\n12 - Campaign Creation - Part 3\n13 - Campaign Creation - Part 4\n14 - Campaign Creation - Part 5\n15 - Campaign Creation - Part 6\n16 - Predefined Reporting\n17 - Custom Reports\n18 - Placement Exclusion List\n19 - Rules and Automations\n20 - Conclusion - Beginners\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nGoogle Ads (Advanced): Fast Track Training\n21 - Overview - Advanced\n22 - Ad Variations\n23 - Using the Forecast Planner\n24 - Connection to Google Resources\n25 - Connection to Autoresponders\n26 - Connection to Zapier Resources\n27 - Connection to Facebook through Zapier\n28 - Connection to LinkedIn through Zapier\n29 - Connection to WordPress through Zapier\n30 - Connection to Twitter though Zapier\n31 - AdWords and Audiences - Part 1\n32 - AdWords and Audiences - Part 2\n33 - AdWords and Audiences - Part 3\n34 - Store and Retail Ads\n35 - Live Example - Part 1\n36 - Live Example - Part 2\n37 - Live Example - Part 3\n38 - Live Example - Part 4\n39 - Live Example - Part 5\n40 - Conclusion - Advanced",

Being here means you are already trying Conversion Rate Optimization ( CRO ) to generate more sales and leads to your business.\nAnd let's face it, the biggest lead-generating platforms there are the giants - Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, and a few others.\nWhat we'll do in this course is to take one of these and showcase to you my 5 starts strategy for building profitable advertising campaigns.\nMy name is Grigor Yovov and I am running an advertising business since 2011.\nBut first thing first!\nBare with me and just for a moment picture your business as a Pizza Delivery company.\nSo, you have your pizza and you want to sell it to more, and more customers so badly.\nBecause you want to grow your business.\nBut wait! Not so fast!\nLet me quickly jump into the calculations to show you what happens in 95% of these cases with real business numbers!\nYour goal is to improve lead generation and sales in order to increase your income and profitability.\nThis is where the 5 stars business development strategy comes into place!\nBut first thing first.\nLet's start with a simple slice of pizza, or why not a whole pizza!\nSo, you have your pizza, it costs $27.99. Let's make it $28 to ease the calculations.\nNow, usually, a family order a pizza bundle for 120$. Including 4 big pizzas, french fries, and coca-cola.\nNow let's assume that one out of 100 visitors of your pizza delivery website makes a $120 order.\n2 out of 100, means 2% of your website visitors convert into clients.\nCongrats! You just calculate your \"Conversion rate\"!\nThis is a very important number, remember it.\nNow, let's go further  and  beyond the Google Ads Certification.\nYou have expenses included in the price of the pizza. Like your rent, staff salaries, electric bills, and others.\nLet's say 50% of every pizza order goes for these expenses and you left with the other 50% income.\nIn this case, you have a $120 avg order so it means you have an income of $60 after all the business expenses.\nSo you need to pay less than $60 for advertising to generate an order to be successful.\nNow, let's turn back to the \"Conversion rate\" we calculated earlier, it was 2% right.\nThis means that you need to pay 100 clicks to Google Ads in order to generate 2 pizza bundles orders.\nWe can take a simple avg cost per click of $3.7 checked for the New York area, so 100 clicks equal a $370 advertising budget.\nAnd guess what, you just spend $370 to generate a single pizza order at a total cost of $240 totally for both orders.\nSomething wrong, right?!\nAnd there's more!\nFrom these $240 you have already spend half on business expenses, so you have a total calculation of:\n$120 income - $370 for ads = -$250 lost for your business\nThis is how 90% of businesses lose money with unprofitable advertising campaigns.\nSo, what's the solution?\nMy name is Grigor Yovov and I am running my advertising business since 2011.\nI have created a 5 stars practical system to solve this problem for my clients and now I will share it with you!\nIn this course, I'll show you how to build your successful advertising strategy.\nJoin me and let's begin!\nHow many times have you faced a client with unrealistic or poorly defined advertising goals?\nIt's not their fault!\nIt's your job as an expert to provide expertise and put order into their world in order to gain progress & profit.\nThis is not a technical course despite we need to touch on the topic of numbers and formulas at some point, this is more of a business course since the very same strategy keeps my business alive since 2011.\nThe foundation of the performance marketing service no matter we speak about Google Ads, Facebook Ads or other platforms is the right goals set up.\nWhat is a good goal?\nIt motivates\nMakes you think\nInspires you\nRewards you\nLeads you to concrete actions\nIt takes you to a new path\nIt is measurable\nData based\nExactly to the point\nAchievable\nRelevant at the moment\nWith a precise deadline\nThat keeps the customers\nProfitable\nContinuously Developing\nAbout the author of this course: Grigor has been the owner of the digital agency Business Trend since 2011. Bachelor of Marketing. Founder of a number of courses on the Udemy platform with more than 20,000 students. Certified Google Ads & Google Analytics expert with more than 10 years of practical experience. He will soon publish his first book, the Google Analytics Kickstarter Guide, with BPB Publications, one of Asia's largest e-book publishers.\n\n\nProfit Detector Sales Course will help you to determine the 20% of the Google AdWords leads and clients that brings you 80% ot the profit! It is combination of marketing science and real sales experience.\nMy name is Grigor Yovov, I am an CEO of Business Trend – Digital marketing agency and also a cretor of the PROFIT DETECTOR FORMULA. I start my career as a sales of digital marketing products (SEO, Google AdWords etc.) and managed to put my name under the certificates of the top leaders in the digital marketing world such as Google, HubSpot and Daragh Walsh.\nThen came the big moment!\nBefore 7 years I start my own company and become independent digital marketing consultant. I constantly growth my business by selling SEO and PPC ads in AdWords and Facebook.\nActually I have such a success selling digital marketing services that I have never thought hiring other sales representative. I really love my work!\nAt this time I haven't an idea that lately I'll create the PROFIT DETECTOR FORMULA!\nBut not always the things were so smooth.\nI remember like it was yesterday that lead that comes one morning form our facebook campaign.\nIn the beginning it was so promising!\nI start a little research before calling the client as usual. It was a medium size travel agency willing to push up sales in the summer season with some mix of SEO and AdWords.\nI call the phone and after a few minutes I have the basic information of what the client need. The main goal was to sell exotic destinations like Maldives, morocco and Tanzania, but mostly to target a hotel in Greece that my client was prebuy for the whole summer season.\nThe client was so confident they want to start the campaign and arrange a meeting in couple of days.\nSo I put my marketing gloves and decide to do some prep work before the meeting.\nI make a short keyword research on the most common terms and the CPC price. Also check google trends and buzzsumo for additional ideas. Than search live in google for the competitors and brows their websites to get some clue for the environment of the business. And so on, and so on. It took me 5 hours to collect all the data and create a great presentation for the meeting.\nThe day before the meeting I hit a golden mine. It was a traditional fest that take place next to that Greece hotel location at the end of the season. I make additional keyword research and find that there are people searching for the fest from the beginning of the season but I have not find a serious competition.\nReal golden mine!\nTo worm up the client a put another hour creating short video to present my discovery and demonstrate that I have serious intention to find the best solution for the client.\nAnyway the day of the meeting have arrived and I knocked on the front door of their office.\nThe meeting pass buy very well and I managed to present all the material prepared and answer all clients questions.\nAt the final stage I already feel the taste of the deal closing and decide to ask whether we’ll be ready to start the campaign.\nThan the cold shower came!\n“We are now on the stage of collecting offers. Also still not sure if we need to go for Adwords or the local radio and newspaper for the fest event, we just do not have budget for both.”\nOf course I explain that adwords is much more measurable and effective method and there is a lot of issues to be calculated before starting the campaign.\nBut at the end of the day I was empty-handed with a bunch of researches under my arm and more than 10 hours of lost in preparation time.\nIt wasn’t the first time a false lead loses my time, but definitely it was the last drop in the glass of my patient!\nI sit in my office, lock the door and stay there a whole week. In the dark I calculate day and night all the sales experience I have and all the sells ninja resources in the internet.\nAnd finally I did it!\n3 minutes’ system to qualify leads and spread them in 4 easy groups to manage my selling time and afforts called the PROFIT DETECTOR!\nIt was real boost in my sales business! I have never find my selves in lost time and nerves position again!\nI call it Profit Detector sales formula!\nThere are 4 levels of efforts you can reach depending the lead and 22 types of leads depending their credibility and monetary value.\nToday I’ll present the system in my course, hurry up and subscribe!",

In fact, you’ve almost definitely seen fast food restaurants use them to increase the size of your initial order.\n\n\nThe type of one-time offers we’re talking about today is presented only after someone makes a purchase.\n\n\nThis type is more powerful simply because they trust you.\n\n\nThey’ve bought your first product.\n\n\nBut the reality is that most people are failing to get their one-time offers to convert.\n\n\nYou know you need to make a change and make more sales, but perhaps you don’t know what it is.\n\n\nWe will give you the blueprint of how we get 75% converting One-Time Offers and higher.\n\n\nStart this course, Discover the Smart One-Time Offer Blueprint and make more sales!",

      "description": "(Updated 6/22/2017) Looking for an effective learning course or training class for PPC advertising? In order to learn PPC advertising (aka SEM) with Google Adwords, you'll need to have a great foundation of knowledge which is packed up right here in this tutorial style course. This course is developed for individuals who have had little success on their own with search engine marketing and who are looking for expert guidance. Rather than creating a learning course with advanced techniques and terminology that sounds foreign, I've designed a course that is both easy to digest and highly effective for those seeking to sharpen their skill set. If you've asked yourself the following questions at some point, this course is meant for you.\nI don't have a marketing degree but I want to learn about PPC advertising.\nI've tried learning SEM on my own but I don't know where to begin!\nIt's too expensive to outsource PPC management so I want to do it on my own.\nI hired a PPC marketing company and I was not happy with their performance.\nI have a business that just needs marketing to be successful and I'm considering PPC.\nThere is no question, PPC advertising is difficult, but so is anything in life that yields fruitful rewards. When I first discovered PPC advertising many years ago, I had to learn Google Adwords marketing on my own through tedious trial and error along with trying to find any type of pay per click training classes online but truthfully there weren't many resources available at the time. Which is why I decided to build my own Google Adwords PPC Tutorial course here on Udemy. After completing my course, you will feel confident, empowered and motivated enough to start working on your own campaign based on the real world success I've had.\nMy name is Sergio Aicardi and I am one of the founders of Profitable Web Properties & the owner of www.themiamiseocompany(dot)com which together comprise of the largest and most effective marketing agency in South Florida to specialize in search engine marketing (aka SEM). We not only help individual learn how to setup an Adwords account from scratch and teach them how to manage them properly in this course, we also offer world class marketing services in case it's just too much to handle on your own.\nWhat makes me qualified as your potential instructor for this in-depth Adwords PPC training course?\nIn 2014 I managed an SEM campaign which I presented a case study for in the US Search Awards of 2014 (powered by Pubcon in Las Vegas once a year). The case study was nominated for the \"Best PPC Campaign\" alongside with the marketing agencies that were managing the campaigns for HSNBS, PGA & a Microsoft product division.\nI founded a marketing company that specializes in SEO/PPC and in the 3 years that it's been in business, we have grown to become the most well known search engine marketing agency in South Florida. If you do your due diligence on me, you will find that I am a guest writer for the Search Engine Journal, SEMRush, Ahrefs, Social Media Today and many other well-respected sites that are known for having industry experts write about their successes and experiences.\nI have hundreds of case studies and white papers that show the success I've had with my own companies and the campaigns that I've managed for other companies at my marketing company. Simply put, this is the one training class for Adwords that you won't want to miss out on, sign up today and obtain the knowledge that can earn you large salaries or generate huge profits for your business.",

You don’t need a long course. It will only slow you down and you will start procrastinating. My goal in this course is to get your ads up and running in a week or less. Here, check this out.\nI basically condensed years of not only my own Facebook Ads experience but also the experience I had working with my clients and students down to this short and intensive course.\nLet me show you what I mean.\nIf you have never run ads before… don’t worry, start at Week 1. This week.\nI will explain the psychology of the users on Facebook and how Facebook Ads are different than YouTube Ads.\nThis will immediately get you up to speed on what will work and what won’t work when running ads on the platform.\nWe will literally spend minutes, not hours setting up your Facebook page and your ads manager ready to run ads.\nIf you are intimidated by the complicated looking dashboard of the ads manager, don’t be. I will do a fun Facebook Ads manager and explain the bare essentials, the only things that you need to know, to run ads.\nBecause this is the Easy Facebook Ads academy, we are going to run ads the easy way. I will explain how to structure your campaigns in a way that will prevent any complications from ever happening. That’s how easy it will be.\nIf you are not sure what kinds of ads to create and how to create it, then start at week 2.\nI call it the creative week. We’ll be creating your lead magnet, landing page, thank you page, and the ad all in a few days.\nBut first, we will talk about how to avoid getting our ads rejected by the Facebook ad cop. The Facebook algorithm. It’s like a robot that is programed to seek out and reject ads based on certain parameters. Once you know what its looking for you will be able to fly under its radar.\nThen we’ll complete your 4 step customer pathway. So that your ad will get clicks, and those clicks will turn into leads and those leads will eventually turn into sales.\nIf you already have your ads created and need a refresher on how to setup your campaigns the correct way then start at week 3.\nI will hold your hand and show you how to setup up everything step by step. How to install the Facebook Pixel, how to structure your campaign the easy way, and then show you with over the shoulder walk through tutorials how to setup your campaign, ad set, and ad. So all you need to do is to follow along.\nYou will also learn the targeting options secret that my clients and I use to instantly find your ideal customers. We call it the 3 flavor ice cream targeting strategy and it will help you find people who are actually sincere about your niche and are the most likely to interact and buy\nAnd finally, if your ad is already running and you are having a trouble figuring out if it’s a winner or loser, than start at week 4.\nI will make data analysis simple, help you arrange your columns of data, show you what data points to look for and solutions to fix ads that are not performing as well as you would like.\nThen we will finish up with some advanced copy writing secrets, advanced targeting secrets, and even an email marketing mini-course so that you not only increase the quality of leads coming into your business but also start converting them into paying customers.\nAnd because the marketplace is always changing and the IOS update is always changing, I will be updating this course with new episodes even new strategies and tactics accordingly.\nHow does that sound?\nSee, I told you it was going to be an Adventure didn’t I.\nSo pick a week and let’s get started.\nLet’s get your ads up and running ASAP so that your business will grow asap.\nAfter all, money love speed and there’s not a moment to lose. Let’s get started.\nI’ll see you in the next episode.",

The course is designed with the purpose of allowing you to set up effective Retargeting campaigns to take your return on investment to the next level.\n\nThis course will take you through from developing your Retargeting strategy, implementing campaigns across Display, Video and Search on Google, YouTube and Facebook (And Instagram). We will also discuss measuring the effectiveness of your campaigns and finally GDPR compliance.\n\n\nWhen correctly Implemented a Retargeting strategy can be a great addition to your marketing efforts. Due to the fact that potential customers are already aware of your brand, conversion rates from Retargeted users can be 10x higher than cold users.  In this course I will illustrate that it is far from beyond the scope of marketers. Over the years platforms like Facebook and Google have made it increasingly easy and effective to implement these strategies.\n\n\nEven with the changes bought about by Apple's iOS 14 announcement, Retargeting remains a valid strategy since Google and Facebook have implemented new measurement frameworks to maintain retargeting, lookalike and similar audiences.\n\n\nI look forward to teaching you!",

I've been IN IT for a decade — and I've got lots of insight to share with you so you can skip the hard lessons I've had to learn.\n\n\n***** \"Sarah's tips are so good! I feel like I just stole a cookie from the jar, and I'm looking over my shoulder to see if anyone has noticed! ?\" - Janice G.\n\n\n***** \"SARAH ROCKS and this session was spectacular.

She are a good teacher and encourager.\" - Erika Z.\n\n\nHello there, I'm Sarah!\nIf you had told me 10 years ago that writing for businesses could make me a million dollars, I would have laughed you out of my classroom.\nIn 2009, I was a high school English teacher. I didn’t even know what the “2” in “B2B” stood for.\nWhen I was ready to leave the classroom, it seemed like I’d need to go back to school (and go into more debt) if I wanted to make something of myself…\n… Until I found B2B.\nWithin two years as a freelancer, with limited marketing experience and NO business experience, I was nearing six figures.\nI was able to fund two maternity leaves in two more years, eventually rounding out my career with three years of $200,000 billed as a freelance writer and retiring my husband so he could become a stay at home dad to two -*ahem* vibrant toddlers.\nOver my 10 year career, I’ve invoiced more than $1 million as a solo freelancer. All through my writing skills. And all in B2B.\n“Success” looks different for everyone, and it’s not all about money. (I am firmly anti-hustle culture).\nBut after training 2000+ writers through the B2B Writing Institute, preparing them for both freelance and in-house full-time writing roles, I’ve seen just what’s possible for writers who embrace their curiosity in B2B.\nIn this training, I walk you thorugh the most important thing syou need to know hwen you first break into white paper copywriting — no holds barred, and no awkward stone left unturned.\n\n\n***** \"I just learned about the difference between B2B and B2C and d*mn it's good. Learned *a lot.* The examples were well chosen and highlight the difference approaches clearly, even for a newbie like me!\" - Amy J.\n\n\n***** \"Sarah is one of the few who really focuses on the how of writing and the quality of it instead of just focusing on the what. Strongly encourage anyone thinking of B2Bing to sign up!\" - Pratika M.\n\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\n\nBY THE END OF THIS COURSE\nYou'll be ten steps ahead of anyone else trying to write white papers — and five steps ahead even people who have written one! You will know answers to the secret unasked questions we rarely get to ask, because I'm sharing everything I know after a decade in the space.\nIn fact, I'm so proud of this material and how helpful it is that, if you don't feel like it rocked your world, I offer a 100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE within 30 days.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU'LL GET IN THE WHITE PAPER COPYWRITING COURSE\n- IMMEDIATE LIFETIME ACCESS to the material shared here.\n- 60 MINUTES OF ENLIGHTENING INSTRUCTION AND CONVERSATION broken up into digestible short videos.\n- MY GO-TO WHITE PAPER TEMPLATE which will help you start every project about halfway done.\n- OVER THE SHOULDER REVIEWS to let you see white papers through MY eyes.\n- 30-DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE if you're not completely satisfied.\n\n\n*****  \"Where was this six months ago when I was starting my second career? I need a pocket version of Sarah so I can reap her wisdom two or three times a day.\" - Lillian K.\n\n\n*****\"Sarah was AWESOME. She helped me reinforce my belief that I can write well, especially coming from journalism, B2C, etc.\" - Mackey T.\n\n\nFROM BEGINNER TO ADVANCED...

      "description": "If you want to know the exact way to get extremely low cost Facebook ads on your Facebook Page, this Udemy course is for you! You get to learn the exact methods and strategies that will work for you based on my experience building my Facebook page to more than nearly 30K likes using Facebook Ads. Take this course today and start getting Facebook Page Likes for 0.004 (or potentially lower) and Facebook Video Views for 0.0003!\nAs a YouTuber who has used Google Adwords to get views on my videos, the lowest possible cost per view is 1c. Which means for 1000 views, you will pay $10. In this course, I show you how you can get Video Views on Facebook for 0.0003 cents, which means 1000 views is only 30 cents!! You are virtually paying NOTHING! And that is the magic I teach you in this course!\nIf, like me, you are looking to build your Social Proof, then this course may be the perfect way! When I first started this page, I spent $30 on just 300 likes. I did not know the ways in which you could get low cost likes! I was foolish and naive, but after a lot of pain and frustration I finally figured how to get the best possible costs for Likes. I share with you the precise formula you need to follow, along with me implementing it live for you to follow.\nI also show you a live example of a video which cost me just $20 to achieve 60,000 views, at 0.0003c per view. On YouTube this would have cost me $600!!\nYou will see how to create a Page that can be self-growing with these techniques. There are plenty of Viral Video sharing pages on Facebook that are growing organically thanks to techniques from this video! The organic growth will be achieved once you've scaled up your Facebook page likes and your Facebook Video Views!\nAnd if you want to just build your Facebook page to build social proof for the professional brand you've created, this course is just what you need. You will see how I managed to get 0.0008c per view on a local video to a small niche audience. The Three Zero Club awaits you in this course!\nThis is not just a load of slides with theory, I show you REAL PROOF! See the free previews...\nTo start learning, just click 'Take this course' button and enroll! You risk no money enrolling because of the 30 day no questions asked refund policy. 99% of students do not request a refund which then just leaves your time.\nFor every minute that you delay, you could be saving a huge amount of money...\nThank you very much for reading this and I hope to see you in the first lecture of this powerhouse course!",
