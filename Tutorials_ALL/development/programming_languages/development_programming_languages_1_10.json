OpenShift Online is implemented as an on-demand consumption model hosted on public cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nThe latest version of OpenShift Online, released in May 2017, provides a container-based platform that developers can access from any web browser, IDE and command line. It also provides support for local development, enabling programmers to deploy a functional OpenShift cluster on their local workstations, and it supports port forwarding, which enables developers to use remote services as if they were running locally.\nOpenShift Online was built with the same code as OpenShift Container Platform, and it is the deployment platform for OpenShift io\nOpenShift Dedicated\nOpenShift Dedicated offers organisations the ability to run a single-tenant OpenShift environment on a public cloud managed by Red Hat while incorporating Docker and Kubernetes orchestration technologies.\nAt the time of its launch in December 2015, OpenShift Dedicated ran only on AWS. Support for Google Cloud Platform was added in December 2016. As of July 2017, support for Microsoft Azure is not offered.\nOpenShift io\nAnnounced in May 2017, OpenShift io is a free, open source supplement to OpenShift Online. Together, they offer an integrated approach to DevOps that incorporates tools for development teams to create and deploy microservices based applications.\nOpenShift io also provides a Linux container environment and a machine learning system that assist developers with design decisions. OpenShift io encompasses several open source development technologies, including fabric8, Eclipse Chef, Jenkins, OpenJDK, Performance Co-Pilot, WildFly Swarm, Eclipse Vert.x and Spring Boot.\nWhy use Red Hat OpenShift\nAs container use increases in app development and production, services such as OpenShift offer ways to manage and automate a large amount of containers. Doing so frees up developers from the manual management of containers.\nA demo of OpenShift features\nAlso, OpenShift can help IT organizations bridge legacy servers supporting traditional applications and modern, microservices based work. These features feed into a mobile-first approach for companies that want to produce smartphone and tablet apps quickly.\nFinally, OpenShift's options promote continuous app development and common tools for development and operations teams. This approach is a cornerstone of DevOps efforts.\nHow Red Hat OpenShift works\nAccording to Red Hat, the key to OpenShift lies in the combination of Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration, both built on RHEL.\nBy using Docker at its model, OpenShift enables any app created with it to run anywhere else that Docker containers are supported.\nAfter developers push code to OpenShift either through software version control or continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI CD) systems, OpenShift orchestrates how and when the apps run. It also enables dev teams to fix, fine tune and scale those apps as quickly as needed.\nContainers associated with OpenShift can serve as web frameworks or stateful services, according to Red Hat.\nIn addition to enabling developers to create their own containers, OpenShift provides an online container catalog with contributions from Red Hat and third parties. Some popular categories include container management, mobile application development, operating systems, programming languages, logging and monitoring, and database management.",

      "description": "[Course fourth updated on Jul. 2023 and ChatGPT enabled!]\nThe goal of this course is to help you learn C# by building and distributing an interesting chatbot application to your users.\n\n\nAccording to my experience, the most efficient way to learn new things is to pick up an interesting simple task and complete it from scratch. Since the task is simple and small, it's not hard to finish; and since it is interesting, you won't get bored during the learning process, especially when you get stock in the troubleshooting phases. Therefore, this is also the approach used in this course to help you learn C# easily.\n\n\nThis course is divided into eight sections. Well, actually there are nine sections. Section 4.5 is a brief two-video bonus section. At the end of this course, you will be able to plan a new application, build all its functions, and then encapsulate it in an installer to distribute it to your users. Here is a brief introduction of what you will learn from each section.\n\n\nSection 1: Introduction\nThe reason to learn C# programming and the reason to choose this course.  You will know who the tutor is and his background to get a solid confidence of choosing this course.\nSection 2: Preparing the tools\nThe steps of downloading and installing Visual Studio 2022, Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Express and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).\nSection 3: Architecture of C# and . Net\nTo understand C# program structure and . Net Framework architecture. All concepts will be introduced by using a simple interactive console application.\nSection 4: C# Essentials\nThe most basic and necessary concepts of C# language are introduced in this section. And all concepts will introduced by build the core functions of the chatbot program via a console application.\nSection 5 Make Reusable Library (original section 4.5)\nThis is a bonus section, and we are going to create a reusable and cross platform DLL library in . Net Standard for future use.\nSection 6: GUI and File Access\nWe will create a Windows Form desktop user interface for the chatbot, and learn how to load initial settings from a config file. Exception handling will be introduced as well.\nSection 7: Database\nTwo ways of accessing a database, including ADO . Net and Entity Framework, are introduced in this section. We start with using a local database, then transform it to a online SQL database.\nSection 8: Program Installer\nTwo ways of building an application installer for distribute applications, ClickOnce and Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects, are introduced.\nSection 9: BOT in .Net 6 WPF (Dec. 2022)\nCreate a WPF application with transparent background.\nSection 10: Using OpenAI GPT3 Model (Jul. 2023)\nUsing C# to create the connectivity of the Chat Completion API provided by OpenAI to make our application more humanized.\nWhat's next?\nThere are lots of things that you can do with C#, we will let you know what to learn next in this section.",

      "description": "Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects\n\n\nPython is a popular general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide variety of applications. It includes high-level data structures, dynamic typing, dynamic binding, and many more features that make it as useful for complex application development as it is for scripting or \"glue code\" that connects components together. It can also be extended to make system calls to almost all operating systems and to run code written in C or C++. Due to its ubiquity and ability to run on nearly every system architecture, Python is a universal language found in a variety of different applications.\n\n\nPython is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes.\nThe programming language includes thousands of third-party modules available in the Python Package . Python provides popular standards for different expertise, like Django for web development  and so on.\n\n\nThose new to programming can benefit from Python's high level of abstraction. It is highly interactive and known for its \"strong opinions\" around specific syntax (including whitespace). Python, like other high-level languages, has a garbage collection process to manage memory or delete unused resources. A user can receive instant feedback from the interpreter by typing python on the command line",

Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n\n\nWhat can Python do?\n\n\nPython can be used on a server to create web applications.\nPython can be used alongside software to create workflows.\nPython can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\nPython can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\nPython can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\nWhy Python?\nPython works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\nPython has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\nPython has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\nPython runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\nPython can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n\n\nThe most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this course. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.\nIn this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as , Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.",

The powerful features of Python containers such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries are explained in an interesting manner.\nUnicode-UTF-8, strings, selection and iteration concepts are explained with simplicity by executing programs. Python calculator and use of Mathematics and other libraries are illustrated.\nPython is also an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. The OOP concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, which facilitate seamless reuse of existing code as implemented in Python are discussed in a lucid manner.\nExceptions such as divide by zero might occur when we execute the programs. Python's techniques of such exception handling are described with interesting case studies.\nPython has many gems in terms of programming concepts such as decorator functions, lambda functions, function objects, and first-class functions, which are rather unique and thrilling and are discussed so that the student learns without even taking a break.\nAn introduction to data structures using Python is given. The section addresses stack and queue and also four popular sorting methods.\nData visualization must precede data analysis – predictive and descriptive. Python has excellent libraries for data visualization. An introduction to data visualization using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn is given describing how to create a number of visuals.\nThe learning by programming and learning one new concept at a time in each program. is the strategy adopted so as to ease the burden of learning a new and modern programming language.",

Having an in-depth understanding of this topic is crucial for mastering many advanced topics, such as lambda expressions, and functional interfaces.\nMost of the Java courses these days don't cover the Inner Classes topic in detail, and many simply avoid it. During the years, avoiding this topic wasn't felt, and most of the Java developers did their work without any special difficulties.\nWith the emergence of lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and streams in Java 8, and with the continuously growing popularity of using them, the necessity of having an accurate and in-depth understanding of inner classes in Java has become very important.\n\n\nLearn and Master the Inner Classes topic by Taking this Comprehensive Course.\n\n\nLearn about nested classes and about those cases in which the nested class is also an inner class.\nLearn how to define a static nested class and abut the cases in which we can benefit from using it.\nLearn how to define an inner class and about the changes the compiler introduces in our code.\nLearn about the unique connection created between the object we instantiate from the inner class and the object that was already instantiated from the outer class, that in its presence the inner class was instantiated.\nLearn about the limitation that exists when defining an inner class within the scope of a method that was defined in the outer class.\nLearn how to define an anonymous nested class, and learn about using it for passing over a specific functionality from one place in our code to another.\n\n\nI teach Java programming for nearly 25 years. During these years I developed my unique techniques for explaining complex topics, such as the one this course covers. When developing this course I did my best using small simple code samples together with diagrams I create using my iPad (I use it as a replacement for a blackboard). Even though the explanations are simple when hearing them separately, when putting them all together in one length video it becomes more difficult.\nI am dedicated to my students and I am available for any question that arises. In the case that an additional explanation is required I make a special effort and create it.",

This course covers from 2.4.0 onwards.\nAutomating tasks with Esri technology and with ArcGIS Online/Portal is already in high demand and growing! There is a skills and knowledge gap with the utilisation of the ArcGIS API for Python. Fill in that gap and put yourself at the forefront of the demand.\nYou will get comfortable with the Item Object and the WebMap Object and the different components of the WebMap that each controls - sometimes we need to update the WebMap Item Object, sometimes we need to update the WebMap Object, all depending on the manipulation and update being performed. All will become clear as you progress through the course.\nWe will interact with...\nBasemaps\nThe Map Item Object\nThe Map Object\nadd and remove layers and tables\ndive into the definition for a Webmap layer\nWebMap Layer Properties\ntitle (name)\nvisibility\nopacity\nfilters\nlabels\nand more\nWebMap Configurations\nset the extent\nreorder layers\ngroup layers\nand more\nWebMap Layer Symbology\nWebMap Layer Popups\n\n\nYou will have lifetime access to the course material, as the API evolves, the course structure and lessons will be updated to reflect the changes. Sometimes API changes are minor and sometimes they are major so keeping up with the changes are important.\n\n\nYour course instructor, Glen Bambrick, has over 18 years' experience with GIS and geospatial data, and has implemented standardized workflows utilizing the ArcGIS API for Python to great affect. In this course he will introduce you to the ArcGIS for Python API for interacting with WebMap components and take you through some common tasks with a focus on gaining a deep understanding of the underlying JSON definitions associated with a WebMap and and Item object.\n\n\nBy the end of this course... you will be fully armed with the capability to start using the ArcGIS for Python API with your own workflows for accessing an manipulating WebMap components. This course will spark your imagination to what can be achieved and give you a solid footing to begin making the ArcGIS for Python API a part of your daily endeavors for automating those repetitive tasks relating to ArcGIS Online WebMaps and beyond. You will be able create a WebMap object and save as a an Item object along with a deep understanding of the Item Object and WebMap object definitions to perform tasks such as adding and removing layers, updating symbology and popups, reordering layers, along with WebMap admin such as applying a  Content Status and adding Delete Protection.",

You will be able to download all the slides, code samples and text version of the videos.\n\n\nWhat will we be covering in this tutorial\nWe will start with the relationship between ASP.NET web applications and JavaScript. Along the way we will understand why we need both client side and server side validation. Debugging JavaScript in Visual Studio to fix any run time or logical errors. The downsides of using JavaScript.\n\nWe will discuss different tools available for learning and practising JavaScript. Difference between inline and external JavaScript. The right location for placing the JavaScript. Commenting JavaScript code and different data types available. We will then discuss working the string object. Along the way we will discuss the basics of JavaScript strings, converting strings to numbers and retrieving sub-strings. We will also discuss in detail different conditional statements available for conditional processing and when to use what. JavaScript loops are covered next.\n\nIn the Arrays module, we will start with the basics of arrays, followed by filtering arrays and creating two dimensional arrays. In the functions module, we will be discussing different ways of defining functions, local and global variables, recursive functions, closures with examples and finally the magical JavaScript arguments object.\n\nIn the Error Handling module we will discuss handling errors using try/catch/finally block and performing global exception handling. In the Date & Time module we will cover the basics of Date object, timing events and creating a simple image slideshow. We will also discuss examples of performing client side validation.\n\nThe next module is Events.

This ongoing revision reflects the latest Java developments, trends, and best practices. Staying updated means you're always learning the most relevant and practical Java skills.\nSample Practice Test Questions:\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the transient keyword in Java?\nA) To indicate that a variable is temporary\nB) To make a variable thread-safe\nC) To exclude a variable from the serialization process\nD) To declare a variable as volatile\nExplanation: The transient keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized. When an object is serialized, the fields marked as transient are not included in the serialized state of the object. This is crucial when dealing with sensitive data or when a field's value can be recreated and does not need to be persisted. Therefore, the correct answer is C) To exclude a variable from the serialization process. Understanding the use of transient is important for effective memory management and security in Java applications, especially when dealing with object serialization and deserialization processes.\n\nQuestion: In Java, which of the following is true about a final method?\nA) It cannot be overridden in a subclass.\nB) It cannot be overloaded.\nC) It cannot be invoked.\nD) It must return a value.\nExplanation: A final method in Java signifies that the method cannot be overridden by any subclasses. This is used to prevent alteration of behavior by subclasses, ensuring the method's functionality remains consistent across the hierarchy. It doesn't restrict the method from being overloaded (which is determined by the method's signature), nor does it affect its ability to return a value or to be invoked. Thus, the correct answer is A) It cannot be overridden in a subclass. This concept is fundamental in Java for ensuring the integrity of methods in inheritance hierarchies, particularly when designing classes that provide specific functionalities that must not be altered.\n\nQuestion: What is the result of attempting to compile and run a Java program with a main method declared as private?\nA) Compilation error\nB) Runtime error\nC) Runs successfully\nD) None of the above\nExplanation: In Java, the main method can be declared as private, and the program will still compile without any errors. However, when attempting to run such a program, it will not produce a runtime error; rather, the JVM will start execution as usual. This is because access modifiers like private, public, or protected do not affect the execution of the main method by the JVM. The correct answer is C) Runs successfully. This question is essential in understanding the nuances of access modifiers in Java and their impact on the execution of the Java application, particularly the special status of the main method in Java applications.\n\nQuestion: What does the static keyword signify when applied to a method in Java?\nA) The method belongs to an instance of a class.\nB) The method can be called without an instance of the class.\nC) The method is thread-safe.\nD) The method can only be called by static methods in the same class.\nExplanation: A static method in Java means that the method belongs to the class, rather than instances of the class. This implies that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class. It does not inherently guarantee thread safety nor does it limit its accessibility only to other static methods. Therefore, the correct answer is B) The method can be called without an instance of the class. Understanding the concept of static methods is crucial in Java, as it helps in creating utility methods and accessing shared resources without needing to instantiate the class every time.\n\nQuestion: In the context of Java Exception handling, what is the difference between throw and throws?\nA) throw is used to declare an exception, and throws is used to explicitly throw an exception.\nB) throw is used to explicitly throw an exception, and throws is used to declare an exception.\nC) There is no difference, both keywords have the same functionality.\nD) throw is used in try-catch blocks, while throws is used outside try-catch blocks.\nExplanation: In Java, throw and throws are two different mechanisms related to exceptions. The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception, allowing a method to generate a specific exception and pass it up the call stack. On the other hand, throws is used in a method signature to declare that a method might throw certain exceptions, which need to be either caught or declared to be thrown in the method calling this method. Therefore, the correct answer is B) throw is used to explicitly throw an exception, and throws is used to declare an exception. This distinction is fundamental in Java for effective exception handling, ensuring that exceptions are properly managed and propagated in a controlled manner.\nEnroll Now!\nJoin this comprehensive practice test course and transform your preparation into success.

With Python, you can put in a methodical system to build your own rule-based algorithm in order to get to your goal efficiently.\n\n\nPython is also the perfect language for AI-based algorithms using a variety of machine learning techniques. The AI-based courses are coming soon.\n\n\nThis complete course of algo trading with Python will teach all the Python syntax you need to know, and get you ready for working with Pandas, taking care of the DateTime objects, and handling errors. You will then immediately learn about how to use Python to connect to the MetaTrader5 terminal, and get market data as well as account information programmatically from your broker directly. You will also learn about constructing indicators that work for your style of trading, by using Pandas, Ta-Lib, or writing your own user-defined functions. You will learn how to programmatically compute position size but first decide where you would like to place your stop loss level, and then query some account information to complete the computation. You will learn about the specific ways that you will communicate, using Python, with your brokers to enter and/or exit trades with the computed size for your risk tolerance. Further, you will also learn about how to set the stop loss and take profit, how to move stop loss to breakeven, and how to update (trail) your stop-loss level after that point. Once you have learned all about these topics, you are able to build as many elaborate risk management strategies as you want in a way that you like to trade.\n\n\nAt the end of this course, you will have a firm understanding of what goes into building an algorithmic trading strategy from scratch. You will have not only all the tools necessary to create your own algorithmic strategies, but you will also know how to manage your positions, as well as take what you already know and set up a backtesting environment for yourself, so that you are able to systematically build and test strategies on an on-going basis.\n\n\nThe goal of the series is to give you an understanding of what goes into building an algorithmic trading strategy from scratch. By the end of the three-part series, you should have not only all the tools necessary to create your own algorithmic strategies, but you will also know how to manage your positions.",

      "description": "What is this course about?\nThis course was created to show you that bite-size lessons can take you a long way! Most people overestimate what they can do in a day but grossly underestimate what they can do in 30 days.\nPython is one of the most popular and useful languages out there. In this class, you'll learn the fundamentals you need to write your own Python programs. The course is designed to be taken over the course of 30 days, in bitesize sessions of around 15 minutes each day. You’ll learn the concepts you need to know to start coding your own useful programs and set the strong foundation you need to move on to any programming field you might be interested.\nPython is extremely flexible and it can be used in many fields, some of them are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Web Development, Programming Applications, Finance, and even Game Development! This course will start with concepts as simple as Python variables and go all the way to a final project where you will code your own Python command-line application that will help you connect the dots on all the concepts you learned throughout the course.\nWho is this course for?\nLearning how to code could be valuable to everyone even if you're not looking to use it professionally. It opens up your mind to understand what goes on in the digital world that surrounds us nowadays. This course is right for you if any of the following statements resonate with you:\n\nI’m completely new to coding. Where do I type my very first line of code?\nI learned to code in the past but I’m looking for a refresher.\nI’m looking to demystify coding and get a sense of what it can be used for.\nI want to set a strong foundation to get a job related to coding down the line.\nI want to stretch my brain by learning something new.\nHow will I learn?\nThe course is designed to be taken through 15-minute bitesize lessons each day for 30 days, and it focuses on learning smart and not hard. You can go through it at your own pace, so if you'd like to do two lessons each day and finish the course in 15 days that is fine, and if you'd like to take it more slowly that is completely fine too.\nWe’ll leverage evidence-based learning techniques such as Active Recall and Spaced Repetition to enhance your learning and commit the knowledge you gain to long-term memory. We have hands-on daily exercises that will help you internalize what you’re learning and even rest days to recover and review. All in all, this is how it goes:\n\n15 minutes/day for 30 days (you choose your pace)\nFollow along with each lesson as we go\nDaily exercises to implement new learning\nRest and recovery days after every 4 lessons\nFinal project to connect the dots\nWhat type of software will I use?\nWe'll kick off the course by downloading and installing the necessary software:\n\nPython 3\niPython - an enhanced Python interpreter\nVisual Studio Code - a popular and powerful code editor\nCourse Contents:\n\nInstallation\nVariables, numbers, strings, string concatenation, indexing\nConditionals, code blocks, For loops, While loops\nLists, Ranges, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets\nFunctions\nUser input\nIntro to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\nClasses - definition, attributes, methods, inheritance\nFiles\nException Handling\nModules and Python Standard Library\nHands-on Project - Python Learning Application\nFinal Project:\nThe final project is to create your own Python Learning Application that will quiz you on any topic you’re learning and keep scores to asses what you know.\nThe app will read JSON files with questions, topics, and scores and quiz the user based on the contents. It will also save new scores. The application will run in the Command Line and will cover all the concepts learned throughout the 30-day course.\nThe purpose of the app is to allow you to create your own questions on any topic you want to study so you can quiz yourself and engage in active recall to help you remember what you learn and assess which topics need more attention based on your scores. To complete the project, you can follow these steps:\nWatch lessons from day 24 to day 29.\nDownload JSON files from the Github website (link in lesson 24).\nRead the README file from GitHub.\nFollow along with lessons 24 through 29 or give it a shot on your own by seeing how the app should work based on the GitHub README file.",

The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.\nOften, you need to execute some statements only if some condition holds, or choose statements to execute depending on several mutually exclusive conditions. The Python compound statement if, which uses if, elif, and else clauses, lets you conditionally execute blocks of statements.\nControl flow statements are an essential part of the Python programming language.\nA control flow statement is a block of programming that analyses variables and chooses a direction in which to go based on given parameters. In simple sentence, a control structure is just a decision that the computer makes. So, it is the basic decision-making process in programming and flow of control determines how a computer program will respond when given certain conditions and parameters. It determines the  order in which the program’s code executes.\nThey are decision Making Statements  that allow the program to take the decision as which statement should be executed next.\nDecision Making statements are used when we want a set of instructions should be executed in one situation and different instructions should be executed in another situation .Decision making can be implemented in python using:\nif statements\nelse statements\nelif statements\nwhile loops\nfor loops",

Start by importing your first dataset which will be the DVD rental database. Then explore and put into practice various SQL clauses and Join types. You’ll also learn tricks to get external data into the database, without worrying excessively about DBA functions and considerations. Also you’ll find out how to take the data into popular BI tools (Excel and Tableau) and refine the analysis further while discussing the interpretation of the data.\nThe second course, Advanced Applied SQL for Business Intelligence and Analytics, runs through the workflow from SQL to a localhost connection in Tableau and also analysis, all of which you'll need in your professional life. Concepts such as CASE statements, common table expressions, and subqueries will be explained via case studies. You'll generate web analytics acquisition source data using Python and then create tables to store your information. Finally, you’ll have gone through all the examples and coded them out, and be ready to confidently tackle non-trivial problems.\nBy the end of this training program, you will have developed your SQL skills and learnt how to answer business questions from the set of data.\nAbout the Author\n\nJeffrey James has been working in the analytics and data space since 2006. With roots in digital marketing and web analytics, he’s applied analytical techniques to problems ranging from customer value analysis to financial forecasting, machine learning and process automation. He’s made his share of mistakes on the way to mastery and understands the mindset of a beginner/learner.",

This course also teaches you in-depth knowledge of JDK tools and the required knowledge of command-line for running java applications.\n- Section 1: Fundamentals of Java Applications\nThis section teaches you the fundamental concepts such as launching an application in terminal and environment variables such as “PATH” and “CLASSPATH” and how to access them inside a Java application. It also teaches you the meaning of command-line arguments and how to use them in an application.\n- Section 2: Default Compiler Tool Chain\nThis section walks you through the installation process of the default compiler toolchain for each operating system. macOS uses Apple Clang (Xcode), whereas Linux uses the open-source GCC and Windows uses MSVC. You will learn how to ensure the correct installation and configuration of these toolchains.\n- Section 3: Introduction to GraalVM Native-Image\nThis section provides the introduction to GraalVM and native-image. You will learn how to download and install GraalVM and how to run the native-image tool. It walks you through all the steps for writing a simple “HelloWorld” java application and compiling it to a native executable binary.\n- Section 4: Compiling Java Applications with Native-Image\nThis section is the more serious introduction to the native-image tool from GraalVM. You will learn about the outputs that native-image provides while compiling your java application. You will also learn how to provide build configuration by passing various flags to the native-image on the command-line. The important concept of pipelining and redirection of commands on the terminal is also discussed in this section.\n- Section 5: Eclipse IDE’s External Tool\nThis section provides an in-depth introduction to Eclipse’s IDE external tool. It is highly recommended to use Eclipse IDE in conjunction with the native-image tool to seamlessly compile your java applications to the native executable binary. It also shows you how to handle jar dependencies of your java application when using Maven build tool.\n- Section 6: Native-Image Options\nThis section describes the most important flags that you can set when running native-image from the terminal. It also introduces how to handle dynamic features of java such as Reflections, Dynamic class loading, JNI, by invoking the tracing agent that is embedded in the GraalVM’s JVM. Once the configuration files are created, you’ll learn how to pass them to the native-image compiler so that the final executable binary can be run successfully.\n- Section 7: Parsing Command-Line Arguments\nThis interesting section describes the use of a java library called “JCommander” that provides an easy-to-use API for parsing command-line arguments of a java application and creating objects or setting the state of objects. You will learn how to instruct native-image to work with JCommander so that the final executable binary also benefits from easily parsing command-line arguments.\n- Section 8: Native-Image Official Documentation\nThis section provides the link to the online documentation of the native-image tool.\n- Section 9: Resources (PowerPoint, source codes, …)\nYou will find the complete set of PowerPoint slides of the course in this section.",

      "description": "Dart is a programming language developed by Google in 2011. It is an object-oriented language that is designed to be easy to learn and use for building web, mobile, and desktop applications. It is a statically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at compile time, and it supports both just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.\nDart has a syntax that is similar to other popular programming languages like Java, C++, and JavaScript. It supports features like classes, interfaces, mixins, async/await, and a variety of built-in types like strings, lists, and maps. Dart also includes a package manager called Pub, which makes it easy to use and share third-party libraries.\nOne of the unique features of Dart is its support for both client-side and server-side development. Dart can be compiled to JavaScript for use in web browsers, or it can be run natively on the server with the Dart VM. This makes it possible to use the same language and codebase for both the front-end and back-end of a web application.\nDart is also the primary language used for developing applications for Google's mobile operating system, Android. With the introduction of Flutter, a mobile app development framework built with Dart, it has become even easier to create high-performance, cross-platform mobile apps for both Android and iOS using a single codebase.",

In this live project hands-on training, Sandeep will teach you how to Build Modern SPA Applications using N-Tier Architecture from scratch.\n\n\nWhat is N-Tier Architecture?\nThat means that these different functions are hosted on several machines or clusters, ensuring that services are provided without resources being shared and, as such, these services are delivered at top capacity. The “N” in the name n-tier architecture refers to any number from 1.\nWhy are Enterprise Applications important to Data Quality?\nEnterprise Application systems are regularly the central hub for a large variety of data arriving from a large number of sources. Therefore they are useful for integrating contact data validation and enhancement solutions as you can guarantee all data then entering the system is of high quality.

      "description": "GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API.\nOne of the most common problems with REST is over and under fetching of data. GraphQL gives you the flexibility to think of the APIs as a graph and not as endpoints. Hence the execution becomes easier and quicker. GraphQL is a data-fetching API developed by Facebook, which has been using it for five years; it powers millions of devices and most components of the Facebook and Instagram website.\nThis comprehensive 3-in-1 course is packed with step-by-step instructions, working examples, and helpful advice about GraphQL. You will learn to build your Blog with GraphQL. This friendly course takes you through the use of GraphQL to develop better RESTful Web Services. In this course, you will get an introduction into GraphQL as a bridge for React client application to communicate with servers as the missing data-fetching or query language.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Learning GraphQL with React and Relay, covers mastering GraphQL by building a blog with React and Relay. In this course, we will learn about GraphQL and how we can use it to create truly decoupled client and server. Writing backend with GraphQL makes our code more declarative wherein the client demands certain data in a particular format and the server responds in a predictable manner. This enables us to evolve our API without versions and iterate on features faster. For front-end and networking, we will use Facebook’s React and Relay respectively. We will learn GraphQL by creating a backend for a blog platform. You will learn about GraphQL schema design, authentication, pagination, testing, query batching and more and how to connect a GraphQL backend to React and Relay client. The course will teach everything to get up and running with GraphQL and React.\nThe second course, Hands-on GraphQL for Better RESTful Web Services, covers use of GraphQL the new API standard to provide an alternative to REST. In this course, you will start with getting ready to install and explore GraphQL for a better RESTful experience. Explore the architecture and use cases to better understand the package setup and architecture involved. Learn more about the GraphQL server by coding its routes and constructing its schema. All the demonstrations in this video course will be shown through the development of a typical real-world restaurant rating application to better understand of users. Learn how to deal with validation, error handling, and security. Finally, you will learn and know more about caching & batching requests, pagination in GraphQL and so on.\nThe third course, Hands-on Application Building with GraphQL, covers rapidly building web applications using GraphQL. In this course, you will learn how to build your own Trello-like web application using GraphQL. Build a Graphql server and a client UI and connect this Apollo-based client to the server. You will then learn to add features to your board such as adding or editing a task. You will then see how to implement the shared whiteboard functionality by populating the changes into others sessions and how to solve the conflicts in this real-world scenario with concurrent changes from different users. . The course then shows you how to add authentication to your application to prevent unwanted access to it and user centric web service\nFinally, you will learn troubleshooting typical problems that may occur while running your app, and how to fine-tune the schema and communication of client-server. By the end of the course, you will be able to build your own applications using GraphQL.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll rapidly build web applications, better RESTful Web Services, as well as create a blog using GraphQL, React, and Relay!\n\nAbout the Authors\nDivyendu is from the top part of India, a beautiful place called Jammu and Kashmir.

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to the \"Java | Core Java Programming with Hands-on Java Projects\" course online.\nComprehensive Core Java programming with Eclipse, covering core Java concepts, Java Swing and advanced Java projects\n\nWhether you're a complete beginner or looking to enhance your programming skills, this course is designed to help you achieve your goals.\n\n\nJava is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, known for its versatility, efficiency, and portability. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), Java is used for building a wide range of applications, from web and mobile apps to enterprise systems and scientific applications.\n\n\nOracle Java is the #1 programming language and development platform. It reduces costs, shortens development timeframes, drives innovation, and improves application services. With millions of developers running more than 60 billion Java Virtual Machines worldwide, Java continues to be the development platform of choice for enterprises and developers.\n\nThis Java Programming online course is one of the most awesome Udemy courses which teach step by step and follow the methodology in introducing concepts and demos ( learn by doing ) to the students so that they can learn with ease Java and learn the core Java skills needed to apply for Java developer positions.\n\n\nThis Java Programming course is project-based and we will do 7 awesome projects during the course. During the course, we will do more than 50 coding exercises.\nIn this course you will learn;\nWhat Java is and how it works,\nProgramming Fundamentals with Java,\nEclipse\nJava Development Kit - JDK,\nJava Runtime Environment – JRE,\nJava Virtual Machine - JVM\nAll Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming\nHow To Use ‘Static’ Keyword and ‘Nested and Inner’ Classes\nSuper Classes and Sub Classes\nStrings,\nWrapper Classes,\nThrow and Throws\nExceptions,\nSwing\nLayouts and Grid Layout\nEnum Types and more\n\n\nThis course aims to teach you the Java Programming Language from scratch. In this context, starting from the installation of Java, we have presented to you the working structure of Java, data types in Java, operators used in Java, condition statements and loops in Java, creating methods in Java, all aspects of Object-Oriented programming and the String class, exceptions in Java, and many other topics. At the end of this course, you will find yourself mastering the basics of Java and ready to take it one step further.\n\n\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\n\n\nNo Previous Knowledge is needed!\nThis course will take you from a beginner to a more experienced level.\n\n\nThis Java course takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program. You will learn the core java skills step by step with hands-on examples. If you are from the field and need a refresher this course will be a guide for you, too. Every time you come back to this course you will learn something new or improve yourself.\n\n\nFresh Content\nOwners of Java ( Oracles ) are releasing new versions of Java at least twice a year and it’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. It’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge. With this course, you will always have a chance to follow the latest trends.\n\n\nWhat is Java?\nJava is a programming language and platform initially developed by Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle. Java is inspired by C and C++ and uses an object-oriented programming model, which means that concepts or things are represented as “objects” that have data fields and methods. One of the biggest advantages of Java is that it runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), meaning that you can execute Java code on any platform that has a JVM, without re-compilation. This is different from C and C++, which require re-compilation for every hardware platform you execute the code on. Java has many other advantages, including automatic memory management. This eliminates hard-to-understand pointers used in languages like C, which can help Java developers write better code in a shorter period of time.\n\n\nWhat does it mean that Java is an object-oriented programming language?\nJava is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means concepts or things are represented as “objects” that have data fields and methods. In object-oriented programming, models called “objects” represent either a programming entity or an abstract concept. These objects are created and assembled independently of one another but can work with each other in logical ways. Objects are manifestations of classes and can inherit code allowing for code re-use, which can drastically reduce code duplication if used correctly. Additionally, encapsulation, another core OOP concept, allows you to create code with the implementation hidden. Although, in many cases, writing OOP code in Java (and other OOP languages) can take longer than using a procedural language, the benefits obtained with OOP, namely code reusability, encapsulation of data, and readability of code, often result in code that is easier to maintain in the long run.\n\n\nWhat is Java used for?\nJava is a very versatile language. Several fields use Java, including Android app development, desktop applications that work on many operating systems, server-side applications, and more. The virtual machine required to run Java programs has been ported to numerous operating systems allowing Java to run on virtually all hardware. According to the TIOBE index, Java has consistently been in the top 3 most-used and popular languages since its initial release in the 1990s. Many developers still consider Java the language of choice in areas such as enterprise and application servers, and even in embedded systems development. Many Fortune 500 companies rely on Java to run their core systems and employers often view Java experience on a résumé as favorable due to its popularity.\n\n\nWhat certification is best for Java?\nOracle, the owner of the Java programming language, has the Oracle Certified Developer: Java SE 11 Developer program, which is easily the best certification to obtain for Java developers. The main reason why it’s the best certification, is, unlike most other certifications for Java, the Oracle certification is both well known and universally accepted by employers all over the world. The exam is challenging. You also must bring an ID with you to the exam, so you cannot get anyone to take it for you.

      "description": "Python is a multi-domain, interpreted programming language. It is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is often used as a scripting language because of its forgiving syntax and compatibility with a wide variety of different eco-systems. Its flexible syntax enables developers to write short scripts while at the same time, they can use object-oriented concepts to develop very large projects.\nA Python script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be executed like a program. The file can of course contain functions and import various modules, but the idea is that it will be run or executed from the command line or from within a Python interactive shell to perform a specific task.\nScripting is a very common practice among Python programmers. It’s used for automation of daily tasks, reporting, server management, security, social media management, business growth and development, financial trading, automating software and many other intelligent solutions.\nA script is used to automate certain tasks in a program. It can run by itself and it is less code intensive whereas modules in python is referred as a library which can not run by its own. It needs to get imported in order to use it .",

Everyone is talking about it. This is said everywhere. Python is for data science.\n- But don't we programmers ever wonder?\n- Can we code an application using Python?\n- How can we use GUI in Python?\n- I wonder if we can quickly prepare a user interface?\nIn this course, we will seek answers to these questions with you. First of all, in our course, we will explain the fundamental topics of Python so that those who are new to Python can understand it. These fundamental topics will include the most powerful and important topics of both Python and software development, such as OOP. Then we will try to develop some programs with GUI using Python with you. While doing this, we will learn how to do GUI design in Python. We will also learn how to make database connections in Python.\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nWhat is a Tkinter in Python?\nTkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. Tkinter is not the only GuiProgramming toolkit for Python. It is however the most commonly used one.\n\nWhat is the easiest GUI for Python?\nTkinter is one of the most popular GUI libraries in Python. It is one of the first choices for beginners to GUI development because of its simple and easy-to-learn syntax.\n\n\nIs tkinter easy?\nIf your goal is to learn how to create GUIs, tkinter is arguably one of the best toolkits there is to reach that goal. It's simple and easy to learn and can provide a fantastic introduction to concepts you must master in order to create graphical desktop applications.\n\n\nWhy tkinter is used in Python?\nTkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\n\n\nIs tkinter included in PyCharm?\nThe Tkinter library is built-in with every Python installation, so it's already installed in PyCharm per default. This means that you have to do nothing else but run “ import tkinter ” or “ import tkinter as tk ” in your Python 3 script without installation.\n\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\n\nWhat is GUI programming?\nGraphical User Interface (GUI), a computer program that enables a person to communicate with a computer through the use of symbols, visual metaphors, and pointing devices.\n\n\nWhy Python is used for GUI?\nPython has a huge number of GUI frameworks (or toolkits) available for it, from TkInter (traditionally bundled with Python, using Tk) to a number of other cross-platform solutions, as well as bindings to platform-specific (also known as \"native\") technologies.\n\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popular.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile development.\n\n\nWhat skills or experience should I have before learning Python?\nPython is often taught in college-level classes because it is well-suited to being someone's first programming language. So, while it can be easier to learn Python if you already know Java, JavaScript, or other common languages, it isn't necessary. Before you learn Python, it might be helpful to understand the basics of programming logic, such as \"if/then\" gates, \"while/for\" loops and procedural vs. objective programming. You might also want to understand how applications get built, the difference between frontend and backend programming, and how computers utilize given applications. Udemy has a lot of beginner courses that can help you pick up Python quickly.\n\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories.

Its sister board to the Pico W now adding WIFI, allowing IoT projects to be built.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn about building projects for the Pico or Pico W in C++. We learn about common components, how to connect them to the Pico and build programs to effectively use them. The course covers:\n·LED and RGB LEDs\n·WS2812B LEDs and a 12 LED Ring\n·Switches\n·Rotary Encoders\n·HC-SR501 PIR Module\nBringing all of these components together into a project that can animate patterns on the LED Ring. You can select the pattern, colour and speed of the animation using the Rotary Encoder.\n\n\nThe course looks at hardware electronics and software separately. People are often more comfortable with one of these than the other. Separating them allows you to skim through the bits you are comfortable with and take your time where you are not.\n\n\nThe course is suitable for those with very little electronics knowledge. Basic C++ knowledge is assumed as the course will not teach syntax, though will explain what the code is doing.\n\n\nThe course follows the knowledge my students would have gained in the Introduction to C Development Environment for Raspberry PICO course on Udemy. I will assume that you have a development environment setup and can compile C or C++ code for the Pico and copy the binary over onto the Pico to run. If you don’t feel confident with that, please do take my introductory course as that will set you up for this one.\n\n\nThe course includes all the code examples and my answers to the assignment problems. I also provide recommendations for further reading on each of the topics. So everything you need to start developing for the Pico and keep going.",

This Embedded Systems & Engineering training will provide you an opportunity to learn about the skills required to be any one of the Embedded engineers and hence will give you direction on how to become an Embedded engineer or test engineer, or any of the titles mentioned above.\nYou will acquire knowledge on Embedded Hardware Development and its complexities through this Embedded Systems, Engineering, and MATLAB course.\n\n\nAn Embedded system is a controller, which controls many other electronic devices. It is a combination of embedded hardware and software. An Embedded System is an integrated system which is formed as an combination of computer hardware and software for a specific function. It can be said as a dedicated computer system which has been developed for some particular reason. Embedded systems work independently or are attached to a larger system to work on few specific functions. These embedded systems can work without human intervention or with a little human intervention.\nThere are two types of embedded systems microprocessors and micro-controller. Getting to market with in-demand IoT applications requires embedded systems designed for rapid development, flexibility and scale, along with a complement of devices, tools, documentation and support.\n\n\nMATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation. MATLAB (short for matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks, a leading developer of mathematical computing software for engineers and scientists. Intended primarily for numerical computing, MATLAB is a programming environment for algorithm development, data analysis, visualization and numeric computation.\nSome of the key areas where MATLAB is used:\nMath and computation\nAlgorithm development\nModeling, simulation, and prototyping\nData analysis, exploration, and visualization\nScientific and engineering graphics\nApplication development, including Graphical User Interface building\n\n\nSystem vs. Embedded System\nBasically a system is a set of interrelated parts/components which are designed/developed to perform a common tasks or to do some specific work for which it has been created. Thus a system is an arrangement in which all its unit assemble work together according to a set of rules. It can also be defined as a way of working, organizing or doing one or many tasks according to a fixed plan.\nEmbedded means something that is attached to another thing. An embedded system can be thought of as a computer hardware system having software embedded in it. An embedded system is a microcontroller or microprocessor based system which is designed to perform a specific task. For example, a fire alarm is an embedded system; it will sense only smoke.\n\n\nMain components of Embedded systems are -\nHardware (hard-wired components)\nSoftware (application software)\nFirmware or Real Time Operating system (RTOS) that supervises the application software and provide mechanism to let the processor run a process as per scheduling by following a plan to control the latencies.\nExamples of embedded systems are -\nDigital watches\nWashing Machine\nToys\nTelevisions\nDigital phones\nLaser Printer\nCameras\nIndustrial machines\nElectronic Calculators\nAutomobiles\nMedical Equipment\n\n\nEngineers and scientists across the globe use MATLAB to analyze and design systems and products currently transforming our world. The programming language is found in automobile active safety systems, interplanetary spacecraft, health monitoring devices, smart power grids and LTE cellular networks. The platform is optimized for machine learning, signal processing, image processing, computer vision, communications, computational finance, control design, robotics and other mathematical operations.\n\n\nEmbedded Systems and MATLAB - Course Syllabus\n\n\nEmbedded Systems Introduction\nReal Life Embedded Applications\nMATLAB Introduction\nEmbedded Product Development with MATLAB\nG.168 (2000)\nEfficient MATLAB Programming\nMATLAB Graphics Commands\nMATLAB GUI Creation\nMATLAB Guide\nIntroduction to Simulink\nFixed Point Arithmetic\nIntroduction to Simulink\nSimulink deep-dive\nPulse Oximeter using Simulink\nEfficient MATLAB\nS Function\nSpecial Plots\nMATLAB Coding Guidelines\nG.168 in Nutshell\nG.168 Implementation in MATLAB\nTest G.168\nEmbedded Firmware Engineer\nEmbedded Firmware Developer\nEmbedded Firmware Test Engineer\nEmbedded Software Engineer\nEmbedded Software Developer\nEmbedded Software Test Engineer\nEmbedded Systems Engineer\nEmbedded Hardware Engineer\nEmbedded Hardware Development\nEmbedded Hardware Test Engineer\nEmbedded Hardware Design Engineer\nLegacy Embedded Systems\nEmbedded Systems Paradigm Shift\nEmbedded Portfolio\nEmbedded System Design Flow",

Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects\nMariaDB Server is one of the most popular open source relational databases. It's made by the original developers of MySQL so they share some similarities.\n\n\nIn this course you  learn how to interface a Python  application program with a MariaDB Server Database. Python has  various modules that you can use to  interact with databases. We will install a database connector module to enable us interact with MariaDB Server database from our Python application.\nWe will be installing Python and MariaDB database server  and also create a new database and table that our Python application will interact with.\nWe will create the Python application frontend using Tkinter which is a built in Python module used to create graphical user interfaces . From tkinter module we will import ttk module which is a themed widget library that contains various types of widgets like buttons, labels etc that we can use to build the graphical user interface for our Python application. We will also import other bits and pieces from the tkinter module that our Python application will use.\nAlso we will create a database configuration file that will be used to interact with the MariaDB Server database from our Python application. We will also be creating a class with methods and also stand alone functions for our application.\nWhen the application is complete we will be able to perform CRUD operations on the MariaDB database from our Python application.",

In fact, they managed to grow their user base to millons of users with an engineering team of only 32 persons using Erlang, before being acquired by Facebook. But WhatsApp is not the only success story. You would be surprised if you knew how many of the things you take for granted in your daily life are in fact powered by Erlang. It all started with the telecom business, but Erlang has since then gained popularity in many areas, including fintech, IoT, Healthcare and gaming. Just to name a few!\nThere are two main paradigms of the Erlang language. The functional paradigm, and the concurrent paradigm. In this course, we will put our focus on the concurrent part of Erlang. Not only will we talk about concurrency, parallelism and design patterns. We will also talk about the OTP, supervisors, and how we can make our programs truly fault tolerant.\nIf you are new to the language, I suggest you start with my other course, which will lay the foundation for this one, and provide you with all the tools you need.\nSo, if any of this sounds interesting to you, give it a try and tell me what you think.",

At its most basic, computer programming is a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions. If you're wondering what a computer programmer is, it's a professional that creates instructions for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully.\nComputers can do amazing things, from basic laptops capable of simple word processing and spreadsheet functions to incredibly complex supercomputers completing millions of financial transactions a day and controlling the infrastructure that makes modern life possible. But no computer can do anything until a computer programmer tells it to behave in specific ways. That’s what computer programming is all about.\nAt its most basic, computer programming is little more than a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions. Based on the requirements or purposes of these instructions, computer programming can be as simple as adding two numbers. It can also be as complex as reading data from temperature sensors to adjust a thermostat, sorting data to complete intricate scheduling or critical reports or taking players through multi-layered worlds and challenges in games.\n\n\nJavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behaviour of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.",

A Beginner’s Guide\nWhat Is Python Used For? A Beginner’s Guide\nWritten by Coursera • Updated on Nov 14, 2022\nShare\nPython has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world in recent years. It's used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alike.\n\n\n[Featured image] A software developer coding in Python on her laptop.\nPython, one of the most popular programming languages in the world, has created everything from Netflix’s recommendation algorithm to the software that controls self-driving cars. Python is a general-purpose language, which means it’s designed to be used in a range of applications, including data science, software and web development, automation, and generally getting stuff done.\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at what Python is, what it can do, and how you can start learning it.\n\n\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today. A survey conducted by industry analyst firm RedMonk found that it was the second-most popular programming language among developers in 2021 [1].\n\n\nDid you know? The name Python comes from Monty Python. When Guido van Rossum was creating Python, he was also reading the scripts from BBC’s Monty Python’s Flying Circus. He thought the name Python was appropriately short and slightly mysterious.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Python used for?\nPython is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.\n\n\n“Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,” says University of Michigan and Coursera instructor Charles R Severance in his book Python for Everybody. “You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem.”\n\n\nWhat can you do with python? Some things include:\n\n\nData analysis and machine learning\n\n\nWeb development\n\n\nAutomation or scripting\n\n\nSoftware testing and prototyping\n\n\nEveryday tasks\n\n\nHere’s a closer look at some of these common ways Python is used.\n\n\nEarn Your Degree\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are Currently on slide 1\nData analysis and machine learning\nPython has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualizations, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyze data, and complete other data-related tasks.\n\n\nPython can build a wide range of different data visualizations, like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and 3D plots. Python also has a number of libraries that enable coders to write programs for data analysis and machine learning more quickly and efficiently, like TensorFlow and Keras.\n\n\nWeb development\nPython is often used to develop the back end of a website or application—the parts that a user doesn’t see. Python’s role in web development can include sending data to and from servers, processing data and communicating with databases, URL routing, and ensuring security. Python offers several frameworks for web development. Commonly used ones include Django and Flask.\n\n\nSome web development jobs that use Python include back end engineers, full stack engineers, Python developers, software engineers, and DevOps engineers.\n\n\nRead more: How to Become a Web Developer\nAutomation or scripting\nIf you find yourself performing a task repeatedly, you could work more efficiently by automating it with Python. Writing code used to build these automated processes is called scripting. In the coding world, automation can be used to check for errors across multiple files, convert files, execute simple math, and remove duplicates in data.\n\n\nPython can even be used by relative beginners to automate simple tasks on the computer—such as renaming files, finding and downloading online content or sending emails or texts at desired intervals.\n\n\nSoftware testing and prototyping\nIn software development, Python can aid in tasks like build control, bug tracking, and testing. With Python, software developers can automate testing for new products or features. Some Python tools used for software testing include Green and Requestium.\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan\nPython for Everybody\n\n\nSpecialization\n\n\nBeginner level\n\n\n· 8 month(s)\n\n\nSkills you'll build:Json, Xml, Python Programming, Database (DBMS), Python Syntax And Semantics, Basic Programming Language, Computer Programming, Data Structure, Tuple, Web Scraping, Sqlite, SQL, Data Analysis, Data Visualization (DataViz)\n4.8\n\n\n(199,516 ratings)\n\n\nEveryday tasks\nPython isn't only for programmers and data scientists. Learning Python can open new possibilities for those in less data-heavy professions, like journalists, small business owners, or social media marketers. Python can also enable non-programmers to simplify certain tasks in their lives. Here are just a few of the tasks you could automate with Python:\n\n\nKeep track of stock market or crypto prices\n\n\nSend yourself a text reminder to carry an umbrella anytime it’s raining\n\n\nUpdate your grocery shopping list\n\n\nRenaming large batches of files\n\n\nConverting text files to spreadsheets\n\n\nRandomly assign chores to family members\n\n\nFill out online forms automatically\n\n\nWhy is Python so popular?\nPython is popular for a number of reasons. Here’s a deeper look at what makes it so versatile and easy to use for coders.\n\n\nIt has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, so it’s easier to read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects, and faster to improve on them.\n\n\nIt’s versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.\n\n\nIt’s beginner friendly, making it popular for entry-level coders.\n\n\nIt’s open source, which means it’s free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.\n\n\nPython’s archive of modules and libraries—bundles of code that third-party users have created to expand Python’s capabilities—is vast and growing.\n\n\nPython has a large and active community that contributes to Python’s pool of modules and libraries, and acts as a helpful resource for other programmers. The vast support community means that if coders run into a stumbling block, finding a solution is relatively easy; somebody is bound to have encountered the same problem before.\n\n\nReady to get started?\nFor those just starting out, Google’s IT Support Professional Certificate prepares course takers for an entry-level position by teaching such IT support tasks as computer assembly, wireless networking, installing programs, and customer service.\n\n\nGoogle\nGoogle IT Automation with Python\n\n\nProfessional Certificate\n\n\nBeginner level\n\n\n· 6 month(s)\n\n\nSkills you'll build:Using Version Control, Troubleshooting & Debugging, Python Programming, Configuration Management, Automation, Basic Python Data Structures, Fundamental Programming Concepts, Basic Python Syntax, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Setting up your Development Environment, Regular Expression (REGEX), Testing in Python, Automating System Administration Tasks with Python, Bash Scripting, Using Git, Version Control Systems, Interacting with GitHub, Reverting Changes, Creating Pull Requests, Improving Software Performance, Managing Scarce Resources, Advanced Troubleshooting, Understanding Errors, Finding the Root Cause of a Problem, Automation at Scale, Basic Monitoring & Alerting, Cloud Computing, Using Puppet, Serialization, Building a Solution, Creating and Translating Media Files, Interacting with Web Services\n4.8\n\n\n(29,775 ratings)\n\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\n\nShould I learn Python 2 or Python 3?‎\n\n\nHow long does it take to learn Python?‎\nLearning the basics of Python can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, depending on what you want to learn and how frequently you learn. But since Python has so many uses—and tools to support those uses—you can spend years learning its different applications.\n\n\nKnowing what tasks you want to accomplish and whether you want to use Python in a professional capacity can determine how long your Python journey will be.\n\n\n“It is a lot easier to be a professional programmer today than it was 20 years ago,” says Severance. “You don't need a bachelor's degree or years of experience to get your start in programming. With the increasing popularity of Python, you can gain the necessary skills to begin writing software as part of your job in a few months.”\n\n\nI can promise you guys, can learn the basics of python even the person who is not having basic knowledge over the python or any coding language till date. Enjoy your sessions with best concentration over the tutorials. I am also attaching the materials to understand very easily. I feel guys can rock the entire course and anyways All the best for your future. So then we can start now itself.",

With this experience, he has developed hundreds of exercises that aim to teach the most efficient and effective ways at using the Python programming language.\nPython is one of the most powerful and popular programming languages today. Although it is widely used, it takes a long time to master. There are often multiple ways of solving the same problem and unfortunately many of these solutions are poor and ineffective. Ted has developed these challenges to teach you the very best practices for completing tasks with Python.\nDo you have what it takes to solve these challenges?",

      "description": "Course Objectives\n\n\nThis is a fast-paced introductory course to the C++ programming language. It is intended for those with a little programming background, though prior programming experience will make it easier, and those with previous experience will still learn C++-specific constructs and concepts.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to:\n\n\n-- Understand and use the basic programming constructs of C++\n\n\n-- Manipulate various C++ data types, such as arrays, strings, and pointers\n\n\n-- Isolate and fix common errors in C++ programs\n\n\n-- Use memory appropriately, including proper allocation/deallocation procedures\n\n\n-- Apply object-oriented approaches to software problems in C++\n\n\n-- Write small-scale C++ programs using the above skills\n\n\nCourse Mechanics\n\n\nYou are responsible for all material presented in lectures. There will also generally be some extra notes in the problem sets the building on the material that you should read before attempting the problem set. We strongly recommend that you attend labs, as you will almost certainly need help on the problem sets (C++ can be tricky!), but you are not required to stay for the entire lab.\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nThere will be four problem sets (the last of which will be smaller) and a final project. You are encouraged to collaborate, but any code and write-ups you hand in must be your own.\n\n\nThis is a P/D/F course. Each problem set will be graded out of 100. We will award a pass based on whether problem set grades are generally on par with the class average and whether the final project demonstrates an understanding of the material. There will be no exams.\n\n\nCoding Environment\n\n\nGenerally, software developers do their development work in some sort of “integrated development environment” (IDE), which will have many built-in tools for editing, compiling, running, and debugging programs. We recommend that you use the IDE known as Code::Blocks, which is freely available.\n\n\nYou will also need to download the GNU C++ compiler (GCC). For Windows machines, you should use the MinGW version of it; you can install the version of Code::Blocks that comes bundled with MinGW, or follow the instructions here. If you’re on a Mac, the easiest thing to do is install Xcode, which comes bundled with GCC. Xcode can be downloaded here (registration with Apple is required). If you’re using Linux, you probably don’t need our help on this one, and your operating system probably came with GCC anyway.\n\n\nThere are many IDEs available besides Code::Blocks, and you may use any of them if you so desire. Another freely available one is Eclipse, which is very powerful and works on all operating systems, though many have had technical problems in the past with installing/using it for C++. (We recommend that you download the edition of Eclipse for C/C++ developers, but if you already have a different version of Eclipse, you can install the C/C++ add-ons through Eclipse’s add-on manager.) On a Mac, you can simply use the Xcode IDE; on Windows, you can use Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows (registration with Microsoft DreamSpark required). While all of these will serve the purpose well, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to help you with any problems that arise in the course of using them.",

      "description": "C# (pronounced \"See Sharp\") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.\nC# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behaviour.\nC# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries. The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard. The CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.\n\n\nASP DOT NET is a popular web-development framework for building web apps on the .NET platform.\nASP DOT NET is the open-source version of ASP DOT NET , that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. ASP DOT NET  Core was first released in 2016 and is a re-design of earlier Windows-only versions of ASP DOT NET  .\nDOT NET  is a developer platform made up of tools, programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of applications.\nThe base platform provides components that apply to all different types of apps. Additional frameworks, such as ASP DOT NET , extend  DOT NET with components for building specific types of apps.\nHere are some things included in the  DOT NET  platform:\nThe C#, F#, and Visual Basic programming languages\nBase libraries for working with strings, dates, files/IO, and more\nEditors and tools for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker\nASP DOT NET  extends the DOT NET   platform with tools and libraries specifically for building web apps.\nThese are some things that ASP DOT NET  adds to the  DOT NET  platform:\nBase framework for processing web requests in C# or F#\nWeb-page templating syntax, known as Razor, for building dynamic web pages using C#\nLibraries for common web patterns, such as Model View Controller (MVC)\nAuthentication system that includes libraries, a database, and template pages for handling logins, including multi-factor authentication and external authentication with Google, Twitter, and more.\nEditor extensions to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and other functionality specifically for developing web pages\nWhen using ASP DOT NET  your back-end code, such as business logic and data access, is written using C#, F#, or Visual Basic.",

      "description": "This course will start with the explanation of intricacies between out, ref and in keyword. Then the students will learn about new data types (tuples and structures) – when and why they shall be used. After grasping all of the preceding knowledge there shall be no mistakes when students use value or reference types. The late-bounding (enabled by various techniques of polymorphism – inheritance, object, dynamic, generics and reflection) opens new doors that will be explored in this course in theory and practice.\nThe topics about delegates and events are very interesting and usually difficult for new developers. The concept of holding as a reference a method is something common to functional programming but C# allows you to get the advantages of that feature too. The students that will finish this course won’t have problems in understanding when and how to use delegates. The Event-driven Design (EDD) is based on the work with events and delegates (wired to them). Coupling EED with the knowledge and characteristics of OOP will help students build web, mobile and graphical applications in the near future/courses easily.\nThe last two important concepts that will be taught in this course are lambda expressions and LINQ. Understanding how they work will improve not only the development speed of different tasks/algorithms but will give the students opportunity to grasp the clever use of delegates, generics and the so called ‘Fluent API’ – a technique that will be used later (when we separate and specify our components/libraries of the n-tier application and/or use ORM such as EF Core).\nBefore we start making multi-tier applications a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and experience with solving simple tasks are necessary. This course is the third stepping stone towards achieving that goal.\nI hope that my students will be benevolent toward each other in the Q&A section of the courses and be successful in their future career as a software developer (and engineer).",

The VSCode is installed on the windows, we use ssl to connect Ubuntu system.\nAfter that, we will write LLVM pass hand by hand. At the early stage we will write a very basic pass that just display the function name in the C source files.  Then we will learn how to write a function pass to analysis function information, such as instruction count, basic block count. We will write a module pass to analysis module information, such as function count.  We will create a loop mass to analysis loop nested level.\nAt the end stage we will create some powerful passes. For example, we will create a pass to collection function call count at compile time. We will write a pass to emit some LLVM IR to collection function called count at runtime. We will create a pass to analysis LLVM IR instructions to execute constant folding compile optimization.\nThis course covers all the aspect of LLVM pass development.",

Here's why.\nBut First, a Warning...\nBefore we go further, let me make something abundantly clear. This is not a course that will make you an \"instant\" expert in R. This is also not a course that promises you that you will learn everything R in 2 hours, just by watching the videos.\nAnd I am not suggesting that everyone (or anyone) who watches this course will like it (maybe because of my French accent). In fact, if you don't apply what you learn in this course and do the practice activities (there are 6 of them and 3 Capstone assigments), it's more than likely that you will not learn anything to analyze your data in RStudio.\nwith that said, let me jump right in and show you...\nExactly What You're Getting\nFirst of all, there isn't any fluff or filler, no powerpoint to fill up time. This is also not an 8 or 10 hour video course like I see sometimes, because if you're like me, you don't have 10 hours sitting to watch programming videos to get your job done. You want something that goes right to the point. That's what I am giving you..\n... and it is easy to follow. 1 hour 54 minutes of video and you'll immediately \"get\" the system I use to start analyzing data in RStudio.\nI hear lots of people say R is a complicated language. I disagree. What used to be a steep learning curve has been made a lot simpler and more efficient with RStudio and the Tidyverse. In this Getting Started with RStudio course, you will learn everything you need to know to get started with RStudio IDE, and to clean, transform and load data with RStudio.\nSay goodbye to the frustrating \"steep\" R learning curve\nSay goodbye to complicated native base R commands\nPlus you'll also discover …\nWhat you should never do to clear your R environment. (Video #5)\nThe 3 main reasons for a messy datasets (Video #16)\nThe 3 rules for a clean dataset (Video #16)\nWhat you should never do when quitting your R session, and why? (Video #5)\nHow to code in R, even without a laptop (Video #3)\nHow to easily handle multiple projects, without ANY confusion, even if you don't know how to program in R (Video #3)\nWhere to find the easiest FREE online platform to code in R. (Video #3)\nThe truth about rm(list=ls()) (Video #5)\nWhat to do if you forgot your laptop and want to analyze data in R (Video #3)\nWhat to do if you want to code in R and Python on the same RStudio account? (Video #3)\nHow to create beautiful interactive graphs, tables and maps, even if you're a brand new R programmer. (Video #7)\n2 ways to install and load R packages in RStudio (Video #6)\nYou need expensive and professional drivers to connect to SQL databases, right? Wrong! (Video #13)\nHow to get source data from Excel, sav, tsv, SPSS, SAS or Stata, even if you don't know how to code. (Video #9,10,12)\nWhat to do if multiple variables and values are stored in 1 column. (Video #16)\nWhat to do if column headers are values instead of variable names (Video #16)\nWhat to do if variables are stored in both rows and columns. (Video #16)\nSay goodbye to frustrations when changing long to wide or wide to long format. (Video #16)\nYes, that's a lot of neat tips, but that's not all, you'll also discover ...\nHow to eliminate unnecessary coding for simple tasks like clearing the console, restarting R, or instantly finding previous commands. (Video #16)\nThe difference between NA and NaN and why it matters (Video #19)\nThe difference between = and == (single and double equal sign) The right way to use them (Video #18)\n4 ways to handle missing values (test, recode, drop, replace) (Video #19)\nHow to create missing data out of invalid data. (Video #19)\nWhen it's OK to extract and replace substrings from a character vector. (Video #17)\nHow to split 1 column into 2,4 or even 10 new columns, in 1 go, with this very useful tidyverse function.

I also know some of these courses have 6 or 8 hours of video content, and they're priced the same, or even cheaper. So, the logical question is: \"why buy this course?\"\nThe reason is simple, in my 1h 54m of video content, I show you what works now and if you're a seasoned or aspiring data analyst who want to use RStudio and R to analyze data, you don't want to go through 8 hours of content to find the commmands you need. You want the essentials, and some more, to get the job done. Because that's what it is about. Getting started with RStudio and get the job done to load, clean and transform your data to start analyze it in the most efficient way possible.\nAnyway, with all that said, this is a limited offer at that price. I'm constantly testing the data and I might decide to increase the price. I really don't know at that point.\noh, one more thing, you're also getting\nALL the Getting Started with RStudio Chear Sheets\nIn these 3 sets of cheat sheets, you'll get one-pagers for quick reference to import, clean and transform data with RStudio\nGetting Started with RStudio cheat sheet\nImporting Data in RStudio cheat sheet\nTransforming (and Cleaning) Data In RStudio cheat sheet\nAnd by the way, you'll still protected by...\nUDEMY's 30-day Money Back Guarantee\nof course, I am abiding by their 30-day guarantee, which states \"We want you to be satisfied, so all eligible courses purchased on Udemy can be refunded within 30 days.

And you can handle them however you like!\n\n\nQ. Will my previous employment experience be irrelevant once I transition to IT? Will my salary decrease?\nA: We do all possible to ensure that you make at least as much money after the training as you did before you came to us. So, when you switch to IT, you may not earn twice as much at first. However, you will advance in your profession and good entry level salary in your first job in IT.

Whether you are working with large-scale enterprise applications, financial systems, or real-time messaging applications, understanding threads, synchronization, and concurrent programming is critical.\n\n\nAlso, this course is project-based and we will do more than 20 coding exercises.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn;\nIntroduction to threads and multithreading\nThread creation using Thread and Runnable\nThread management and lifecycle\nSynchronization techniques (synchronized, volatile, Lock API)\nAdvanced locking mechanisms (ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock)\nJava’s high-level concurrency APIs (ExecutorService, Future, Callable)\nThread coordination (wait(), notify(), condition variables)\nWorking with thread-safe collections and blocking queues\nPerformance optimization, avoiding deadlocks, and scaling applications\nReal-world multithreading case studies (Web server, Producer-Consumer, Chat system)\nWith multithreading, you can:\n- Improve application performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores\n- Build responsive applications that don’t freeze during long-running tasks\n- Ensure thread safety and prevent issues like race conditions and deadlocks\n- Master Java’s high-level concurrency APIs and parallel computing techniques\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Multithreading in Java?\nMultithreading in Java is an act of executing a complex process using virtual processing entities independent of each other. These entities are called threads. Threads in Java are virtual and share the same memory location of the process. As the threads are virtual, they exhibit a safer way of executing a process.\n\n\nWhat is a Thread in Java?\nA thread is the smallest segment of an entire process. A thread is an independent, virtual and sequential control flow within a process. In process execution, it involves a collection of threads, and each thread shares the same memory. Each thread performs the job independently of another thread.\n\n\nMultithreading vs. multitasking vs. multiprocessing\nMultithreading differs from Multitasking and multiprocessing. However, multitasking and multiprocessing are related to multithreading in the following ways:\nMultitasking is a computer's ability to execute two or more concurrent programs. Multithreading makes multitasking possible when it breaks programs into smaller, executable threads. Each thread has the programming elements needed to execute the main program, and the computer executes each thread one at a time.\nMultiprocessing uses more than one CPU to speed up overall processing and supports multitasking.\n\n\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching\nOAK Academy, based in London, is an online education company that offers courses in IT, Software, Design, and Development in Turkish, English, and Portuguese.

Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n\n\nWhat can Python do?\n\n\nPython can be used on a server to create web applications.\nPython can be used alongside software to create workflows.\nPython can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\nPython can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\nPython can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\nWhy Python?\nPython works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\nPython has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\nPython has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\nPython runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\nPython can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\nThe most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this course. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.\nIn this course Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as , Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.",

It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\nIt is used for:\nweb development (server-side),\nsoftware development,\nmathematics,\nsystem scripting.\nWhat can Python do?\nPython can be used on a server to create web applications.\nPython can be used alongside software to create workflows.\nPython can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\nPython can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\nPython can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\nWhy Python?\nPython works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\nPython has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\nPython has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\nPython runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\nPython can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\nGood to know\nThe most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.\nIn this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.\nPython Syntax compared to other programming languages\nPython was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\nPython uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\nPython relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.",

In this course, we’ll start by setting up our development environment using Anaconda and installing Pygame, a powerful library that makes it easy to build games and graphical applications. From there, we’ll explore the fundamentals of Python programming, including variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. As we progress, we'll begin working with object-oriented programming by creating and using Python classes. These classes will form the building blocks of our very own arcade-style game inspired by Space Invaders.\nThroughout the course, you'll learn how to design and control game elements like enemies, a player-controlled spaceship, and missiles. You’ll write code that brings these objects to life—making them move, bounce, collide, and react to keyboard input. Our game logic will evolve gradually, starting with simple structures and becoming more complex as we add features like scoring, hit detection, and game-over conditions. While we won’t dive deep into theoretical computer science, this course will give you a solid, practical foundation in coding and logical thinking, with the fun of creating a working game from scratch.

We skip the theory and jump straight into understanding how sorting algorithms work from a more practical point of view. This course includes thorough animations and code explanations to get you up to speed as quickly as possible.\nSorting algorithms are used to sort data. They are used everywhere, from simply sorting numbers in an application, to sorting files by name on your operating system, to sorting videos by popularity on a website. Without sorting algorithms, most of what we take for granted today would not be possible.\nWe start with the most basic of sorting algorithms and then gradually move on to more complex and efficient algorithms, each one more interesting than the last. This course covers five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.\nAlgorithms may look like complicated beasts, but with the right guidance, you start to realise that they are not so mysterious after all. By looking at carefully crafted animations you will gain an understanding of an algorithm without even looking at the code. Then studying the code afterwards becomes a greatly simplified process, removing a lot of the guesswork and frustration.",

It's a great starter programming course to include as part of a computer science curriculum for your students.\nThis course isn't about learning Scratch programming specifically. Rather, it is designed to help students get their first experience with programming and computer programming, and along the way, get a basic understanding and familiarity with essential concepts in programming languages, such as algorithms, loops, variables, logic, conditionals, objects, properties, events, design, implementation, debugging, testing, etc.\nThe projects in this STEAM course are designed to be well-balanced between thinking & logic and artistic expression and creativity, so that both left- and right-brained students can thrive and be motivated!\nThis is an all Project-based Learning (PBL) lab course. Each week's class includes a little bit of lecture and slides, but the majority of the time is spent by the students in the lab (or on students' laptops) on their own to finish each week's project. The solution to each project is included and the teacher may choose to review it with the students during the next class. The course ends with a capstone project, wherein students will design, implement, test, and debug a State Machine device of their choice (e.g. a soda machine) using Scratch.\nI teach this class to a real 8th grade classroom in a middle-high school, during one school semester.\nPerquisites and Requirements\n\n\nNo prior knowledge or experience in programming needed\nExercises only require a computer with internet access\nInfo for Teachers\n\n\nSchool computer curriculum ready\nFor teacher curriculum bundle see Termeric Education website.\n\n\nSections\n\n\nIntro\nCourse Overview\nUnit 1\nScratch: Sign Up, Log In\nBasics Demo\nUnit 2\nIntro to Algorithms\nProject 1: Write Algorithm for Farmer River Crossing Problem\nUnit 3\nProject 2: Implement Algorithm to Farmer River Crossing Problem Using Scratch\nUnit 4\nLoops\nEvents\nBroadcasts\nProject 3: Remote Controlled Car\nUnit 5\nCostumes\nTimers\nProject 4: Traffic Light\nUnit 6\nVariables\nArithmetic Operators\nProject 5: Traffic Light with Timer\nUnit 7\nCreate a Moving Art\nUnit 8\nProject 7: Browse Existing Scratch Community Projects\nUnit 9\nAsking the User\nConditionals\nProject 8: ATM Machine\nUnit 10\nProject 9: Make Some Sound/Music\nUnit 11\nLogical Operators\nTesting & Debugging\nProject 10: Rock Paper Scissors Game: Debug & Customize\n(Bonus) Unit 12\nState Machines\n(Bonus) Design Project 11: Make Your Own State Machine\nOutro\nConclusion",

Why C# (pronounced see-sharp)?\n\n\nWell, aside from the fact that the C# programming language is multi-purpose, robust, open source, and free, we can use it to develop endless applications from financial to games, from simple to enterprise applications that can manage an entire bank's or government's financial operations.\n\n\nAs such, this course represents Montec's foundation course on structured programming - an experimental course that re-designed the typical approach to software development education for accessibility to anyone wanting to truly learn the profession.\n\n\nSo, you'll find that each of these courses are very important pillars on their own and focus on assisting you to develop your programming mindset.\n\n\nAnd, to a much lesser extent, focus less on the code language and, as such, shall not comprehensively cover the C# programming language which is already commonly available today.\n\n\nTo get the most of this course, it is very important that you write the course's programming code along with the instructor to develop your own style and confidence, while establishing the programming practice foundations and grasping concepts.\n\n\nAnd should you have any issues, post them within Udemy's Q & A forum here as early as possible so we can quickly assist you - in fact, it would especially help should you post the issue with full details (including the code segment and screen print(s), as much as possible), to expedite this assistance, which would in turn ensure that you can keep your pace in the course.\n\n\nOtherwise, again, Welcome To This Course, we look forward to hearing from you ( especially about how this course has helped you transitioned and/or improved ), areas where we can improve, and we sincerely hope you enjoy this course as much as we did making it!\n\n\nWho is this course for\nThis course targets the absolute beginner who may be in school or changing careers or just need a solid refresher and wants to learn programming from scratch using a proper language like C# and want to start building confidence within its practice.",

      "description": "OpenGL Lighting is a crucial and captivating aspect of computer graphics that brings virtual 3D scenes to life by simulating the interaction of light with objects. It is a fundamental concept for creating realistic and immersive visual experiences in various applications, including video games, simulations, architectural visualization, and more.\n\n\nThe primary objective of OpenGL Lighting is to model the behavior of light sources in a 3D environment and calculate how light interacts with surfaces to determine their appearance. This involves considering factors such as the position, intensity, and color of light sources, as well as the material properties of objects, such as their reflectivity and transparency.\n\n\nIn OpenGL, the lighting process involves several key components:\n\n\nLight Sources: OpenGL supports various types of light sources, including directional lights, point lights, and spotlights. Each light source has its unique characteristics, such as its position, direction, and attenuation. Multiple light sources can be combined to create complex lighting scenarios.\n\n\nMaterial Properties: For objects in the scene, material properties play a vital role in determining how they react to light. These properties include ambient, diffuse, specular, and emissive colors. Each property contributes to the overall appearance of the object when illuminated.\n\n\nShading Models: Different shading models, such as the Phong shading model, Blinn-Phong shading model, and Lambertian shading model, are used to calculate the interaction between light and surfaces. These models determine the final color of each pixel on the screen, taking into account the light direction, object normals, and viewer position.\n\n\nLighting Techniques: OpenGL supports various lighting techniques, such as per-vertex lighting and per-pixel lighting. Per-vertex lighting calculates the lighting at the vertices of the object and interpolates it across the faces. Per-pixel lighting calculates the lighting at each pixel, resulting in smoother and more accurate lighting effects.\n\n\nMastering OpenGL Lighting involves understanding the principles of light physics, the mathematics of shading models, and the OpenGL API functions related to lighting. Moreover, it requires an artistic eye to achieve the desired visual effects and create captivating scenes that evoke realism and immersion.\n\n\nIn conclusion, OpenGL Lighting is an essential skill for any graphics programmer or designer looking to create visually appealing and dynamic 3D scenes. With its ability to replicate real-world lighting scenarios and generate stunning visual effects, OpenGL Lighting opens a gateway to boundless creativity and breathtaking graphics in the realm of computer-generated imagery.",

Then we will try to develop a program using Python with you. While doing this, we will learn how to do GUI design in Python. We will also learn how to make database connections in Python.\n\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\n\n\nWhat is the use of PyQt5?\nPyQt is widely used for creating large-scale GUI-based programs. It gives programmers the freedom to create GUIs of their choice while also providing a lot of good pre-built designs. PyQT gives you widgets to create complex GUIs.\n\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

      "description": "A desktop application developer is a programmer who writes code for software applications that\nrun natively on operating systems like macOS, Windows, and Linux, and  don't need to be connected to the internet.\nIn this course we will be building desktop applications using Python, Java and C#.\nPython is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\nTkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI  Desktop applications\n\n\nJava is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacentres, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere.\nJava applications generally contain many mini programs with various functions. Some mini programs have a graphical user interface (GUI), if only a simple window or dialog box, and many mini programs have no GUI. The application itself, however, is likely to have a main GUI that consists of menus, buttons, tool bars, text fields, and other graphical features. The GUI is mainly for user input, whether the user clicks a button or types in information, and a GUI can provide the user with additional information. In addition, GUI components often display information back to the user.\nTo create the GUI, you use the Java Foundation Classes/Swing (JFC/Swing) and Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) API. The many classes and interfaces in those packages allow you to easily create buttons, check-box objects, text fields, and other components, as well as components to organize them. By far the easiest way to create the frame and all the GUI components for your application is to use an integrated development environment (IDE),  such as the NetBeans IDE. This IDE allows you to drag and drop your components into place while it writes the complex component code for you.\n\n\nC# (pronounced \"See Sharp\") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications\nC# Windows Forms is a UI framework for building Windows desktop apps. It provides one of the most productive ways to create desktop apps based on the visual designer provided in Visual Studio. Functionality such as drag-and-drop placement of visual controls makes it easy to build desktop apps.",

In the first episode we'll focus on getting everything prepared for the HTML parser and we're going to take influences from the functional style of writing code and also from our compiler episode.\nThe techniques taught in this course is not only useful for HTML. Everything is applicable no matter what kind of programming language you wish to create, or any existing language you want to parse. For instance, you can write your own C compiler or invent your own programming language. All you need is some basic C programming skills and the contents of this course.\nYou will learn how to code a lexer, which will turn the code into tokens, the smallest atomic part of any programming language. Then you will define the grammar according to the format taught in this course (bnf). The third step is to parse the tokens according to the language, by writing a recursive functional parser. And the final step is using your code, like rendering web pages (html), emitting assembly or machine code (c compiler) etc.\n\n\nAbout the author\nDr. Jonas is an experienced instructor who's been coding C for 25 years and teaching it for 7 years.

While many developers learn how to use std::unique_ptr, few truly understand how it works under the hood. This course takes you on a step-by-step journey to implement a smart pointer from scratch, teaching you not just how to use modern C++ techniques, but why they matter.\nWe start with the core philosophy of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and why it is the foundation of safe C++ programming. From there, you’ll write your own AutoPointer class and gradually evolve it into a unique_ptr clone, exploring concepts such as:\nRAII and deterministic destruction\nOwnership semantics and move-only types\nImplementing custom deleters\nmake-functions (make_unique) and safe resource creation\nEmpty Base Optimization (EBO) and how the standard library leverages it for efficiency\nPractical design trade-offs in real-world C++ libraries\nBy the end, you'll will gain a deep mastery over the internal mechanics of smart pointers, become fluent in resource-safe C++ techniques, and leave with the ability to design powerful abstractions that blend safety, flexibility, and performance.",

But the increasing complexity of the language and the remarkable performance of the JVM created an opening for a new generation of programming languages.\nThis Learning Path is a step-by-step guide which will walk you through the modern programming language: JVM. The course will start by giving you a basic understanding of JVM and its features, which are common to the JVM languages, helping you get abreast of its concepts. It will then dive into explaining languages such as Clojure, Kotlin, and Groovy and will show how to work with each language, their features, use cases, and pros and cons. By writing example projects in those languages and focusing on each language’s strong points, it will help you find the programming language that is most appropriate for your particular needs.\nBy the end of the course, you will have written multiple programs that run on the JVM and will know the differences between both languages. Also you'll be able to Work with various programming paradigms and gain knowledge about imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 2 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Introduction to JVM Languages - JVM, Java, Scala begin with a general introduction to the JVM and its features, which are common to the JVM languages, helping you get abreast of its concepts. It then dives into explaining languages such as Java and Scala and shows you how to work with each language, their features, use cases, and pros and cons. By writing example projects in these languages and focusing on each language’s strong points, it will help you find the programming language that is most appropriate for your particular needs.\nThe Second course, Introduction to JVM Languages – Clojure, Kotlin, and Groovy starts with a general introduction of the JVM and its features, which are common to the JVM languages, helping you get abreast with its concepts. It will then dive into explaining languages such as Clojure, Kotlin, and Groovy and will show how to work with each language, their features, use cases, and pros and cons.

      "description": "I talk about a number of concepts in this course that should make your code easier to maintain.\nYou might want to use some of these concepts and you might want to ignore others.\nBut if you know what is going on, you are not developing in the dark.\nIn programming, unlike photography, this is not something you should do.\nThe course is split into seven sections.\nThe first section is the introduction.\nIn the second section I talk about close to the code concepts, like indirections, small functions and beautify code.\nIn the third section I talk about larger groups of concepts and how they relate to maintainability.\nI present things like SOLID programming, Object Calisthenics and language speed through the code maintainability lenses.\nIn the fourth section I talk about how Inheritance affects maintainability.\nI explain things like why Encapsulation and Modeling will help you and why you should be careful when using inheritance and polymorphism.\nIn the fifth section I talk about how programming patterns relate to maintainability.\nI try bring attention to pattern types and I recommend using the simple ones and staying away from the complex ones.\nIn the sixth section I talk about ways of writing maintainable code.\nI describe and recommend things like Test Driven Development, High Level First and Continuous Refactoring.\nIn the seventh section I talk about concepts complementary to programming that can help you write maintainable code, like Yagni, Dry, Kiss and Fop.\nHere is a more in-depth list of things you will learn about in each lecture:\nSmall everything - The most important principle of maintainable code is to work with small units of code: small methods and small classes.\nIndirection - In this lecture I talk about indirection, a very useful principle that stands at the core of maintainable code together with Small everything. From indirection we can deduce useful principles and refactoring techniques like beautify code and extract method.\nExtract method and extract class - Extract method and Extract class are the most important refactoring techniques you need to know.\nBeautify Code - Make code easier to read and understand using indirection.\nNaming things to express intent - Names are our tool to express almost with free speech what we are doing in our code.\nLess parameters is better than more parameters - I talk about how the number of parameters is important and how you can bring that number down.\nSingle responsibility principle extended - I talk about the most important concept in SOLID programming, SRP and how it can be extended as a concept even to row level.\nOne to One principle - A lot of good programming principles seem to have one thing in common: they can be represented as one to one relationships.\nLow coupling High Cohesion - I talk about how it's good to keep you classes and methods decoupled but with high cohesion.\nCommand and query separation - You can separate your methods in two types: commands and queries. I talk about how to make this separation and what are the benefits.\nTell don't ask - Tell your objects what to do, don't ask what their state is.\nThe law of Demeter - Only use objects that were available when your method started.\nCoding good practices - Close to the code practices that help keep your code maintainable.\nCode Smells - A code smell indicates that something is wrong in your code. Some of them repeat themselves often and have names.\nIf and Boolean functions - \"If\" and \"Boolean functions\" deserve special attention when talking about maintainable code.\nProgramming languages particular features are dubious - There is something common in programming languages. Some sort of common programming language. I think this commonality is good and should be used a lot at the expense of particular language features.\nSOLID programming - In this lecture I discuss SOLID programming and which principles I think are good and important and which not so much.\nObjects Calisthenics - Object calisthenics are a set of strict programming principles created by Jeff Bay, that might help your code be more maintainable.\nOptimization, language speed and maintainable code - I explain why language speed is not important for most projects.\nMaintainability scarcity - Time is expensive. Here I explain why and a bit how to focus refactoring on the areas of the project where it will bring the most benefit.\nMaintainability architecture - I am in favor of writing code, building unit tests and refactoring over upfront architecture.\nEncapsulation is a friend - Objects should keep their internals to themselves.\nAbstraction (modeling) is a friend - Taking entities from the real world and abstracting them into classes makes it easier for the mind to understand what is going on in code.\nComposition is a friend, inheritance is not - Classes should use other classes, not inherit them, to avoid complex entangling.\nPolymorphism - it's complicated - I recommend staying away from polymorphism, due to the complexity it ads, because of it's magic nature.\nData classes are a thing and they are OK - Data objects are useful just as they are, they don't need to pretend to be classical oop objects.\nKnow the pattern types - There are different pattern types and I think that this is important.\nUse Simple patterns - It's good to know and use simple programming patterns.\nStay away from Complex patterns - Complex and hard to understand patterns are not something you want to use.\nMaintainability through tests - Tests, especially unit tests, are a core pillar for writing maintainable code.\nTDD - Test Driven Development is takes time and patience but is rewarding.\nHigh Level First - I like to write code by first writing method calls to methods that don't exist yet. This way I lay out the entire high level algorithm just with method names. After that I finish up by writing the body of the methods.\nRefactoring - Refactoring is an important pillar in keeping the code maintainable.\nContinuous refactoring - Always refactor when going through code.\nRefactor for simplicity - A special type of refactoring that I like is to refactor the code to make less complex.\nBig refactoring - Care must be taken when doing big refactoring.\nComplementary concepts - Concepts that are not necessary closely related to writing code.\nYagni - You ain't gonna need it.\nFocus on the present (FOt6P) - Focus on the present is a good mindset when deciding what functionality to implement.\nDry - Don't repeat yourself to avoid WET - wasting everyone's time.\nKiss - Keep it simple stupid.\nThe 80/20 rule - 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.\nWorse is better - A worse, simpler, product might be more useful than a more complex one.",

And understand what are the points of growth for a better understanding of Java. This test is suitable for anyone who wants to test their knowledge.\nJava is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was originally developed by Sun Microsystems and is now owned by Oracle Corporation. It is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications, and embedded systems. Java's popularity is due to its ability to run on multiple platforms, as well as its extensive libraries and tools.\nOne of the unique features of Java is its \"write once, run anywhere\" philosophy. This means that once a program is written in Java, it can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without needing to be recompiled for each platform. This makes Java an ideal choice for developing applications that need to run on multiple platforms, such as web-based applications that run on different operating systems and browsers.\nJava is also known for its robustness and reliability, thanks to its automatic memory management, garbage collection, and exception handling features. This makes it a popular choice for developing large-scale enterprise applications, where the ability to handle errors and exceptions is critical.\nAdditionally, Java has a large and active community of developers, who have created a wide range of libraries and frameworks to make it easier to develop applications in Java. This includes popular frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and Struts, as well as numerous open-source libraries for everything from cryptography to machine learning.\nOverall, Java is a powerful and versatile programming language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple desktop utilities to complex enterprise systems. Its platform-independence, robustness, and community support make it a popular choice for many developers and organizations.",

      "description": "Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. It leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.\nElixir is a functional, dynamic language built on top of Erlang and the Erlang VM. Erlang is a language that was originally written in 1986 by Ericsson to help solve telephony problems like distribution, fault-tolerance, and concurrency. Elixir, written by José Valim, extends Erlang and provides a friendlier syntax into the Erlang VM. It does this while keeping the performance of the same level as Erlang.\nFeatures of Elixir\nScalability − All Elixir code runs inside lightweight processes that are isolated and exchange information via messages.\nFault Tolerance − Elixir provides supervisors which describe how to restart parts of your system when things go wrong, going back to a known initial state that is guaranteed to work. This ensures your application/platform is never down.\nFunctional Programming − Functional programming promotes a coding style that helps developers write code that is short, fast, and maintainable.\nBuild tools − Elixir ships with a set of development tools. Mix is one such tool that makes it easy to create projects, manage tasks, run tests, etc. It also has its own package manager - Hex.\nErlang Compatibility − Elixir runs on the Erlang VM giving developers complete access to Erlang’s ecosystem.\nTopics covered in this course includes:\n\n\nInstalling Elixir\nDisplaying output\nElixir build tool\nApplication structure\nCreating a new elixir project\nReading from afile\nInjecting a file into elixir project\nCreating a custom task\nUsing elixir packages\nData types\nOperators\nusing Elixir Map\nVariables\nFunctions and Modules\nFiltering data\nSorting data",

You'll be equipped to tackle complex data-driven projects with confidence and finesse.\n\n\nAbout TClientDataSet\nThe TClientDataSet is a powerful and flexible data access component in Borland's (now Embarcadero's) Delphi development environment. It was introduced as part of Delphi 2, released in late 1995. The TClientDataSet allows your application to store and manipulate data locally on the client machine without needing to connect to a database server.\nHere are some key features and uses of the TClientDataSet:\nKey Features\nLocal Data Storage: It can store data locally, allowing your applications to work offline or with limited network connectivity.\nData Editing: It supports editing data in place within the dataset, making it suitable for applications where users need to update their own records directly.\nData Encryption and Password Protection: It supports encryption and password protection for added security when storing sensitive data locally.\nMulti-Tenant Support: Allows for multiple datasets (or \"tables\") to be stored in one file, which can be useful for applications that handle different users' data separately.\nSQL-Driven Operations: Supports SQL queries for fetching and manipulating data.\nUses\nOffline Capable Applications: Useful for creating desktop applications that don't require a constant internet connection but still want the ability to access, edit, or view local data.\nDatabase Prototyping: Because of its ease of use and flexibility, TClientDataSet is often used in prototyping phases where developers can quickly create mock databases to test their application's logic.\nData Migration Tools: It has been used as part of migration tools from older database systems to newer ones by providing a way to store data temporarily on the client for manipulation before being uploaded.\nArchitecture\nThe TClientDataSet works with other Delphi components, like DBGrid, DBNavigator, and DBEdit, to provide a user interface for managing its data. It also interacts with SQL-based services for fetching or modifying data, though it doesn't directly require database connectivity in the traditional sense.\nIn summary, the TClientDataSet offers an efficient way to manage local data within Delphi applications without needing server-side databases, making it useful for offline-capable apps and prototyping phases.",

Generics also provide compile-time type safety that allows programmers to catch invalid types at compile time. This reference will take you through simple and practical methods using Java Generics.\nThe Java Generics programming is introduced in J2SE 5 to deal with type-safe objects. It makes the code stable by detecting the bugs at compile time.\nBefore generics, we can store any type of objects in the collection, i.e., non-generic. Now generics force the java programmer to store a specific type of objects.\nIt would be nice if we could write a single sort method that could sort the elements in an Integer array, a String array, or an array of any type that supports ordering.\nJava Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify, with a single method declaration, a set of related methods, or with a single class declaration, a set of related types, respectively.\nGenerics also provide compile-time type safety that allows programmers to catch invalid types at compile time.\nUsing Java Generic concept, we might write a generic method for sorting an array of objects, then invoke the generic method with Integer arrays, Double arrays, String arrays and so on, to sort the array elements.",

In fact, it’s the only framework built into the Python standard library.\nThis Python framework provides an interface to the Tk toolkit and works as a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tk. The Tk toolkit is a cross-platform collection of ‘graphical control elements’, aka widgets, for building application interfaces.\nTkinter module provides Python users with a simple way to create GUI elements using the widgets found in the Tk toolkit. Tk widgets can be used to construct buttons, menus, data fields, etc. in a Python application. Once created, these graphical elements can be associated with or interact with features, functionality, methods, data or even other widgets.\nTkinter provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes used in a GUI application.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the C++ Programming for Beginners course by Uplatz.\n\n\nC++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. It gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. C++ is used everywhere, to develop literally anything, e.g. operating systems, web browsers, microcontrollers, video games, client-server applications, device drivers, embedded firmware, and so on.\nC++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming. C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object-oriented programming (OOPs) used in C++ viz. Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction. C++ is widely used now a days for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.\nSince C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc., this makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.\n\n\nIn essence, Standard C++ programming is divided into three important parts:\n\n\nThe core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.\nThe standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.\nThe Standard Template Library (STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.\n\n\nAdvantages of using C++\n\n\nC++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.\nC++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.\nC++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.\nC++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.\nC++ is fun and easy to learn!\nAs C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa\n\n\nThis C++ course will help you learn the fundamentals of programming in the C++ programming language, syntax, data types, iteration, decision branching, expressions, control statements, objects and classes, inheritance, constructor, destructor, this, static, polymorphism, abstraction, abstract class, interface, namespace, encapsulation, arrays, strings, exception handling, File IO, and so on. This C++ training provides knowledge of basic to advanced concepts of C++ programming language. The C++ course is designed for beginners as well as professionals.\n\n\nC++ Programming for Beginners - Course Syllabus\n\n\nIntroduction to C++ Programming\nDebugging Tools - Objects - Types - Values\nOperators - Expressions - Control Flow - Functions\nInput - Output - Classes\nTemporary Objects - Functors - Templates\nLambda Expressions - Classes - Inheritance\nVirtual Functions and Run-time Polymorphism\nContainers - Iterators - Algorithms - Templates\nTime Measurements - Exceptions - References\nSmart Pointers and References\nMoving - Forwarding - Concurrency\nMultithreads and Mutexes\nCondition Variables and Atomics\nAtomic Memory Models and Undefined Behavior\nBest Practices - Tips - Pitfalls in C++",

Which of the following statements about C arrays is true? Options:\nA) The size of arrays can be changed at runtime.\nB) Arrays in C can store multiple data types.\nC) The first index of an array in C is 1.\nD) Arrays in C are indexed starting from 0.\nAnswer: D) Arrays in C are indexed starting from 0.\nExplanation: In C programming, arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element of the array is accessed with index 0. Options A and B are incorrect because arrays in C have a fixed size determined at compile time and can only store elements of the same data type. Option C is also incorrect as it contradicts the zero-index nature of C arrays.\n3. What does the sizeof() operator in C return? Options:\nA) The size of the data type or variable in bytes.\nB) The number of elements in the array.\nC) The memory address of the variable.\nD) The length of a string.\nAnswer: A) The size of the data type or variable in bytes.\nExplanation: The sizeof() operator in C is used to determine the size, in bytes, of a data type or a variable. It is a compile-time unary operator and is often used to determine the memory allocation requirements for different data types. Options B, C, and D are incorrect as sizeof() does not return the number of elements in an array, the memory address, nor the length of a string.\n4. In C, if a function is called before its declaration, what will be the result? Options: A) The program will execute successfully.\nB) The program will fail during compilation.\nC) The function call will be treated as a syntax error.\nD) An implicit declaration of the function is assumed.\nAnswer: D) An implicit declaration of the function is assumed.\nExplanation: In C, if a function is called before it is declared, the compiler assumes an implicit declaration of that function with a return type of int. This can potentially lead to runtime errors if the actual function definition does not match the assumed declaration. However, it's considered good practice to declare functions before their use to avoid such issues. Options A, B, and C are incorrect in the context of standard C behavior.\n5. What is the purpose of the return 0; statement in a C program? Options:\nA) It terminates the program immediately.\nB) It indicates that the program executed successfully.\nC) It returns control to the operating system.\nD) All of the above.\nAnswer: B) It indicates that the program executed successfully.\nExplanation: In C programming, the return 0; statement at the end of the main function indicates successful execution of the program. By convention, returning 0 signals to the operating system that the program completed without errors. While it does mark the end of the main function and returns control to the operating system, option D is not entirely accurate as the primary purpose is to indicate success rather than immediate termination or control transfer, which are side effects.\nEnroll Now and Transform Your C Programming Skills!\nEmbark on this comprehensive journey through C programming.

      "description": "Welcome,\nObject-oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\nClass: The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.\nFor Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brand but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc. So here, Car is the class and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.\nA Class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member functions.\nData members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables and together these data members and member functions define the properties and behaviour of the objects in a Class.\nIn the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage etc and member functions can apply brakes, increase speed etc.\nWe can say that a Class in C++ is a blue-print representing a group of objects which shares some common properties and behaviours.\nThis class is intended to teach you how to pick up speed in OOP with C++.",

Your compiler will be able to compile the C programming language.\nThis course does not rely on any frameworks we do everything from scratch to ensure the best possible learning experience for students\n\n\nModule 2\nIn module 2 of this course we create a code generator that produces 32 bit Intel assembly language that can then be passed through an assembler to produce a program binary that we can run. We also in this module create a resolver system which is responsible for taking a complicated expression such as \"a->b.c.e[50] = 50\" and breaking it down into simple steps and rules that our code generator can then easily follow. This abstraction is essential to ensure that the code generator does not become over complex.

      "description": "Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialised for any specific problems.\nOften, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.\nThe Main topic that we will cover in this course are:\nWe cover a wide variety of topics, including:\nWhat is Python\nPrinting out our first python program\nComments\nVariables\nDatatypes\nOperators\nTypecasting\nInputs Statements\nStrings\nLists\nDictionary\nConditional Statements\nFor Loops\nWhile Loops\nBreak Statement\nContinue Statement\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

We also have videos explaining why we chose the various answers. Some of the questions might require a bit of research before attempting to answer.\nWe start with questions about time and space complexity (Big O), then look at memory efficiency in Java. We then examine Lists in detail, considering when to use which one. We also look at how to sort lists and how to write good Comparators.\nIn our next section, we look at sets, both sorted and unsorted.\nWe then focus on how the hashing mechanism has changed over the years.\nOur next section looks at maps, considering both thread-safe and non-thread-safe implementations. We also look at some highly specialized maps.\nWe then ask questions about queues, blocking queues and deques, before ending with some questions about the facades Collections and Arrays.\nEach of the questions has a detailed video walkthrough tutorial, so that if you get an answer wrong, you can examine the video and see what the issue was.\nThe best strategy is to start by doing the practice questions, so that you can see where your strengths and weaknesses are. Focus on the weaknesses and watch the tutorials and do a bit of research, then do the test again to see if you have improved in your understanding.\nWe have made the pass mark deliberately high at 95%, in order to motivate you to get stuck in and learn the data structures well.\nGood luck!\nHeinz",

Options A, B, and D are incorrect as there are no statements such as DEFINE, CREATE, or ALLOCATE in JCL for dataset definition.\n\n\nQuestion 2: What is the purpose of the IF-THEN-ELSE construct in JCL?\nA) To define dataset attributes\nB) To perform conditional processing\nC) To specify job scheduling parameters\nD) To manage dataset disposition\nExplanation: Correct Answer: B) To perform conditional processing\nThe IF-THEN-ELSE construct in JCL is used for conditional processing, allowing the job to execute different sets of instructions based on specific conditions. It provides flexibility in job execution by enabling the execution of alternative job steps depending on whether certain conditions are met or not. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the purpose of the IF-THEN-ELSE construct in JCL.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Which utility is commonly used in JCL for sorting records within datasets?\nA) IDCAMS\nB) SORT\nC) IEBCOPY\nD) IEBGENER\nExplanation: Correct Answer: B) SORT\nThe SORT utility in JCL is commonly used for sorting records within datasets based on specified criteria such as key fields. It provides powerful sorting capabilities and can handle large volumes of data efficiently. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they refer to other utilities used for tasks such as dataset management, copying datasets, and generating data, respectively.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What does the COND parameter in JCL allow you to specify?\nA) Job priority\nB) Job class\nC) Condition code for job termination\nD) Job execution time\nExplanation: Correct Answer: C) Condition code for job termination\nThe COND parameter in JCL allows you to specify a condition code that determines whether the job should be terminated or continued based on the completion status of preceding job steps. By defining conditional logic using the COND parameter, you can control the flow of job execution and handle different scenarios dynamically. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the purpose of the COND parameter in JCL.\n\n\nQuestion 5: Which JCL statement is used to execute a program or utility within a job step?\nA) EXEC\nB) RUN\nC) CALL\nD) START\nExplanation: Correct Answer: A) EXEC\nThe EXEC (Execute) statement in JCL is used to specify the program or utility to be executed within a job step. It is followed by the name of the program or utility to be invoked and may include additional parameters and options. The EXEC statement plays a crucial role in defining the sequence of job steps and executing various tasks within a JCL job. Options B, C, and D are incorrect as they do not represent valid JCL statements for program execution.\nThese sample practice test questions are designed to assess your understanding of key concepts and principles in JCL. By reviewing the explanations provided for each question, you'll not only test your knowledge but also gain insights into the rationale behind each answer. Keep practicing to strengthen your skills and ace your JCL interviews!\n\n\nEnroll now in the JCL Interview Questions Practice Test course and embark on a journey towards mastering the intricacies of Job Control Language.

This is a beginners' course covering Functional Programming with Python, not Object Oriented Programming. I will also give you a background in Computer History, Computer Ethiics and Computer Literacy.\n\n\nWe will also explore the inner workings of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and how it controls Input/Output (IO) devices and peripherals. We will investigate how the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) makes computations in Binary and how the Memory Unit (MU) stores information in Hexadecimal. We will also learn how the ALU performs Boolean Logic and Logical Comparisons.\n\n\nI hope to give you as close an experience as possible to the experience you would have if you took this course with me in my own classroom at the college! I've been teaching High School and College Math, Physics and Computer Science for over 30 years. I recently retired from High School teaching and would like to share my experience beyond the classroom. So, you're in luck as I am currently converting my College Introduction To Computer Science class into this new format for the Udemy platform.\n\n\nHope you learn a lot!\n\n\nEnjoy and Be Well,\nProfessor Garcia\naka MrG",

This process becomes more interesting when you have limited resources available. One such programming language is V. V is relatively new programming language which is rapidly becoming popular because of its simplicity, readability and maintainability.  Apart from this V is said to be one of the fasted language available on the earth. So, undoubtfully V programming language (popularly known as Vlang) will make a big impact in IT industry in future. But as I mention very less resources are available for Vlang if you are keen to learn it. This course will be certainly one of the best resources to learn Vlang.\nThis  extensive 'Learn V programming' comes with 50+ videos. The course starts with setting up the V environment and in later stages it also covers the other aspects like control statements, functions, arrays, modules, structures etc. It is in fact a journey from beginner to expert for the student. And guess what, you need to have only basic knowledge of any programming language to understand every concept of this course.\nDuring this course  I have covered :\nSetting the environment for V\nUsing symlink and REPL\nVariables and constants\nWorking with control statements\nUser-defined functions\nSingle dimensional and multi-dimensional array\nStructures\nUser-defined modules\nPre-defined modules\n\n\nAfter completing this course, you will certainly able to write the code in Vlang.

It includes topics such as understanding what exceptions are, how to handle them using try-except blocks, and how to raise custom exceptions. Additionally, the course explores the use of built-in exception classes and how to create user-defined exception classes. The course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of exception handling in Python and enhance their ability to write robust and reliable code.\n\n\nteaching students how to handle and manage exceptions in Python programming. Students will learn about different types of exceptions, error handling techniques, and how to write robust and resilient code by effectively handling various error scenarios. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of exception handling best practices and be equipped to write more reliable and efficient Python programs.\n\n\nIn Python, exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. They are used to handle exceptional situations that may disrupt the normal flow of a program. When an exception occurs, it can be caught and handled using try-except blocks. This allows for graceful error handling and enables the program to continue running without terminating abruptly. By using exceptions, developers can anticipate and handle different types of errors and ensure that their programs can handle unexpected situations smoothly.",

We explain how OWD settings determine the baseline level of access users have to records they don't own. This segment helps you understand how to set these defaults to Private, Public Read Only, or Public Read/Write, depending on your organizational needs.\n\n\nRole Hierarchy and its Impact:\nDive deeper into the Role Hierarchy, a crucial component that allows you to automatically grant record access to users higher in the hierarchy than the record owner. Our tutorial clarifies how to configure and optimize role hierarchies to ensure efficient and secure access across different levels of your organization. Implementing Sharing Rules: Explore Sharing Rules, which allow you to extend sharing access beyond the Org Wide Defaults for specific users or groups. We provide practical examples and step-by-step instructions on setting up criteria-based and ownership-based sharing rules, enhancing collaboration without compromising data security.\n\n\nManual Sharing Explained: Learn about Manual Sharing, a flexible tool for granting one-off access to records. This section is perfect for situations where exceptions to the regular sharing model are needed, such as providing temporary access to users or teams for specific business processes.\n\n\nApex Sharing for Developers: For developers, understanding Apex Sharing is vital. This part of the tutorial focuses on using Apex managed sharing to programmatically share records when declarative sharing options fall short. We cover the basics of writing Apex sharing reasons and share records, crucial for custom functionality.\n\n\nNavigating Restriction and Scoping Rules:\nLastly, get to grips with Restriction Rules and Scoping Rules. These advanced features control which records are visible to users, based on conditions or criteria, further fine-tuning data visibility and ensuring that users see only the data relevant to them.\n\n\nOur comprehensive tutorial is designed with clear explanations and visual aids to ensure that whether you are a beginner or an experienced professional, you can effectively implement and manage Salesforce Sharing Settings. Whether you're looking to enhance data security, streamline data access, or understand the nuances of Salesforce's complex sharing mechanisms, this video has everything you need.

Whether you have zero programming experience or just want to strengthen your basics, this course walks you step-by-step through all the essential concepts you need to write, run, and understand C programs.\nWe start with the basics of setting up your coding environment, ensuring you’re ready to compile and execute your first program without confusion. You’ll learn the structure of a simple C program, including keywords, comments, and the classic “Hello, World!” example, giving you a strong starting point in programming.\nFrom there, we move into variables, data types, and naming rules, teaching you how to store, handle, and manipulate different kinds of data in your programs. You’ll understand how to write clean and error-free code by following proper naming conventions.\nNext, we explore input and output in C, focusing on functions like printf() and scanf(). You’ll learn format specifiers (placeholders) and how they relate to different data types. To ensure mastery, there’s a dedicated hands-on practice section where you’ll complete coding exercises using these functions in real scenarios.\nWe then progress into conditional logic—the decision-making backbone of programming. You’ll understand the if statement, if-else blocks, the else-if ladder, and the switch statement. Multiple exercises are included to help you apply logic in solving real problems.\nThe course also covers ASCII values in C, helping you understand the relationship between characters and their numerical representations, which is useful in data processing tasks. You’ll also learn escape characters for formatting output, such as creating tabs, new lines, and other text effects in your programs.\nThroughout the course, you’ll benefit from:\nStep-by-step explanations with simple examples.\nHands-on exercises to apply what you learn.\nPreview-enabled lectures so you can try before you enroll.\nA downloadable C Programming Cheat Sheet summarizing syntax, functions, and concepts for quick reference.\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nBe able to write, compile, and debug basic C programs.\nUnderstand core programming concepts like variables, data types, input/output, and conditional logic.\nHave the confidence to move on to advanced C programming topics or transition to other languages like C++, Java, or Python.\nIf you’re ready to start coding in C from scratch, build problem-solving skills, and lay a strong foundation for your programming career, this course is for you.",

The concept of this course is to take more of a 'classroom' approach to teaching and hopefully encourage you to practice and learn with me as we make our way through the course material together.\nThe course is centred around the Lua programming language and the Love2D framework. Lua is a great beginner language to get started with as it is a lot simpler and more straight-forward than other languages.\nThe course structure is basically that we jump straight into making stuff and explain concepts as we come across them. After we make our first game together, we go back and clarify some concepts. I have taken this approach because a criticism I have of most programming tutorials that I've come across is that they overwhelm you with out-of-context theory at the start before actually doing anything fun. With my model, we immediately make something tangible and then go back and talk about the theory, but since we've already used it in a meaningful way, the theory and concepts will make a lot more sense and will be enjoyable to learn about!",

Arrow Functions? Of course. Rest/Spread Operator? Included! And every other new piece of syntax!\nMastering ES6 syntax can get you a position in web development or help you build that personal project you've been dreaming of. It's a skill that will put you more in demand in the modern web development industry, especially with the release of modern web frameworks like React and Angular 2.\nThis course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build applications using each new piece of Javascript syntax introduced with ES6.\nWe'll start by mastering the fundamentals of iteration over Arrays using helpers like 'forEach', 'map', and 'reduce'.  After an introduction to Array helpers, we'll dive right in to advanced ES6, covering topics like enhanced object literals, default function arguments, and classes.  Every topic includes multiple live code exercises to ensure you understand each new concept.\nIf you are new to Javascript or ES6, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the Javascript course for you! To learn ES6 you have to understand it and comprehend exactly why each piece of syntax was added to the language\nLearn the purpose of Babel and why ES6 was created\nMaster the process of refactoring your current ES5 code into super-charged ES6\nGrasp the difference between the 'rest' and 'spread' operators\nDevelop complex applications that scale in complexity by mastering advanced ES6 design patterns\nDive deeper into iteration using generators.  No fancy terms required!\nI've built the course that I would have wanted to take when I was learning ES6. A course that explains the concepts and how they're implemented in the best order for you to learn and deeply understand them.",

Whether its Elm that introduced the Model View Update pattern which inspired React's Redux and  Angular's ngrx architecture or Haskell that introduced us to Maybe and Either which influenced Rust, functional concepts are becoming more common.\n\n\nHowever, in order to understand these advanced concepts, you need a solid foundation to build upon which is what we'll be tackling in this course. By tackling the Mars Rover kata, you'll get hands-experience with the three core concepts of functional programming.\n\n\nImmutability - Removing complexity by reducing where data can change\nFunctions - Removing complexity by reducing what functions can do, ensuring that they're easier to understand\nComposition - Building new functions by composing existing functions\nBy learning immutability, you learn how to arrange your code so that you don't have to track as much state in your application, reducing your troubleshooting time.\nBy learning what functions are, you'll learn how to spot pure functions (e.g., those that are easy to test/troubleshoot) and how to minimize the amount of business rules in the impure functions (e.g., those that are hard to test)\nWith these two concepts in hand, you'll learn how you can take existing functions and combine them into new functions, gaining re-usability.\n\n\nIf you're interested in functional programming but not sure where to start, then this course is for you!",
