      "description": "In order to create messages (for business-to-business sales) that compel the prospect to take action, you need to first understand the compelling business priorities for your prospects, and then align your messages and conversations to those priorities.\nPerformance Metrics and Key Performance Indicators or KPIs can be a great way to learn about your prospects business priorities, the issues they really care about, and the targets that keep them awake at night.\nIn the first part of the course, you will learn the two main categories of Metrics and KPIs, used within most organisations, and a few quick and easy ways to learn the ones that will be relevant to your target prospects. Then, you will learn a simple three step exercise that can help to identify the specific metrics and KPIs that can be connected to the value of your solutions.\nOnce these metrics and KPIs are identified, you will have one of the two components needed for a compelling sales message. For the second component, you will need some information from your existing customers. So, you will learn a very specific conversation framework, to capture that second component.\nIn the final part of course, you will learn how to package all of the newly discovered information and use it effectively at every stage of the sales process:\nHow to use this information during prospecting… in a way that it leaves the prospect wanting to find out more.\nThen, at the initial meeting, how to use this information to systematically quantify the impact of the prospects current situation.\nWhen it comes to presentations, how to use this information tactfully in order to lower the prospects reluctance to change.\nAnd finally, how this information can be used to create a strong and credible business case that makes your solution… a ‘no-brainer’.\nIn short… by the end of this course, you will have learnt... how top sales professionals are able to open more doors and close more sales.\nSo… let's get started!",

These professionals automate sales results and get their process down to a science.\nIf you're here, it means you want to close more deals, land more qualified leads, and make more sales. Guess what? The things you learned yesterday probably won't apply for much longer: B2B sales is being massively disrupted by technology. It's time to get ahead of the curve...\nYou might be wondering:\n-How do I close B2B lead opportunities?\nRest easy! You'll learn the whole process from first contact, to qualification, to close.\n-I have virtually no experience in B2B Sales. How do I drastically increase my value in a short amount of time?\nCheck! I fell into the sales world with no experience, and I struggled for a while. Within a year, I figured out how to achieve six-figure results. You'll learn from my experience while avoiding my pitfalls (learn more about me below).\n-How can entrepreneurs successfully outsource B2B lead generation?\nDon't sweat it! By the end, you'll know how to use VA's and other freelancers to deliver qualified leads on a silver platter. You'll learn a step-by-step process that takes 30 days or less.\n-What are the best tools and services for generating high-quality B2B leads and sales?\nGlad you asked! You'll learn about dozens of apps and resources that only the most savvy B2B sales professionals know about. Plus, you'll get exclusive access to my very own spreadsheet tools.\nLearn the B2B sales strategy that won us business with 16 Fortune 500s. We went from 0 to $1.4 Million. As the first employee and Senior Account Manager at IdeaRocket, a startup that creates explainer videos for businesses, I was thrown into the world of sales with no experience. After floundering for a while, I realized I needed to change my game. I studied intensively, applied new technologies and tools, and practiced through hundreds of calls and outreach opportunities.\nWithin a year, I tripled the sales of our 2-person company, bringing increase of $282,188. I won business with big companies like Electronic Arts, Verizon, and Bank of America, as well as successful tech startups like Venmo. After hiring a junior colleague, we achieved $1.4M in revenue by the time I departed in late 2014. Now I write books, create courses, and practice sales strategies on an entrepreneurial basis.\nIf you follow these lessons and take action, I'm confident you'll be on your way to joining the modern sales elite. Among other major benefits, this means generating a continuous flow of leads, sales, and fat commissions.\nAs a friendly reminder, this is a no-risk course. It comes with a 30-day, no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.\nSee you inside,\nDan",

      "description": "Uzo Akotaobi, Director, Human Resources at Comcast, said:\n\n\"I took Gustavo's course about Customer Success and found it to be the single most valuable resource I tapped into when pursuing a career in this space. The reason for that is because Gustavo was able to explain the science of customer success in such a way to where you could look at your own experience whether it was in Customer Success or not and find ways to translate it to a resume. This helped me tailor my resume to Customer Success jobs in ways I didn't think to do otherwise. I can attest to the fact that after I took the course on Customer Success and revised my resume, recruiters responded more frequently. No joke! 3 different companies contacted me over the course of 3 weeks vs. NONE before. My background is in HR so I was looking at Customer Success roles in the HR technology space. Gustavo was easy to understand and the content was insightful. There is no silver bullet but if you take his course and really try to understand how your experience translates to Customer Success, there is no way you won't benefit from this course. I know I did and I got the interviews and job OFFER to prove it!  \"\n\n\nWhat is a Customer Success Manager?\nIn the digital age, tons of new jobs have sprung up. Most people think of computer programming, website design or software integration, but what about the human side? The Customer Success Manager is one such job.\nTo sum it up in one sentence: This job is simply helping customers accomplish their goals with the software or service they purchased.\nFor any business, client retention is huge. It costs a company way less to keep a customer than to acquire a new one, and even more costly is to try and win that customer back. That's where this job comes in. If they have a complaint, you take care of it. If they succeed, you celebrate with them. You get to build long-term relationships with the clients, and as the client's needs adapt and change, you get to assist them in that process.\n\n\nBenefits of working as a Customer Success Manager\nLet's start with Salary. According to Payscale the average salary for an Entry-Level Customer Success Manager is $59,619 per year and $69,210 when you are past Entry-level and can reach into the 6 figure range for those who excel at this position.\nMore and more companies are seeing the incredible opportunities this type of job can provide. Startups and tech companies are leading the way, both big and small, and this field of work is only growing bigger.\nAnd let's not forget perks. Because a lot of these jobs are at tech and startup companies, often they have great employee benefits such as:\nGreat health care coverage, and even gym memberships.\nAmazing offices, with plenty of recreational activities around.\nOften they will match your 401(K).\nFree snacks, free catered lunches every day… some even free beer.\nHappy hours or cocktail afternoons.\nCompany trips, dinners, events.\nFlexible hours and unlimited vacations.\nRemote work.\nAnd of course: equity.\nIf you consider all of the benefits, the salary, and how dynamic this position is, it definitely makes sense to invest a few dollars in a course that will help you learn about and prepare for this growing job opportunity.\n\nEnroll now, and I'll see you on the inside.",

Start A Passive Income Tshirt Brand on Etsy Udemy Course Workbook uploaded\nJune 2020 - Update - Section 4: Researching for Designs\n\n\nAre you ready to start generating a passive income? Are you interested in launching your clothing brand? Have you heard about the hundreds of millions of dollars Etsy is bringing in every year for the platform's sellers, and you want in on that action? If you've answered yes to any of these questions, this is the perfect course for you.\nFor a few years straight, I spent a lot of time researching different ways of generating passive income online. Believe me, there are a ton, but the problem is, most of them only bring in nickels and dimes, and I'm looking to make dollars. I started getting frustrated until I came across a print-on-demand and dropshipping business model.\nAs a graphic artist, I figured I would still have to work hard to create images to place on t-shirts and other products. I was wrong; I discovered that there is plenty of low-cost and free resources that offer commercial licenses so I can use them to streamline my product creation.\nThen I needed to figure out how to get noticed...well, I had to learn that the hard way too. After a year of experimenting, I finally found the keys to making consistent sales on Etsy while only putting in about an hour of effort per week.\nThis course will bring together all of my accumulated research and development into a shiny little package for you. Not only that, but I will also share with you how I am currently scaling my store up from generating around $40 per week in revenue to hundreds per day!\nThis course is designed for beginners who have little to no experience with print on demand and dropshipping on Etsy but if you are intermediate with this topic, here are a few things you may take away from this course:\nHow much can you really make by letting things run fully automated vs. how much you need to manually intervene to scale up.\nHow to get started with SEO and understanding a couple of misconceptions that you may be practicing with your tags.\nHow to use vector graphic design software to put together designs using pre-rendered assets.\nHow to use Etsy's built-in marketing tools, such as ads, sales, and email followups.\nWhat items to add right after t-shirts that are proven to sell.\nWhy start with Etsy rather than Amazon Merch.\nI have also completed a workbook that I will be updating from time to time as the market changes. Please use the workbook as your cheat sheet and Etsy store planner.\n\n\nWhat is NOT covered in the course:\nMy goal with this course is just to get you started. You could stop after taking this course, but I recommend diving deeper into some of the topics I cover. Here are some things I may touch on but won't dive deep into.\nAdvance SEO and marketing analyses\nMarketing (buying ads) on social media\nAdvance graphic design techniques\nI look forward to teaching you all that I know!",

      "description": "The Painless Negotiation is an interactive course that addresses one of the critical pressure points in closing any B2B Deal - and that is the \"Negotiation.\" Throughout the course you will be applying new concepts to YOUR real Negotiation.\nToo often we view the Negotiation as a single event that occurs when we are \"across the table\" from the Customer (perhaps Procurement), when in reality we should have been Negotiating throughout the entire sales campaign. To make matters worse, we are typically not prepared to negotiate and this \"event\" is happening late in the sales cycle in a \"crisis mode.\" These are two things that Procurement Professionals are counting on and will exploit to their advantage. This often results in long drawn out negotiations that are painful at best, but usually result in bad Deals and/or slipped Deals.\nIn this course, you will learn how to:\nIdentify the four Common Negotiation Mistakes (and how to avoid them)\nEnsure you are aiming at a Great Deal for yourself and the Customer (after all, who wants an average Deal?)\nManage the always challenging Internal Negotiation within your Company (it's often the toughest part)\nDetermine which side really has the Power in any Negotiation (so you don't give too much away)\nSet up the \"\"Right Negotiation\" (it's always easier to negotiate when you're negotiating the right things)\nNegotiate the \"Right Way\" (increases the odds of closing a Great Deal and solidifies the long-term relationship)\nDevelop a Negotiation Plan and manage Customer Negotiation Tactics (you know they're coming, so why not be ready for them?)\nAs you learn and apply these concepts your understanding of how to better sell and position deals will also increase.  And closing more deals, closing them faster and making them better deals is what makes the most successful salespeople!",

This is the 'Holy Grail' of selling tools and once you have done yours, you will wonder how you ever survived without it and\nYOU WILL USE IT FOR EVER\n.\nPlus, I'd like you to\nsend it to me\nso I can review it and make sure you have squeezed the most out of the course to maximise the benefit from your investment.\nLet me say right from the outset that there is no trickery or gimmick or 'secret formula' to B2B Selling Skills. It is good fundamental common sense logic that is used all around the world and the foundation of sales success in every industry.\nGo on, get into it and see what you will learn. I bet you are dying to find out what THE KILLER QUESTION is. When you start using it you will suddenly find out why your customers are going to buy (or not going to buy) and this information will shock you!\nIt is my wish to improve the selling skills of all salespeople with this course so that you can really enjoy your career in sales, take pride in being able to identify and satisfy your customers needs, and be able to make to make a profit out of it.\nProfit - It's not a dirty word.\nIf you don't make a profit out of your sales then everyone loses because\nnothing happens until somebody sells something!\nThink about this for a moment - it will give you an insight into my PASSION for sales.\nNo one designs anything, no one manufacturer's anything, no one ships anything, no one receipts anything, no one warehouses anything, no one counts anything, no one invoices anything, or analysis it, credits it, guarantees it or delivers it or gets paid for anything\nuntil somebody sells it.\nEVERYONE ELSE'S JOBS DEPEND ON YOU SELLING SOMETHING!\nIt all starts with you.\nSo I think that's a pretty good reason for you to do this course.\n(plus it's fun).\nWhat do you think?",

Having to sell something does not have to cause you fear and discomfort. Not only can selling be something that you enjoy, it can be a highly profitable activity.\nLook, the truth is: the lack of success that most encounter with selling has nothing to do with being an introvert or an extrovert, but instead is simply the absence of learning a few basic principles.\nThis course lays out the foundation of what it takes in order to succeed in selling ANY product or service in ANY industry. Grant demystifies what selling really is and how in fact, every person on the planet is a salesperson, regardless of their job title or profession.\nContrary to what some say, people are not “born\" salespeople. Selling is a skill that can be learned, developed, and mastered. This course will set you down the path to increased sales, higher levels of confidence, and more motivation as you approach prospective clients of your products or services in the marketplace.\nThis course will teach you:\nWhat the MOST important sale you will ever make is\nThe difference between the PROS and the amateurs in sales\nThe 1st and MOST important rule of selling\nThe ONLY reason you won't like selling… and it's not what you think\nWhy price is a MYTH\nHow to develop a million dollar sales attitude\nHow to predict what the customer will say before they actually say it\nWhat the 90 day phenomenon is and how to avoid it\nHow to MASTER time\nHow to identify your easiest sale\nWho your powerbase is and how to sell to them\nThe EXACT amount of effort for you to see success in selling\nThe MOST successful strategy to use when a customer wants a discount\nAnd find out who the most important person in the world REALLY is",

      "description": "Customer Service: Delight Your Customers with Customer Care\nMaster Customer Service - delight your customers using great customer care and benefit from lifelong loyalty and referrals\n\n\nDo your customers LOVE you? Do they rave to their friends about what a great company you are? Would they ever consider switching to a competitor? Do they always leave your premises happy and well cared for? You might think this is a faraway dream, too expensive to achieve, or simply impossible for a product/business like yours….But guess what - it’s not! Customer Service can make all of those goals come true, and doesn’t need to cost you anything except creativity and passion.\n\n\nAmazingly there are almost no official theories, tools or frameworks out there talking about Customer Care. For me it’s one of the most powerful and underestimated marketing, sales and leadership areas. So, I have created a step by step course you can use to come up with original, cost effective and unique ways to delight every customer and have them coming back to you time after time. Imagine if all your customers became repeat clients, and referred you to others many times over? You could fire your whole sales and marketing team! In my experience, most employees genuinely want to do a good job and make customers happy, but often don’t have the tools or empowerment to make it a reality. This course fixes that with simple, tried and tested ideas that have been working for decades.\n\n\nOver my 20 year management coaching career I've seen thousands of businesses... and I've pinpointed all the ways they could improve their customer service! The challenge with Customer Service is you need to be constantly ahead of your competitors and offering something unique and special to delight the customer. If you don't already have fresh Customer Service ideas popping up on a daily basis I’d highly recommend taking this course. It will allow you to build a loyal fanbase of customers who would never dream of spending their money elsewhere... and that could multiply your revenues many times over!\n\n\nChris Croft is an international speaker, and widely published author, who's been teaching Customer Service to companies for over 20 years. He's taught all over the world, as well as online, and has an entertaining and practical teaching style. This course is guaranteed to keep you engaged and amused, and teach you life-changing skills for home and work.\n\n\nThe course overview includes:\nThirty unique ways to create Customer Care delights\nProvide incredible service even with zero industry experience\nMotivate your employees to go over and above\nHighlight missed opportunities to delight customers\nTurn every customer into a lifelong fan\nBenefit from repeat sales, upselling and referrals\nAnd as always it's 100% practical, and with no technical jargon.\nAnd lots lots more!\nBy becoming great at Customer Service, not only will you benefit from customers never switching to a competitor, but you'll also have made your company thousands in referral and repeat sales!\n\n\nThis course comes with a 30 day money back guarantee",

When you start to pay attention to how PEOPLE buy, how PEOPLE make decisions, and what motivates PEOPLE to change, your sales career will take a massive step forward.\nI built this course to teach you how to sell in a way that's not only better for the people you’re selling to but also better for you as the salesperson. A way that you can sell without being shady, or tricking your prospect just to secure the close. A way that makes sure there's a great outcome for everyone.\nI've collected a lot of knowledge throughout my career, and I want to share that with you. I've built and led teams with hundreds of sales reps and generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. I've been fortunate enough to be named an InsideSales Top 10 Sales Leader, LinkedIn Top Sales Voice 2020, Sales Development Exec of the Year in 2018, and one of the 100 Top Sales Coaches to Watch. And all of that is great. But more importantly, it means that what my teams and I have done and continue to do WORKS.\nIn this course, you'll:\nFoster the right mindset to confidently reach your sales goals\n\nUse methods of influence to lead your prospect to the best outcome\n\nUnderstand your prospect and the problems they're trying to solve\n\nExecute immaculate discovery to set yourself up for success\n\nPerfect your demo/pitch to make them want what you're selling\n\nGet buy-in and agreement to close productive next steps\n\nConduct world-class follow up that makes it easy for your prospect to buy\n\nHandle common objections and deflections with tried and true techniques\nWhat's great is that ALL of this can be done REMOTELY, given the times we're in. I've also included a few tips specific to selling remotely when you're not able to be in the same room as your prospect.\nNow, in order to see results, you're going to have to put in the work. Don't just watch this course and call it a day. Every step of the way, I want you to put these techniques into practice. I want you to take a good look at the way you sell and figure out what could be better. How could you improve? Incorporate the things you learn in this course and you will see results.\nI know for a fact you can be incredibly successful in sales and not have to sell your soul to do so. If you're ready to improve the way you sell, and do it the RIGHT way, join me in this course!",

      "description": "This course looks at the basics of Great Customer Service and how that can lead to greater success for your business with less reliance on paid advertising and marketing.  We look at the definition of Customer Service, the different outcomes that great service or poor service can lead to, and some simple ideas and examples to help you start thinking about how you can improve the service to your customers and prospective customers.\nThe course starts with an examination of what customer service means, we then look at the outcomes of great service vs poor service before moving on to some basic golden rules and some thinking points for you to focus on.  We also look at what happens when things go wrong, and why simply offering a refund is not always the best way of handling a tricky situation - how do you take a customer complaint and turn it into a way to build better relationships with your customers?  Service should be at the very heart of your business, it's something that is 100% in your control.  We look at and test your Moments of Truth and find out what they mean to your customers.\nThis is a conversational course at a beginner level which may also be worth revisiting for more experienced professionals.  It's my hope that everybody comes away from this with at least one thing that they take on and use for the rest of their career and that by improving your service you develop yourself as well as your businesses.\nI hope you enjoy the course....remember.....the key to great service is consistency!\n\n\nWhat did people who have taken this course had to say? :-\n\"This is so amazing because you end up with important skills on how to deal with different customers.\" - Oscar Niyitegeka\n\"Good logical reasoning..helped me gain knowledge\" - Sandesh Awachat1\n\"Simple and complete\" - Kristine Mendoza\n\"I really, really enjoyed this course.

CS is not merely about managing accounts or helping your customers out when they have problems. Your job is to make sure customers get what they need from your product in the way they need it.

Whether you're brand new to CS or experienced in the field, this course can help you identify new approaches to support your customers' objectives.\nI'm your instructor, Lincoln Murphy, and I invented Customer Success. Okay, I didn't invent it, but I helped make Customer Success what it is today. From writing THE book on the subject to speaking at events around the world, most people that are in Customer Success have either learned directly from me or from someone sharing my ideas. But I don't just talk about this stuff, I actually do it, too. I've worked with hundreds of companies of all shapes and sizes around the world. And while I've helped them, I've also learned from them.\nAnd some of what I've learned, I'll share with you, including:\nWhy customer success matters to your company, your customers, and you\nWhat customer success is and isn't\nThe concept of the desired outcome, and how to help your customers achieve theirs\nThe success milestones and joint accountabilities that your customers must go through to succeed\nThe idea of a success potential checklist to identify good and bad-fit customers\nThe root causes of churn that you can eliminate to make it a non-issue\nUsing customer success as a growth engine\nHow to measure success for yourself and your customers\nHow to position customer success correctly for your customers and colleagues\nThroughout this course, I've provided exercises to put concepts into practice immediately. To get the most out of this course, don't just listen to me talk - apply what you're learning to YOUR customers. I highly recommend you pause to do these exercises along the way, and download the templates to use on the job.\nIf you're ready help your customers stay longer, do more, and advocate for you, join me in this course today!",

      "description": "Are you nervous about selling products & services online or off?\nDo you feel that some people don't take you seriously enough or that you don't have the much-needed confidence?\nAre you happy with your income? Are there missed opportunities slipping through your fingers that you don't know about?\nIf you want to drastically improve your sales success then you've come to the right place.\nThese testimonials sum up what this course can do for you:\n\n\nScott Jackson\nIn this course on sales Desmond points out some very enlightening information. I have been in outside sales for a number of years and thought I was an old hat at it. He showed me that and \"old dog can learn new tricks\" with his training and new insights on this course. His delivery keeps me very interested in the subject matter and I seem to be able to remember it even better. Everyone is in sales no matter what you are doing so this course can be a benefit to anyone who needs to improve their sales skills. Even if you are just trying to get a date, job, promotion, talk your partner into going out to dinner - this course if for you!\nDesmond's training is spot on. He has a style that is easy to understand and learn from. So don't hesitate - get this course and you will have a better grasp of sales!\n\n\nJennifer Johnson\nCalling all entrepreneurs, salespeople, career driven people, and anyone looking to boost their productivity! This class provides you with actionable methods to understand how your potential customers think, what tools you can use to hook them with the unexpected, and how to lead them to the proverbial water most effectively, rather than forcing them to drink. Instructor Desmond Bryam introduces concrete techniques for pitching to clients and investors, what you need to become awesome at public speaking (which we all need), and how to close the sale. I’m not a salesperson, but this course taught me how to pitch myself in career settings (after all, we have to be selling our skills and framing ourselves the best we can in order to snag that job or promotion), as well as boost my productivity at work with hacks such as the pomodoro technique, and how to set “mini habits” for success. Desmond is a phenomenal speaker and teacher, and he truly practices what he preaches. I highly recommend this course, and encourage you to learn from the best!\n\n\n\n\nA Little About My Experience:\n\nI started my first sales company when I was 15 years old & I already had a team working for me at that time (we sold embroidered polo shirts)\nBy age 22 I owned a full-time investment agency (Doyle Wealth Financial) with my own team.\nBut my age & shyness were always a factor. Being taken seriously & being assertive enough to demand the authority that I deserved in each industry was a problem for me.\nThe answer came when I discovered Neuro-Scientific research that pointed to why we all do what we do & think how we think.\nThese ideas gave me the confidence to overcome the unknown because it shined a bright light on everything that I needed to know to own the sales world.\nHave you ever learned something about a topic that once seemed so terrifying, and then when you understood it all, you sort of laughed at yourself for fearing it all this time?\nWell that's exactly what happened to me & what will happen to you once you learn the killer system in this very course.\nI developed this proven method in order to now share with you what led to my success so early on.\nThe Close More Sales Method (Years In The Making) Is Backed By Science & Proven Results:\nLearn This One Thing That Gets Everyone's Attention (Fast)\nCreate Your Own Inner Value Proposition\nGather Specific Intelligence To Present Like A Pro\nGet Real-Time Insights About Your Prospect\nWork With Screeners, Gatekeepers, And Assistants\nPerfect Your Opening & Closing Statements\nMinimize Resistance\nGet A Commitment For The Next Action\nStay Motivated\nAnd Much, Much More!\n\n\nYou are going to learn the rock-solid neuroscience & psychology behind these unstoppable sales techniques.\nI’ve learned over time that those who truly want to succeed in sales, for the longterm & for many years to come, are those that know the value of a good reputation & trust, plus they aren’t lazy, they actually want to succeed & make a good living off of helping everyone win.\nThis course will teach you how to craft a true win-win-win scenario where first the customer wins by getting exactly what they want & the company wins by growing & you automatically win by getting paid for your results. The more you help everyone else win, the more you will win & this is a timeless method that will boost your career for a lifetime.\nHonesty never goes out of style in selling, but short gimmicks only last so long.\nI am going to show you how I was so frustrated in sales because I was being so honest with my customers but still not selling as much as I could have, I was barely making it.\nThen I discovered that honesty & trust needed one more critical key added to it in order to become the ultimate selling machine.\nAfter learning these simple ideas (all backed by science & proven results) I was then able to work part time hours & earn the same (or more) commissionable income than the top agents in my firm who worked fulltime hours!\nI found those critical pieces that were missing, what we all desire & what specific pieces of information mean the most to us & help us feel good & secure about our purchase. This drastically increased my success in sales.\nI am going to show you exactly what they are & how you can easily obtain these skills in your own career/pursuit/venture or project.\nIt's interesting how we all create a narrative based on what we think is important.  We see what we want to see. But just because you’re not looking at something…    doesn’t mean it’s not there. Learn the missing key to your sales success right here & right now.\nThis strategy kept working in every industry I moved on to, it was insane! This is because of a very fundamental fact, you are always selling to a human, robots don’t buy stuff.\nEven the most reasonable person is still a human & has feelings & emotions no matter how hard you think it is to find it in them. But they always have a direct route or channel to their emotion switch. We are all hardwired with that same exact switch.\nSome people's emotional switch might be a little harder to turn, you might have to put a little more effort into it, but its still there & I’ll show you how to find it & work with it so that both you & your customer truly win every single time.\nYour probably having the same exact doubt that I had: this works fine with person to person sales in the public, but working B2B is a different game all together.\nI thought the same exact thing too!\nAnd I was wrong, this method works even better!!!\nI found out that in bigger industries where selling to big companies is so important, the employees are even more desperate to be treated this way & to be truly understood even more so because everyone just sees them as one big company faceless company with no individuality.\nBut when you put a face on something it changes how you view it, even how you treat them. A study done with X-Ray technicians found that if you add a photo of the person to their folder, then the technician spends more time, gives more accurate & thorough findings & overall gives better quality. All they did was add a photo of the person to the chart. They put a face on them.\nI found a way to be unexpected & it worked so well that I used a presentation time & again that was just a restaurant menu template. The first time I used it was with an extremely hard to sell accountant who counted everything twice.\nAfter I delivered the presentation to the CEO & then again to the tight budgeted CFO, this simple presentation resulted in a six figure deal that lasted for years. I will show you how to the deliver like this.\nIf you want to learn how to close more sales & reach your full selling potential then this course is right for you.\nLet's take this journey together. I'll see you inside.",

      "description": "Sell in the Spirit of Service, seek to solve problems and build lasting relationships. This is Consultative Selling Skills,  the anxiety free way to sell million dollar contracts.\nSelling is an essential skill in our economy and for your personal development. To earn your full potential you must be able to sell your self, your ideas, your product or service. Consultative Selling reduces the anxiety of selling by focusing on shared problem-solving and building trusting relationships. Those who become partners or principles in professional service firms (consultants, lawyers, etc.) are those who bring in the business. This course describes exactly how to bring in high value contracts by building trusting relationships with clients. To succeed as an entrepreneur you must have the selling skills taught in this course.\nThe instructor was CEO and owner of a consulting firm for more than thirty years and sold multi-million dollar consulting contracts to companies like Shell Oil Company, Texaco, Honeywell, Merck, Coca-Cola, Bacardi, Corning, and others. He explains exactly how to build your own brand, establish credibility in the marketplace, build awareness, interest, and lasting relationships.\nTransactional selling is like a one-night date. Consultative Selling is like a marriage, a partnership with your clients, in which you share in identifying problems and co-creating solutions. Consultative Selling skills take you from the earning potential of a skilled professional in your field to the million dollar plus earning potential of a partner or business owner.\nThe topics covered include the following:\n1. How Do High Performing Sales People Behave? - A Study of the Stars. This is actual field research conducted by the instructor for a client on the dozen most successful sales people out of many hundreds selling for a major commercial truck manufacturer.\n2. The Process of Consultative Selling: The Antecedents that Lead to the Sale. The instructor describes the process of creating a \"sales funnel\" that starts with knowing your market, creating awareness, personal and company branding.\n3. The Consultative Conversation. This section describes the factors in \"likeability\", the process of dialogue (thinking together), problem solving models that enable you to immediately start adding value by helping the client diagnose their problems and co-create solutions that incorporate the features and benefits of your service or product. The instructor shares a detailed actual proposal of his consulting services that sold for more than a million dollars. He also shares a case study and suggest possible proof statements that enable the closing of the sale.\n4. Service the Sale: Many sales courses end with the famous \"close\". However, this instructor insists that the initial close of a contract is only the beginning of a relationship and describes the process of post sale service and quality control that leads to additional sales opportunities.\n5. The Essential Communication Skills: The final section of the course is training in the fundamental communication skills of asking open-ended questions, reflective listening, and expressing empathy that are essential to all quality relationships and are essential for Consultative Selling.\nThere is nothing theoretical about this course. It iis entirely based on the instructors many years as the principle rainmaker of a successful consulting firm.\nLarry Miller has more than three hundred thousand online students, eighteen courses, and numerous best selling courses. He has also published eleven books, two of which were on the NY Times Best Seller list.\nComments by previous students:\n\"The course exceeded my expectations, its content is of quality and delivered beautifully. I could start applying things that I have learned tomorrow morning and I probably will. Thank you!\" Andrei Nechifor\n\"Yes, Lawrence Miller explains everything in detail. Very good to know what to expect and why. Also, very informative with coaching and dealing with individual vs team performance. The lines are laid out pretty clearly. There was a lot of great material, including feedback and open-ended questions techniques that are definitely useful in coaching and management.\" Deanne Duncan\n\"An outstanding leader and an amazing teacher. This teacher transformed the way I am doing business. He made me by far a better business consultant and executive coach. All the respect and love for him. Once you take one of his courses, you will be addicted to his teachings and courses.\" Nabil El Hady\n\"This course is fantastic, and I say that as someone who is very familiar with lean. I'm now using this course as part of my consulting practice to help my clients learn lean management, quality improvement, and the kata of high performing teams. The quality of instruction is outstanding on every front, and all the more so considering the low cost at which it can be accessed here on Udemy (whether purchasing it for myself or for others who need the material). Larry, thank you for what you have created here. This is an excellent resource for the direct practitioner, as well as the coach/consultant who is seeking to help clients learn, implement, and master these methods. I truly appreciate what you've done.\" Josh White\n\"The course was very informative, with proper guidelines and activity involved to practice. Miller is awesome in explaining things with right choice of words. Thanks again.\" Divya\n\"I love it! is concise, easy to understand even for me. I am just a beginner, but the explanations are very clear. He is a great teacher! Although it is a lot of information I did really enjoyed this course. Lawrence is amazing.\" Maria Vargas Figueroa",

Stefan is also a great coach very helpful and always there to answer your questions and give feedback. This is a course you don't wanna miss out on so if I can give advice take this course right now.\"  - Ruben Freemantle\n\n\nCold calling is dead? What a lame marketing slogan. Every high ticket sale in the world is made either in person or over the phone. No matter how effective your digital marketing is to bring you in great leads, in the end, you and your team need to pick up the phone and close them.\nBy taking this cold calling course, you will become a master in cold calling by\nBeing confident on the phone and knowing\nknowing what to say\nknowing how to say it\nknowing when to say it\nYou will learn a complete sales process and which tonalities to use. Sales is in the end a game of certainty and the transference of that emotion to others.\nThe system in this cold calling course is partly based on the teaching my mentor, the Wolf of Wall Street has taught me over the years. It contains the secrets that made his broker firm (in)famous in the 90s.\nThe cold calling course is different from others as it focuses not just on what to say, but how to say it. The focus is on hard skills and techniques rather than the inner game of sales.\n\"Its a Great Course and the way Stefan explain its Just on point.\" - Oscar Antonio Linarte Fernandez\nHave you ever bought an online course and not went through with it?\nIf so, this is most likely not your fault but the fault of the person putting it together. This cold calling course is different as it is based on the latest NLP research of how to keep attention high and make learning easy. The material is different from other courses in 7 distinct ways\nAudiovisual summaries at the end of each segment supported by brain waves to create ideal stickiness of content\nDifferent teaching styles and locations to keep the content light and easily digestible\nLoads of quizzes and supporting documents so that it adapts to your learning style\n\n\nStories to make the information sticky\nMotivational messages in-between to keep you jacked up and full of energy\nTechniques are based on world class sales gurus and have been tested and applied by simple people\n\n\n24/7 access to the instructor - any questions or individual training included\nThis cold calling course will teach you how to effectively cold call. It combines the teachings of the world's greatest sales gurus: from Grant Cardone, to Brian Tracy, from Jordan Belfort, the wolf of Wall Street to Dirk Kräuter, the German pendant.\nCold calling and sales go hand in hand - even in times of digital marketing, you can only run successful funnels if you add an offline element to it - which is, of course, to pick up the phone and start dialing.\nBy taking this cold calling course, you are going to learn\nHow to prospect like a pro\nHow to cold-call like a wolf\nHow to overcome objections like a winner\nHow to make the sale like the Wolf of Wall Street\nJoin this course now and believe me, you are not going to regret it. Sounds fair enough?\n\n\n\"This course was very helpful for those sales person and u can use it immediately. The course will provide [tonnes of] scripts and you can just suit them into your business.\" - Ng Hui Qi",

What if, instead of thinking of it as training, or onboarding, or the resting place for an organization’s broken things, we thought of sales enablement as a strategic investment—a proactive function that actually enables sales to sell more, sell higher and sell faster?\n\n\nThe biggest problem with Sales Enablement is that there is no one universal definition. If you were to ask 10 different people “What is Sales Enablement?” you would get 10 different answers, ranging from training to tech to messaging & positioning. None of these answers would be wrong – but none of them would show the whole picture. And when the answer to such an apparently simple question is so complicated, it becomes difficult to convey to senior leaders the value of Sales Enablement.\n\n\nRoderick Jefferson, CEO and top sales enablement consultant, is here to provide some much-needed clarity. After 20+ years in the Sales Enablement space, he has narrowed his definition down to this:\nBreaking the complexity of the buying & selling process into practical ideas through scalable, repeatable, and measurable practices that leads to decreased time to revenue and increased productivity.\n\n\nIf it sounds simple, it isn’t – but it can be done, and in this course, you’ll discover exactly how to do it.\n\n\nIn this course you will:\nDefine Sales Enablement and its value to the organization\nArticulate the impact Sales Enablement has on revenue\nUnderstand the roles and responsibilities of a high functioning Sales Enablement team\nDevelop a Sales Enablement charter and craft a blueprint to success for your Sales Enablement team\nBuild a culture of learning in your sales organization and learn to lead Sales Enablement in a virtual environment",
