      "description": "Retouching beauty images had always been a huge challenge for photographers and retouchers. I made this course to introduce you non-destructive ways of retouching that will allow you to retouch fast and create beautiful portraits that you may see on magazine covers.\nWhat is Professional Beauty Retouch?\nProfessional retouching or so called High End retouching is most advanced form of retouching that require a lot of practice and patience. For many people, retouching beauty images might take hours - in this course I teach you how to not waste too much time and retouch fast and effective. In such a retouch it's very important to work non-destructively, which means to not destroy the skin texture, face features or color harmonies. In prefessional retouch we don't blur or soften skin, we use advanced techniques to make image clean and dynamic, at the same time preserving the skin texture.\nTo make great beauty retouch, you need to use the right techniques, which allows you to save the time and get perfect results.\nWho am I?\nI am Marcin Mikus and I am professional retoucher with 6 years of experience in the field. I specialise in fashion, beauty and commercial retouching. Choosing me as your teacher guarantee that you will get prefessional knowledge and practice from the real industry expert, working every day with images that can be found in magazines, lookbooks and fashion campaigns.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat This Course is about?\nFor many photographers one of the biggest challenge they face is retouching process and making images look professional - with the right skin retouch, contrasts and color. Getting the final look requires knowledge of retouching tools, light and color grading techniques. Yet, It doesn't have to be overhelming process once you know how to manage your work and use the right tools.\nI cover up all of the important subjects of retouching such as:\nRAW Processing - A camera raw image file contains minimally processed data from the image sensor of a digital camera. Raw files are named so because they are not yet processed and therefore are not ready to be printed or edited with a bitmap graphics editor. In this course I show you how to work with the RAW files straight out of your camera. I will teach you how to process images in such a softwares like Camera Raw, Lightroom or Capture One. No matter which software you are using - you will find lessons for you!\n\n\nClean Up - In this course I teach you how to clean up your images. And not only the skin! First of all you will learn such a retouching tools as healing brush tool, spot healing brush tool, patch tool and clone stamp tool. You will know how to clean up background, how to retouch skin, hair, eyes, lips and every other part of the beauty image you could think of!\nAs a part of this section I will teach you some additional things as usage of filters that allow you to remove fine body hair within seconds. I will teach you how to use Frequency Separation in the right way to correct light imperfections. And I will teach you how to restore skin texture that we could loose during demanding tasks with skin retouching!\n\n\nNails Retouching - Small part of clean up but how important. With beauty images we need to make sure every element of the image looks great. Thats why I will teach you how to create natural nail reflections on the image!\n\n\nDodge & Burn Retouching - Dodging and Burning is only one Non destructive technique used in Retouching. Learning this technique brings your skills to the new level of retouching, and allows you to achieve non destructive results You can see in Beauty Posters or Magazines. In this course I teach you dodge & burn technique using curves - most common and most popular way to retouch using D&B technique! Curves are the only one tool that allows You to retouch whole image. I will introduce You to the terms like dodging and burning and You will know how to work with Your image on a micro level to retouch small imperfections of the skin by controlling lights and darks.\n\n\nContrasts, Lights and Shadows - Wrong is thinking that to get better perspective of the image we need to do global Dodge & Burn. It could lead us to destroing natural face features. Thats why in this course I teach you how to create precise masks that allows you to work selectively on increasing highlights and shadows to get the perfect contrats. I will show you few tricks that teach you how to get special look of the image, weather you look for something more dramatic or more of a film camera look.\n\n\nColor Grading - One of the most important part of retouching - often underrated. Now knowing how to work with colors we can easily destroy our final outcome of the image. Thats why in this course I teach you not only about color grading tools and adjustement layers but also about theory behind color harmonies. After that we will do very subtle color grading on our images working with tones and saturation values of the image.\n\n\nFinal Touch Ups - At the end of each retouch we want to make sure that our images looks perfect, this is where we polish our colors, lights and saturation values. In this section you will know how to do each of this things as well as liquify image and add noise in non destructive way.\nAnd the best part of this course is that it comes with resources valued at over $500! I provide to you high quality images to practice taken by amazing fashion and beauty photographer Dominika Jarczyńska. Shot in professional studio, with professional model and make up artist! And all of this specially for this course! Except the images you will get my retouching actions that will be big help in your retouching process and let you get the things done much quicker!\nEnjoy the Course!\nMarcin",

      "description": "Have you always wanted to learn how to retouch skin in your portraits to make them look like those professional portraits you often see in magazines?\nThen you've come to the right place.\nThis course will teach you how to use the power of Adobe Photoshop to retouch skin in your portraits and take your portrait photography to the next level.\nWhether you're a beginner or you've already been into editing, you'll derive massive value from this course because this course only focuses on one thing - taking your portraits to the next level.\nHere are some of the things you'll be learning in this course:\nColor Correction\nExposure correction\nSkin Clean up\nBlemish Removal\nStray Hair and Wrinkle Removal\nFrequency Separation\nDodge and Burn\nUsing the Liquify tool\nRetouching Eyes\nSharpening\nColor Grading\nand so much more\nWe'll be starting off by learning how to colour correct our photos so that we have a good base to work with.\nFrom there on, we'll be moving on to doing skin clean up where we'll be learning about things like blemish removal, stray hair removal, wrinkles removal, etc.\nOnce that is done, we'll be set to perform one of the most game changing steps - Frequency Separation.\nYou'll not only be learning how to do frequency separation, but also understanding the concept behind this popular technique.\nFrequency separation will teach you how to make the skin of your subject appear really smooth, yet very realistic as the texture will be preserved on a separate layer.\nFrom there one, there's another huge step we'll be performing - Dodge and Burn.\nThis can be a challenging step for beginners since most people don't know which tools to use.\nIn our course, we'll be covering Dodge and Burn in detail. We'll first be understanding the concept behind this technique and then we'll be seeing how to perform this entire step in the easiest, fastest and non-destructive way.\nDodge and Burn will add a crazy amount of dimension to our portraits, giving them that professional look we all crave for.\nOnce Dodge and Burn is done, it'll be time to move on to retouching the eyes. Initially we'll be doing some basic retouching to the eyes just to make them look really appealing but towards the end of this course, we'll also be learning how to change the hue and color of the eyes in a subtle and realistic manner.\nOnce that's done, we'll be learning how to sharpen the important features in our portrait to make them stand out even more. Sharpening  can often lead to a deterioration in image quality but in this course you'll be learning how to perform this step without affecting the image quality.\nIn this course we'll also be learning how to use the Liquify tool to change the body shape and facial features.\nWe'll also be learning how to do color grading as the final step to get the best out of our portraits.\nThere are different kind of portraits (studio and outdoor, zoomed in and zoomed out) that you'll be working with so you get an idea on how to perform all these techniques on any kind of portrait, not just a studio portrait as it's so often done in other courses.\nOf course, you'll be getting access to all the shots used in this course so you can work along with me on the same image. This will make your learning very practical.\nThere are also a lot of small additional things that you will be learning along the way, like knowing the difference between using a mouse and a Wacom tablet, knowing important functions and shortcuts in Photoshop to make your work flow easier, important tricks and tips, etc.\nAnd everything is shown in such a way that you understand the entire workflow in a very easy manner so when you finally start to work on your own portraits after this course, you'll know exactly what steps to take and in what order.\nEmphasis is placed on keeping the entire retouching workflow efficient, flexible and non destructive, so you can go back to any step and reduce its effect to make the retouch as realistic or as over-the-top as you wish.\nI've created this course after years of research and practice. My main aim is to teach you high end and professional retouching in a way that is easy to understand and execute.\nI hope to see you inside the course :)",

      "description": "LATEST: Course Update - May 9, 2023\nPhotographing people in love has been a passion of mine since getting started in the business of photography. The Outdoor Engagement \"Love Story\" Portrait is my favorite portrait session and can also be a lucrative part of your business. The same principals also apply to doing \"Lifestyle\" portraits.\nThis course covers my approach to documenting this important part of their lives. While too many photographers think of an Engagement Portrait as a single portrait from a session, I think of it as a \"Love Story\". It is a story of romance at a special time and needs to be told in a storybook fashion.\nThis course reveals the techniques that I used in the many years of my photography career. I would like to share these techniques with you, so that you may be able to not only enjoy the passion of photography but also earn a good income as you do something you truly love.\nIf photographing people is your passion, this style of portraiture can be a huge market for you.

One of these techniques is known and used by top professional photographers.\nFun & Variety with Different Focal Length Lens Techniques - Part 3 - See the different effects you can achieve using different focal lengths and lenses, plus important information in techniques on focusing that I use to get sharp subjects while getting nice background blur.\nFun & Variety When the Sun Goes Down - Part 4 - When the sun sets, don't put your camera down. Here we look at several ways you can add even more variety for an exciting addition to their engagement story.\nImpact, the Number 1 Element in Outstanding Photography - Part 1 - Learn several ways you can add \"impact\" to dramatically make your photos stand out from the competition.\nImpact, Using B&W Infrared Photography - Part 2 - Black & white infrared photography is a sure way of adding impact while creating images having surreal effects. Another way to add dramatic impact is with post processing. In this segment, I discuss how using both of these methods can drastically make your images stand out.\nBest Use of Lighting - Part 1 - If there were only 1 lighting accessory that I could use, this would be it.\nThe Art of Posing Without Posing - Using this technique, you'll learn of ways to take many images in a short amount of time.\nFinding The Light - Look for This First - Part 1 - As soon as you arrive at your outdoor destination, you need to know how to find the best lighting for the time of day you are shooting.

Then, I end this segment with a look at what I think is the best prime lens to use for outdoor engagement \"Love Story\" portraits.\nFinal Touches & Enhancement - What are some of the different enhancing techniques used by professional photographers in producing their images? Here I show you several techniques that you can also use to help improve your final images and take them to the professional level.\nPreparing For The Sales Process - Preparing for the sales process begins with having the belief in yourself that you can sell.

Here you may find the answers to your questions:\nWhat do I need to start shooting portraits?\nHow can I take better photos?\nWhich are the most common mistakes that I need to avoid?\nWhat tricks may I use, so that to create memorable images?\nHow to work with my model?\nWhat technical skills do I need?\nMy name is Denis Buchel, I am an experienced photographer and my goal is to help you improve your photography skills. I have been a lecturer in different photography courses, I have spoken about photography on various exhibition openings. What I noticed in people is that they are always interested in how things work, how they really happen on the field. How do I need to compose my frame, why does the background matter, why does the communication with the model matter?\n\nWe’ll speak about the minimal equipment you need (without focusing on studio light and studio portraits - that's a completely different type of photography). I’ll help you understand which the best practices are, which the most common mistakes are. And of course - how to avoid them.\n\nPortrait photography may tell deep stories - when you learn how to pay attention to details. When you choose a memorable face with strong enough expression. When you include one’s hands. It’s not only about a beautiful girl in a square frame.\n\nPortrait photography is about life.\n\nLet me show you!",

Se la complessità della pittura faceva sì che avere una propria icona dipinta fosse un privilegio per pochi, la fotografia ha reso l’arte del ritratto più diffusa e accessibile.\nEd è proprio nel ritratto, forse più che in altri generi, che la luce riveste un’importanza fondamentale nel creare il sapore dell’immagine, consentendo al fotografo di interpretare la figura della persona ritratta alla luce della sua sensibilità.\nCome nella pittura, anche nella fotografia i migliori ritrattisti sono quelli più abili a plasmare la luce, mettendola al servizio della loro creatività.\nIn questo videocorso illustreremo come la pittura abbia influenzato la fotografia e ti guideremo a capire come la luce possa essere modellata, intervenendo sui contrasti, per mezzo dei sagomatori, o variandone la direzionalità.\nComprenderai come iniziare a scattare ottimi ritratti con un singolo punto luce per poi passare a padroneggiare set più complessi per realizzare immagini dal forte impatto emotivo.\nCosa imparerai in questo videocorso:\nL’importanza di luci e ombre nella pittura, e come la fotografia abbia ereditato il loro uso dall’arte.\nLa scelta della sorgente luminosa fra luce continua e luce flash.\nCome misurare e regolare la potenza del flash.\nLa qualità di luci ed ombre: due facce della stessa medaglia.\nCome i modificatori influiscono sulla qualità della luce.\nCome la posizione della luce influisce sulla tridimensionalità dell’immagine.\nCome ottenere uno scatto dal forte impatto, anche con un singolo illuminatore.\nCome padroneggiare più punti luce per realizzare immagini più complesse.",

Learn about what gear to use, how to position lights, and how to edit the final image. This popular setup is versatile and great for portraits or headshots for both men, women, and children subjects.\n\nGood lighting makes good photography. One of the quickest ways to improve your photography is to learn to control light.\nMany photographers fear that getting intro flash photography will be too expensive or two confusing. Many insist on making large investments on nicer lenses or cameras, when they could get better results with a small investment in a flash or two.\nThis look can be achieved with a single light and then refined by adding an optional second light, or even a third.\nBy the end of this course you will be able to reproduce this same high end fashion/beauty headshot portrait look and have confidence placing your flashes, taking the images, and retouching in lightroom and photoshop.",

Great course that I can't wait to try creating vintage photos, especially love the Sleeping Beauty one!\" - Cindy Dupont\n\"Loved going through course. Completely changed my attitude towards portrait photography.\" - Zoheb Mansuri\n\n\nWelcome to our course “Modern Vintage” - a new tutorial in our \"Creative Portrait Series\".\nIn our photo studio, we have led over 50 photography workshops, specializing in creating conceptual photoshoots. And in this course, we will show you a style that was requested by many photographers, models and clients - a truly timeless and glamorous fine-art concept:\nHOW TO CREATE AN AMAZING SERIES OF \"VINTAGE-INSPIRED\" IMAGES!\nFrom the 1920's to the 1970’s... WE WILL COVER IT ALL! The history of film-making and photography in THE GOLDEN AGE OF HOLLYWOOD, the characteristic looks, the style, the lighting, live \"fly on the wall\" shoots - plus tons and tons of photography set ideas and inspiration!\nBut first of all: Why do you need to learn about \"Modern Vintage\" photography?\nVintage inspired movies and TV shows are trending right now and more and more people fantasize about the \"good old days\":\nModels want to show a different side of themselves in their portfolios and couples ask more and more for retro style engagement shoots, or even design vintage inspired weddings. If you look on Pinterest, Facebook or Instagram you will see tons and tons of images that resemble vintage styles.\nBut why?\nLife wasn't necessarily easier back then. However: The images that we see on the news or on social media make it appear as if life was simpler yet more glamorous!\nOr at least looked more desirable: No complicated technologies, no internet trolls, no viral tweets - just beautiful neighborhoods with classic cars and classic people (who talked to each other because they knew their neighbors). You get the idea.\nAnd talking of people - they all looked so well dressed and fancy... When we look at those images we can escape reality for a while.\nWe wonder how life has been for these people, there is a dreamy melancholy, and it appears almost magical. I mean : Who doesn't want to look glamorous and whimsical like a Hollywood Starlet or a Movie Icon on a film set - or at least would like to sneak into a time machine to get a glimpse of the past?\nThere is something so glamorous and timeless about those vintage images that it's no wonder that many clients love to be captured this way...\nSimply put, there is no way around it: Photoshoots that resemble a past era are more in demand than ever, and are a fantastic opportunity for us photographers to create timeless yet fun photoshoots that capture our clients in a way that they will cherish forever!\n\n\nThis Course Is For You - If You Want To:\nOffer a new category of photography for portraits, engagements or weddings\nOffer specialized model portfolios\nCreate interesting Mini-Sessions,\nIncrease your profit while standing out from your competition with fine art imagery\nCreate new set-ups for your portraiture and are wondering “How can I style my photos in a certain way?” (maybe with the help of posing, lighting, exposure or photoshop)\nGet out of a creative rut and would love to explore a new field of techniques\nEnhance your portfolio with new styles - all while working on a budget\n\n\nOr maybe you are just trying to get a better understanding of the history of vintage photography!\nIf any of these desires describe you, then this course is for you! If you love vintage images with a modern twist, then I promise you: You don’t want to miss out! :-)\nCheck out our intro video for more details or enroll in the course right now and let’s get started! Over 20 Photoshoots with brand new concepts are waiting for you!

      "description": "***Please note:  This course covers Affinity Photo up to version 1.10. Version 2 has been released. The interface is almost identical but uses different graphics for the icons, and version 2 has new features. This course contains a wealth of tuition that is directly relevant to Affinity Photo 2, but was made using Affinity Photo 1. I recommend looking at the course sample videos when considering this course.***\n'I've seen some videos about this or that technique and the person in the photo was gorgeous! But how do I actually enhance one of my photo portraits? Where do I start? How do I finish?'\nThat was the question I saw asked on a forum and I thought: 'Good point!' So here is a course designed with exactly that in mind. This is not a course about how to enhance an image of a professional model with a professional camera and professional lighting. Nope! This course is about taking the kind of photos you typically see of loved ones in a family album and making them look as good as they can be.\nReal world photos are more of a challenge and can give you the kind of problems you don't always get in a photography studio. I'll show you how to meet that challenge with Affinity Photo, start to finish. Don't get me wrong. The workflow and techniques you will learn are the same as the experts use, but I've designed this course so that you can apply what you've learned to any standard of photography.\nSometimes we have that special photo of a special person but it needs special care to make the memories it holds clearer, brighter, more vivid. So I use the kind of real world photos you find in a family album. I also deal with different faces because everyone deserves to look their best, no matter if they are young or old, or the tone of their skin. I deal with photos that will be seen by loved ones who know the face in the photo. Faces that deserve to be seen, not in a false light, but in their best light.\nWe'll take a series of .jpegs and RAW files and work them through, right from the start, right to the end. I'll take you through every stage and explain why we are doing things in a particular order. I've given you all the images used on the course to follow along with. I'll show you problems that can crop up and what do about them. Real world portrait development brings its own set of problems and opportunities, and the various techniques I guide you through take this into consideration. Check out the free preview introduction video and see the files we start out with, and then see just how good we can make them by the end.\nThis course assumes you have some basic knowledge of Affinity Photo but I'll also help you there. I've included links to videos I recently uploaded plus links to articles I've written in the public domain which show you the principles of things like Layer Masks, Layer Blend Ranges and Curves.\nBy the end of the course you will have followed along with a series of portraits, start to finish. You will gain the confidence to tackle your own images and one day soon you may be looking at a photo of you or a loved one which you've enhanced, and thinking 'That looks fantastic! I did that...'\nSign up now, and get ready to make your portraits shine. I'll see you on the course.",

I will walk you through the exact steps that I use to sell my portraits and close the sale in about an hour with my clients. My method does NOT rely on simply showing the client 20-30 images and sitting back while they decide. I will teach you how I am able to showcase, on average, 100 images per portrait shoot and keep my clients focused and happy while I lead them though the appointment and into the desired sale. My clients always comment that the process was easy and enjoyable. This course also spends a great deal of time covering how to set the client expectations. We will go over how to handle the initial contact, the consultation, how and when to discuss pricing and products, and all of the little things that help build the client’s trust in your skills and service. You will watch me cull the images and preplan the sales appointment before the client arrives so you can fully understand WHY I am choosing to show the images the way I do. Then, when the client arrives, you will watch the actual sales appointment from the client’s perspective. You will be watching the same screen that the client is watching and you will see exactly how I am showing each image and how I am working them down to the plan I put together in the planning phase. You will hear our conversation and see how I overcome any objections. My method is very easy to emulate.

In this course, you will learn how to create Double Exposures the right way: Fast, Easy, and Satisfying.\nMost of the courses out there are teaching the method that is relying on masking, which is very time consuming. In this course, you will learn the authentic method, which is easier, faster, and produces natural looking results.\n\n\nWHAT IS DOUBLE EXPOSURE:\nDouble Exposure photographs are created when two or more photographs/exposures are combined into one. Fine art pieces have been created using this technique. They’re also called Multi Exposure Photographs. This method originates in the age of film photography when artists were exposing the film twice to achieve similar results. Nowadays we have more control over the process because of digital tools. Thus the technique got its second life and modern artists are pushing it to another level of expression.\nEven if you haven’t heard this name before, you’ve most likely seen the eye-catching images on book covers, advertising, billboards, and online.\nJoin me to learn the simple photo manipulation trick that takes no time, and you too will be able to produce those artworks.\n\n\nABOUT ME:\nDouble Exposure Photography allows me to travel the world full-time and lead a remote Digital Nomad lifestyle. At this point in my career, I’m an independent professional photographer and visual artist dedicated to this Multiple Exposure Photography genre. I’ve turned my passion into a business. I’m quite confident that I’m the most experienced visual artist in this niche. I’ve accumulated knowledge and experience over these years of work and I’m ready to share it with you now.\nJoin me on Instagram and follow my steps as I travel around the world and create art:\n\n\nINSTAGRAM: @victortondee",

This course aims to save you time, spark your passion, and help you create outstanding portraits, by showing you an entire retouching workflow, perfected over 10 years of active work both as a professional boudoir photographer and retoucher.\n\nComplete start-to-finish retouching guide will teach you:\nRAW Photo Editing - Color Stylisation & Grading, Color Contrast\nEfficient Skin Retouch Basics & Tools - Smooth Skin and Preserve Detail\nAdvanced Frequency Separation & Mixer Brush Made Simple!\nThinking Outside the Box and Creative Ways of Using Tools and Techniques\nFinding the Most Time Efficient Methods\nAdding Depth and Dimension using 3 Types of Dodge and Burn\nMaster Subject Separation, Guiding Attention, Boosting Detail\nCreate Atmosphere and Ambience in Your Photos!\nLearn to Analyze Photos, and Squeeze the Last Drop of Color Contrast\nSharpen and Optimize Your Photo for Publishing!\n\nHaving spent most of my recent years offering private education, I've noticed a growing trend of photographers reaching out to me with some basic knowledge, that's more often than not, a confusing mess of 'half baked' information, techniques and advice picked up from various Youtube channels. All this in most cases causes total confusion, stress, wasted time, poorly retouched photos, eventually leading to loss of passion and love for this beautiful art and craft.\nThis course is my best effort to date, to demystify retouching, bring clarity, simplicity and fun into the process many photographers struggle with, allowing you to explore what truly matters - your creativity, efficiently and stress free.\nBy the end of this course, you will understand where color harmonies are being created, how to post process your RAW file and pull the most out of the RAW data, how to retouch skin for any kind of professional publication or commercial work, how to add depth and dimension to your photos, making the color pop, and creating the sought after subject separation, famously known as the ''3D effect''\n\n\nContents and Overview\n3 hours of study content and follow along material, covering the way from the initial color stylisation and Lightroom/Camera RAW setup, to a high end professionally retouched photo that could be printed or published.\nFor your convenience, the course is divided into 7 chapters, all starting with a discussion and analysis of our goals, followed by the in depth explanation of the tools we're going to be using\nThe course is going to be focusing on non destructive retouching techniques, that are the high end industry standard, explained in a simple, beginner friendly way,\nA significant portion of the course focuses on color work, that is besides skin work, another key factor that makes a photo stand out.\n\nThe 7 chapters of the course are:\nChapter I — Color Correction and Grading\nChapter II — Basic Skin Work\nChapter III — Advanced Skin Retouch\nChapter IV — Dodge and Burn\nChapter V — Detail Enhancement\nChapter VI — Plugins and Atmosphere\nChapter VII — Final Color Correction\nYou will also receive\na RAW file used in the lesson, for practice, or if you wish to follow along\nTwo Action Packs, there to help you save tremendous amount of time\nPhotoshop Workspace Presets to help organize your workspace\nPortrait Retouching Checklist - with everything you need to look at and analyze\nDodge and Burn guides and examples\n\nI would add that the methods and techniques you will find here are universal and you can apply them to all kinds of portrait photography (high end beauty, newborn, elopement, studio, neon, outdoor, family, boudoir, lifestyle, glamour, nightlife, commercial, couple, fine art, business…)",

      "description": "Are you done with forced smiles and poses in your portrait photography? In this class you’ll learn to look and go beyond the surface of your subjects (and yourself!) and portray who they really are.\nYou’ll learn to build rapport and capture their inner beauty in authentic portraits. I’ll teach you several ways to invite your subject (paying client or model) to reveal themselves as they are so you can capture their aliveness. No more fixed poses or vacant looks. No more stifling discomfort. No more uninteresting, superficial portraits.\nSo, this is not a technical course; it's all about the personal stuff in portrait photography. *\nSkills, tips and tricks from 12 years of experience\nI’ll share with you my personal toolkit. All that I’ve learned and acquired over more than 12 years of working with hundreds of people. I’ll share my client briefing and clothing tips. And many different ways to approach and work together with your subject. Some quite unusual...\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is for professionals and aspiring photographers, hungry to go deeper than just the technically correct pretty picture.\nLike: professional still life or landscape photographers aspiring to start working with people. Perhaps you’ve tried it, but can’t seem to build rapport with your clients or models? Do you or they feel awkward? Join me in this course.\nThe class is also for beginning photographers, who wish to portray their friends and family for fun or even start a stock photography portfolio, using regular people as their subjects.\nIt is not for you if...\n... you're looking for a technical class (this is personal and both you and your subject must be willing to be a bit vulnerable).\n... you want to be in charge all the time and think only you decide how a portrait must be taken.\n... you don't like to play.\nAuthenticity is key. Why learn to capture it?\nIn a world with dozens or even hundreds of images on our retina per minute, we decide quickly who to trust, who to work with and which images to buy for our business’ communication.\nAs humans, we are trained to recognize what is real and what is fake. And usually we don’t like fake people.\nTherefore, in our portraits, we seek to catch a person’s realness, so others can relate to what they see and trust them (your brand etc.).\nIf you can master authentic portraiture, you will make many people very happy: not only your subjects, but also the viewer and if applicable, the buyer of your work. Even for you, it will become so much more interesting and you’ll find that you can use the skills also in other areas of your life.\nWhy join?\nAfter taking this course and doing the exercises and assignments, you will be able to apply the skills in your own photography.\nYou will feel a lot more confident working with people.\nYour photos will be more real, more personal and simply better, because you will have learned to truly work together with your subject, rather than telling them what to do.\nYour portraits will speak more and be more relatable.\nSee you in class!\nLucy Lambriex\n*In just one hour, you'll learn more than you can probably handle, so I advice you break it up in perhaps two or three sessions.",

      "description": "Featured Review:\n\"Sandy is brilliant and very clear and descriptive in her presenting of the course content. She kindly shares her new discoveries and ideas on making a great theme even better always going the extra mile!\" - Rebecca Ybarra\nWelcome to our course “Creative Photography Lighting - Create Funky Background Designs With Gobos”\nMy name is Sandy Dee, author of \"Posing Like A Pro\" and photographer in San Jose, California. In our photo studio we have led over 50 photography workshops so far, specializing in creating conceptual photoshoots. And knowing how to use Gobos in your lighting set-ups will open a whole new world of creativity and storytelling to your photoshoot.\nMany photographers asked me what a Gobo is or how to use and place one - and today we will explain it all!\nGobos are an amazing yet simple tool to add more interest to your image. But what are Gobos? Well, the word “Gobo” stands for “go-between-object” and means that you place an item in front of a flash (or lens) to throw a funky effect onto your model or background.\nSo why should you learn about Gobos? Well there are many reasons:\n1. Do you want to save money? All the Gobos that we will show you today are very affordable with around $100 each - and with each of them you will be able to achieve an enormous amount of effects, especially if you throw a package of gel in to the mix: So you will only need to invest one time instead of buying different background designs again and again.\n2. Do you want to create a great variety of looks in a short time? Instead of changing backgrounds to create variety to your shoot - just place a Gobo in front of your flash (and maybe a gel) and continue with your shoot. Easy as that!\n3. Do you want to have a less cluttered studio? Gobos require hardly any space in comparison to storing big paper or vinyl rolls.\nPlus: You can create an endless variety of looks fitting to your model’s story, outfit and fashion accessories and have YOUR Images standing out from the crowd by adding a truly unique and interesting effect to your images.\nThe only requirement: You do need an understanding of your DSLR (manual settings) and you should have some practice with basic lighting and access to lighting equipment. Though we do explain important beginner subjects such as basic lighting diagrams and in the bonus section you will also find “the recipe of great portraiture” - the majority of the materials covers more intermediate techniques. However here we include as many options as possible: We will show you set-ups that are easily achievable and affordable with a variety of gobos, cheap flashguns and low-end strobes.\nOur promise: Creativity doesn’t have to cost a lot of money and: creative lighting doesn’t have to be confusing. You will see exactly what we are doing inside the studio with our “fly on the wall” videos. Furthermore Matt will walk you through the lighting diagrams to enhance your technical knowledge and my expertise will bring your creativity to the next level, so you will be able to achieve these looks in no time:\nHow to set-up the Lastolite Strobo Gobo to create an interesting window and foliage effect\nHow to set-up the Lastolite Mask Strips for funky shadow patterns\nHow to set-up the Lightblaster by Spiffygear, an enormous amount of variety for your background\nThe advantage of using Cinefoil for creating patterns on your backgrounds\nHow to use household or decorative items to create interesting shadows\nAnd SO MUCH MORE\nAt the end of this tutorial you will be able to set up images with amazing background effects that will WOW your models and clients. If you want to bring your creativity to the next level - then this tutorial is for you!\nHave Fun!",

      "description": "The secret of creating striking portraits lies in natural-looking, seamless manipulation. Through hands-on work using five unique portrait edits, you’ll take a dive-deep into portraiture specific adjustments such as skin, body shape, eyes and hair enhancements. You’ll also learn how to work with light to create depth and intrigue in your images. Together we’ll study the way your subject is affected by light and its direction, and explore how advanced photo editing techniques can significantly enhance the the balance and beauty in your work.\n\n\nSharpen Your Skills\nNon-Destructive Workflow\nLearn how to combine masks and adjustment layers to achieve your creative vision while at the same time maintaining tremendous flexibility. You’ll be able to create alternative versions of one photo in no time, or revisit your artwork in the future to bring new ideas to life with just a handful of strategic adjustments.\n\n\nEssential Portrait Enhancements\nEstablish a solid base for any portraiture edit by first performing a quick clean-up and body shape correction with the Liquify tool, and then a background fix with the Stamp tool. You’ll immediately add impact to your portraits by bringing up the detail in the frame, including hair texture enhancement and intelligent eyes brightening.\n\n\nCounter Balance the Visual Weight\nLearn how to increase the distinction between your subject and the background. Draw your viewers into the frame and add a strong visual punch to get their attention. By bringing up the textures in the environment, you’ll create more dramatic, effective artwork.\n\n\nMaster the Classic “S”-Shaped Curve\nDiscover this extremely useful technique to target flat areas in your images. You’ll learn how to quickly and precisely add contrast to the scene. And you’ll also experience how to gain more control of your light and shadow contrast by combining “S”-Curve with Layers and Masks.\n\n\nLow Key Portrait Technique\nPlay with balancing shadows and lights to build a moody, nostalgic atmosphere. You’ll work with complementary colors to create subtle grading with Curves, and discover how to inject a desired shade into selected luminosity ranges.\n\n\nRecompose Your Scenes\nExplore recomposing your frames so you can get your desired canvas ratio. And get creative by cropping images shot in portrait orientation to square, or recreate missing background elements to achieve a more compelling and seamless composition.",

      "description": "Featured Review:\n\"I didn't know color gels can be used to achieve so many different effects!! Sandy & Matt never disappoint. They delivered yet another great and informative photography video. This time on how to produce captivating photos which convey a certain story to the viewer and ones that have a cinematic color quality similar to what we see on TV/movies today. And, unlike Hollywood productions, the props and technique featured here are very innovated and accessible to anyone. I'm a huge TV/movie fan so I loved this video a lot. There's also a detailed and thorough post-process walk-through at the second half of the video, which I found easy to follow. Lots of great tips/tricks here.\" - Pocholo Pasicolan\nOne of the most important aspects of photography, is lighting. But it's not enough to just know the theory - to take outstanding images you need to tell a story!\nWelcome to our course “Creative Photography Lighting - The Magic of Color And Gels” - a new tutorial in our creative portrait series.\nColor Gels are an amazing yet simple tool to enhance the story of your image. But: Instead of just adding color for the sake of color, you need to think about:\na) How it changes the mood and result of your image and\nb) How it pulls the viewer into your world!\nMy name is Sandy Dee. In our photo studio we have led over 50 photography workshops, specializing in creating conceptual photoshoots and in this course we will bring your creativity to a whole new level: You will learn how to unlock the magic of color and gel photography!\nSo why do you need to dive into Gel photography? Well there are many reasons.\nDo you want to save money? A package of gels costs way less than buying rolls and rolls of paper.\nDo you want to save time? Instead of changing heavy paper rolls that might require an assistant - just pop on a gel onto your light and continue with your shoot.\nDo you want to have a less cluttered studio? A package of gels requires hardly any space in comparison to storing paper rolls.\nPlus you can create an endless variety of looks fitting to your model’s story, outfit and fashion accessories.\nAnd now comes the most important part why you should learn to unlock the magic of gels:\nWe all know that there is an abundance of images flooding the web these days and to stand out from the crowd is more important than ever, which can be very challenging. Luckily - Creativity is also more affordable than ever! That’s were colors and gels come into play. In the olden days you would have to risk wasting money on trial and error shots to get the look of your colored gel right in camera - but not any longer, thanks to your modern DSLR and LED display.\n\nHowever: The scary fact still stands - working with colors and gels doesn’t really follow particular rules. Personally I love to take the guess work out of lighting and use a light meter - but with gels? It’s not that easy. Also: There are many different set-up possibilities, so how do you know which is the right one? And: Gels come in all sorts of thickness and colors - and do you use them on strobes or flashguns? And - how do you know that the color look fits to your story?\nAll these questions can be very daunting for photographers, so today we will answer all of them and walk you through the set-up, step by step.\nThe only requirement: You do need an understanding of your DSLR (manual settings) and you should have some practice with basic lighting and access to lighting equipment. Though we do explain important beginner subjects such as the recipe of great portraiture and basic lighting diagrams, the majority of the materials covers more intermediate techniques. However here we include as many options as possible: We will show you set-ups that are easily achievable and affordable with simple props, flashguns and low-end strobes.\nOur promise: Creativity doesn’t have to cost a lot of money and: creative lighting doesn’t have to be confusing. You will see exactly what we are doing inside the studio with our “fly on the wall” videos. Furthermore Matt will walk you through the lighting diagrams to enhance your technical knowledge and my expertise will bring your creativity to the next level, quick and efficient, so you will be able to achieve these looks in no time:\nHow to set-up a “Hitchcock” inspired movie look with shadows, colorful gels and gobos\nHow to set-up a Tv-show inspired “Diner” scene (inclusive a fake milkshake, color and rain)\nHow to set-up your gels to achieve a romantic glow\nHow to set-up your flashguns to create an interesting “star” effect\nHow to set-up edgy Rim lights, colorful background lights and\nSO MUCH MORE\nAt the end of this tutorial you will be able to set-up images that look like a movie scene or were featured in a fashion editorial. If you want to wow your models or clients - then this tutorial is for you!",

As photographers, we should be able to walk into any lighting situation and know what light will work best for the type of photograph you are creating (this varies depending on what you are shooting- portraits, landscape, or product). On top of that, we should know what lens will produce the look we are going for as well. Obviously, this takes time to find your style of shooting, but light is light and knowing how to use it to your advantage is key to creating high-quality images that are sharp and require little editing.

      "description": "Featured Review:\n\"It was definitely a good match. I am trying to set up my own home studio and it is the second course I take with her. I love how clearly she explain things with German accent and easy going smiling kind manners. I am learning a lot cause when I don't have a professional model but a couple, or a mum or kids or families, it is not so easy for me to pose them :) this course helps to still get the images you want\" - Alexandra Grippa\n\n\nHi and Welcome to our course The Ultimate Posing Flow For Portrait Photographers!\nThis is Part 2 of our posing series \"Posing Like A Pro\" - join us in the photography studio for live sessions where we put everything you learned in Part 1 into practice! Or if you already have a little experience, then jump right in here.\nBONUS: Includes PDF sheets with almost 1500 poses for you to download and take to your shoots! Also: Closed Captions are available!\nIn our photo studio we have led over 50 photography workshops so far, specializing in creating conceptual photoshoots. And knowing how to pose a model or client is a big part of a successful shoot. I realized that most of my students were really savvy about photography techniques and new technology but started to freeze when they had to pose the model.\nOne of the most important skills that you will need to develop as a portrait photographer is being able to direct your subjects into the right pose. It will make your model or client feel natural, and your photography session will flow.\nAt the end of this course, you will know how to pose your clients and models for the most flattering pictures. If you watched my tutorial ‘posing like a pro’ or if you have already learned the foundations of posing for portrait photography,  this course takes those lessons even further by bringing you into my studio where you can watch how I put it all together into a real shoot to create the ‘posing flow’.\nTo give you a real life experience, I will show you how I work with a model versus a couple that never stood in front of the camera. None of the shoots are rehearsed with the exception that I briefed our model Rebecca to bring some different wardrobe items for variety. This means you will see realistic posing problems and questions that your client or model might have, and how I communicate with them to bring them into the right pose.\nThe entire tutorial is shot from my point of view, so you are more than just a fly on the wall - you see everything almost exactly as if you were behind the camera! Each time I take a shot, the image is overlaid so you can see the result straight away. There is no post production on them - they are ‘SOOC’ - straight out of camera with the exception that they are cropped in ACR. Sometimes I’ve also adjusted the white balance because different styles of image look best when they are warmer or cooler in tone.\nIn this course you will learn:\nHow to pose models and clients - females, males, and couples.\nStanding vs sitting poses, and tips for slimming bigger clients\nHow to quickly create different styles to offer more variety and enhanced sales: from headshots, beauty, dreamy, fashion, edgy, and more.\nGetting creative with concepts such as my trademark ‘lying on the floor’ setup\nHow to modify your communication style for experienced models vs regular clients\nHow to create an amazing experience and have fun while still getting the shot\nOne point to keep in mind as I will be covering a lot of detail that may seem impossible to get right all the time: don’t worry about the perfect pose, because it’s hard even for “super-pros” to achieve a “100%” perfect result - and if in doubt it’s always ‘Emotions Over Posing”. However if you are interested in knowing why a client maybe didn’t buy certain images due to things they didn’t like about themselves then our tutorial will tell you all about how you can best flatter your client.\nThis course is for the beginner to intermediate portrait photographer who is looking for a practical hands on approach to learning how to create a posing flow so that they will never run out of ideas again!\nSo if you are interested in seeing me in action, go ahead and watch some previews! Or if you want to develop your posing flow to the highest standard: Enroll now and let’s get started in creating your best pictures ever! See you soon!\nP.S : Closed Captions are available, so you can either listen or read (or both) to my posing instructions! Have fun!",

      "description": "** Voted by students as one of Udemy's outstanding instructors of 2014 **\nFollow me on live photo sessions with individuals, couples, 'fuller figure' subjects, young and older siblings and large and extended families and watch how I pose them to overcome their natural tendencies to sit or stand like statues and to get some great portraits.\n\nReal life indoor and outdoor photo sessions\nWarts and all posing i.e. some of them don't quite work, and I say why!\nMostly non-model real live people, like you and me,\nCreate beautiful family photos by getting your lovely subjects into more natural, relaxed and flattering positions..\nPractice the easy steps in this course and it will pay huge dividends in your portraits\nPDF crib sheets are available for most of lectures, keep them with you\n\nModels aside, the majority of us are not aware of our natural and unconscious body positions and so we don't usually present ourselves as well as we might. For example, most of us tend not to be concerned with where or how we place our hands and arms, tilt our heads, or position our feet. This course shows how I handle that problem, and how I position and pose people to get great results.\n\nPosing is a powerful skill that will transform your portraits, not only can you copy the ones demonstrated in the videos, but understanding the general basic dynamics of a good pose, will help you to create your own.\nEach video has a short introduction and summary of the photo session that just took place, it's then followed by the live photo session.\nDownloads are ENABLED for this course!\n\nThis is a brand new course so no reviews yet\n\nModesty almost forbids me publishing some comments about my teaching style, taken from reviews of my other two courses, but I overcame that, so here they are:-\nBernie is really easy to listen to, and his videos were really entertaining and kept you listening. (I also like his accent!)\n\nMany online courses suffer from over prepared, monotonic boring voice overs but Bernie's style is a bit like having your mate round to show you how to do something. This even goes to leaving some bloopers in which makes it human and fun.\nBernie is a hoot! He knows his material, presents it well, and is witty to boot. It's a great combination in a teacher.\nI love Bernie's approach. Such a great instructor,\nBernie is an excellent teacher and his enthusiasm for photography is contagious.\nBernie is a fantastic tutor,\nLove it, love it, love it!!",

      "description": "Featured Review:\n\"It is just perfect, we have a lot of well explained information with lots of samples and also the PDF... just get it trust me.\" Thank you Carlos Albert Martinez Gomez!\nWelcome to our course “Posing Like A Pro: Create Your Best Portraits Ever”!\nThis is Part 1 of our posing series and is a ‘classroom’ style course, covering the 200 page eBook 'Posing Like A Pro'.\nMake sure you download the PDF from lecture 4! I will talk through examples of great poses, bad poses, and things to look for - all supported by images and assignments from the book.\nIt's the perfect precursor to Part 2 of our posing series: \"The Ultimate Posing Flow\", which is a live photography studio session, showing you how to implement the poses with real models. Here we focus more on the \"do's\" than the \"don'ts\"\n\nWhy did I make this course?\nWhilst teaching workshops I realized that most of the attending photographers were really savvy about photography techniques and new technology but would freeze when they had to pose the Model or would run out of ideas very quickly.\nNine times out of ten we had the following scenario:\nStudent talking to the Model: “Do this! Do something completely different! OK good, let’s go somewhere else”.\nMe to the Student: “Why don’t you finetune the pose or develop it further?”\nStudent: “Well, I don’t know how….I don’t know anything about posing!”\n\n\nSo, that’s when I realized 2 things:\n\nFirst: It was time to write my own book about posing to really break things down as much as possible!\nAnd Second: Why not also turn this book into a tutorial so I could demonstrate all those poses and scenarios?\nBecause THIS way my photography students could take the book with them to their shoots (for some guidance and reference) AND also watch me demonstrating all those poses (plus seeing overlaid images to understand even better why some poses work and some don’t)\nSo, let me tell you a few things about “Posing Like A Pro”:\nIn this course you will learn ALL the THEORY about posing STEP-BY-STEP. You will learn to design poses that flatter your Model and your Client. You will understand the importance of animating the Model’s body and why it’s critical to the Success of Storytelling. Being a great Portrait Photographer means being able to create memorable images continuously AND on the spot. And this is exactly the No. 1 WORRY for many new (and even intermediate) photographers: How can you guarantee your Model or Clients these amazing images, that make them look like a million dollars - time after time after time? (And without that you need to freak out!)\nThis is why you will learn the following:\nHow to Evaluate Your Location / Your Subject / Your Lenses\nHow to Create Great Shooting Concepts\nHow to Pose the Body to Look Effortlessly Slim\nHow to Pose Your Model’s Hands in Flattering Ways\nHow to Use Props to Enhance Your Story\nLearn the Difference Between Male and Female Posing\nHow to Pose People with Weight Issues\nLearn about the Importance of the Right Light\nWhat to Do When Your Mind Goes Blank\nWhy Different Photographic Styles Demand Different Posing\nAnd So Much More!\nAt the end of “Posing Like A Pro” you will be able to flow through the poses, without your client looking stiff or unnatural and without your mind ever going blank. You will know all the tricks to accentuate your subject’s best features whilst integrating location, lighting and communication.\nAlso - Our little assignments will help you to practice your photography skills actively to really deepen your understanding of pro and cons of certain poses.\nAND: In your course materials in Section 2 (Lecture 4) and again in the final Lecture, you will find a link to your own copy of “Posing Like A Pro” e-book (which includes even more secrets: For example the “7- ingredients-recipe” for producing outstanding photography!)\nIntrigued? Ready to Create Your Best Portraits Ever?\nGo ahead and watch our previews or - if you want to learn all our tricks right now:\nEnroll into “Posing Like A Pro” and let’s get started in creating your own posing flow!\nSee you soon!\nSandy\n\n_________________________\nSome reviews:\n\"I really enjoyed Sandy's course, friendly explained the \"how-to\" and \"why\" with no bla-bla (means: not boring) to get the most flattering pictures of/for your clients. I think it covers everything for posing as summary of the greatest books about posing out there. Additionally you get the whole thing as PDF inside the course to download. Very professional, highly recommended !\" - Peter Leinfellner\n\n\n\"amazing explanation and a phenomenal instructor\" - Lisa Dubinsky\n\n\n\"What a fantastic set of material from someone who clearly has a lot of experience photographing all kinds of people and models. I love how Sandy clearly explains each topic and is very easy to follow and implement. Seems like a lot of instructors talk very high level, but she goes into each detail about posing, and has done a lot of research on the matter. Highly recommended.\" - Will Perez",

They are down to earth and explain the differences of the products they use, like you are in the room with them.\" - Lawrence Brenton\nDo you ever struggle with wind, rain, heat or the wrong time of day at your photo session and think 'it would be so great if I had my own studio'?\n\nDo you ever think 'I wish my client's location wasn't so cluttered or dark or ugly' and 'it would be so great to have my own studio'?\nDo you want work in a safe environment where you are in control, and be the master of your light?\n\n\nIf you answered 'YES!' to at least one of those questions - then it's time for you to think about finding and setting up your own photography studio space!\n\n\nWe went through all those issues from battling rain when living in England to harsh Californian summer heat, so we understand you. If you want to bring your photography to the next level but are daunted by all the factors involved in setting up a studio with the right equipment, then with us you are in good hands.\nThis course will save you a ton of research time and money by drawing from our own experience, cutting straight to the necessities with no fluff, so you don't have to make the same mistakes. In this course we will cover:\nFinding the right studio location\nSize and shape of the room\nPros and cons for your own needs\nLighting equipment from flashes to studio strobes\nModifiers - softboxes, beauty dishes and more\nBackgrounds - stands, paper/vinyl/patterned\nProps and accessories\nThink about how fun it would be not only to work in your own environment, but also to meet your client for the pre-consultation or sales presentation in your own photography studio rather than in a crowded coffee shop.\n\nYou will be able to produce a greater variety of images in a smaller time frame - which means more customers and more profit. Or if you are shooting for a hobby, you will be able to create your vision without being at the mercy of the weather or location.\nFor your great new photography studio you don't even need a huge space or super high ceilings. We will go through all our studio's limitations and how we found solutions so you can achieve the same results.\nAfter this course you will know what you need to get going with setting up your own studio space whether it's in a leased room, spare bedroom or basement in your home.\n\n***Plus: A complete 1.5 Hour Lighting Tutorial to show you all our different modifiers!***\nHave fun and Happy Shooting!",
