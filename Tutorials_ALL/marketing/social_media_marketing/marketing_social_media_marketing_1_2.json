      "description": "Social Media has become very popular in recent years, and increasingly important for business. Large business have started to increase their investment in social media marketing because they see tremendous opportunity in it. This is good news for them, but there is even greater opportunity for all business small and large.\nNever before has it been easier for anyone to get their message seen throughout the world. Just 20 years ago if we wanted to get a message out about our business, we would need to invest in ads in the newspaper, radio or television. Direct mail was also popular but could be very expensive. We can still do these things and they still work to a certain degree, however if budget is a concern then these mediums of communication are not accessible.\nThe great news is, with social media we can send a message to thousands of people per day for free. In my opinion, social media is the great equalizer in marketing.  There are over a billion users using Facebook and Twitter today and you can bet that a lot of them are buying the same products that you sell. It is time that they know they can buy from you.\nAs a online marketing consultant, I frequently meet people who know that this is possible, but have no idea how to do it. This is why we have created this course. Social Media offers a great opportunity, but unless we know how to use it, it will not provide great benefit to us. I see many businesses doing it the wrong way, and as a result they are repelling new customers instead of attracting them.\nIn this course, Greg will cover the 4 steps needed to successfully sell on Facebook. He will then show you how to apply these 4 steps to Facebook in order to generate leads and convert those leads into customers.",

That’s why a big chunk of this Facebook Marketing course is focused on hands-on training.\nWe don’t just talk the talk, we walk the walk.\nStill, just to make sure you understand the psychology of this platform, initially we will cover the mindset of clients when they go on Facebook and how to create an effective marketing strategy.\nWhat's more, I’ll cover everything from:\nhow to create content for Facebook\nhow to schedule it for maximum exposure\nhow to use software that marketing agencies use and how to analyse results and better yourself and your strategy each step of the way.\nAnd, for those of you who think can handle everything Facebook, I’ve included a lecture on how to create a custom Facebook tab with an integrated iframe where you can insert any content you want.\nThis type of thing is done mostly by big brands with deep pockets, but you’ll be able to do it in minutes with less than you spent last time you went out for dinner.\nBut let’s get back on track. I’ll give it to you straight.\nThis course is a complete material on Facebook Marketing and covers:\nthe professional setup of your Facebook Page\nongoing management with everything from structure to strategy\nadditional resources to ease your workload\ncase scenarios with various problems you might face and how to overcome them\nBut what this course beats a lot of other Facebook marketing courses at is because IT'S PERSONAL.\nWhat does that mean?\nIt means that depending on your own specific business needs I will offer appropriate advice.\nSo if you are not sure how a specific section applies to your Facebook campaign, just ask me in the discussion section of the course or personally email me (you’ll have my full contact info once becoming a student).\nSo you not only get professional training, but 1on1 Facebook marketing coaching as well. And the average hourly rate of advertising agencies ($150+) is higher than the entire course itself.\nAnd unlike when dealing with an agency where most of the time it’s just a transaction. I have all the interest in the world for you to succeed with the advice I share.\nWhat better marketing can I get than a student saying my course helped him/her to get where they wanted.\nYou can’t beat that!\nAnd that’s my goal as an author here on Udemy, to guide people into achieving their desired goal, in this case, create and manage successful campaigns on Facebook.\nStill hesitant? WHY?\nUdemy offers a 30 day money back guarantee. No questions asked. So what are you really risking?\nAnd besides, the thousands of students that took my courses and gave great reviews can’t all be wrong?\nOn the other hand, WHAT DO YOU GAIN if you DO take this course?\nthe chance to finally feel in control of your social media marketing, Facebook in particular\nspend minutes on tasks that you once spent hours on\nknow how to read Facebook Insights data and understand what works and what doesn’t\nget a bonus from your employer or if you’re self-employed get the bonus plus the pride of success\nknow that you have one less thing to worry about\nAnd in case if it’s any value to you, what I want, as your coach, in this journey through Social Media Marketing is:\nTo see a smug look on your face for reaching pro level at Facebook marketing and create campaigns that ROCK.\nAnd knowing that from your success, maybe 0.1% is my contribution, will give me a similar smug ;)\nSo my message to you is simple.\nTAKE THE COURSE,\nTAKE ACTION,\nWIN AT FACEBOOK MARKETING.\nBecause as you already know “the universe rewards action, not thought.”",

Even if you are already an experienced social media user or even an influencer, you will learn valuable lessons and enjoy the creative examples.\nWho's that girl?\n\nMy name is Esther Jacobs and I am one of the top 10% of social media influencers in the world, just below Madonna and above Angela Merkel. This is surprising, because I am from The Netherlands, which is only a tiny country, and I have a relatively small following. I am certainly not as famous as these ladies.\nMy secrets to being a top influencer are:\n1) Be authentic\n2) It's not about you\n3) Always provide added value\nI learned how to be successful offline first, long before social media started. I collected €16 million for charities by figuring out how free publicity works. I have been featured in the media over 500 times and I have been on most of the TV shows in my country various times. I still apply the same principles to everything I do, and it works. In this course, I will show you exactly what to do (and what NOT to do) to make your social media exceptional.\nBenefits\nThis course will teach you what to post, how to add value, to find your own voice and express your core values in everything you do. You will learn to turn average posts into exceptional ones. It has almost 8 hours of expert advice, examples and practical tips that you can start applying immediately.\nYour social media posts will be unique and interesting, resulting in more people following you, interacting & sharing your message.\nIdeal student\nYou’re an expert in your area, maybe you have a gift you want to share with the world. (Author, speaker, consultant, coach, freelancer etc).\nAnyway, you are good at what you do and people value your work, but somehow your social media does not reflect that (yet).\nIt could be that you just don’t like social media very much, or don’t know what to post. You probably think you don’t have time for social media, or maybe feel like you don’t want to be in the spotlight. If you feel this way, this course is going to change everything completely.\nMaybe you’ve tried outsourcing your social media (or are considering to do so), but you still feel your social media doesn’t really reflect your unique take on things. You want your social media to be engaging and effective.\nI designed this course specifically for people who already have some social media experience. It’s not about setting up your account, or the technical stuff, just about finding your own voice and adding value.\nAre you ready to make your social media as exceptional as you are?",

My business - Spreadit Limited, would not exist without social media because all our customers today came to us from social media. While I have been on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube for at least 10 years, none of them has given me the kind of visibility, exposure, and global reach as TikTok, and that within a very short time.\nMy customers are now scattered all across Africa and the world. We get calls, chats, and business from the United Kingdom, Armenia, Jamaica, South Africa, the Gambia, Cameroon, etc. TikTok has exploded my customer base and made me a recognized authority in the field of international sourcing, procurement, and shipping.\nYou may want to know that I got my first ever consulting client on TikTok within a few days of applying what you'd be learning in this course. I was paid $100 by a lady in Jamaica for a one-on-one session. This experience motivated me to learn more about TikTok and how to attract more such people.\nThe result is this course.\nWhen I began to record this course, I had just over 3,000 followers on TikTok but by the time I was uploading this course on Udemy, I had over 20,000 highly engaged followers. This happened within 3 weeks of deliberately doing what you will be learning in this course.\nWhat I have done in this course is to show you how you too can become an authority quickly in your chosen field by leveraging the VIRALITY of TikTok. I will show you both the fundamental and engineering aspects of TikTok account growth so that you can start growing your account super quickly. You will see how easy it is to grow an account and to attract your tribe on TikTok.\nThis course is for beginners. So, rest assured that nothing I teach here will be difficult for you to understand.\nIf you are just joining TikTok or have been struggling to find your way around the TikTok universe, this course will quickly clear every confusion and show you the path to influence and profitability.\nIf you are seeking a skill that can distinguish you in today's insanely competitive job market, then this course will equip you with that skill.\nAs a professional seeking to share your knowledge with the world and also attract quality clients, I will show you how to do that. More so, you will join an exclusive group of those who have taken this course so we can continue to learn and grow together.\nLet me emphasize this. My focus in this course is to show you how to attract the right people to do business with on TikTok. While your TikTok account will grow as you apply what you learn, my main aim is to help you scale the number of customers and patrons for your business. My joy will be complete when you begin to get prospects and customers for your business or profession by applying what I teach you in this course.\nWhile TikTok will continue to evolve, the principles I share in this course will remain relevant. TikTok now wants creators to publish their videos in a horizontal format and for these contents to be much longer than usual. So, while you learn the principles and methods I share here, keep your eyes and ears open to changes happening on TikTok.\nI look forward to seeing you in class.\n\n\nTochukwu Nkwocha\nInstructor",

Is it too late to start posting on YouTube? Sure, there's more competition as more and more people are uploading now (compared to five years ago) but I firmly believe that it is still very possible to create a very successful YouTube channel. You just have to make sure that you're prepared and have a plan of action.\nThroughout this course, I will run you through everything that you will need to know when first starting. From planning, filming, editing, uploading to promoting. Each step is important and it is crucial that we tick the right boxes to maximise our efforts.\nBut why stick around and watch my course? Well, I started my YouTube channel in 2018 and the channel has since grown to 75,000 subscribers and gains a monthly average of 500,000 views. I've experienced troubles, watched an unbelievable amount of 'how to grow on YouTube' videos and filtered out the best advice, plus I am always actively willing to adapt to an ever changing algorithm so I believe what I say in this course, should help you when starting your YouTube journey.\nSo, with all of that said and done, let's get into it!",

This is surprising, because I am from The Netherlands, which is only a tiny country, and I have a relatively small following. I am certainly not as famous as these ladies.\nMy secrets to being a top influencer are:\n1) Be authentic\n2) It's not about you\n3) Always provide added value\nI learned how to be successful offline first, long before social media started. I collected €16 million for charities by figuring out how free publicity works. I have been featured in the media over 500 times and I have been on most of the TV shows in my country various times. I still apply the same principles to everything I do, and it works.\nThis challenge contains some of the best parts of the 8 hour e-course 'Impact & Influence: Pro Secrets to Exceptional Social Media'. I am eager to share exactly what to do (and what NOT to do) to make your social media exceptional.",

      "description": "This course is for anyone who wants to take their G+ Hangout to the next level. This can be for personal reasons or for professional reasons, with the desire to monetize the hangouts. No prior knowledge of G+ Hangouts is required as this course will walk you through start-to-finish. This is not an average course about G+ hangouts as it also covers identifying your objectives, planning your hangout, announcing it, hosting it, and packaging it. Worksheets are available in most text lectures, guiding you through the inventory process and helping you to identify your objectives. The course is set out for beginners and those who are advanced and everyone in between. The amount of time depends on if you require every lecture. It is also dependent on the objectives that you define for your hangouts (with the guidance of this course). However the course is approached, it aids in taking those G+ Hangouts to the next level.\nMany of the lectures include worksheets to help you work through the process, as you learn, identifying what works for YOU and not just a cookie cutter replication.\nThere are also many full-length videos of actual hangouts. The beauty is that you can watch them to get ideas, but, if you are short on time, you can skip them and come back laters. Section 2, \"Creative Uses\" is a section on examples, to get you thinking HOW you want to use hangouts. You can pop back and forth to that section, or skip the uses that do not apply to you and go directly to the following sections to find out HOW to do what you want to do.\n\nDeborah's Commitment:\nMy commitment, as your instructor, is to provide the information that you need, to be a success. So, utilize the questions section to ask for more information. Working in a video studio/sound studio provides the luxury of being able to put together more material to help you out, in your learning process. Being a full-time video editor (yeah, while being a full-time host and socialpreneur and charting Jazz Singer!) allows me to get those turned-around to you. Your questions and feedback help me to target exactly what YOU want to learn. This course is more like affordably-priced, personalized coaching. So, ask away and I'll answer you.\n-Deborah",

During these ten years, I have managed & spent over $1.5 Million on ads with target audience all over the Globe.

I have trained over 50,000+ students Worldwide & have assisted over 100+ companies in forming their Digital Marketing strategies.

The course will start off with six reasons why everyone needs to run Facebook Ads. In the second video, I have revealed EIGHT key success factors & have briefly covered each of the factor with examples. The eight success factors are policy compliance, realistic goal, audience identification, budget planning, engaging creatives, measurement & optimization, continuous testing & understanding ads algorithm. The entire course is structured around the eight key success factors. While explaining each layer of Facebook ads, I will be linking every key success factor for better understanding.\n\n\nSection 2: Ads Manager Walkthrough & Five Campaign Success Pre Requisites\nSection two is divided in to two parts. In the first part, I have shared my $38,000 ever green campaign as an example to set the pace of this course. Ads manager demonstration topic has been covered after the example. In the second part of Section two, I have revealed the FIVE key Facebook Ads Campaign Pre Requisites. Policy compliance, Optimized Facebook Page, Optimized Website, Facebook Tracking Pixel & customer query management are the five pre requisites. Follow these five pre requisites; If you are planning to play a long-term game on Facebook.  No entrepreneur or advertiser likes to flavor the disaster of getting their ads account disabled. This is the core reason why everyone has to follow the five pre requisites before even creating a campaign.\n\n\nSection 3: Marketing Objective & Sales Funnel\nIn section three you will learn the importance of selecting the right marketing objective. Like stated above, selecting a realistic goal is the second key Facebook Ads success factor. After following the five pre requisites; the first option that advertiser needs to select for creating a campaign is marketing objective. Imagine running an engagement campaign when your goal is to get website clicks? Marketing objective is integrated with advertiser set KPI's. There are three categories in marketing objective that are awareness, consideration & conversion. Each category has several sub categories. Every option in marketing objective is linked with Facebook Ads Sales Funnel. I have covered the integration of sales funnel & marketing objective with examples.\n\n\nSection 4: Campaign Structure & Budget\nSection four has two parts. After selecting the marketing objective, advertiser have to finalize the campaign structure. The first part of this section will cover how an advertiser can select ABO or CBO campaign structure with examples. Selecting the right structure sets up the tone of a successful campaign. After the campaign structure advertiser has to select the right marketing budget. There are multiple basic and advanced options available in budget section. Give a realistic budget to your campaign in order to exit the ad set learning phase as soon as possible. This is where the eighth Facebook Ads success key of \"Understanding the ads Algorithm\" comes in to play. The sooner your ad set exits the learning phase; the better the results you can expect. All of this has been covered in section four.\n\n\nSection 5: Core/Detailed Audience\nThere are three types of audience options available for running ads. In the fifth section, I have covered the core/detailed targeting option with examples. Core Audience sets the tone of custom audience and Lookalike audience for the new advertiser. Scenario based core targeting selection with examples have been covered. I also have shared a $21,000 campaign case study to explain the significance of Core audience.\n\n\nSection 6: Custom Audience\nIn sixth section, custom audience options are covered in detail. These are two sources to create custom audience. First is the advertiser source like website, customer list, offline activity or app. The second is Facebook source like Instagram page, Facebook Page, Video, Events, Shopping & instant experience. All these sources are utilized to create audiences who have already connected with the brand. I have covered how an advertiser can create a meaningful custom audience for running remarketing ads.\n\n\nSection 7: Lookalike Audience (LLA)\nAdvertisers can reach to fresh prospects by creating Lookalike audience (LLA). In this section, I have covered the best practices for building a meaningful LLA audience. The power of LLA is explained with $16,500 & $21,000 campaign case studies. Different scenarios for creating a meaningful LLA audience is also covered in this section along with examples.\n\n\nSection 8: Ads Placement\nAfter selecting right marketing objective, right structure, right marketing budget & right audience, advertisers moves to placement selection. The selection can be done on manual or automatic placement options. This is where an advertiser decides on which placement & platform they want to showcase their ads. I have shared a $40,000 campaign case study to explain the impact of placement selection.\n\n\nSection 9: How to create & Spot Winner Ads\nYou will move to the third layer of Facebook Ads after selecting the right placement. This layer is considered as the most important aspect of Facebook Ads success. There are a lot of formats and ad options available for the advertisers to create an effective ad. The key four elements of ads are covered with examples. I have connected ads with the ad relevance diagnostic tool to make everyone understand the power & significance of ranking system. A $40,000 campaign case study is covered to explain WINNING ads methodology. I have also covered how Winning ad can be utilized to achieve consistent results through Facebook Ads.\n\n\nSection 10: Test, Measure, Optimize & Repeat\nIn order to be successful on Facebook Ads; the process of measurement & optimization starts as soon as the campaign is initiated. Without continuous test, measurement & optimization; success cannot be achieved. I have covered the measurement & optimization topic with the help of an example. No creative or audience will work forever & advertiser has to face creative or audience saturation. In order to avoid saturation, I have covered the testing methodology for achieving consistent results.\n\n\nAfter completing this course you will be in a position to create an effective Facebook Ads strategy. You will also learn the integration of all eight success factors. Feel free to contact me incase of any query or assistance. Happy Learning. Enjoy the course.",

The tool is designed to save users time and effort by automating tasks such as visiting profiles, sending connection requests, and sending personalized messages. It also provides analytics and tracking features to help users understand the effectiveness of their outreach efforts.\nOne of the key features of Dux-Soup is its ability to automate the process of visiting profiles. This can be a valuable time-saver for users who are looking to expand their network or research potential connections. The tool can automatically visit a set number of profiles per day, allowing users to reach out to more people in a shorter amount of time.\nAnother important feature of Dux-Soup is its ability to automatically send connection requests and personalized messages.

These analytics can help users identify patterns and trends, and make adjustments to their outreach strategy as needed.\nDux-Soup is not an official feature of LinkedIn, but is a third party tool that can be used as a complement to enhance the user's experience on LinkedIn. However, it is important to note that LinkedIn's terms of service prohibit the use of any third-party software that automates interactions on the platform, so using Dux-Soup or any similar tools may put your account at risk of being banned by LinkedIn. Therefore, it is recommended that you use the tool with caution and within the guidelines set by LinkedIn.\nOverall, LinkedIn Dux-Soup is a powerful tool for users who are looking to grow their professional network quickly and efficiently. It can automate many of the manual tasks involved in reaching out to potential connections, and provides analytics and tracking features to help users understand the effectiveness of their outreach efforts.

      "description": "Facebook Messenger chatbots will be the next BIG marketing trend in 2017 and beyond.\n\nMore than 1 billion people are active on Messenger every month, so why not monetize this platform as part of your/your client's social media marketing strategy?\n\nThe beauty is that chatbots are still in their infancy, meaning that very few businesses are using them to sell. This equates to HUGE opportunity for you, as a digital marketer, because deploying a bot will help your brand — and whatever products you're selling — stand out from the competition.\nSome advantages of building Facebook bots include...\n90% open rates, compared to the average 30% with email marketing\nInstant, relevant answers to users who message your page, eliminating slow responses and missed sales\nReach all your fans without paying Facebook to \"boost\" your posts\nPersonalize your sales pitches using Facebook data, proving to customers that you understand them\nMonetize your conversations inside Messenger without redirecting them to a painfully slow sales page\nWhether you're a brand consultant, social media marketing agency, or a do-it-yourself small business owner, this course will teach you how to build a Facebook Messenger bot that converts users and puts money in the bank.",

This course is the step by step blueprint I use when creating any of these accounts from scratch.\nIt's true, Instagram is a pretty unique platform and at first it may seem inhibited and impossible to drive sales. But what seems like a lack of features are in fact the reason it is so effective when you know why.\nIf you're building a brand profile on Instagram you could be falling into one of the many traps or easy routes out that so many small businesses fall prey to and be well on the way to creating a useless account that's weighing you down and taking up your time without doing anything for your bottom line.\nSelling on Instagram starts with building a strong foundation for your account, if you start of strong it just gets easier and easier.\nThis course teaches you not only how to build that strong foundation but also how to use Instagram specifically as a business owner to make sales and also how to bend the rules to have Instagram work in your favour.\nEnrol now to uncover a trove of free insider info which will get your Instagram account cooking on gas!",

But you also know times are changing and social media is getting a little noisy and crowded - and audience retention is taking a dive too. People are now wanting to buy in a consciously aligned way. They want to dig deeper into the businesses they're interested in buying from, to see if they're a good fit in terms of values, ethics and beliefs - they want authentic and aligned. They're also growing wise to (and a tad tired of!) the fakeness that's going on online. Your audience wants to see the real you and your real life, so they can decide if you're trustworthy and worth their time and money.\nBecause people buy from people - so you need to show the person behind the business!\nAnd that's what this course helps you do. It shows you how to let your audience into your world and see more of you - without you needing to bare your soul, share the things you want to keep private, and without having to jump around on camera (unless you want to!).\nIn this course, you'll get my simple system for coming up with ideas and showing more of YOU in the online space - letting your personality shine and doing it in a safe, enjoyable, aligned way.\nHere's exactly what you'll be able to do once you finish this course:\nYou’re going to feel more confident about sharing yourself with your audience without feeling vulnerable and uncomfortable.\nYou’re going to know what things you’re happy talking about and how you can talk about them.\nYou're going to find an easier way for you to build engagement (and connections) with your audience.\nYou're going to walk away with a simple way to come up with shed loads of ideas you want to use, making it easier and faster for you to create your content, and content that feels good to create.\nThis course isn’t all about learning, with no implementation either. In fact, you’re going to walk away with your first 3 posts created, and either posted or scheduled ready to go.\nThis is for you if:\nYou’re currently feeling a little disconnected from your audience.\nYou're getting a little bored with talking to yourself.\nYou're finding content creation a little hard.\nYou're running out of ideas on what to post.\nYou want to connect more with your audience so you can build better relationships and engagement with your ideal fans.\nSo if you're ready to add more of YOU into your social media marketing, click the enrol now button and I'll see you on the other side!",

Evanston, MA created this Social Media Training program in 2007, and has been named a top marketing consultant by About.com and written up in The Huffington Post for her effective marketing in social media and the results it gets her clients.

Her insights to utilizing the program take it to a new level. And we bring that together - here.\nThis social media training program is less about how to tweet or build a page or profile, it is more about what marketing strategy will work for your business online.

      "description": "LinkedIn rewards creators and operators who move fast, personalize at scale, and automate the busywork. In this beginner-friendly, hands-on course you’ll learn how to use n8n to build AI-powered LinkedIn automations and agents—end-to-end, from setup to deployment—so you can create content faster, connect with the right people, and run lead-gen and job workflows without babysitting tabs.\nWe start with the foundations: how n8n works, the logic of nodes, triggers, variables, filters, and loops, plus a clean server setup (domain, VPS, custom domain, reverse proxy, and secure access). You’ll then plug in real services you already use—Google Sheets/Airtable, Browserflow for safe cloud actions, OpenAI for message generation, and Apify for large-scale scraping. You’ll see how each node fits into a complete workflow, how to test safely, and how to fail-proof automations with filters, IF/Switch routing, error handling, and throttling.\nFrom there, you’ll build four practical automations step-by-step:\nIdea-to-Post Generator: Type a topic in a form, auto-generate a LinkedIn post, and store drafts for scheduling. Great for daily posting discipline.\nConnection Requests with Hyper-Personalized Notes: Pull prospects from Sheets, check if you’re already connected, enrich their profile data, craft a concise note with AI, and send a connection invite through Browserflow. You’ll add loop + wait controls to respect platform limits, and update your Sheet to avoid duplicates. (Tip: message notes are short—plan for ~200 characters; limits vary by account and change over time.)\nLinkedIn Job Scraper to Outreach: Paste a LinkedIn job search URL (e.g., “SDR, past week, United States”) and let the workflow enrich the poster/company, find and verify emails, generate an authentic first-liner from the company site content, and push leads into your cold email and LinkedIn campaigns—while logging everything cleanly in Google Sheets. You’ll also learn to deduplicate companies, clean company names, and add verification gates to protect deliverability.\nTop-Post Spy for Content Ideas: Track creators/competitors, scrape their posts (with stats), filter for high-performers (e.g., reposts or reactions), and save the post copy into Airtable so you can ethically repurpose angles and formats that already resonate—fueling a consistent pipeline of viral-tested ideas.\nBy the end, you’ll have a reusable LinkedIn automation stack you can run for yourself, your brand, or clients—plus importable n8n workflows, prompts, and formulas to adapt quickly.\nWhat you’ll gain:\nConfidence running production-grade n8n flows (triggers, filters, loops, routing, error handling).\nA repeatable system for personalized outreach and content, not just one-size-fits-all spam.\nA proven “jobs → leads” engine: scrape, enrich, verify, personalize, send, and log—automatically.\nA content research pipeline that surfaces what works so you can publish more with less guesswork.\nWhat you’ll miss if you skip this course:\nA working library of copy-and-paste workflows that actually ship results on LinkedIn.\nGuardrails that keep accounts safe (delays, checks, verifications) while scaling.\nThe ability to package these automations into retainers or productized services.\nYour transformation:\nYou’ll go from “manual LinkedIn grind” to AI-assisted operator—someone who ships posts daily, connects with intention, opens conversations at scale, and fills pipelines using smart, resilient automations you control.\nNote on connection notes: Character allowances change frequently and can differ by account type. Design your prompts to stay under ~200 characters for safety. (Recent help pages indicate 200-character notes with a small monthly quota for personalized notes.)",

Since the initial audience had little (almost no) knowledge of marketing and social media, I tried to simplify the concepts as much as possible.\n\n\nWhat are the first initial strategic steps that we should take?\nHow do we define our audience?\nOn what platform should we start our social media presence?\nWhat type of calendar should we do? How do we create a social media calendar?\nHow do we create effective content, and how do we recycle the content that we already have?\nWhat is organic and what is paid content? What is the difference? When should we start spending?\nWhat should we measure in our campaigns?\nAnd much more!

      "description": "LinkedIn Campaign Manager is a powerful advertising tool designed to help businesses reach their target audience and achieve their marketing goals on LinkedIn. With this tool, businesses can create and run highly targeted ads on LinkedIn, reaching professionals who are interested in their products or services.\nIn this Udemy course, you will learn everything you need to know about using LinkedIn Campaign Manager to create and manage successful LinkedIn ad campaigns. You'll start with the basics of setting up a LinkedIn Campaign Manager account, and then dive into the different types of ad campaigns you can run on LinkedIn.\nYou'll learn how to target your ideal audience based on job title, industry, location, and more, and how to create ad content that resonates with your target audience. You'll also learn how to track the success of your campaigns using LinkedIn's powerful analytics tools, and how to adjust your campaigns for maximum ROI.\nWhether you're a marketer looking to expand your skills or a business owner looking to grow your customer base, this course will give you the knowledge and skills you need to succeed with LinkedIn Campaign Manager.\nHow to create a LinkedIn ad in 9 steps\n\n\nTo create your own LinkedIn ad, follow the steps below:\nStep 1: Create a LinkedIn Page if you don’t have one already\nThis is required to create Sponsored Content and Sponsored Messaging Ads. If you need help setting one up, read our guide on LinkedIn for business.\n\n\nStep 2: Log in to Campaign Manager or create an account.\nThe Campaign Manager platform, also known as LinkedIn’s ad manager, will be home to all your advertising activities, such as running campaigns and managing your budget.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Select your ad objective\nThink about what type of action you want to inspire among your audience.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Choose your target audience\nFirst, you must choose a location, and then you have the option of adding job title, company name, industry type and personal or professional interests.\nIf it’s your first campaign, LinkedIn recommends a target audience of at least 50,000 for Sponsored Content and Text Ads. For Message Ads, 15,000 is best.\n\n\nYou also have the option of connecting with people you already know through Matched Audiences. You can do this by retargeting people who’ve visited your website or uploading a list of email contacts.\n:\n\n\nStep 5: Select an ad format\nDepending on the objective you chose, you’ll be able to pick from Sponsored Content options (single-image, carousel or video ads), Text Ads or Message Ads.\n\n\nStep 6: Create your budget and schedule\nCampaign Manager will provide a budget range based on other competing bids for your ideal audience.\nThe initial 2-4 weeks are typically considered a learning experience to figure out what works (or doesn’t). For testing, LinkedIn recommends a daily budget of at least $100 or a monthly budget of $5,000.\n\n\nStep 7: Start building your ad\nIf you opt for Sponsored Content or Text Ads, the Campaign Manager will share previews so you can get a sense of the final look of your ad. In the case of Message Ads, you’ll be able to send yourself a test message.\nStep 8: Provide payment information\nBefore you can debut your ad to the world, you’ll have to provide payment information. Once that’s done, you’re ready to launch!\n\n\nStep 9: Measure performance\nWhen you sign in to Campaign Manager, the first thing you’ll see is the reporting dashboard for your LinkedIn ads. From here, you can review performance metrics, access charts, and demographics, or export a CSV report. This is also where you’d go for conversion tracking.",

      "description": "Product retargeting can be extremely effective. It gives your customers a second chance to make a purchase of a product that they may have been strongly considering. Product retargeting is when you market a product to an individual who's already shown interest in it. You can remarket to customers who have added a product to their cart, who have clicked a specific link, or who have visited a specific webpage. I'm going to give you a practical example of how product retargeting could work for you and your business. For this example, I'm using a web bar. Within a web bar, you can create automations for your list. For example, when someone subscribes to your list and then makes a purchase, you might want to put them on a different list. You can use list automations as a way to unsubscribe someone as a prospect and subscribe them as a customer. This is one benefit to creating multiple lists. You can also use this Page Hits Automation feature. This is where you can connect your website to your CRM system. You can then add an automation so when someone visits a specific page on your website, this could be a product page for example, then what you can do is add a tag and then you can create automated campaigns to specific people who visited this specific page. You can also remove tags from people who have visited a page as well. This is a way to determine who on your email list has visited certain product pages, so you know who to retarget to. Not everyone who comes across your product for the very first time is likely to make a buying decision. It is important that you have strategies in place to ensure that as many people as possible convert so you can benefit from improved conversions.",

I'm working on an update of this course.\n\n\n★ JOIN MORE THAN 4,000 STUDENTS WHO HAVE LEARNED HOW TO MASTER PINTEREST TO INCREASE REACH AND TRAFFIC\n\n\nDo you want to learn how to unleash the full potential of Pinterest? How to attract free and passive traffic to your website? Are you interested in growing your Pinterest profile much faster than ever before? If the answer is yes, that means this course is for you!\n\n\nSo as you probably already know Pinterest is one of the largest social media platforms out there. On average people tend to spend more money on this platform than on Facebook or any other social media platform. That means if you have an e-commerce store having a Pinterest profile is a MUST.\n\n\n★★★★★\nStudent review by Lindsey Miller,\n“Exactly what I needed to increase my knowledge base! Many great ideas that I can use immediately.”\n\n\nI have a question for you. Do you think Pinterest is like any other social media platform? No, it's not.\nYou're probably using Facebook and Instagram. Am I right? And on these social media platforms, you share your photos, thoughts and communicate with friends. But I can guarantee that you don't use Pinterest in the same manner.\nYou see Pinterest is more like a search engine; that's why it's so unique. The idea behind this platform is to help people to find things that they would love. That's why the average shopping cart from Pinterest traffic is higher compared to Facebook.\nImagine that Lilly just moved into a new place. It's a single bedroom apartment, and there is no furniture.  So she starts looking for ideas on how her bedroom could look. That's not an easy task since she has no idea where to start. What furniture to choose or in what color paint the walls.\nBut with the help of Pinterest, just by entering the keyword \"bedroom ideas\" she can start creating a clear image of her room. She might as well search for furniture or decor ideas. So this is how Pinterest works; the primary mission is to help people.\nBut you're not Lilly you're a person who owns a business. Your story is different. You want to attract visitors to your website and grow your profile.\n\n\n★★★★★\nStudent review by Khurram Shahzad,\n“Very informative and interesting... very good methodology used for teaching and training presentation...”\n\n\nIn a course Pinterest Marketing 2021 you'll learn how you can achieve these things. I'll teach you everything you need to know about this social media platform to grow your business.\nYou'll learn how to optimize your profile, boards, and pins correctly. As well I'll show you what tools to use to grow your Pinterest account faster. And I'll share with you all the strategies which helped me to get massive traffic to my website. The best part is that once you apply this information, you'll be getting passive visitors to your blog or e-commerce store.\nDoesn't this sound great? Because you wouldn't be able to achieve such things with Facebook or Instagram. Like I mentioned to you before Pinterest is different and that's why it works.\nAnother great thing about Pinterest is that you don't need to have lots of followers to get great results. One of my profiles has over 5 thousand followers, and I'm getting more than 7 million monthly unique viewers. By spending only 20 minutes per day, I get about 250 targeted clicks to my store each day. Good luck trying to get similar numbers on Facebook. It's just impossible.\nOnce you finish this course, you'll learn all the needed information to grow your business and your Pinterest profile. And don't forget to join my Facebook group where I'll be sharing useful information not just about Pinterest but all other social media platforms as well. If you'll have any questions feel free to ask I'll be here to help you.",

      "description": "Instagram marketing has changed. Static posts are no longer enough. If you’re not leveraging the power of carousels, you're not only missing out on reach and engagement — you’re leaving your audience and potential sales on the table. Carousels are now the king of content on Instagram, and this course is your ultimate shortcut to mastering them using Canva.\nCreate Amazing Instagram Marketing Carousel Using Canva is a powerful, action-driven course designed to take you from zero to expert in designing highly effective, scroll-stopping Instagram carousels that get noticed, shared, and saved — all without needing any previous design experience.\nIn just a few hours, you’ll learn how to design flawless carousel posts that tell stories, educate audiences, generate leads, and drive traffic — using Canva’s user-friendly platform. You’ll get step-by-step walkthroughs on everything from carousel structure and copywriting formulas like AIDA, to creating seamless transitions and using the right size ratios for maximum visual impact.\nThis course is not about random tips. It’s a strategic system that helps you create carousels with purpose — content that actually converts. You'll discover the psychology behind why carousels work so well, and how to apply that to your own designs to grow your following, boost your content engagement, and establish authority in your niche.\nHere's what most people don’t realize: if you're not using carousels strategically, you're being ignored. Instagram favors them in its algorithm. Audiences spend more time swiping through them. Smart creators and businesses are using them to dominate feeds and expand their influence — while the rest fall behind.\nThis course gives you the competitive edge. You’ll learn how to create seamless carousels that flow visually and narratively, how to split and format images for multi-slide impact, how to adapt designs for portrait mode, and how to recreate successful carousel styles that are already performing.\nAnd you won’t waste time with guesswork. This course gives you clarity and a proven method that you can apply immediately, no matter your niche. Whether you're a content creator, coach, entrepreneur, freelancer, or brand — this skill will pay off every time you post.\nIf you choose to skip this opportunity, you're choosing slower growth, lower engagement, and limited impact. In a world of short attention spans, carousels are one of the few formats that hold attention — and convert it into results. Don’t let your competitors outshine you with better design and messaging.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll walk away with professional-grade carousel design skills that are simple, repeatable, and effective. You'll know how to design fast, smart, and with intent — using Canva as your creative powerhouse.\nNo complex tools. No prior design knowledge needed. Just you, your message, and the ability to deliver it in a format Instagram can't ignore.",

We’ll start with what actually makes people click: how to research your audience, study your niche, and analyze what’s working for top creators.\nThen, you’ll learn how to use free tools like Canva to design thumbnails that pop, as well as using proven layout techniques, color psychology, and emotional storytelling.\nWe’ll also explore AI tools that help you brainstorm faster, generate visuals, and fine-tune your ideas.\nAnd because titles and thumbnails go hand-in-hand, you’ll also discover how to write viral titles that “confirm the click” and boost your overall performance.\nWhether you’re just getting started or already growing your channel, this course will give you the tools and strategies to level up your thumbnails, and help your content get the views it deserves.",

I will be explaining how to do this using a desktop computer running Mac OS and an internet browser. Facebook advertising requires a lot of experimentation. You will probably not get it right on the first try. Different ads perform differently to different people on different days. I’ve been advertising YouTube videos for years, so I’ve got that dialed in pretty well and am getting a good click though rate and cost per click. Some people do split testing, also known as A/B testing, to see what works and what doesn’t. You post an ad, then you post another ad that’s the same, but just one thing changed. A different headline for example, or advertised to two different groups of people. One could target the US and the other could target the UK. Just to see where in the world would give you the best results. The only way to know what works best for you is to try a bunch of different things and find out what performs the best. Thank you for considering taking my course.",

But You’re Not Getting As Many Sales As You’d Like Because You’re Not Able To Attract New Prospective Clients Eager To Work With You!\nTop agents aren’t doing any sort of voodoo-real-estate-marketing tricks, they were simply fostering one of the MOST powerful marketing principles: the Know, Like & Trust factor.\nIt’s really simple, the more people Know, Like & Trust you, the more likely they’ll be to buy from you.\nDo you know the MOST powerful and cost-effective ways for you as agent to tap into this Know, Like & Trust factor?\nIt’s video and it’s YouTube!!!\nTop agents know that a simple video can go a long way in building their business and boosting their sales.\nNow, it's your turn to leverage the SAME powerful marketing tool Top agents use to boost their annual real estate revenues!",

Isn't it just another Facebook course like, you know, all the bajillion others?\"\nNope. Unlike other courses that you may have bought and that are sitting there on your hard drive gathering digital dust - in MY course, I focus ONLY on forensic step-by-step stuff. My videos are me taking you through eaaaaach step without assuming you know anything! I literally take you from zero to Facebook ads hero on topics such as:\n* Understanding how to build and use custom audiences (NOT a small thing - and I show you all the latest methods!)\n* Master advertising on Instagram (and yes, you want to be on instagram running ads, let me tell you!)\n* How to create a high-converting ads funnel to grow your email lists and explode into a profitable source of income!\n* Find out how to set up dynamic ads for multiple products (saaay whaaaaa....? Yeah, that's what the lectures explain!)\n* Discover how to master the Power Editor and all it's hidden features (grown-ups use Power Editor. Leave the basics behind)\n* Plus lots more. With steak knives* (*May not be true)\nIn fact - you know what? FORGET \"zero to hero\" training..\nThis course is ZERO TO ROCKSTAR - in the shortest time I can cram your head with step by step processes! IMPLEMENTATION is the focus, rather than boring long-winded explanations (although I will explain stuff of course!)\nSo: Within the next 5 mins, I'm going to walk you through setting up your campaigns from start to finish - and I will also be throwing in some ninja tips and tricks I've never revealed before (i know i know - sounds sales, but trust me - I get paid a metric shed load of money to keep on top of this stuff, and this is the ONLY WAY I can get this info out of my head in quicktime to paying people such as yourself without charging you my normal rates. Fair?)\nOh - and remember - as Facebook ads is a constantly changing platform, you need to be one step ahead of the crowd. Facebook Advertising School will be revealing (and testing so you don't have to) all the new features and changes to the Ads Platform as they are released. I'm looking forward to revealing all my tips and tricks so you can make more money from Facebook Advertising in your business!\nAnyway, I can bang on all day about this stuff - i LOVE IT! But YOU need to get stuck in right now right?\nAH - HANG ON! DO NOT SIGN UP FOR MY SCHOOL if you're going to be thinking you can make a million in a weekend. That's NOT the market I cater to - the \"get rich quick\" people and the usual internet marketing crowd who make you feel like a loser if you are making less than 80000 figures per day.\nBUTTTTTT.... if you're a normal everyday person who just wants to make Facebook ads work for them and their business - I'm your chick. I promise you will love this course and I TOTALLY promise you'll get results if you complete it and apply everything you learn.\nFair?\nYeah it is! See you inside!",

The only effective method is subtle, natural, useful, tactical and transparent. And this quick course will help you to master this approach so you can generate sales through Reddit for free!\nThe areas covered in this course include the common challenges and mistakes, key steps to grow your ID and market effectively ans well as practical examples of effective comments and posts.\nIt will also cover the key precautions and approach tou should follow to avoid getting banned and provide a stepwise guide to help you get to a flying start.\nReady to begin with Reddit marketing?Let's get started!",

      "description": "OVER 1,000 DELIGHTED STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN THIS COURSE\nPinterest is such a powerful tool for Business and Social Media Marketing.\nOne of the hottest social networking sites today is Pinterest. Although the site still lags behind global behemoths Facebook and Twitter in terms of number of registered users, Pinterest has nonetheless had a steady and progressive rise over the years, thanks in large part to its heavy focus on gorgeous images. The site's enormous success is definitely one for the books.\nLatest figures show that Pinterest has over 70 million registered users across the world, with a huge bulk of them - or more than 50 million users - coming from the United States alone.\nPinterest is an online visual bulletin board. It is a relatively new social sharing website that is sweeping the nation. You choose an image that you like and pin it on a board that you name. From fitness to food, to photography and art, there are unlimited possibilities with Pinterest. What seems like a simple concept is simply addictive. Think of this website as visual image of everything beautiful. People pin things to a virtual pin-board. All the things that you would traditionally cut out from a magazine or print off the internet are no longer necessary. The days of cutting pictures from a magazine, articles, and recipes are long gone. You can pin any image to a board on your Pinterest account. You can follow other people's boards, you can follow friend's boards, friends can follow you, it's a lot like facebook and twitter in that respect to sharing and amplification of what you are posting. Given the right social media strategy and implementation, Pinterest may actually offer any business more referral traffic than Twitter, and perhaps generate more leads than LinkedIn, Google+ and YouTube combined. It may even have the power to convert more fans into paying customers who will easily share your content with their friends. In just a few years after it was launched, Pinterest surpassed ten million users, faster than any other stand-alone site in history. It now has the potential to drive a significant amount of referral traffic to your website and at the same time boost actual sales. That idea perhaps is valid enough for any business to consider using Pinterest.\nOver an hour of simple yet very powerful videos (plus many links), Pinterest expert Paul Tilley shows you how to Make Profit with Pinterest in 7 simple steps\nPaul will show you:\nA system to profit on Pinterest.\nDiscover everything there is to know about Pinterest\nPros & Cons Pinterest\nWho and what to target for max profits\nThe things that you must avoid when making money on Pinterest\nHow to get into Pinterest, configure your account, get followers and automate your profits on Pinterest\nHow to optimize your Pinterest account to generate Mass Traffic so traffic to any website, affiliate link or product you want.\nHow to use the affiliate profiting strategy, so that you can side step all trial and error everyone else goes through when promoting on Pinterest.\nHow to use Pinterest itself so that you don't have to scour the Internet all day to find images that people \"want\" to see on Pinterest.\nBONUS: How to automate the whole thing!\nThe entire course is over one hour long, but you have the ability to pause the videos and re-read the .pdf text so that you can go at your own pace.\nThe instructor, Paul Tilley, will also take any of your questions, you can type these into the \"Questions\" box on the right-hand sign of your screen.\nAnd the unconditional, Udemy backed, 30 day money-back guarantee is not just any old guarantee, it's my personal promise to you that you will succeed ...",

      "description": "How To Build Your Social Media Marketing Strategy\nA social media marketing strategy is an overview of everything you plan to do and hope to achieve on social media. Ultimately, it guides your actions and highlights whether you are on the right path to achieving your objectives.\nThe more structured, detailed and specific your social media strategy is, the more effective it's going to be! A social media strategy is often overlooked by those who are aiming to build a brand on social media, but it can often be the difference between success and failure.\nAfter all, if you have goals you want to achieve, but have no idea of the steps you need to take to reach them, how can ever expect to succeed?!\nThat's why in this Skillshare class I am going to be outlining just how important a social media strategy is to your brand/business and exactly how you can build your own.\n- - - - - - - - - -\nThe modules discussed in the class are as below:\nModule 1: Understanding why you are using social media in the first place\nIf you don't understand why you are actually using social media, you'll never be able to create an effective strategy. Understanding the why behind your existence on social media is what drives everything you do.\nModule 2: Completing thorough competitor research\nWith the incredible amount of information available to us, it would be crazy to go in blind and start from scratch. It's important to research what our successful competitors are doing. From this, we are able to document a significant amount of data that can be implemented into our own strategies.\nModule 3: Understanding your most important metrics\nWhen it comes to social media, many will only focus on the number of likes and followers they have. However, the number of likes and followers may have no impact or contribution towards your social media goals. Understanding the metrics that are relevant to your goals is key to measuring the success of your social media marketing strategy.\nModule 4: Target audience research\nIf you don't know who your target audience is, or where they are on social media you won't stand a chance. Unfortunately, when it comes to the various social media platforms there is no \"one size fits all\". Each platform will have it's own unique demographic and therefore, it's down to you to work out where you can find your target audience.\nModule 5: Creating effective social media content\nYour content is the backbone of your social media marketing strategy. It's the reason people will be attracted to your profile, it's what builds trust and authority with your audience, and consequently, it will end up driving sales for your business. Therefore, understanding how to create effective social media content is essential.\nModule 6: The importance of timeliness\nWhen it comes to social media, building a relationship with your followers and audience is a must. To do so you have to be timely with everything you do, and in this module, I explain why this is the case and how to be.\nModule 7: Assessing your analytics and adjusting your content\nInsanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. This is where I see so many people fail on social media. They continue with a strategy they have built, that isn't working, but expect that all to change overnight. Thankfully, there is incredibly detailed analytics for us to assess which highlight how we can adjust our strategies for optimum success.\nModule 8: Adjusting your goals over time\nSocial media is unpredictable. It's highly unlikely that the goals you set yourself within a given time frame will be achieved exactly as expected. In some cases, you will underestimate what you can achieve, and consequently, you'll have to reassess your goals sooner than expected. In other cases, you'll overestimate what you can achieve and will have to again change your goals accordingly.",

      "description": "As a business owner, you already know that social media matters — but let’s be honest: it doesn’t work the way it used to.\n\n\nThe reach is inconsistent. The algorithms keep changing. And no matter how many posts, stories, or reels you create, the needle barely seems to move. It starts to feel like you’re working for the platform instead of letting the platform work for you.\n\n\nThis course exists to flip that relationship on its head.\n\n\nInstead of treating social media as your business, you’ll learn how to make it support your business — by using it to promote something far more valuable: your own platform.\n\n\nWhether that’s a blog, a newsletter, a podcast, or a course page, your platform is the digital home you actually control. That’s where you build trust, grow your audience, and turn attention into action. Social media is simply the highway that leads people there.\n\n\nInside this course, we’ll build out a system that helps you stay visible without staying online all day. You’ll learn a focused strategy that takes just one hour per week — and actually works. You’ll learn how to create once and publish everywhere, using the right content on the right platforms for the right people.\n\n\nWe’ll explore what to post (and what not to bother with), how to promote your work with confidence, and how to track progress in a way that actually reflects growth — not just empty engagement stats.\n\n\nThe core framework is backed by hands-on, printable resources that you’ll actually use. You’ll walk away with tools like a weekly visibility planner, a post planning grid, a content syndication map, and fill-in-the-blank scripts for promoting your work without sounding pushy or awkward.\n\n\nAnd because every platform behaves differently, we’ll walk through practical ways to maximize visibility on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and YouTube — not to become influencers, but to use each one strategically as part of your broader content flow.\n\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered whether social media is worth the effort — or felt stuck between posting nonstop and disappearing altogether — this course is your answer.\n\n\nIt’s time to build a real platform.\nTo create with purpose.\nAnd to use social media on your terms — not theirs.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\n\nHow to use social media to drive attention to your platform — not build your business on rented land\nHow to structure your content using the 2:1 ratio of Provide vs. Promote\nHow to turn one piece of content into posts across multiple platforms\nHow to promote your work without feeling pushy or salesy\nHow to plan your entire week’s content in just one hour\nHow to get seen on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and YouTube without being glued to your screen\nHow to track what actually matters (and ignore vanity metrics)\n\n\nThis Course Includes\n\n\nA step-by-step framework for smarter, more strategic social media use\nPractical, printable worksheets and planning templates\nA content syndication flow that starts with your own platform\nVisibility checklists and post planners\nSelf-promotion prompts to help you share without hesitation\nPlatform-specific tips for optimizing your presence on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and YouTube\n\n\nWho This Course Is For\n\n\nEntrepreneurs and business owners who want results without social media burnout\nCoaches, consultants, and freelancers looking for consistent, organic leads\nCreators and professionals who want a calm, structured approach to visibility\nAnyone tired of algorithm-chasing and ready to build a lasting online presence\n\n\nWho This Course Is Not For\n\n\nAnyone looking for shortcuts, hacks, or viral tricks\nPeople focused solely on growing followers without a long-term strategy\nBusinesses that rely entirely on paid advertising (this course takes a no-ads-first approach)",

As a professional, you can use social media to engage with others, share your experience, expand your reach, meet new people, and deepen relationships — in short, to build your network. Social media’s vast appeal lies in the personal connection it creates, and your social media should reflect your personality and interests. It’s not just about likes, shares, and followers—social media is about your connections with clients, teammates, and recruits. Every company has its own rules about social media. In this course we will cover some standard ones, using examples from some financial sector companies. Social media allows you to establish yourself as a thoughtful entrepreneur focused on financial solutions for families. Social media is a great way to nurture relationships, but it is not a substitute for one-on-one recruiting within your natural market. Your reputation as someone others can trust and have confidence in is “on the line” in the posts you make. Stay honest and accurate. As a professional, you must follow all regulatory laws that apply to your business, including your public interactions on social media. Social media is most effective when it works together with other tools and resources the Company provides you to build your business. Avoid negativity in your posts —always share positive information and treat everyone you encounter with respect.",

If so, then this class is perfect for you.\nThis class is your one-stop shop for everything you need to know about Instagram hashtags.\nModule 1: The Hashtag Ranking Ladder\nIn this module, I explain exactly how Instagram hashtags work and the way the algorithm tests your content within each of the hashtag size boundaries.\nModule 2: Hashtag Stacking Explained\nHashtag stacking is a common strategy used by all of the top creators. It involves selecting a certain number of hashtags from each of the ladder size boundaries explained in module 1. I tell you exactly why this technique is so effective and the exact number of hashtags you need to select for each size.\nModule 3: Creating Hashtag Sets\nYou can't simply use the same hashtag set forever. Over time your reach will decline so you need to have a backup plan. I explain why creating various hashtag sets is so important.\nModule 4: Where To Put Your Hashtags\nInstagram gives you the option to place your hashtags in either the caption or the comments section. I display my preference from my own personal experience and how I actually write my captions to cater for hashtags.\nModule 5: How To Rank On Hashtags\nI explain EXACTLY how the Instagram algorithm works so that you can build a relationship with it, in order to eventually rank on the hashtags. This module is a MUST listen.\nModule 6: Hashtag Tips To Remember\nTo round up I share some of my top hashtag tips that you need to remember when implementing your Instagram hashtag strategy. Failing to follow these could make or break the performance of the hashtags you use.\n\n\nI look forward to teaching you everything you need to know in order to achieve Instagram hashtag goals.

I run regular workshops showing them how to build brand exposure using social networking sites like Facebook.\nI have spent my career building solid, long-term business relationships. After continually encountering businesspeople bewildered by Internet technology, I decided to apply my tech and business networking experience to social media, and founded Web Friendly, a company that teaches a smart approach to this online phenomenon.\nIn its early days, Internet marketing was purely a numbers game, but things have evolved. Social media capitalizes on the quality and longevity of online relationships, rather than on mere volume. I understand these nuances, and I apply that knowledge to help clients produce tangible results.\nAfter years of studying Facebook Marketing, I’ve managed to:\nEarn $1000+ by spending $40 on Facebook Ads several months in a row\nUse Facebook ads to attract leads at $1.50 per lead or less in almost every industry\nUse Facebook ads to get 1000's of TARGETED Fans for fractions of pennies\nMake over $1800 in sales in a couple days from asingle Facebook update (a technique that my students used to generate similar results)\nBuild a really strong Facebook presence using Facebook Ads spending only $1 a day!\nI’ve also consulted with Small Businesses and helped them:\nGet 3,000+ downloads for their free ebook in under 3 months\nEarn $25,000 in one summer using my carefully developed strategies for a brand new one-person business\nI’ve helped businesses generate 1000’s of new Fans in just a few short weeks spending only PENNIES per Fan using Facebook Ads\nAnd unexpectedly helped one student have lunch with a major Canadian celebrity, and get featured on Forbes.com!\nThe results I’ve achieved is a measure of what effective Facebook Marketing can do for YOUR business\nBut as you've probably experienced for yourself, achieving success on Facebook can be easier said than done, either due to the lack of correct information, information overload, or the limited amount of time you have as a business owner.\nI was lucky back then...\nI was helping businesses with their online marketing and Facebook was becoming a big part of the “Internet”. I was under the pressure to stay relevant so I had to make time to find out what really works with Facebook marketing.\nI know that most small business owners probably don’t have that kind of time to spare.\nSo I wanted to create a solution for this.\nI wanted to create a simple solution to help smart, but overwhelmed and frustrated small business owners to quickly use Facebook marketing to generate leads for their business.\n\nThis course equates to over 8 hours of top-level Facebook Marketing training incuding a full 1 hour video on Facebook Advertising which details a dollar-a-day advertising blueprint every business should know.",

      "description": "In this course, I focused on how, you - as photographers- can reach your marketing objectives thanks to social media. Putting your business objectives at the center of my reflection, I chose six common goals that might occur in your everyday life.\nIn a few words, social media platforms are modern and mandatory tools to run your marketing. Nowadays, it is crucial to know how to design a social media strategy that fits your needs as a photographer. Putting in place a pattern you can replicate is a best practice, that is why it is important to know your target audience, your social media objectives, your brand voice, and how to establish a content plan.\nOnce done right, you can consider running brand awareness campaigns, and building a cohesive community on your social properties.\nWhen you succeed to gather people around your artwork, you will feel the need to increase your visibility and drive more traffic to your website, portfolio, e-commerce, or merch. Only then, you start considering increasing your sales thanks to social ads and social selling. Combine these two technics together and discover the beauty of increasing your income thanks to social media.\nDuring this course, I will take all these matters one by one and discuss them in-depth in different units. Every unit will cover one theme or marketing objective. And by the end of every unit, you can find a multiple answers test, to estimate how much you understood from the learning materials.\nWhen I conducted this course, my goal was to make happier photographers who can use their social media platforms like digital savvies, for more independence and increase their business opportunities, while staying connected in a creative discussion, especially after the global pandemic the world witnessed.",

Then I taught very basic but crucial points that must be taken care of while making a Facebook video ad or improving an existing Facebook Ad which includes adding social proof to your Facebook ads and what actually social proof is. Moreover, Pixels of Facebook video Ad and duration are also discussed in the course because there are some custom dimensions of videos that when played in mobiles then it will automatically cover a larger area of the screen which will draw the attention of the viewer for sure!\nAlso, as no one can remake a Facebook video ad just because it is in landscape mode, we showed how you can convert the video pixels online within minutes for Free. Furthermore, not only the best Facebook Ads bring sales but also selecting the best Facebook/Instagram Audience and Ad Placement bring many more conversions in very small time hence both are discussed deeply in the forth and Firth lecture of the course.\nAs we already know that unique Facebook ads bring more sale hence we not only discussed all its points but also we showed some tactics by which one can get royalty-free video and audio contents for their Facebook video ads to make them super unique. Captions and texts are very important in Facebook video ads because many people watch Facebook ads without sound hence we discussed how important it is to add texts and captions so that one can understand your Facebook video ad without voice too. Also, we did a practical video editing session in which we uploaded a video ad and improved it with canva for Facebook to bring more sales and clicks. In the next part, we make a new Facebook Video ad from scratch within 10 mins that include images, elements, texts, cool backgrounds and also a contact us page with logo address and email. and that video ad can be uploaded to Facebook or Instagram for marketing and for sure that type of Facebook ad brings good sales compared to simple picture Facebook Ads. Also, we discussed adding real-life examples to your Facebook VIdeo and Image ad so that the customer will directly engage him/herself in that ad which will bring good sales at the end.\nFacebook Pixels play a vital role in collecting the information about the audience that is coming to your website from Facebook and Instagram and hence we showed how you can connect Facebook pixels to your website step by step to get real tracking of website visitors.\nThe Best Facebook video ad with Best audience and ad Placement will bring very good results but all the effort is incomplete without the perfect and professional Title and Description of the Facebook Ad hence we discuss deeply how one can write Facebook Ad or Instagram Ad's Title and Description with hooks to attract more clients. In the end, I explained a simple trick to get Free traffic on your video ads so that you will get some extra fruits from your Video ads.\nWe are looking forward to having you in our student's list while getting better results of your ads after this course.

      "description": "TikTok - самая быстрорастущая социальная сеть в мире, которая предоставляет очень простую площадку для публикации и распространения контента. Платформа позволяет пользователям создавать короткие видеоролики с музыкой, фильтрами и некоторыми другими функциями. И на эту бесконечную ленту из контента очень легко подсесть.\nЧто такое ТикТок: для тех, кто совсем не в теме\nTikTok - это приложение для iOS и Android, которое можно использовать для создания и публикации коротких видеороликов. Первоначально оно было запущено под названием Douyin (Доуинь) в сентябре 2016 года в Китае. В 2017 году приложение было запущено китайской компанией ByteDance для рынков за пределами Китая. TikTok и Douyin используют одно и то же программное обеспечение, но поддерживают разные сетевые протоколы, чтобы соответствовать ограничениям китайской цензуры. TikTok доступен по всему миру в магазинах App Store или Google Play. В конце 2017 года компания-учредитель TikTok, ByteDance, выкупила приложение Musically и вышла на подростковый рынок США.\nГлавные преимущества TikTok по сравнению с другими соцсетями:\nэто развлекательная платформа с бесконечной лентой контента, она реально затягивает;\nпрактически любой может стать производителем контента из-за простоты использования приложения;\nполучать просмотры и лайки на этой платформе намного проще, чем в том же Instagram.\nПосле прохождения онлайн-курса вы овладеете основами ведения и продвижения TikTok аккаунта.\nПрограмма курса\nСтатистика TikTok и варианты продвижения\nОсобенности ведения личного бренда и аккаунтов для бизнеса\nРабота с контентом\nЭпоха коротких видео\nРабота с блогерами\nTikTok Ads\nРекомендации по работе с TikTok\n\n\nАвтор курса\nВячеслав Юренко, Основатель digital агентства 4limes\nСоучредитель и идейный вдохновитель 4Limes, Южной рекламной группы, Chernobyl Global, Global Remote Staff, туроператор Зима-Лето, консалтинговой компании МдМБ.",
