If you're working in the accounting sector, it's crucial to understand your obligations and how to spot the signs of money laundering.

While AI has produced effective fingerprinting results, it cannot adapt to a landscape of Social Engineering - where human behavior can change in an instant. Understanding the neuroscience of social engineering and the implications of fraud is important in detecting and preventing the loss of assets.\n\n\nThe course provides guidance and examples to understand why the human mind is affected by culture and biases and what drives malicious social engineering. This will enable companies to develop and improve fraud strategies, and processes and even reconstruct current workflows, requirements, and other decisions to combat fraud better.",

      "description": "APRESENTAÇÃO DO CURSO\nO conceito de Compliance possui duas conotações: o significado da palavra em si, ou seja, a etimologia da palavra e o sentido aplicado atualmente para caracterizar procedimentos éticos no ambiente de trabalho.\nEtimologicamente, Compliance deriva do latim complere e o seu significado está ligado à vontade de fazer o que foi pedido, ou de agir ou estar em concordância com regras, normas, condições. A literatura costuma fazer remissão ao verbo anglo-saxão “to comply”, que significa cumprir, ou seja, agir conforme uma regra, um comando e/ou um regulamento.\nNo sentido do mercado, Compliance refere-se a um programa que permite a uma organização ter a segurança que seus integrantes serão íntegros no comportamento, seguirão as normas, serão éticos nas atividades que desempenham e agirão sempre à luz das normas legais. Ao levar esse conceito para o ambiente de trabalho, fica entendido que ele mostra uma conformidade da empresa com as normas e leis de seu setor. Seguindo uma linha coerente, é possível evitar desgastes, problemas e corrupção dentro do meio corporativo, o que mantém uma postura mais firme da corporação e previne ações ilícitas.\nEste curso, com toda certeza, vai te preparar para implantar um Programa de Compliance, para reavivar e colocar em andamento na sua organização ou, ainda, para que você possa assessorar sua diretoria na implantação do referido programa.\nMesmo que você não atue na área específica do Compliance, os conhecimentos adquiridos contribuirão em muito para seu crescimento profissional e até mesmo futuras promoções.\n\n\nOBJETIVOS\na.

If so, we've got just the thing for you: a guide on how to craft high-quality AML narratives and reports that will impress even the most discerning Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs).\n\n\nUpdated captions\nUpdated general content, including the closed caption and subtitle.\nBonus Resource: Wolfsberg AML Principle on Political Exposed Persons (PEPs)\nVideos and voicing are being redone with new content\nWriting qualitative AML narratives and reports for FIUs should not be a nightmare.\nBy legislation, all reporting entities are obligated to generate specific reports, known as Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) or Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) in some jurisdictions, to the competent authority Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) for receiving these reports. It has been observed that most financial and non-financial Institutions struggle with sending quality Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) or Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to the FIUs mainly because these reports lack the salient information the analysts or investigators need to know. Most money laundering reporting officers (MLROs) are not skilled or are confused about how to proceed when needed. This is what this course seeks to address.\nStudents will learn the following:\n1. What is a suspicious transaction?\n2. Importance of writing and sending qualitative reports\n3. What an account officer must know ahead of time about a client’s information\n4. How an account officer should explain what a suspicion is and all others\n5. How not to send incomplete STRs/SARs narratives.\n6. Case study and class exercise.\nBy sending a qualitative report, the financial institution helps the financial intelligence analysts or investigators understand the suspicion, among other reasons.\nThis is the concluding part of a three-part course, “Identifying Suspicious Transactions” and “How to Report Suspicious Transactions Under the AML/CFT Regime.\".",

The questions relate to core topics in chapter two such as FATF, Egmont Group, Wolfsberg, etc. There are also questions on FATF-style regional bodies and carious legislation surrounding AML/CTF.\nThis is designed for people enrolled in the CAMS exam. If you need to reach out to me for any reason I'm happy to answer questions. I  have completed the CAMs exam and have a Master of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing from Charles Sturt and ACAMS.

      "description": "The need for labour reforms in India has been long-standing, particularly due to evolving market conditions post-globalization and the IT revolution's economic boom.\nIn response, the Indian government established the Second National Labour Commission on October 15, 1999, chaired by Mr. Ravindra Verma. The commission submitted its report on June 29, 2002. Based on its recommendations, the government began drafting new labour codes in 2015 to enhance ease of business. The four codes were finalized and approved by both houses in 2019.\nThese codes were drafted considering the commission's 60 recommendations. Recommendation 6 categorized them into four main types:\nCode on Wages\nSocial Security Code\nOccupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions Code (OSHW Code)\nIndustrial Relations Code (IR Code)\nOther recommendations were also incorporated into each code.\nThis course provides an overview of all codes, emphasizing the expected changes in the HR executive role following their implementation. While media coverage has been extensive, consensus exists that these codes will streamline compliance requirements for corporations. This will bring ease of business and reduce HR executive workloads, though social security and overtime compensation provisions will increase corporate financial burdens.\nThe financial implications have fueled corporate opposition. Coupled with trade union objections and the Covid-19 pandemic, this has delayed implementation.\nAs the pandemic subsides, the government is poised to resolve disputes and enforce the codes, pending state government rule formation. This necessitates detailed knowledge of the labour codes for HR executives and aspirants, for which this course serves as an initial step.",

      "description": "There was a wrong common thought that Risk Management is a secondary activity or function and not that important. Believers and followers of that school used to say that corporates should focus their time and efforts on revenue-generating activities only. In their views, those activities that need to be given too much importance are:\nSales, Logistics, Marketing and Finance not Risk Management. In the last two decades, we have seen many crisis and risks that made many big and famous companies go bankrupt and vanish from our business world due to lack of Enterprise risk management. Those cascading risks and crisis and their impacts on businesses turned the table on the followers of the old though.\nDid you hear about a company called Kodak?\nKodak dominated the Photography business for so long and it was manufacturing the films for the old cameras. Its films were the most famous and trusted ones in all studios all over the world. New digital cameras were introduced in the market which was a great competition “RISK” to KODAK. Kodak neglected that risk as they weren’t competent with Risk Management.\nGuess what was the result?\nKodak is not existing any more after dominating the whole world!\nI bet you are not one of those people who used to say that “Risk Management” is not important, that’s why you are reviewing my course right now!\nCongrats, you are on the right path to safeguard and secure your company’s assets and operations!\nThat course will teach you the whole cycle of Enterprise Risk Management step by step!\n\n\nTopics Covered are:\n- Nature and Causes of Risk\n- Risk types\n- Risk appetite & attitudes\n- Importance & Effectiveness of ERM\n- ISO 31000\n- COSO Framework\n- Setting the context of ERM\n- Risk identification / Event identification\n- Risk assessment, Mapping, Analysis & Evaluation\n- Risk Treatment, Actions & strategies\n- Risk Communication and Reporting\n- Monitoring, Reviewing & Documenting ERM\n- Role of Insurance Companies in ERM\n- ERM Information Systems & Software\n- Credit Rating Agencies\n-Real life ERM examples\n\n\nI hope you will enjoy the course and can’t wait to start that journey with you!",

Além de fornecer as ferramentas conceituais para compreensão, prevenção eficaz e conformidade regulatória na prevenção à lavagem de dinheiro, também forneceremos técnicas ESPECÍFICAS para a investigação de casos.

O verdadeiro elo perdido entre auditoria forense e conformidade ou investigação, conforme o caso.\nPasso a passo, em detalhes, indicaremos:\n1. Qual software selecionar\n2. Como baixá-lo na web e localizá-lo no seu dispositivo\n3. Como converter arquivos transacionais em formato de banco de dados (Excel) em uma versão de arquivo de texto adequada para processamento por software de interface gráfica\n4.

      "description": "This is anti-money laundering (AML) training – a compliance course designed for people who don’t particularly get excited about AML compliance training, but have to take it anyway, in order to satisfy compliance requirements set out by Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, better known as FINTRAC.\n\n\nThis is all driven by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), Canada’s federal laws to “facilitate combatting the laundering of proceeds of crime and combatting the financing of terrorist activities.”\n\n\nSo, in order for your company to stay operational, and keep making bank, it needs to show FINTRAC that it has a kickass compliance program. And in order for a compliance program to be kickass, it needs to have FIVE things: An appointed compliance officer; written compliance policies and procedures; a proper risk assessment of your company’s business activities and relationships; a written, ongoing compliance training program; and an effectiveness review of the company’s overall compliance program, in order to ensure it is doing everything it can to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing activities.\n\n\nThe course is designed for Canadian financial entities, securities dealers and life insurance companies. And after the course, you’ll know:\nHow your company is vulnerable to money laundering;\nHow to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activities;\nYour regulatory obligations, policies and procedures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing;\nKnow Your Client (KYC) requirements;\nWhen to identify individuals;\nBeneficial ownership requirements;\nConfirming the existence of an entity;\nPolitically exposed persons; and\nOngoing and enhanced monitoring.",

Pour sa part, le crime organisé génère 10 % du PIB mondial grâce à de nombreux crimes, dont certains à l'échelle transnationale.\nAu vu de ces chiffres choquants, il est évident que les organisations publiques et privées ne peuvent ignorer le phénomène de la fraude et doivent adopter des mesures appropriées pour la combattre.\nDans cette activité, nous analyserons le sujet depuis ses débuts, en comprenant la genèse de la fraude à travers la psychologie du fraudeur, son évolution par l'insertion dans une structure d'entreprise, et les mesures successives de prévention, de dissuasion et de détection que les organisations peuvent adopter pour lutter contre la fraude.\nNous explorerons ensuite en détail la méthodologie des enquêtes sur les fraudes, les documents qui sont générés tout au long de celle-ci et le rôle des auditeurs judiciaires dans le processus.\nBref, c'est une activité aussi nécessaire qu'intéressante pour ceux qui veulent acquérir ou élargir leurs connaissances dans la lutte contre la fraude sous toutes ses formes. Sans aucun doute, ce sera un cours précieux qui ne décevra pas les attentes de ceux qui le suivront",

      "description": "THE ULTIMATE PAYMENT SYSTEM FRAUD/DISPUTE MASTERCLASS\nYou'll find this ultimate masterclass contains two courses on payment system fraud and dispute:\nFundamentals of Fraud Prevention and Monitoring;\nIntroduction to Payment Dispute Resolution;\nTogether in this masterclass, you'll find the definitive experience for any payment professional that wants to diagnose and address any type of payment issue.\nYou will learn about dispute frameworks, fraud prevention tools and systems, internal processes, and more.\nMuch more.\n\n\n\n\nWHY FRAUD PREVENTION?\nIf you want to understand how fraud is committed, or how disputes are resolved, you'll see it's not that easy.\nYou'll find countless fraud techniques to take into account. You'll learn that perpetrators can be of different types and use different approaches. And you'll soon get to know that disputes can come in many shapes and sizes, and due to many different reasons.\nIf you're aiming to know more about fraud prevention an dispute resolution - whether as a fraud monitoring professional, a payments professional, a commercial banker, or any other type of professional that wants to master the theory and practice of both, you'll agree that finding the right information is crucial.\nUnfortunately, most fraud prevention or dispute resolution courses you'll find nowadays don't fit the minimum requirements.\nEither the information you come across is too academical and not something you can put into practice, or there are no specific examples, or information is just missing!\nIn a world where information must be constantly updated, you'll hardly find a reliable, comprehensive information source for fraud and disputes\nAnd this has consequences not just for your career, but yourself personally as well.\nWhat happens when you don't have enough information (or the adequate format)?\nYou'll become confused by the myriad fraud prevention techniques and types of systems, or the myriad dispute resolution frameworks;\nYou won't be able to properly identify when to use a certain technique to prevent a certain type of fraud of manage a certain dispute;\nYou'll become frustrated and irritated that you don't know why a system works, or why it doesn't;\nYou won't be able to properly identify why a fraud detection technique works, or whether a dispute resolution process works or not;\nYou won't know how to optimize a specific fraud prevention solution (or why it's not optimized), or a dispute resolution process - both in terms of people and machine problems;\nSo if you want to know everything about fraud and disputes, what is my proposed solution?\nThis new course masterclass, of course!\n\n\n\n\nTHE ULTIMATE FRAUD AND DISPUTE PREVENTION COURSE\nUnlike other fraud prevention or dispute resolution courses you'll find out there, this course is comprehensive and updated.\nIn other words, not only did I make sure that you'll find more topics (and more in-depth) than other courses you may find, but I also made sure to keep the information relevant to the types of fraud and disputes you'll find nowadays.\nBecause both fraud prevention systems and dispute resolution workflows seem complex, but they rely on simple principles and practices.\nIn this course, you'll learn about the essentials of how fraud is both performed and prevented, as well as how disputes and chargebacks are initiated, as well as managed. Information that comes both from the principles and theory present in the finance world, but also my own experience and insider knowledge, working with multiple institutional banks.\nIn this 11-hour+ masterclass, you'll find the following modules:\nIntroduction to Fraud Prevention and Monitoring (~4 hours)\nYou'll learn about the Fundamentals of Fraud (who are the perpetrators, how they obtain information, and how they commit fraud);\nYou'll get to know the main Approaches to Fraud (including general approaches of obtaining and using information, from identity theft, to convenience fraud, social engineering and more, specific techniques such as cash return fraud or card block fraud, and the different types of perpetrators);\nYou'll learn about all possible Fraud Prevention Techniques (individual techniques to prevent fraud including hotlists, velocity checks, and many others);\nYou'll learn about full Fraud Prevention Systems (how complete fraud prevention solutions are assembled and maintained, and best practices of doing so);\nIntroduction to Dispute Resolution (~2.5 hours)\nYou'll learn the Fundamentals of Disputes (how they occur, which parties are involved);\nYou'll get to know the ADR or Alternative Dispute Resolution framework (negotiation, mediation and arbitration, and when each should be used);\nYou'll learn what ODR or Online Dispute Resolution is (its context, steps, and implementations);\nYou'll get to know the principles of Dispute Resolution in Merchant Banking (how banks should deal with merchant disputes, process flow, and more);\nYou'll learn about all major Chargeback Reason Codes (an extensive list of the major categories of chargeback reason codes, from fraud to processing errors, authorization errors or consumer disputes, as well as guidelines for both banks and merchants);\nFundamentals of PCI-DSS (~5 hours)\nYou'll learn about the Essentials of PCI-DSS (assessment process, history, goals, etc);\nYou'll learn about the 12 Requirements of PCI-DSS v.3.2.1, and the specific controls demanded by every single one of them;\nBy the end of this course, you will know exactly how fraud is performed, how disputes occur and are resolved, how both can be prevented, in terms of principles and techniques, and how PCI-DSS compliance can be achieved.\nThe best of this masterclass? Inside you'll find all these 3 courses.\nIn short, even if you only fit one of the three profiles (only fraud, only disputes, only PCI-DSS), you will still have a course dedicated to it!\nAnd naturally, if you are interested in multiple of these topics... this is the ultimate package for you.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PERFECT COURSE... FOR WHOM?\nThis course is targeted at different types of people. Naturally, if you're any current or future fraud prevention/dispute resolution professional, you will find this course useful. If you're a commercial banker, you'll even fit both criteria. But if you're any other professional that aims to know more about fraud or disputes, you'll also find it useful.\nMore specifically, you're the ideal student for this course if:\nIntroduction to Fraud Prevention and Monitoring\nYou're someone who wants to know more about fraud execution itself (how fraud is performed, specific executions, and by whom);\nYou're someone who is interested in fraud prevention systems (how they work, how can they be optimized, what problems usually occur);\nYou're someone who wants to know about specific fraud prevention tools and how they act in combination (identity verification tools, technological tools, others, and how they come together);\nYou're someone who is interested in the role of both people and systems in fraud prevention (how to optimize both a system, but also the people working with that system);\nIntroduction to Dispute Resolution\nYou're someone who will directly deal with dispute management or resolution;\nYou're someone who wants to know more about the different types of dispute resolution (both litigation and ADR, offline or not);\nYou're someone who wants to specifically know how to address disputes involving merchants and cardholders (as a bank or merchant);\nYou're someone who wants to know more about the different types of reason codes for chargebacks (and how to prevent them);\nFundamentals of PCI-DSS\nYou're someone who will directly deal with PCI-DSS certification;\nYou're someone who regularly deals with card data and wants to know about the associated security controls;\nYou're someone in charge of specific controls in an organisation that deals with card data (firewall, antivirus, access control, media protection or disposal, etc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this masterclass covers:\nFrom Fundamentals of Fraud Prevention and Monitoring\nYou'll learn about the general approaches to fraud, including convenience, social engineering, internal fraud and identity theft;\nYou'll learn about how convenience fraud works, with easily accessible information that can be used to commit fraud;\nYou'll learn about how social engineering works, manipulating people into giving up confidential information;\nYou'll learn about how internal fraud works, by leveraging internal information to facilitate fraud;\nYou'll learn about how identity theft works, by having enough information about someone to impersonate them;\nYou'll learn about the different execution types of fraud, including consumer fraud, card block fraud, single-use fraud, cash return fraud, collusive and affiliate fraud, and dynamic or morphing fraud;\nYou'll learn about how consumer fraud works, by lying about product characteristics or other elements to obtain returns or cash;\nYou'll learn about how card block fraud works, generating a batch of card numbers and gauging which are insecure, to be later exploited in purchases;\nYou'll learn about how single-use fraud works, by making one single purchase in a merchant (or multiple), being harder to catch;\nYou'll learn about how cash return fraud works, by buying products with a stolen card and returning them for cash;\nYou'll learn about how dynamic or morphing fraud works, by changing fraud execution to bypass fraud detection;\nYou'll learn about fraud prevention techniques relying on data verification, including velocity checks, card verifications, charge and deposit verifications;\nYou'll learn about how velocity checks work, by analyzing the number of times a credit card (or another field) is either used or changed within a given period of time;\nYou'll learn about how card verifications work, such as Mod10, BIN, and/or card security schemes, both for data integrity and identity verification;\nYou'll learn about how charge verifications work (verifying a charge with the bank) and deposit verifications (making a deposit to verify a bank account);\nYou'll learn about fraud prevention techniques relying on identity verification including lists, field verifications, address verifications, manual authentication and automated lookups;\nYou'll learn about how lists work - both hotlists and warm lists of known offenders, but also whitelists for trusted clients;\nYou'll learn about how simple field verifications work for email, age, and others - quick, but not very effective security measures;\nYou'll learn about how address verifications work, for both the billing and shipping addresses (the latter being more complex and expensive, but a lot more secure in terms of preventing fraud);\nYou'll learn about how manual authentication works - by having someone call the client to verify a transaction, or manually search information to verify their identity (usually done by bank staff for KYC requirements);\nYou'll learn about how automated lookups of addresses or phone numbers work, mostly to double-check existing information;\nYou'll learn about fraud prevention techniques relying on technology (device or token identification, digital signatures and/or consumer location);\nYou'll learn about how device or token identification works, by using software such as cookies or hardware such as USB dongles, smart cards or biometrics in order to tie a device to a specific person, and authenticate them using that device;\nYou'll learn about how digital signatures work, through asymmetric cryptography, authenticating a transaction through the person's private key;\nYou'll learn about how consumer location techniques work - both in terms of tracking someone's IP or proxy (including VPN), or through their cell phone GPS location;\nYou'll learn about how fraud scoring and fraud rules can work to prevent fraud - appearing to be competing solutions, but actually working well together under certain conditions;\nYou'll learn about fraud prevention techniques that are actual processes of institutions, including insurance, guarantees, manual reviews and representment;\nYou'll learn about how insurance and guaranteed payments work, helping reimburse a merchant in the case of fraud, but representing an overhead in terms of costs and being restrictive in terms of the transactions accepted;\nYou'll learn about how manual reviews by banks help guarantee the authenticity of a transaction, and how representment of information by the acquiring bank can help a merchant, but both with unstable results and high costs;\nYou'll learn about technique considerations when assembling fraud prevention strategies, including determining the risk level of an entity, and the recommended techniques based on it;\nYou'll learn about considerations in terms of the usage of fraud data - fraud rules, fraud scores, and guaranteeing consistency in the database;\nYou'll learn about considerations in terms of the processing of fraud data - making sure that database field changes are documented, and that ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes don't ruin the data between operational DB and data warehouse;\nFrom Introduction to Payment Dispute Resolution\nYou'll learn about the essentials of disputes (contractual vs. non-contractual disputes, payment disputes, issuer and acquirer banks);\nYou'll learn about how ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) is and how it differs from litigation;\nYou'll learn what the different types of ADR are (negotiation, mediation and arbitration), as well as the differences between these, and specific implementations of them;\nYou'll learn about the ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) framework, as well as its context and six key principles (accountability, transparency, accessibility, credibility/accreditation, security and enforceability);\nYou'll learn about the three major steps in an ODR process;\nYou'll learn about the three major types of ODR tools (cyber courts, electronic ADR, internal ADR);\nYou'll learn about implementations of ODR (such as blind bidding, cyber mediation, cyber negotiation and cyber arbitration), as well as specific case studies, such as ICANN-WIPO;\nYou'll learn about general guidelines for more efficient dispute resolution as a merchant bank;\nYou'll learn about the steps in the lifecycle of a dispute between an issuer and an acquirer bank, including the retrieval request, chargeback, and second chargeback;\nYou'll learn about the conditions under which the payment scheme may become involved in a chargeback, as well as some measures by them (allocation vs. mediation, pre-arbitration vs. arbitration, liability shifts);\nYou'll learn about disputes by different payment systems: debit cards, credit cards, ACH, prepaid cards, ATM;\nYou'll learn about the four major categories of chargeback reason codes: fraud, authorization errors, processing errors,  customer disputes;\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to fraud (not authorised or recognised transactions, fraudulent processing, monitored merchant or monitored card, the EMV liability shift);\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to authorization issues (missing or declined authorisation, card in recovery/lost card/stolen card, invalid authorization information),\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to processing errors (late presentment, invalid transaction code or invalid transaction data, duplicated payment or paid by other means, currency mismatches);\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to consumer disputes (mismatches in terms of goods - counterfeit, misrepresented, not delivered, others - cancelled or incomplete transactions, credit not processed);\nFrom Fundamentals of PCI-DSS:\nYou'll learn about the clarification of all terms used in the PCI-DSS, including what is the CDE, what is CHD, SAD, whether an organisation must take an ROC or SAQ, as well as some \"general\" payment industry terms such as what is an issuing bank and an acquiring bank;\nYou'll learn about the history of the PCI-DSS since 2004, with several iterations and its own release lifecycle;\nYou'll learn about the merchant assessment process, based on their classification from Level 1-4, and how both SAQs and ROCs work, as well as the 8 different types of SAQs, and the types of machines/merchants they target, including the SAQ-A and SAQ-A-EP, the SAQ-B and SAQ-B-IP, the SAQ-C and SAQ-C-VT, the SAQ-P2PE-HW, and finally, the most general SAQ-D;\nYou'll learn about the anatomy of a payment process, involving a cardholder and a merchant, from authorisation to authentication, clearing and settlement, and the role of the issuing bak, the acquiring bank and the card company;\nYou'll learn about an overview of all 12 PCI-DSS requirements, as well as their relationship with the 6 goals;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 1 (Have a Firewall), including firewall configurations and standards, documentation on network topology and card data flows, setting up a DMZ, rejecting unsecured traffic, and more;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 2 (No Defaults), about removing default passwords/accounts/strings from devices, but also isolating server functionality and removing unnecessary ports/services/apps that may present vulnerabilities;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 3 (Protect Stored Data), about using strong encryption to protect cardholder data, as well as having proper data retention policies, data purging, as well as masking plaintext PANs, not storing SAD, and using proper key management and key lifecycle procedures;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 4 (Protect Transmitted Data), about using strong encryption when transmitting CHD across public networks such as cellular or satellite, as well as masking plaintext PANs in transit, especially across IM channels;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 5 (Prevent Malware), about having an antivirus solution on all commonly affected computers in order to prevent malware, as well as access control policies to prevent disabling AV software;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 6 (Develop Securely), about doing vulnerability ranking and timely patch installation for both internal and 3rd-party applications, as well as including security requirements in the SDLC, as well as training developers to protect against common exploits such as code injections, buffer overflows and many others;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 7 (Need-to-Know Access), about limiting access to CHD by personnel as much as possible, defining permissions by role, and having a formal mechanism for access control to consolidate this, such as LDAP, AD or ACLs;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 8 (Identify Access), about tying each action to a unique user, including forcing unique IDs, automatic logouts on inactivity, lockouts on wrong password attempts, removing inactive accounts, limiting third-party access, forbidding the use of shared IDs, forcing physical security measures to be used only by the intended user, and more;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 9 (Restrict Physical Access), about authorising and distinguishing visitors, enforcing access control to rooms with CHD, as well as the proper transport, storage and disposal of physical media containing CHD, with different sensitivity levels;\nYou'll learn all about Requirement 10 (Monitor Networks), about logging.

Nous y abordons des thématiques aussi diverses et variées que l’histoire de l’audit shariatique, ses règles de fonctionnement, sa place dans l’organigramme, sa supervision et la gestion de la zakat. Ensuite nous planchons sur les risques éventuels liés à la pratique de la finance islamique. Ils sont également existants mais parfois différents des risques bancaires classiques. Enfin nous découvrons quelles sont les perspectives à venir pour la finance islamique ainsi que les principaux défis qui guettent la discipline dans le cadre de son développement futur. Ils sont nombreux et sont tout autant une source de crainte qu’ils constituent des perspectives d’amélioration certaines car cela reste une discipline toujours en plein développement",

We initiate our journey by providing an in-depth overview of the current landscape of sustainability reporting practices. Subsequently, we delve into the intricacies of two pivotal frameworks designed to facilitate the establishment of an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting system.\nThe first framework, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), places a strong emphasis on a multi-stakeholder approach, ensuring a holistic perspective. The second framework revolves around the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S1 and S2, tailored to cater primarily to investor stakeholders' interests.\nOur exploration extends to both the external and internal facets of ESG reporting, encompassing environmental, social, and governance dimensions of sustainability management. We take a deep dive into issues like modern slavery, examining its relevance to firms and supply chains, especially in the context of developing economies. Furthermore, we scrutinize the implications of the ESG reporting insights for the assurance function.\nThe course proceeds to tackle significant topics such as the carbon tax, emissions trading, and the reporting of Scope 3 emissions. Finally, we delve into the strategies for integrating this crucial information into decision-making processes within an organization, with a particular focus on the measurement and allocation of costs in the realm of sustainability management accounting. We finally provide a brief insight into where manufacturing is concerning sustainability management and the adoption of AI.",

Haksız da sayılmazlar çünkü iç denetçi ilanlarını incelerseniz göreceksiniz ki hemen hepsinde CIA sertifikası olanların tercih edileceği belirtiliyor.\n2 - Daha fazla kazanmak istiyorlar.\nDünya çapında yapılan anketlerden sertifikalı iç denetçilerin %51 oranında daha fazla kazandıklarını öğreniyoruz. Elbette rakamların büyüsüne kapılmamak gerekir çünkü bu denetçiler sadece sertifikayı aldıkları için çok kazanmıyor. Bu sertifikayı bir nişan gibi kendi becerilerini işverenlere sunmak için kullanıyorlar ve maaş pazarlıklarında elleri güçleniyor.\n3 - Daha hızlı terfi etmek istiyorlar.\nÖzellikle finans kurumlarında sertifikalı iç denetçiler daha hızlı yükselebiliyorlar. Hatta sertifika sahibi olmak işverenler tarafından özendiriliyor. Kamuda sertifikası olanlar aday belirleme sınavına katılmadan doğrudan Kamu İç Denetçisi eğitim programına katılabiliyor ve kariyerine kamu iç denetçisi olarak devam etme imkanına kavuşuyor.\n4 - Mesleklerini ve \"kendilerini\" seviyorlar.\nKim işini sevenden daha başarılı ve aynı zamanda mutlu olabilir ki? Özellikle kendini seven insanlar, işbaşında oldukları sürece becerilerini geliştirmek için sertifikalar alıyorlar. Denetçiler için de elbette alınabilecek en değerli sertifika bu. Bu sertifikayı almak hiç kolay değil. Ciddi bir emek ortaya koymak, çok çalışmak gerekiyor. Herkesin sahip olamayacağı bir sertifikayı almış olmanın gururu anlatılmaz ancak yaşanır.\nŞunu sakın unutmayın tek bir sertifika almak size iş bulmakta, terfi etmekte, iş değiştirmekte ve haklı gururunuzu belgelemekte sadece \"yardımcı\" olur. Kesin ve mucizevi bir başarı reçetesi değildir.\nİş dünyasını dev ve vahşi bir orman gibi düşünün. Sertifika sizin bu ormanda kullanabileceğiniz bir silahtır sadece. Belki ormandan çıkacağınız yani emekli olup dinlenmeye geçeceğiniz zamana kadar hiç kullanmayacaksınız, belki de hemen her ağacın arkasında sizi bekleyen tehlikeleri bunun sayesinde savuşturacaksınız. Bilemezsiniz!\nBazıları bu ormana çıplak elleriyle girer ve diğer ucundan kazasız belasız çıkıverir. Kimi talihsizler ise onlarca silahı olduğu halde çıkmayı başaramaz. Gerçi çıplak ellerle ormana dalanların sağ salim çıkma olasılığını tahmin etmek için istatistikçi olmaya gerek yok, değil mi?\nZaman ve imkan varken hazır olmak en güzeli.\nBu kursta YouTube kanalımda ücretsiz olarak yayınladığım Sertifikalı İç Denetçi (CIA -Certified Internal Auditor) sınavına hazırlık videolarını bir araya getirdim.\nBu kursu bitirdiğinizde 1. bölüm sınavında %15 ağırlığı olan \"bağımsızlık ve objektiflik\" konusunda bilgi sahibi olacaksınız.\nBölüm sonlarında konuların kafanızda pekişmesini sağlamak için beşer adet örnek soru da bulunuyor.\nDaha fazla örnek soru için YouTube video kanalımı ziyaret edebilir veya diğer Udemy kurslarımı da inceleyebilirsiniz.\nVideolarda sadece müfredata bağlı kalmadan denetim sektöründeki tecrübelerimi de ekleyerek konuları açıklamaya çalıştım.\nDaha kapsamlı ve yazılı konu anlatımları için piyasada bulunan Türkçe kaynakları yine YouTube kanalımda anlattım.\nMutlaka kanalı ziyaret edin ve abone olunki yeni videolar yayınlanır yayınlanmaz ilk sizin haberiniz olsun.\nSorularınızı ve önerilerinizi sosyal medya kanallarımdan veya metinserenakinci@gmeil.com üzerinden iletebilirsiniz.\nŞimdiden Başarılar!",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Bank Audit: Your Guide to Becoming a Bank Auditor course by Uplatz.\n\n\nA Bank Audit is a regular evaluation of the organization's records and services to verify that they are in conformity with industry rules and regulations. Banks must undergo a variety of audits, including statutory audits, revenue audits, concurrent audits, and so on. This may be done by external or internal organizations. A bank audit is a process carried out by an auditor designated by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) and the ICAI (The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India) to review the financial accounts of banking institutions and to determine if they are complying with the legislation and regulatory framework in place.\nIn essence, bank audit is a process in which a bank's financial statements are audited by an auditor designated by the RBI and the ICAI to determine if the bank is in compliance with the appropriate regulatory framework. It is not something that is done on a daily basis or throughout the year but instead, for the vast majority of auditors and audit firms, it is a once-a-year effort, and as a consequence, most auditors' understanding of crucial areas will be restricted.\n\n\nThe Certification for Bank Auditors (CBA) is a credential for bankers who want to advance their status and authority in internal auditing. The CBA curriculum is meant to fit with current knowledge and employs an integrated yet customizable framework for internal auditing, giving more credibility to contemporary audit technique with a focus on IT audit. The current CBA is an upgrade of the Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers' Certificate in Internal Auditing for Financial Institutions (CIAFIN) (AICB).\nIn order to comply with legal and jurisdictional requirements, laws, and industry standards, every financial service organization must undertake audits on a regular basis. A bank auditor is a kind of accounting professional that does bank audits. A bank audit may be conducted as an internal audit, which is conducted by a financial institution employee, or as an external audit, which is conducted by an independent auditor under the supervision of a certified public accountant (CPA). A financial company must keep track of all transactions at all times. A comprehensive and unabating review system is required for a business like a bank. As a result, a concurrent audit is required. A bank audit is a simultaneous inspection of financial transactions, i.e. an examination that takes place at the moment the transaction occurs. It is a component of a bank's early warning system for detecting breaches or abnormalities in a timely manner.\n\n\nThis Bank Audit course gives a thorough conceptual and practical introduction to auditing in the modern world. It focuses on principles and applications relevant to the professional obligations of financial-statement auditors, as well as important aspects of the audit process such as risk assessment and audit reporting. Financial statement audits and associated services are usually offered by Certified Public Accountants in the United States (CPAs). This bank audit course stimulates critical thinking and careful communication skills concerning audit professionals' decision contexts, decision processes, and deliverables.\nThis Bank Audit course is best suited for professionals who have in-depth understanding of the subject or who want to broaden their knowledge base, and who are in a mid-level position within an organization with operational or supervisory duties, or both. The bank audit will look at trust preferred securities, financial guarantees, financial asset transfers and servicing, and much more. This training will also be most useful to individuals new to bank and financial institution accounting who may be at the staff or entry level in the business, as well as seasoned professionals with limited exposure to bank and financial institution accounting. The ultimate goal of this course is to help you understand the end-to-end process of how to conduct bank audit and finally how to become a bank auditor.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\n\n\nTo augment banks' efforts in conducting internal checks of transactions and other verifications, as well as compliance with established processes\nTo increase the efficacy of banks' concurrent audit systems\nTo improve the quality and scope of concurrent audit reports\nHow to conduct bank audit\nHow to become a bank auditor\n\n\nBank Audit: Your Guide to Becoming a Bank Auditor - Course Curriculum\n\n\nWhat is a bank?\nWhat are the types of banks?\nWhat are the banking operation and regulatory and legal frameworks of bank in India?\nWhat is the accounting system of banks?\nWhat will be the approach of bank audit?\nWhat is the income recognition system of bank?\nWho will be eligible to appoint as an auditor of the bank?\nWhat will be the eligibility, qualifications and disqualifications of auditor?\nWhat will be the amount of remuneration of auditor?\nWhat are the powers of auditor?\nWhat will be the form and content of financial statements of the bank?\nHow to conduct audit of bank?\nWhat will be the internal control in certain selected areas?\nWhat is the compliance with CRR and SLR requirements?\nHow to verify the assets of the bank?\nHow to verify the capital & liabilities of the bank?\nWhat is the bank audit reports and type of bank audit reports?\nWhat will be the format of bank audit report?\nWhat are advances?\nHow to conduct audit of advances?\nHow to conduct audit of revenue items?\nHow to compute drawing power?\nWhat is Concurrent audit of bank?\nWhat is Audit Committee?",

      "description": "This course covers how to file Dormant Company Accounts at Companies House in the UK. It is a very practical course that is a must-have for all UK Company Directors and Company Secretaries. As a Company Director, you are responsible for filing company accounts annually with Companies House, even if your company has not traded.

Filing dormant accounts can be a daunting task, but our step-by-step guide makes it easy for you to file your dormant company accounts yourself. Save on expensive accountants filing fees and get the job done yourself.\n\n\nOur course is unique in that it is designed to be extremely practical, making it easy for you to follow along and file your dormant company accounts quickly and efficiently. With our easy-to-follow guide, you can save time, effort, and energy and avoid late filing penalties. You can save many years of accountancy fees if (like many people) you want to hold onto a company name for a few years, but to keep it dormant (non-trading) which is a sensible strategy as a potential competitor could come along and take the name. And this can cause untold problems.\n\n\nThis course is perfect for UK Company Directors and Company Secretaries who have a limited company that is not trading. However, it is also useful for accountants or bookkeepers who are filing for their clients for the first time or individuals who need to file for themselves.\n\n\nWe look at limited (LTD) company dormant filing, Community Interest Company (CIC) dormant filing and limited liability partnership (LLP) dormant filing - all practical examples.\n\n\nInvesting in our \"Filing Dormant Company Accounts\" course is a wise decision that will benefit you and your company in the long run. Avoid the stress and cost of late filing penalties, and learn how to file your dormant company accounts with ease.

In my opinion as well as based on my experience, the ACAMS exam is not tough like the CFA or ACCA, but it still requires us to go through all the knowledge in the book.\nThis test includes 200 questions covering all chapters in the textbook: Risks and methods of money laundering and terrorist financing (Chapter 1), International AML/CFT Standards (Chapter 2), Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorist Financing Compliance Programs (Chapter 3), Conducting and Responding to Investigations (Chapter 4), Glossary of Terms (Chapter 5). There are several types of questions in this test such as Yes/No questions, Situational questions, multiple-choice questions, multi-select questions, fill-in-blank questions. Most importantly, each question has a clear answer with very detailed explanations and pointing out which part of the book you should revise. This test not only helps you to revise your knowledge but also prepares you for the physiological rigors of the exam. Practice makes perfect!!!!!\nHere are my tips. I hope it will help you guys to pass the exam.\n1. You should read the study guide at least 03 times.\n- The first time: roughly read the whole study guide. It is normal if you can’t remember all the knowledge because the amount of content is large. However, you should try your best to get to know the concepts.\n- The second time: After understanding, I summarized each chapter in my own way. I highlighted contents which I considered to be important or hard to remember.\n- The third time: review and try to memorize the content in your summary. (Finally, you should take the mock test. In case you get wrong answers, you open the book and only review the related content).\n2. I know many people said that questions in Chapter 6 are quite easy so you can ignore or skim through the questions. No no, try to understand and remember all the questions & answers in this chapter. Believe me, you will thank me when you have already taken the real exam.\n3. When you take the exam, make sure that you reach each question carefully & carefully & carefully. Be prepared that 30% of questions in the exam are long scenario-based questions.\n4. I know many test takers have years of experience in this field so they ignore the study guide and just use their experience to take the exam. DON’T DO THAT. Experience is subjective. 99% of questions are taken from books. You can ignore all e-learning from the website of CAMS (except for the sample questions). Remember that STUDY GUIDE IS VERY IMPORTANT.",

En efecto, es quien debe proveer aseguramiento al Comité de Auditoría y por su intermedio a la Junta Directiva respecto del buen funcionamiento del sistema de control interno. Por lo tanto, la Auditoría Interna debe velar por el cumplimiento normativo y legal, el debido reporte financiero y contable y la eficiencia de la gestión. En tal carácter, monitorea el accionar de todas las unidades, proyectos y procesos de la organización.\nPero la pregunta es: ¿quién examina al examinador? En tal sentido, el IIA – Institute of Internal Auditors, Instituto de Auditores Internos (global), ha previsto en las Normas Internacionales para el Ejercicio Profesional de la Auditoría Interna, la obligación, para todas las Auditorías Internas, de mantener un programa de aseguramiento de calidad. Programa que debe examinarse por uno o más expertos independientes al menos una vez cada cinco años.\nEn este seminario abordaremos el establecimiento del programa de revisión y las alternativas para su validación independiente. Desde los conceptos básicos y fundacionales de calidad y su aplicación a la Auditoría Interna, el establecimiento de indicadores de gestión y desempeño hasta las tres modalidades de revisión externa:\n1. Revisión externa directa\n2. Revisión externa con autoevaluación previa\n3. Revisión externa con autoevaluación previa asistida por un consultor independiente\nEste curso es imprescindible para quienes aspiran a establecer, dirigir o supervisar una auditoría interna de clase mundial y ajustada a Normas",

Consequences of Non-Compliance\nMethods of Risk Mitigation and Prevention of Compliance Violations\nEmerging Trends and Future Outlook in Regulatory Compliance\n\n\nRegulatory Compliance refers to an organization's adherence to laws, regulations, guidelines, and specifications relevant to its business processes. These rules can be external (governmental, industry-specific) or internal (company policies).\n\n\nImportance of Developing Regulatory Compliance Skills for Managers and Companies:\n1. Risk Mitigation:\nLegal and Financial Penalties: Non-compliance can lead to hefty fines, lawsuits, and even criminal charges for managers. By understanding regulations, managers can proactively identify potential risks and ensure compliance, thus safeguarding their companies' financial health.\nReputational Damage: Regulatory violations can tarnish a company's reputation, leading to loss of customer trust, decreased sales, and difficulty attracting investors. A manager skilled in compliance can prevent such scenarios.\nOperational Disruptions: Non-compliance can lead to business interruptions or shutdowns. Managers with a strong compliance background can ensure smooth operations by implementing effective controls and procedures.\n\n\n2. Strategic Advantage:\nCompetitive Edge: Companies with robust compliance programs are often viewed as more reliable and trustworthy by customers and partners. This can translate to increased business opportunities and market share.\nInnovation: A deep understanding of regulatory landscapes can help managers identify opportunities for innovative products or services that meet emerging compliance requirements.\nInvestor Confidence: Investors are more likely to invest in companies with strong compliance records, as it demonstrates responsible management and reduces investment risk.\n\n\n3. Career Advancement for Managers:\nIncreased Employability: Regulatory compliance is a sought-after skill set across industries. Managers who possess this expertise are highly valued and have a broader range of career opportunities.\nLeadership Roles: Compliance often involves cross-functional collaboration and strategic decision-making, making it an excellent stepping stone to senior management positions.\nPersonal Growth: Staying updated on complex regulations requires continuous learning, which contributes to professional development and enhances a manager's overall skillset.\n\n\n4. Ethical and Social Responsibility:\nProtecting Consumers and Employees: Compliance with regulations ensures that products, services, and workplaces are safe for consumers and employees.\nSustainability: Many regulations address environmental concerns. Complying with these rules demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility.\n\n\nDeveloping skills in regulatory compliance is not just a matter of following rules. It's about understanding the broader impact of regulations on businesses and society. By mastering this field, managers can protect their companies, advance their careers, and contribute to a safer and more sustainable business environment.",

        "Regulatory Compliance refers to an organization's adherence to laws, regulations, guidelines, and specifications relevant to its business processes. These rules can be external (governmental, industry-specific) or internal (company policies). Importance of Developing Regulatory Compliance Skills for Managers and Companies: 1. Risk Mitigation: Legal and Financial Penalties: Non-compliance can lead to hefty fines, lawsuits, and even criminal charges for managers. By understanding regulations, managers can proactively identify potential risks and ensure compliance, thus safeguarding their companies' financial health. Reputational Damage: Regulatory violations can tarnish a company's reputation, leading to loss of customer trust, decreased sales, and difficulty attracting investors. A manager skilled in compliance can prevent such scenarios. Operational Disruptions: Non-compliance can lead to business interruptions or shutdowns. Managers with a strong compliance background can ensure smooth operations by implementing effective controls and procedures. 2. Strategic Advantage: Competitive Edge: Companies with robust compliance programs are often viewed as more reliable and trustworthy by customers and partners. This can translate to increased business opportunities and market share. Innovation: A deep understanding of regulatory landscapes can help managers identify opportunities for innovative products or services that meet emerging compliance requirements. Investor Confidence: Investors are more likely to invest in companies with strong compliance records, as it demonstrates responsible management and reduces investment risk.",
        "3. Career Advancement for Managers: Increased Employability: Regulatory compliance is a sought-after skill set across industries. Managers who possess this expertise are highly valued and have a broader range of career opportunities. Leadership Roles: Compliance often involves cross-functional collaboration and strategic decision-making, making it an excellent stepping stone to senior management positions. Personal Growth: Staying updated on complex regulations requires continuous learning, which contributes to professional development and enhances a manager's overall skillset. 4. Ethical and Social Responsibility: Protecting Consumers and Employees: Compliance with regulations ensures that products, services, and workplaces are safe for consumers and employees. Sustainability: Many regulations address environmental concerns. Complying with these rules demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Developing skills in regulatory compliance is not just a matter of following rules. It's about understanding the broader impact of regulations on businesses and society. By mastering this field, managers can protect their companies, advance their careers, and contribute to a safer and more sustainable business environment."

To mitigate such effects Government set out some rules and regulations to counter such elements which organisation will implement in its organisation.\nMoney laundering is generally described as the process by which criminals attempt to hide or disguise the true origin and ownership of the proceeds of their criminal activities, including terrorist financing, thereby avoiding prosecution, conviction and confiscation of criminal funds. The prevention of terrorist financing is included in all the Firm’s policies, procedures, systems and controls for the prevention of money laundering.\nSuch operations may be complex but, in essence, they comprise three basic stages, as follows:\n(i) Placement – the placing of “dirty” money into the financial system;\n(ii) Layering - the process of moving “dirty” money within the financial system to conceal the source of the funds;\n(iii) Integration - the withdrawal of “cleaned” money from the financial system for the purpose of general expenditure or purchase of business or financial assets or real estate in furtherance of criminal activity.\nIn this course keeping in view such rules and regulations we have defined and set the standards regarding roles, objectives and responsibilities for countering Money Laundering and Terror Financing. This course will clearly mention the role of staff to identify, assess and report suspicions.\nThis course will clearly define Know your Customer, Customer Due Diligence, Identifying suspicion, assess the suspicion on some parameters defined under AML Regulations. The role of compliance Officer does not end upon suspicion but start as compliance officer has to take actions upon the suspicion and report to the regulator in a pre-defined mechanism. Reporting of Currency Transaction beyond the threshold defined by AML regulations is also a role of compliance officer and retention of record for certain period defined.\nSee you in the course",

By understanding the definition and importance of intraternships, navigating the intraternship process, maximizing the experience, overcoming challenges, and exploring the future of intraternships, you will be equipped with the knowledge and insights to make the most of this unique pathway to success.\nAn intraternship can be defined as an internship offered within a company or organization where the intern is currently employed.

That's exactly what an intraternship offers. It's an opportunity for employees to expand their horizons and explore different aspects of their organization.\nPicture this: You've been working in the marketing department of a large corporation for a couple of years now.

Bu sertifikayı bir silah gibi düşünün. İş dünyası / kariyer dediğimiz dev vahşi bir orman içinde size faydalı olabilecek bir silah. Bunu yerinde ve doğru kullanabilirseniz hayatta kalma şansınız artar ancak kullanmayı beceremezseniz işiniz Allah'a kalmıştır. Aklını kullanan ve biraz şanslı olanlar silahsız bile o ormandan çıkabilir ama dikkatli olmazsanız silahla bile çıkamayabilirsiniz.\nPeki işverenler neden iş ilanlarında CIA sertifikasına sahip denetçileri tercih ettiklerini belirtiyorlar?\nCIA sertifikası olan adaylar işverenler için de çok faydalı çünkü;\n- Denetim kavram ve yöntemlerine hakim olduklarından şüphe duyulmuyor.\n- Denetçi temel eğitimleri için çok daha az bir bütçe ve zaman yeterli oluyor.\n- Denetim ekiplerinin ne kadar kaliteli olduğunu somut olarak gösterebiliyorlar.\n\n\nBu kursu satın alarak sadece sınava hazırlanmış olmayacaksınız. Sınav süreçleri konusunda kafanıza takılan konuları sorabileceğiniz, sınav soruları hakkında takıldığınız yerlerde size destek olabilecek, ümitsizliğe kapıldığınızda size manevi olarak destek verebilecek bir hocanız da olacak.\n\n\nBu kursta sunulan soru setinde aşağıdaki listede ikinci sırada yer alan Yetkinlik & Gereken (Azami) Mesleki Özen konularına ilişkin 3 adet 25'er soruluk 3 adet deneme sınavı bulunuyor.\n\n\nSertifikalı iç denetçi olmak için 3 farklı sınavı geçmek gerekir.\nBu sınavlardan birincisi 6 ana bölümden oluşuyor:\n1- İç Denetimin Temelleri (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %15)\n2- Bağımsızlık ve Objektiflik (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %15)\n3- Yetkinlik ve Gereken Mesleki Özen (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %18)\n4- Kalite Güvence ve Geliştirme Programı (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %7)\n5- Yönetişim, Risk Yönetimi ve Kontrol (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %35)\n6- Sahtekarlık ve Suiistimal Riskleri (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %10)\n\n\nSertifikalı İç Denetçi (CIA) sınavında bir bölümü geçmek için en az 600 puan almanız gerekir. En yüksek not 750 olduğu için tüm soruları %80 oranında doğru yanıtlamalısınız.

It is therefore critical to understand the importance of that when entering a B-BBEE deal.\n- Rules to abide by\n- Formulas\n- Calculations\nUnder the generic scorecard, 8 points is allocated to Net Value under the ownership scorecard. Should a measured entity not receive a minimum of 3.2 / 8 for this indicator, it effectively means that the measured entity would be discounted with one level.\n\nIt can become a technical point, but effectively it measures the value created in the hands of black people taking into consideration variables like:\n1. The debt portion coupled to the shares – if there is a debt portion, either to the measured entity itself or a third party, this will have an effect on the value creation.\n2. The value of the measured entity – if this decreased since the acquisition date, this effectively means the value of the share has decreased as well. The debt(liability) portion will most like increase due to interest, and therefore your value has decreased compared to debt, and this will have a negative effect on the outcome.\nThe Amended Codes provide a graduation factor over 10 years to reach unencumbered black shareholding.",

Ascertainment of price for the contract of sale.\nINTRODUCTION\nSale of goods is one of the specific forms of contracts recognized and regulated by law in India. Sale is a typical bargain between the buyer and the seller. The Sale of Goods Act, 1930 allows the parties to modify the provisions of the law by express stipulations. However, in some cases, this freedom is severely restricted. Sale of Goods Act, 1930 is an Act to define and amend the law relating to the sale of goods. It extends to the whole of India. It came into force on 1st July, 1930.\nSUMMARY\nIn nutshell, contract of sale of goods is a contract where the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price. Where, however, the transfer of property in goods is to take place at a future date or subject to some conditions to be fulfilled, the contract is called ‘agreement to sell’. The subject matter of such contract must always be goods. Price for goods may be fixed by the contract or may be agreed to be fixed later on in a specific manner.\nCONTENTS\n1.

Aklını kullanan ve biraz şanslı olanlar silahsız bile o ormandan çıkabilir ama dikkatli olmazsanız silahla bile çıkamayabilirsiniz.\nPeki işverenler neden iş ilanlarında CIA sertifikasına sahip denetçileri tercih ettiklerini belirtiyorlar?\nCIA sertifikası olan adaylar işverenler için de çok faydalı çünkü;\n- Denetim kavram ve yöntemlerine hakim olduklarından şüphe duyulmuyor.\n- Denetçi temel eğitimleri için çok daha az bir bütçe ve zaman yeterli oluyor.\n- Denetim ekiplerinin ne kadar kaliteli olduğunu somut olarak gösterebiliyorlar.\n\n\nBu kursu satın alarak sadece sınava hazırlanmış olmayacaksınız. Sınav süreçleri konusunda kafanıza takılan konuları sorabileceğiniz, sınav soruları hakkında takıldığınız yerlerde size destek olabilecek, ümitsizliğe kapıldığınızda size manevi olarak destek verebilecek bir hocanız da olacak.\n\n\nBu kursta sunulan soru setinde aşağıdaki listede üçüncü sırada yer alan Görevi Gerçekleştirmek başlığına ilişkin 4 adet 25'er soruluk deneme sınavı bulunuyor.\n\n\nSertifikalı iç denetçi olmak için 3 farklı sınavı geçmek gerekir.\nBu sınavlardan ikincisi 4 ana bölümden oluşuyor:\n1- İç Denetim Faaliyetini Yönetmek (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %20)\n2- Görevi Planlamak (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %20)\n3- Görevi Gerçekleştirmek (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %40)\n4- Görev Sonuçlarını Açıklamak ve İlerlemeyi İzlemek (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %20)\n\n\nSertifikalı İç Denetçi (CIA) sınavında bir bölümü geçmek için en az 600 puan almanız gerekir. En yüksek not 750 olduğu için tüm soruları %80 oranında doğru yanıtlamalısınız. Bu da her bir sorunun ne kadar değerli olduğunu ortaya koyuyor.\nİkinci bölüm sınavında dört başlıkta bölümün tamamı için toplam 100 soru bulunur ve bu da Görevi Gerçekleştirmek başlığına ilişkin olarak 38-42 adet soru çıkacağı anlamına gelir.",

Especificamente, o processo de aquisição e contratação é extremamente vulnerável à corrupção, que também é a fraude mais difícil de detectar e provar. Isso se deve à sua natureza \"fora dos livros\", na qual negócios espúrios são refletidos apenas indiretamente na contabilidade da organização (por exemplo, por meio de superfaturamento).\nNesta atividade, analisaremos detalhadamente os elementos que levam ao incentivo ou desestímulo à fraude nos processos de compras e contratações, bem como identificaremos as vulnerabilidades que são registradas no processo, os indícios de atuação fraudulenta e as melhores práticas para a condução de investigações sobre fraudes cometidas no processo de Compras e Contratações. Identificaremos os processos mais vulneráveis e suas instâncias críticas\nTambém forneceremos ferramentas e metodologias adequadas para a prevenção, dissuasão e detecção de fraudes no processo de Compras e Contratações de forma ordenada e sistemática, e por meio da atuação interdisciplinar de profissionais de diferentes disciplinas.\nResumindo: forneceremos uma estrutura adequada para a mitigação de fraudes no processo de aquisição e contratação, bem como para melhorias na transparência e eficiência da gestão. Neste curso, explicaremos como identificar riscos de fraude, preveni-los, detectá-los e esclarecer o que aconteceu",

The ACAMS exam is not hard like the CFA, but it still requires for the test sitter to go through all the knowledge and practice in the lead up. This will help in passing the CAMS exam. The exam is designed to have real-world scenario questions that are present in the CAMS exam but also has other questions related to knowledge checks. The questions relate to core topics in chapter two such as FATF, Egmont Group, Wolfsberg, etc. There are also questions on FATF style regional bodies and carious legislation surrounding AML/CTF.\nThis is designed for people enrolled in the CAMS exam. If you need to reach out to me for any reason i'm happy to answer questions. I  have completed the CAMs exam and have a Master of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing from Charles Sturt and ACAMS. The highest qualification within the industry.\nPlease be advised, I've been getting complaints about the test being hard. The test is deliberately designed to be hard to ensure you are ready for this exam.

      "description": "The field of financial crime compliance is changing. In today’s environment it is no longer enough for a financial crime or compliance professional to be able to describe money laundering or terrorist financing, they must also have a strong understanding of the potential predicate offences - “the crime behind the crime”.\nWith this knowledge, investigators are better able to understand the activity they are observing, articulate their findings, and present the final intelligence product to their audience.\nThis course examines a wide range of financial and white collar crimes, linking these predicate offences to the indicators of money laundering / terrorist financing.\n\n\nTestimonials\n\"The course filled several gaps in my understanding of financial crimes and is a great resource for those looking for an introduction to a variety of financial crime topics. The course is well structured, easy to follow, and offers numerous pertinent examples shedding light on financial crimes in Canada and across the globe. The fact these examples cover several decades, illustrates that financial crimes have, and always will be, an issue that law enforcement and financial sectors grapple with.\"\n\n\n\"I found the course to be very informative. I was impressed with both the quality and quantity of the information, and I learned quite a bit about aspects of financial crime, money laundering, and how it all interacts with technology. My favourite parts of the courses were the times when we got to see news reports and clips from documentaries, as I felt that these segments really helped me to put what we were learning in the context of the real world. The content was so interesting I was actually disappointed when it was over! I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in financial crime.”",

We support individuals and organizations who are dedicated to ending financial crime through thought leadership, continuing professional education, and our best-in-class peer network. CAMS is an established global qualification that outlines the key principles of money laundering, and how to prevent it. In as little as four months, individuals and teams can be certified as Anti-Money Laundering Specialists.\n\n\nCAMS is recognized as the gold standard in AML certifications by institutions, governments and regulators worldwide.\n\n\nThis question bank covers wide range of areas of the AML CFT procedures with case scenarios. This will help you a lot to understand the question pattern and also gives you the confidence to recheck your ability to attend the CAMS exam or similar exams. Few questions may be tough and few may be easy. The pattern ensures that all the chapters from the exam portions are fully covered. It will help you remind the years and Associations involved.\n\n\nPlease message me for any clarification on the answers when you have difference of opinion or need to understand more them.\n\n\nThe question bank will not guarantee you the exact questions or the difficulty level as ACAMS assess. But this will give you the overall idea of how the CAMS question will appear. Few questions may reflect the exact CAMS pattern, whole few will be just knowledge test.\n\n\nAnd efforts have been put in this QA that all the study material areas are covered while picking the questions. Especially on the years, the associations and their main roles, who has formed and how it came into existence et all. For example, the BASEL committe is formed by the Central bank governors of G10 countries in 1974.\n\n\nFew questions will give you the knowledge to realign the years for which an Act or association was formed. For example, the FATF recommendations came into picture in the year 1990 but formed in 1989.",

      "description": "Money laundering is one of the most widespread financial crimes, enabling terrorism, drug trafficking, corruption, and organized crime to thrive worldwide. Each year, trillions of dollars are laundered through banks, fintech companies, cryptocurrencies, real estate, and shell corporations, making it increasingly difficult for governments and financial institutions to combat illicit money flows. As global regulators intensify their crackdown on financial crime, the demand for skilled AML professionals has never been higher. Whether you're looking to break into the field or advance your expertise, this comprehensive AML Masterclass will equip you with the knowledge and practical skills to detect, investigate, and prevent money laundering across multiple industries.\nThis course contains the use of artificial intelligence, to boost your learning experience.\nThis course covers everything from fundamental AML principles to advanced investigative techniques. You will learn how criminals launder money, the most common red flags financial institutions look for, and how to conduct risk-based transaction monitoring to identify suspicious activities. We will also explore the global AML regulatory landscape, including major compliance frameworks like FATF (Financial Action Task Force), FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network), OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control), and EU AML Directives. Through real-world case studies, you’ll see how financial institutions have failed AML compliance—resulting in multi-billion-dollar fines—and learn how to implement best practices to avoid such failures.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this course is its focus on modern money laundering techniques, including cryptocurrency, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, shell companies, and trade-based money laundering. With the rise of fintech and blockchain, criminals are leveraging new-age digital assets to launder money in ways that are harder to trace. You’ll gain hands-on experience in recognizing crypto-related AML risks, understanding how regulators track illicit digital transactions, and applying compliance frameworks to combat financial crime in fintech and crypto sectors.\nThis course is designed for finance professionals, AML officers, fintech experts, law enforcement investigators, risk managers, and job seekers who want to develop expertise in financial crime prevention, forensic accounting, and regulatory compliance. You’ll receive interactive case studies, quizzes, downloadable resources, and certification guidance to help you master AML strategies and prepare for globally recognized credentials like CAMS (Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist), CFCS (Certified Financial Crime Specialist), and ICA (International Compliance Association) certifications.\nNo prior AML experience is required, making this course ideal for both beginners and experienced professionals looking to enhance their compliance skills. By the end of this masterclass, you will have the confidence and expertise to detect, prevent, and investigate money laundering schemes, ensuring regulatory compliance and protecting businesses from financial crime risks.

Bu sertifikayı bir silah gibi düşünün. İş dünyası / kariyer dediğimiz dev vahşi bir orman içinde size faydalı olabilecek bir silah. Bunu yerinde ve doğru kullanabilirseniz hayatta kalma şansınız artar ancak kullanmayı beceremezseniz işiniz Allah'a kalmıştır. Aklını kullanan ve biraz şanslı olanlar silahsız bile o ormandan çıkabilir ama dikkatli olmazsanız silahla bile çıkamayabilirsiniz.\nPeki işverenler neden iş ilanlarında CIA sertifikasına sahip denetçileri tercih ettiklerini belirtiyorlar?\nCIA sertifikası olan adaylar işverenler için de çok faydalı çünkü;\n\n\nDenetim kavram ve yöntemlerine hakim olduklarından şüphe duyulmuyor.\nDenetçi temel eğitimleri için çok daha az bir bütçe ve zaman yeterli oluyor.\nDenetim ekiplerinin ne kadar kaliteli olduğunu somut olarak gösterebiliyorlar.\nBu kursu satın alarak sadece sınava hazırlanmış olmayacaksınız. Sınav süreçleri konusunda kafanıza takılan konuları sorabileceğiniz, sınav soruları hakkında takıldığınız yerlerde size destek olabilecek, ümitsizliğe kapıldığınızda size manevi olarak destek verebilecek bir hocanız da olacak.\n\n\nBu kursta sunulan soru setinde aşağıdaki listede ilk sırada yer alan Suistimal Riskleri  konusuna ilişkin 25'er soruluk 4 adet deneme sınavı bulunuyor.\n\n\nSertifikalı iç denetçi olmak için 3 farklı sınavı geçmek gerekir.\nBu sınavlardan birincisi 6 ana bölümden oluşuyor:\n1- İç Denetimin Temelleri (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %15)\n2- Bağımsızlık ve Objektiflik (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %15)\n3- Yetkinlik ve Gereken Mesleki Özen (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %18)\n4- Kalite Güvence ve Geliştirme Programı (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %7)\n5- Yönetişim, Risk Yönetimi ve Kontrol (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %35)\n6- Sahtekarlık ve Suiistimal Riskleri (Sınavdaki ağırlığı %10)\n\n\nSertifikalı İç Denetçi (CIA) sınavında bir bölümü geçmek için en az 600 puan almanız gerekir. En yüksek not 750 olduğu için tüm soruları %80 oranında doğru yanıtlamalısınız.

Yet, when we see a company or even politicians; actively trying to manage people’s perception about themselves; we ironically tag them as manipulative or fake.\nThus, managing reputation is not an easy task as one needs to maintain a fine balance between being manipulative to being reactive after earning bad rap.\nIf managing reputation is such a challenging task, then what  happens when it’s a bank in question struggling with its deteriorating image in public?\nBe Bankable..\nWhile, we heavily rely on these institutions to keep our money safe & secure however, what if they lose our trust?\nWondering if it ever happened in the history of banking when people lost trust on their bank and rushed towards its branches to withdraw all their money?\nWell, it happened and not just once but many times. Nations across the globe have seen banks falling due to Reputational crisis and bank run (a phenomenon when a considerable part of the bank’s customers withdraw their money at the same time due to the fear that the bank won’t fulfil its obligations).\nIf a bank run takes place, it doesn’t really matter whether the fear is well-founded or only based on rumours, the result will always be the same, bank failure. No bank can survive if all its customers withdraw their money at the same time. Thus, a bank run is a self-fulfilling prophecy, it increases the likelihood of bank failures and destabilisation of entire economy.\nThis also explains why it is so important for a bank to maintain its image of a trustworthy and sound institute as they are the flag bearers of a functional economy.\nBecause Reputation is Everything\nIt’s not an easy task to characterize Reputation risk. We all know about it and have our own understanding on how to manage it.\nFor some, it is a specific risk with clear drivers and tangible business consequences, even if these are hard to quantify.\nFor others, it is a risk of risks that does not exist on a standalone basis.\nA third perspective is that reputation risk is not a risk at all, simply an outcome of other risks.\nWhile, these three views capture the 'essence of reputation risk' yet a lot is left unsaid about it.\nTherefore, I decided to capture all the aspects of Reputational Risk in this course and you will find that there is much more to this risk than meets the ‘naked’ eyes.\n\n\nWhy Enroll?\nThis course will take you through a journey of interesting real world stories entangled within the Reputational risk concepts to ensure that every topic is covered in an engaging and non-imposing manner.\n.........................................................................................................................................................................................\nOverview of Class\nWe will cover the following topics in detail:\nWhy Study Reputational Risk?\nHypothesis “Reputation is Everything”. Stories:\nNorthern Rock Bank\nICICI Bank\nHypothesis “Reputation is Everything”. Stories:\n3 Major Definitions\nBasel Committee on Reputational Risk\nWhat is at Stake?\nValuing Intangibles\nGoodwill vs Reputation\nStory of Royal Bank of Scotland\nQualitative & Quantitative Methodologies\nManaging Reputational Risk\n5 Steps Process\nWhy Manage Reputation\nWho Should Manage\nStory of SunTrust Banks\nAdvantages & Disadvantages\nReputation Management vs Crisis Management\nRightful place of Reputational Risk in Building Strategies\nEssence of Reputational Risk\nSummary",

We used A.I. to ensure smooth reading of the extensive notes for each slide. Many slides will however require that you pause the video and read quietly. Our fully-scripted notes are also provided as a PDF, which can be read as a booklet of the entire course.\nWe will outline several critical concepts and tools that are essential for UHNW families and their family offices:\nAnti-Money Laundering (AML): A set of procedures, laws, and regulations designed to stop the practice of generating income through illegal actions. For UHNW families, this means having robust internal controls to prevent their wealth from being used for illicit activities.\nKnow Your Customer (KYC): The process of verifying the identity of clients to assess potential risks of illegal intentions for the business relationship. This is a crucial component of compliance for family offices, as banks and other financial institutions will perform extensive due diligence on them. The course includes a timeline of KYC evolution.\nPolitically Exposed Persons (PEP): Individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with a prominent public function, as well as their family members and close associates. In this lecture, I will highlight that a UHNW family from an emerging market is more likely to be classified as a PEP, which can lead to increased scrutiny and compliance burdens. Finally, I will addresse the targeted risks and what being a PEP means for a family office.\nIn this course I will highlight how, while UHNW families often focus on wealth preservation and growth, they must also manage significant reputational and compliance risks within their international footprint.\nThis course consists of 3 lectures:\nWhat is Compliance?\nWhy is it an issue for UHNW Families?\nMitigating Debanking & Reputational Risks.\nEnjoy our course!\nAnd do not forget to take the MCQ at the end.",

      "description": "Chapter 3: The Indian Partnership Act, 1932\nUNIT -1: GENERAL NATURE OF PARTNERSHIP\nINTRODUCTION\n‘Partnership’ is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called individually ‘partners’ and collectively ‘a firm’, and the name under which their business is carried on is called the ‘firm name’.\nAfter studying this unit, you would be able to understand-\n1. Understand the concept of partnerships and be clear about its essentials.\n2. Try to understand the ‘principal - agent relationship’ among the partners.\n3. Note the points of difference between partnership and other various forms of organization.\nSUMMARY\nIt is not quite easy to define the term ‘Partnership’. The definition given by Section 4 of the Act brings out very clearly the fundamental principle that each partner, when carrying on the business of the firm, is an agent as well as principal, and is probably the most business like definition of the term. The definition contains three elements which must be present before a group of persons can be held to be partners, namely; (a) agreement among all the partners; (b) agreement to share the profits of the business; (c) the business must be carried on by all or any of them, acting for all. These three elements may appear to overlap, but they are nevertheless distinct.\nThe element of agreement in partnership distinguishes it from various other relations which arise by operation of law and not from agreement, such as, joint-owners, Hindu Undivided Family, etc.",

      "description": "Chapter 3: The Indian Partnership Act, 1932\nUNIT – 2: RELATIONS OF PARTNERS\nAfter studying this unit, you would be able to understand-\n1. Be familiar with the legal provisions regulating relation of partners’ interest as well as relations with the third parties.\n2. Note the scope of implied authority of a partner to bind the partnership by his acts.\n3. Be aware of the various situations in which the constitution of a firm may change and its effect on the rights and duties of the partners.\n4. Learn how the share in a partnership is transferred and what shall be the rights and obligations of such transferee.\nSUMMARY\nThe mutual rights and duties of partners are regulated by the contract between them. Such contract need not always be expressed, it may be implied from the course of dealing between the partners (Section 11). Section 12 gives rules regulating the conduct of the business by the partners and Section 13 lay down rules of mutual rights and liabilities. Sections 14 to 17 also contain particular rules which become useful and important while determining the relations of partners to one - another. What is essential to note, however, is that all these rules are subject to contract between the parties.\nAs regards third parties, a partner is the agent of the firm for all purposes within the scope of the partnership concern. His rights, powers, duties and obligations are in many respects governed by the same rules and principles which apply to the agent. Generally, he may pledge or sell the partnership property; he may buy goods on account of the firm; he may borrow money, contract debt and pay debts on account of the firm; he may draw, make, sign, endorse, accept, transfer, negotiate and get discounted promissory notes, bills of exchange, cheques and other negotiable papers in the name and account of the firm. The implied authority of the partner to bind the firm is restricted to acts usually done in the business of the kind carried on by the firm. He is also empowered under the Act to do certain acts in an emergency so as to bind the firm. The firm, however, is bound only by those acts of a partner which were done by him in his capacity as a partner.\nA partner may in some circumstances become liable on equitable grounds for obligations incurred by a co-partner in doing acts in excess of his authority, real or implied. He may also become liable for an unauthorized act of his co-partner on the ground of estoppel.",

Verification agencies are happy to accept these interpretations if they are in keeping with what the BEE codes prescribe.\nFact “the spirit of BEE” does not exist within the context of a BEE verification\nNo verification agency has the ability to assess you in terms of the spirit because their mandate is to objectively measure the evidence you present. Similarly, SANAS is not an interpreter of the BEE codes. They are there merely to assess the quality of the information submitted to a verification agency.\nIt follows that any reasonable interpretation of the codes will suffice for compliance purposes.\nBEE Compliance has to fit within your business strategy and operations not the other way round\nIt’s likely that we would have no loadshedding if Eskom hadn’t put “empowerment” credentials above their mandate to deliver cost-effective and reliable electricity.\nWhy expose your business to a similar fate? Your business exists to provide employment and generate a return for its shareholders. Splurging large amounts of money on BEE points with all too willing service providers could impact on both of those business imperatives.\nDon’t do it!\nThere are much more cost-effective alternatives.",

By adhering to the standard's guidelines, entities provide a transparent view of their asset valuations, enhancing stakeholder confidence in the financial reporting process.\nWith this objective in mind and recognizing the complexities of IAS 36, I designed this course to simplify these topics for students. I incorporated more audiovisual presentations than textual content to increase student engagement, including videos to explain key examples.\nIn this course, I have unraveled the complexities of determining value in use, carrying amount, recoverable amount, and fair value. The allocation of impairment loss to Cash Generating Units (CGUs) and goodwill is effectively explained through practical examples. Additionally, the reversal of impairment loss and its allocation to CGUs are thoroughly covered. The course also explains asset valuation models, such as the Cost Model and Revaluation Model, in the context of assessing impairment loss and the corresponding accounting journal entries, in an easy and understandable manner. The full version of IAS 36 has been provided in a downloadable format in the last section of the course.

More recently there is now regulatory pressure from regulators and law enforcement globally to start making sure private funds, and investment advisors are carrying out KYC after many of the regulators and law enforcement spent a lot of time on crypto.\nKYC is a real opportunity to get your foot into the door at a Hedge Fund or Private Equity firm and is going to be one of the few jobs or careers that will continue to grow despite the US economy entering some form of economic contraction.\nThe course will focus on onboarding individuals, trusts, partnerships, and LLCs as per the main onboarding types for the alternative investment industry. It will focus purely on the KYC process, specific to these entities so if you work with these entities and need to do KYC this may be for you.\nIf you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out.",

      "description": "Neden insanlar Sertifikalı İç Denetçi - CIA olmak istiyorlar?\nBunun bir kaç sebebi var:\n1 - Daha kolay iş bulmak istiyorlar.\nDenetçiler veya denetçi adayları sertifikalı olduklarında daha kolay iş bulacaklarını düşünüyorlar. Haksız da sayılmazlar çünkü iç denetçi ilanlarını incelerseniz göreceksiniz ki hemen hepsinde CIA sertifikası olanların tercih edileceği belirtiliyor.\n2 - Daha fazla kazanmak istiyorlar.\nDünya çapında yapılan anketlerden sertifikalı iç denetçilerin %51 oranında daha fazla kazandıklarını öğreniyoruz. Elbette rakamların büyüsüne kapılmamak gerekir çünkü bu denetçiler sadece sertifikayı aldıkları için çok kazanmıyor. Bu sertifikayı bir nişan gibi kendi becerilerini işverenlere sunmak için kullanıyorlar ve maaş pazarlıklarında elleri güçleniyor.\n3 - Daha hızlı terfi etmek istiyorlar.\nÖzellikle finans kurumlarında sertifikalı iç denetçiler daha hızlı yükselebiliyorlar. Hatta sertifika sahibi olmak işverenler tarafından özendiriliyor. Kamuda sertifikası olanlar aday belirleme sınavına katılmadan doğrudan Kamu İç Denetçisi eğitim programına katılabiliyor ve kariyerine kamu iç denetçisi olarak devam etme imkanına kavuşuyor.\n4 - Mesleklerini ve \"kendilerini\" seviyorlar.\nKim işini sevenden daha başarılı ve aynı zamanda mutlu olabilir ki? Özellikle kendini seven insanlar, işbaşında oldukları sürece becerilerini geliştirmek için sertifikalar alıyorlar. Denetçiler için de elbette alınabilecek en değerli sertifika bu. Bu sertifikayı almak hiç kolay değil. Ciddi bir emek ortaya koymak, çok çalışmak gerekiyor. Herkesin sahip olamayacağı bir sertifikayı almış olmanın gururu anlatılmaz ancak yaşanır.\nŞunu sakın unutmayın tek bir sertifika almak size iş bulmakta, terfi etmekte, iş değiştirmekte ve haklı gururunuzu belgelemekte sadece \"yardımcı\" olur. Kesin ve mucizevi bir başarı reçetesi değildir.\nİş dünyasını dev ve vahşi bir orman gibi düşünün. Sertifika sizin bu ormanda kullanabileceğiniz bir silahtır sadece. Belki ormandan çıkacağınız yani emekli olup dinlenmeye geçeceğiniz zamana kadar hiç kullanmayacaksınız, belki de hemen her ağacın arkasında sizi bekleyen tehlikeleri bunun sayesinde savuşturacaksınız. Bilemezsiniz!\nBazıları bu ormana çıplak elleriyle girer ve diğer ucundan kazasız belasız çıkıverir. Kimi talihsizler ise onlarca silahı olduğu halde çıkmayı başaramaz. Gerçi çıplak ellerle ormana dalanların sağ salim çıkma olasılığını tahmin etmek için istatistikçi olmaya gerek yok, değil mi?\nZaman ve imkan varken hazır olmak en güzeli.\nBu kursta YouTube kanalımda ücretsiz olarak yayınladığım Sertifikalı İç Denetçi (CIA -Certified Internal Auditor) sınavına hazırlık videolarını bir araya getirdim.\nBu kursu bitirdiğinizde 1. bölüm sınavında %15 ağırlığı olan \"iç denetimin temelleri\" konusunda bilgi sahibi olacaksınız.\nBölüm sonlarında konuların kafanızda pekişmesini sağlamak için beşer adet örnek soru da bulunuyor.\nDaha fazla örnek soru için YouTube video kanalımı ziyaret edebilir veya diğer Udemy kurslarımı da inceleyebilirsiniz.\nVideolarda sadece müfredata bağlı kalmadan denetim sektöründeki tecrübelerimi de ekleyerek konuları açıklamaya çalıştım.\nDaha kapsamlı ve yazılı konu anlatımları için piyasada bulunan Türkçe kaynakları yine YouTube kanalımda anlattım.\nMutlaka kanalı ziyaret edin ve abone olunki yeni videolar yayınlanır yayınlanmaz ilk sizin haberiniz olsun.\nŞimdiden Başarılar!",

The ease with which criminals can exploit services such as money transfers, currency exchanges, and check cashing puts MSBs at the forefront of regulatory scrutiny.\nGovernments and regulatory bodies worldwide are tightening AML regulations and ramping up enforcement. As a result, MSBs face significant compliance expectations — and failure to meet them can result in heavy penalties, license revocation, reputational damage, and even criminal liability.\nWhether you are an MSB owner, compliance officer, auditor, or frontline employee, having a strong understanding of AML obligations is no longer optional — it is essential.\nThis practical course is specifically designed to empower MSB professionals with the knowledge, tools, and confidence to build and maintain an effective AML compliance framework.\nThrough clear explanations and real-world examples, you will learn:\n1. How money laundering operates in the MSB sector — and why MSBs are often targeted.\n2. How to identify red flags, suspicious activities, and typologies unique to MSBs.\n3. How to design and implement a risk-based AML program that meets both regulatory standards and your business needs.\n4. How to stay prepared for regulatory exams and audits — and create a culture of compliance in your organization.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be equipped to actively protect your MSB, your customers, and your community from being used as a conduit for financial crime — and contribute meaningfully to the global fight against money laundering.",

      "description": "Before we can begin to understand how the Fifth Amendment applies in offshore tax cases, we must first understand why such a provision is in the Constitution in the first place. Most of us cannot relate to confessions extracted by torture (Kylo Ren’s interrogation of Poe Dameron in The Force Awakens is in something of a gray area). But for the people who voted to ratify the Constitution in the late 1780s, torture and involuntary confessions were a big deal. Many of their great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers left England largely because of this issue.\n\n\nAs late as the mid-17th century, English officials often forced prisoners to take ex officio mero oaths before they even knew the nature of the charges against them, and they then proceeded to take whatever information they needed by whatever means at their disposal. “Freeborn” John Lilburne famously refused to take such an oath in 1637, after his conviction for the heinous crime of publishing an unlicensed newspaper and subsequent refusal to rat out his fellow Puritans.\n\n\nHis stance helped inspire other dissidents to present The Humble Petition of Many Thousands to the English Parliament in 1647, and much of that document later worked its way into the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.\n\n\nAs a result of all this, the Fifth Amendment is normally associated with criminal proceedings and the prohibition against self-incriminating testimony. However, the Fifth Amendment is a little broader than that. Its protections also apply in some pseudo-criminal matters, such as contempt of Congress. More importantly for tax law purposes, there is a documentary production privilege, and there is a trio of cases that flesh out this concept.\n\n\nQuestions addressed include the following:\n\n\n1. How does the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination impact the production of documents in legal proceedings?\n2. In what ways can the act of producing documents be considered a form of testimonial communication under the Fifth Amendment?\n3. Discuss the implications of the collective entity doctrine on the Fifth Amendment rights of corporations compared to individuals.\n4. Analyze the significance of the Supreme Court cases Fisher v. U.S. and United States v. Hubbell in shaping the understanding of the Fifth Amendment's application to document production.\n5. What challenges do taxpayers face when asserting their Fifth Amendment rights in response to IRS summonses, particularly in offshore audits?\n6. How does the concept of act-of-production immunity protect a taxpayer from self-incrimination when complying with a subpoena?\n7. In what scenarios might the government be required to establish a chain of custody for documents produced in response to a subpoena, and what role does this play in a potential trial?\n8. How do the required records doctrine and the Bank Secrecy Act intersect with Fifth Amendment protections?\n9. What ethical responsibilities do attorneys have when advising clients on invoking their Fifth Amendment rights during legal proceedings?\n10. How might the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination affect the behavior and decisions of taxpayers involved in ongoing audits or investigations?\n11. Discuss the potential consequences for a taxpayer who voluntarily produces documents without asserting their Fifth Amendment rights.\n12. How does the evolving interpretation of the Fifth Amendment influence the balance between individual rights and the government's need for information in criminal investigations?",
