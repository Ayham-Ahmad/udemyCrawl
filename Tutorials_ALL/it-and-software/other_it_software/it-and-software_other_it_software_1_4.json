The concepts are explained in simple language to help students understand clearly what is the use of API management tools. Along with practicals, students will be equipped with clear concepts.\nI suggest please go through both theory and practicals for better understanding.\nThe implementation/configuration stage for each lifecycle is explained with the practicals. The focus of the course is to understand the API Lifecycle concepts with proper examples and to build the integration flows using the built-in policies.\nThe API Manager which is part of the Provider organization provides the UI to create, manage, secure, versioning, and retire the APIs. The APIs can be designed in the API manager or the APIs can be imported. These are the different ways used to create an API proxy.\nFrom Target Service\nFrom Existing Open API Service\nFrom existing WSDL service (SOAP proxy)\nFrom existing WSDL service (REST proxy)\nNew OpenAPI\nImplemented API proxies using both the API Type (OpenAPI 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0). OpenAPI specification is explained in detail.\nImplemented different Transformation techniques and Routing Techniques using the built-in policies.\nThe APIs are available in the Developer portal when the Product containing APIs is published.  There are multiple visibility and subscribability options available while publishing the Product. The consumers of this API, register with the Developer portal by creating an application. The developer portal is part of the consumer organization.\nAPI manager governs the API by creating the proxy endpoint and applying the different kinds of policies. Based on the business requirements, the required policies like rate limiting, Client ID enforcement, etc. can be configured. It has the option to create integration flows using different policy actions like a switch, Invoke, map, etc.  It provides the Analytics feature at the APP level, Catalog level, and Space level.\nError Handling in Assembly is explained in details and also the use of the throw policy. Rate Plan and Rate Limit concepts are explained in the Traffic Management section.",

It starts from Google Search data Download and process data till last result. it also covers the  use of  available  online data sources to prepare Groundwater. It covers all Practical aspects till final results. Only you need to have land use map  ready before starting of this course.  Rest of things covered in this course from basic. You no need to go anywhere outside of you room to run this project. But if you have observation data then you can generate fluctuation map also, that is optional part of this project. By using GIS it is also possible to generate groundwater maps without groundwater data also. But this data is not easily available. So, while performing groundwater potential zone analysis we not used observed data it is optional. Observed data covered in other section of this course for fluctuation map analysis. The data, which used for Groundwater analysis, same data can be used for other analysis also, like Flood risk, Drought prone area analysis. So this analysis are also performed in this course. Because data is same just difference of value.  You will also learn data plotting. This project also covers watershed Delineations.  If your study area is not watershed, just use study area boundary and skip watershed delineation.  Therefore, it covers more than it specified. You by taking this course you not only learn groundwater, you will learn many more advanced task of GIS also, Like DEM mosaic, Data Re-Project , Cutting of study area, soil map generation etc. Therefore, This is complete project from scratch. Feel free to ask me question in Q&A Section. I assumed you know very basic of GIS to perform this analysis.  This is Expert level work.\nThis course is in Full HD 1080p for better Experience use Setting to HD and headphones.\nOnly take this course if you know basic of GIS. You must have landuse landcover file before processing to this course.",

If you want to use RabbitMQ in Spring boot event-driven microservices then this course is useful for you.\n\n\nWhat is the Spring Boot?\nSpring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that eliminated the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application.\n\nSpring Boot is an opinionated framework that helps developers build Spring-based applications quickly and easily. The main goal of Spring Boot is to quickly create Spring-based applications without requiring developers to write the same boilerplate configuration again and again.\n\n\nWhat is RabbitMQ?\nRabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software. It accepts messages from producers and delivers them to consumers. It acts like a middleman which can be used to reduce loads and delivery times taken by web application servers.\nRabbitMQ uses Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol (AMQP) for the secure transfer of messages.\n\n\nUse of RabbitMQ in Microservices\nRabbitMQ is one of the simplest freely available options for implementing messaging queues in your microservices architecture. These queue patterns can help to scale your application by communicating between various microservices. We can use these queues for various purposes, such as the interaction between core microservices, decoupling of microservices, implementing failover mechanisms, and sending email notifications via message brokers.\n\n\nWhat is event-driven architecture?\nEvent-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern in which decoupled applications can asynchronously publish and subscribe to events via an event broker/message broker.\nIn an Event-Driven Architecture, applications communicate with each other by sending and/or receiving events or messages\n\n\nWhat you will learn?\nLearn RabbitMQ Core Concepts\nLearn how to integrate RabbitMQ in the Spring boot application\nLearn how to create RabbitMQ Queue, Exchange, Binding, Producer, and Consumer\nLearn how to exchange string messages between Producer and Consumer using the RabbitMQ broker\nLearn how to create Multiple Queues in the RabbitMQ broker\nLearn how to exchange JSON messages between Producer and Consumer using the RabbitMQ broker\nLearn how to create Event-Drive Microservices using Spring boot and RabbitMQ\nLearn how to use RabbitMQ as a Message broker for Async communication between multiple Microservices\n\n\nTools and Technologies used in this course:\nTechnologies:\nJava 17+\nSpring Boot 3+\nTomcat\nMessaging Broker:\nRabbitMQ\nIDE:\nIntellij IDEA\nTools:\nPostman - Test REST APIs\nMaven - Build Tool",

There are several hundred thousand mobile applications available to consumers today across platforms such as Android, Windows and Apple iPhone. Many consumers of web applications now expect at least a basic continuance of the same web services on their mobile devices. This brings up not only the need to create Apps but to Test them, and to ensure that they run on an increasing array of platforms and devices. Mobile Application Testing is the process by which application software developed for hand held devices are tested for its functionality, usability and consistency.\nAs part of this course we are learning MOBILE APPLICATION TESTING FROM SCRATCH . This course deal with how to write the test cases and how to test the mobile apps in Android and iOS platforms. Also included how to report the defects/screenshots/log files with the development team during the test case execution.",

Nice explanations. Great course...anyone can learn no matter of the previous level of programming knowledge”\n\n★★★★★\n“This instructor seems very knowledgeable, and covers topics that seem very important ”\n★★★★★\n“This course is really worth it. The tutor has ample practical knowledge and discusses about almost everything that is there to know. I am glad i took this course and would encourage any aspirant to go for it.”\n★★★★★\n“Good, clear instructor with uncluttered focused examples – recommended.”\n★★★★★\n“Liking the course so for. Very good explanation of each concepts, explaining the fundamentals on each topic, all the way till what happens in memory in each, explaining the “Why’s” in the beginning of topic (which is very important to me, otherwise one would be just memorizing). I liked the author’s approach to start with explaining methods and then expanding it to classes, objects and others. This course is good value for the money.”\n\n\nKnowledge Notes!\n\n\nWhat is Cpring Core?\nSpring core is the core module that is built on key spring principles like Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (Discussed in the course!).\n\nAll there rest of the spring Modules/Projects relay on Spring Core Module.\n\n\nWhat is dependency injection?\nBefore spring, all the software components used to be tightly coupled with each other where making changes in one component would require other component to be altered.\nWith spring, developers will not define the dependencies themselves, instead they'd ask the Spring Container to inject he required dependency right when the application is booted. Objects define their associations (dependencies) and do not worry about how they will get those dependencies. It is the responsibility of Spring container to provide the required dependencies.\nIn other words,  instance creation is taken care by the container and would be injected in components that ask for it. There by promoting a loosely couple architecture, where one component will not be impacted due to the changes in other dependent component.\n\n\nWhat is Inversion of Control (IOC)?\nIn simple terms, Inversion of Control (IOC) means, that the responsibility of creating the instance is given the underlying container.\n\nDependency injection is one such pattern to achieve Inversion of Control. However, there are many more approaches to achieve IOC (Ex: Service locator pattern, Strategy Design Pattern, etc)\n\n\nWhat is Application Context in Spring?\nApplication context is responsible for instantiating the beans, configure and wire them together depending on their dependencies. How how does the AppliationContext know of what beans to configure and how they are dependent on other objects? It will take at the config file where we define all the beans.\nTraditionally we use XML as the config to define our beans, but it comes with a lot of drawbacks. For example, there is no syntax highlighting making it difficult to manage for large projects.\nA better approach is the more recent Java config which is much more convenient and provides a lot of flexibility in terms of configuring beans.\nEven modern, we don't have to even define our beans. We can ask Spring to scan the objects for us. But how does spring know which components to scan and create instances? Well, it will just simply create an instance of all the beans that are annotated with any of these annotations\n@Component\n@Controller\n@Repository\n@Service\n\n\norg.springframework.context.ApplicationContext is the interface that defines the contract for Spring Core IOC container.\nThere are several implementations of ApplicationContext and we need to use the one depending on our needs. For example, if you want to go with good old XML config, ClassPathXmlApplicationContext is the implementation to use.\nFew Random Reviews on this Course\n\n★★★★★\nEXCELLENT CURSE , I WOULD LIKE THIS COURSE BECOUSE ITS VERY COMPLETE AND THE CREATOR IS SO GOOD , THANK YOU IAM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS COURSE\n\n\n★★★★★\nI liked the course so far. I am only in the beginning stages of the course and I like the way the teacher explain things.\n\n\n★★★★★\nIn South Korea, nobody can teach like this course. Before I was very hard to understand even though having experience 10 years scalable network programming. NOT now. It's very easy to go into the Spring world step by step. I recommend it if you want to know what is spring.\n\n\nSatisfaction Guaranteed! | 30-Day Refund Policy.\n\n\nLet's have fun learning!

For instance, a company gets applications from different channels and needs to collect sales stats uniformly. Alternatively, you can compare the effectiveness of ads from famous brands on several websites. There's a need for BI in all of these processes.\nIn SAP BI, you get a bunch of solutions, methodologies, and tools for analyzing data quickly, efficiently, and with high quality. From ETL processes to corporate data warehouses to tools for reporting, visualization, and planning, each tool has its purpose.\nThere are a lot of data sources to analyze: company information systems, local sources, specialized accounting programs, and industry solutions.\nIt's hard to do without SAP BI if you want to get better at business intelligence, strategy, planning, reporting, finance, or forecasting. Business owners need to understand one thing. Their marketing and accounting departments need to use SAP BI if they want to be competitive.\nReporting, visualization, and sharing are all centralized in SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence. It turns data into useful insights, available anytime, anywhere, as part of SAP's Business Technology Platform.\nKnown as SAP B1, SAP Business One is an ERP solution specifically designed for SMEs to help them manage their day-to-day business. There are modules for CRM, finance, production management, reporting and analytics, warehousing and inventory management, purchasing and procurement, billing, and invoicing on this platform. The purpose of this software is to automate and streamline these key business processes, so one can turn their firm into a profitable one.\nIn this Fundamental (101 level), I would lie to explain the 5 major topics,\n1. Overview of SAP BI, SAP BW, SAP BusinessObjects, and SAP Business One\n2. SAP BusinessObjects Architecture, BI Tools & Their Solutions\n3.

No coding is used .All software used in this course are NOT Open Source. You need to manage software. You must know to prepare landuse maps rest of things covered in this course from scratch. Future prediction of landuse depends on number of drivers/Parameters. Drives means forces which decide how the future urban area will look. It includes many drives like, old city boundary because new settlement will be constructed near to old city boundary. Roads and relief are also one of factors, because first roads near city covered by settlement. On another side how, much possibility at different location on agriculture site that can be convert to urban. Similarly, forest cover also. We also need to avoid some landuse classed like water, river, lake or reservoir never convert to urban. So, we need to setup our model in such a way so that it avoids water. After setting accuracy of learning and output accuracy also matters. We also need to modify it. In this course we have achieved learning accuracy of 42%, and 67% in two different runs. But 89% accuracy we have achieved in predicted landuse. Learning and prediction accuracy is different on computer to computer and data to data. While running you will receive more or less accuracy then this course. But focus on your output results. If Learning accuracy was 100% then it also wrong. So, see and understand each video carefully. Then run you model. You must see free preview video before enrolling this course. Because this is Expert level course.\nNote: Who having IDRISI Taiga They can also follow same steps.\nThis course covers 90% Practical and 10% Theory.\nDon’t hesitate to ask me Questions in QA Session.",

      "description": "Welcome to the best resource online for learning GraphQL with Python!\nIn this course you will learn how to build GraphQL APIs to replace standard REST APIs and their limitations. In addition, you will learn about features like authentication, object-relational mapping, version control, and deployment, which go hand in hand with modern application development of GraphQL APIs.\nToday GraphQL is used by teams of all sizes in many different environments and languages to power mobile apps, websites, and APIs. From Airbnb and Atlassian to Audi and GitHub, companies the world over are using GraphQL APIs in production. GraphQL has gained significant traction in recent years because it offers a more flexible and efficient approach to data retrieval that addresses over-fetching and under-fetching issues that are common with REST APIs.\nThis course is for anyone looking to learn GraphQL with Python. It is designed to teach you everything you need to know to build production-ready GraphQL APIs with Python.\nIn the first 2 hours you will learn the basics of GraphQL, how to build a GraphQL server with Python, and how to expose a web API to interact with it.\nThis introduction will give you a solid foundation of the core GraphQL concepts like schemas, types, queries, mutations, variables, fragments, directives and more. We will be working with a live GraphQL API, as we explore these concepts through a graphical in-browser IDE, constructing queries and mutations, and exploring result sets in real time.\nIn the second part of the course we'll delve into more advanced topics, as we integrate our GraphQL applications with cloud-hosted SQL databases, and in the process also gain a practical understanding of the widely-popular SQLAlchemy ORM. We'll define advanced mutations and query capabilities, before we shift our attention to authentication and authorization flows, where we will use JSON web tokens to implement a role-based permissioning system. In the end we will deploy our application as a serverless function to the cloud, for free.\n\n\nThroughout the course you’ll learn how to:\n\n\nModel your application data using schemas and entities\nCreate queries allowing clients to access data in the database through GraphQL\nCreate mutations allowing clients to create and change data in the database\nQuery and change your data from the browser by making requests with graphical, in-browser IDEs\nWork with the SQLAlchemy ORM (v2) to communicate with your database\nSecure your application data with JWT-based authentication and authorization system\nDeploy your GraphQL applications as serverless functions, for free\n\n\nThis course assumes you're somewhat familiar with python, but if you're not or haven't programmed in python for a while, there is a full length introduction to the python programming language included as an appendix.\nI'm excited to be your instructor. See you inside!",

      "description": "Product Cost Controlling (CO-PC) in SAP is very simple and easy.\nBut why is everyone saying that Product Costing is one of the most complicated topics in SAP?\nI too first struggled with costing and could not really grasp the overall picture of how things really work in the system. Everything changed when one of my colleagues saw my pain and showed me how product costing was maintained for one of the companies he was working for. After spending just a few hours in the system, I had a crystal-clear understanding of how costing in SAP works. All it took was one real-life example to see how simple the topic actually is.\nThis is what this course will be offering to you. We will be building a realistic end-to-end costing scenario that is based on a real-life example.\nIn this course, we will not be going through every single costing-related configuration screen in detail as this is usually just a waste of your time. Once you understand how one complete costing scenario is set up and how the costs are flowing inside the system, it is fast and easy for you to start expanding your knowledge on your own and become a true expert on the topic.\nAs Product Costing can’t be discussed without also discussing Cost Elements (note: in S/4HANA, cost element & GL master data has been merged) and Cost Centers, we will also go through all the fundamentals of Controlling (CO). So you do not need to have any prior experience with the Controlling module to take this course.\nI guarantee that after this course, you have a good overall understanding of how costing works in the system and you will be ready to start implementing advanced costing scenarios in the system. My promise to you is that this will be the best SAP course you have ever taken.\n\n\nThe structure of this course is the following. We will first start with a short slide set that introduces our costing scenario that is based on a real-life company. The slide deck also introduces the most fundamental terms and concepts related to product costing. I know that I have made a big fuss about explaining costing through a real example in the system and not through slides but please bear with me. We will not use too much time going through the slides and we will be playing around in the system before you know it.\nAfter we have finished our short theory session, we will start looking at how costs are planned in the system. Cost planning is essential for the creation of material costs estimates that decide how goods are valued in financial postings and in a company’s balance sheet. Cost planning also gives us information that can be used for managerial decision-making and allows us to compare actual costs to cost estimates.\nThe final part of the course is about the actual costs: We will go through what happens in costing during the actual manufacturing process and will see how cost controlling is linked with Production Planning and Financial Accounting.\nThis course is specially designed for people who have started to read a 1,000 pages SAP Controlling manual and given up after the first 100 pages after countless chapters of irrelevant background information and no realistic examples of how things actually work in practice. The unfortunate truth is that SAP consultants don’t know how to teach SAP. But I’m too shy to claim that I make an exception to this rule. Every second of my video lectures is designed to expand your knowledge as fast as possible.\nSign up for my course and I promise that it will be the best investment you have ever made for your SAP career.",

      "description": "So you have taken an initial programming course or have learned the basics on your own. However, when you look at other people's code, or listen to their discussions, you see many concepts that seem alien -- stuff that you don't understand. So, the question is: how do you go from a beginning level programmer to the expert level? How do you become a guru?\nThis course answers this question. In it, we will be building on top of your existing basic understanding of the Python language (and programming in general). We will cover concepts that will take you to the next level of programming expertise. These will include language constructs that are typically not covered in a beginner level course. Concepts like generators, decorators, callbacks, higher order functions, context managers and others.\nWe will also discuss some tools that are not difficult but are essential to the life of a professional programmer. An example of this is logging for tracking down bugs -- a simple technique that is used in all production level software but is never touched upon in typical programming courses.\nWe will discuss parallel programming -- multi-threading and synchronization issues -- another important concept you must understand to code in a production environment. We discuss these through a case study to explain WHY you need them as well as HOW to use them.\nClosely related to this, a highly important concept in today's programming practice is the idea of asynchronous programming -- more commonly known as asyncio. Python and Javascript -- two of the most influential languages in today's development -- are heavily focused on this new paradigm and we will cover this in a very intuitive, easy to understand manner. For all concepts, we take a case study-based approach and motivate why we need the concepts we're seeing and how everything fits together.\nRemember: the most important reason you're paying for a course is support. So, please ask questions in the Q&A forum if you ever get stuck. I have a maximum response time of around 15 hours -- not average, maximum. Please use this to your advantage -- ask questions and you should be able to breeze through this course and go beyond a basic level of programming to the next level where your code will take less time to write ... will be clean and much easier to maintain.\nWhat will I learn?\nCross-cutting Tools (logging and testing)\nCaveats in usage of lists\nIntermediate Python concepts such as decorators, generators, context managers\nParallel programming, multithreading, synchronization, locks\nAsynchronous programming (asyncio)\nPlotting data\nRegular Expressions (and how to not have headaches when using them)\nAbout the instructor:\nTeacher and researcher by profession\nPhD in Security and a PostDoc from Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany\n17+ years of working with computers and 15+ years of teaching experience\n10+ years of working professionally as a Linux System Administrator/VoIP DevOp -- including 5+ years of provable track record on UpWork (with 5.0 star rating there)\nTarget Audience:\nAnyone who:\nHas a basic understanding of Python but wants to take their skills to the next level\nWants to learn the tools and techniques used by expert professional programmers\nWhat you need to know:\nYou should have knowledge of basic usage of Python (variables, conditionals, loops, basic list and dictionary usage, basic file handling)",

      "description": "UPDATE: Added section on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n\n\nIn the fast-paced world of Data Science and Machine Learning, you have to stay up-to-date and keep ahead of the competition. For this, you have to constantly be on the lookout for the latest trends in tools and techniques for Data Science and Machine Learning. You don't want to miss out on the latest trend and the tool of the future! Right now, that tool is the Julia programming language. It's the hot new language that all ML and data science experts are very excited about. Learning Julia will open up several doors for you in your career!\nThat is the objective of this course: to give you a strong foundation needed to excel in Julia and learn the core of the language as well as the applied side in the shortest amount of time possible.\nIn this course, we take a code-oriented approach. We don't waste time with the theory of why Julia is fast. We jump right into the details and start coding. You will quickly realize how easy it is to learn this state-of-the-art and promising language. You will see how you can start using Julia to excel in your current job without moving the whole stack to Julia immediately.\nWe take a case-study-based approach. After explaining the basic concepts, we jump to case studies in data science and then machine learning. We apply both traditional machine learning models and then get to deep learning. You will see how Julia can help you create deep learning models from scratch in just a few lines of code and then move on to the state-of-the-art models without spending too much time.\nThis way, you get to learn the most important concepts in this subject in the shortest amount of time possible without having to deal with the details of the less relevant topics. Once you have developed an intuition of the important stuff, you can then learn the latest and greatest models even on your own! Take a look at the promo for this course (and contents list below) for the topics you will learn as well as the preview lectures to get an idea of the interactive style of learning.\nRemember: The reason you pay for this course is support. I reply within the day. See any of my course reviews for proof of that. So make sure you post any questions you have or any problems you face. I want all my students to finish this course.

      "description": "Welcome to the course on ROS for Beginners III Web-based Navigation with ROSBridge. I am Anis Koubaa, and I will be your instructor in this course. This course is the third course in the series ROS For Beginners. It is a project-based course that deals with how to develop a web interface to teleoperate and interact with ROS-enabled robots.\nProject Overview\nAt the end of this course project, you will develop a web interface that will allow you to teleoperate and monitor the robot based on ROS. The Web interface will be developed using ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript framework for front-end development.\nWe will first start by developing a component that will tell us whether the robot with which we would like to communicate is connected or not connected. Then, you will develop another component to teleoperate the robot through a web-based joystick in ReactJS. You also implement a button for stopping the robot in an emergency situation. Furthermore, the web interface will display live information about the robot such as its position, orientation, and linear and angular velocity. The last part of this project deals with map-based navigation. You will be able to display the navigation map on the web browser and send the goal location for the robot to navigate to. In the end, you will develop a comprehensive web interface that will allow you to interact with your robot easily through a web interface using the most popular JavaScript framework, which is ReactJS.\nWhy this course?\nThis course represents a first step into the world of cloud robotics.\nCloud robotics is an emerging topic in the last few years and it aims at integrating mobile robots with cloud computing systems and the Internet of Things through web services interfaces.\nBesides, I have developed this course because there are not sufficient pointers and no comprehensive tutorials on how to make web browsers interact with robots.\nWhat's worth in this course?\nThis course is unique in the sense that it is designed to Bridge the gap between the robotics world and the web development world.\nIn fact, most of the engineers who work in the robotic area do not have a background in web development, and most of the web developers do not have a background on robots or ROS. This course bridges these two areas together and provides a systematic introduction to the topic of web development for ROS-enabled robots.\nFurthermore, we will use the ReactJS web development technology which the most evolving most popular javascript front-end development framework.\nYou will learn all the tricks in a step-by-step approach to help you save plenty of time looking around for scattered documentation.\nPre-requisites\nTo take the most benefit from this course, you should be already familiar with Robot Operating System (ROS) and its navigation stack. If you are not familiar with ROS, then take by two courses ROS For Beginners I and ROS For Beginners II before diving into this course.\nAs we will do some web development, it will be recommended to have some very basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, just basics and nothing advanced. You can take any introduction about HTML, CSS, and JS if you do not know about them.\nIt is not required that you have any Prior knowledge of ReactJS because I will introduce all the essential concepts in this course.\nWelcome to the course and I wish you a pleasant learning experience.",

It occasionally deals with advanced notions about security, software and data engineering, REST APIs etc, that are not explained here. Check the minimum Requirements for this course, and the \"What is NOT Included in This Course\" section below, before buying this course.\n\n\nWho I Am\nThe only world-class expert from Canada selected for the Snowflake Data Superhero program in 2021.\nFormer SnowPro Certification SME (Subject Matter Expert): i.e. many exam questions have been created by me.\nPassed eight SnowPro certification exams to date, all from the first attempt.\nSpecialized in Snowflake for the past few years, I worked for Snowflake Partner companies, and I served dozens of clients in this capacity or as an independent consultant.\nToday I continue to work with Snowflake, but I am no longer affiliated with their company in any capacity. I recently left most of their programs to keep my professional independence.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nHow to access, expand and automate Snowflake through most if not ALL their existing APIs.\nHow to build useful real-life tools and small apps with Snowflake APIs.\nHow to ingest CSV and JSON data into Snowflake, through data pipelines and Snowpipe.\nHow to write medium to complex data analytics queries for Snowflake.\nHow to optimize queries, compute, storage and overall costs for Snowflake.\nHow to process and render semi-structured and hierarchical data and metadata in Snowflake.\nI tried to cover almost everything from Snowflake to date, only from a programming perspective.\n\n\nWhat Snowflake APIs You Will Learn About\nSQL (DDL/DML/DCL) and Snowflake Scripting\nStored Procedures, User-Defined Functions (UDFs), User-Defined Table Functions (UDTFs)\nPython Client, Snowpark for Python, Python Worksheets\nStreamlit Web Apps, Streamlit for Snowflake, Snowflake Native Apps Framework\nSecure Data Sharing and Data Clean Rooms\nSharing with private Data Exchange or public Marketplace\nSnowflake SQL REST API and Snowpipe REST API\nQuerying metadata from Account Usage and Information Schema\nI tried to cover most possible APIs that Snowflake offers today!\n\n\nWhat is NOT Included in This Course\nData Science and Machine Learning APIs.\nMost external integrations, such as external functions, or Kafka and Spark connectors.\nIntegrations with data transfer applications or other third-party partner apps.\nClient driver programming in Go, PHP, Java etc.\nSnowpark programming in Java or Scala.\nMain focus was on SQL and Python, with small extra snippets in JavaScript, C#, Java, Scala.\n\n\nReal-Life Applications You Will Learn To Build\nCDC Data Pipelines with streams and tasks, or dynamic tables\nGeneric hierarchical data viewer\nHierarchical metadata viewer (for data lineage and object dependencies, role hierarchy, etc.)\nEnhanced query profile\nScript automation accessing the SQL REST API\nWe’ll build all apps from scratch. We’ll use then Streamlit – for many of them - to create simple web apps, local or remote. We may deploy them into Snowflake, as Streamlit Apps. Or even share them with local partner accounts, as Native Apps.\nI sold tools similar to these to real-life clients and Snowflake partners!\n\n\nNo other course, book or documentation around - including those from Snowflake! – will offer as much insights, hands-on exercises and knowledge transfer as my course here, guaranteed!\n\n\nEnroll today, to keep this course forever.

Here's what yyou'll learn:\nCreating databases and tables\nAdding data to a table with INSERT\nReading a table with SELECT\nHow to use WHERE to filter data\nUsing ORDER BY to sort data\nJOINs and how to use them to read from multiple tables\nChanging data in a table with UPDATE\nThe DELETE query: removing one or more rows of data from a table\nUsing a text file to load a database schema\nThese topics and many more will be covered. The concentration in this course is on MySQL itself… not on how to use it to for any particular purpose. But this course makes a great introduction to our upcoming course about web databases using php and MySQL. So why wait… sign up today!",

      "description": "Overview\nJQuery is a popular JavaScript library that is used extensively in modern websites. This library facilitates common JavaScript tasks such as animations, event handling, manipulating HTML content, and communication with external servers. In addition to its easy-to-use features, JQuery also takes care of many cross-browser compatibility issues automatically.\nPrerequisites\nHTML: The student must know how to use HTML tags and attributes. Only a very basic understanding of HTML is assumed.\nJavaScript: Since JQuery is a JavaScript library, the student must know how to write JavaScript. JQuery makes extensive use of functions and objects, so the student must be familiar with these concepts.\nNotepad++ (Recommended): Notepad++ is a free, open-source text editor. Although JavaScript and HTML can be written using any text editor, Notepad++ is highly recommended because of features such as syntax highlighting and auto-complete.\nJavaScript-enabled browser: In order to run JavaScript, the student must have a\nccess to a JavaScript-enabled browser. Although Google Chrome is used throughout the tutorial, any modern web browser will work as long as JavaScript has not been disabled by an administrator.\nWhat you will learn\nWe will begin the course by learning about selectors. Selectors are strings that are used to target specific HTML elements on the page. The selector syntax is highly intuitive and easy to read and understand.\nWe will then move on to events. The student will learn how to write code that reacts to things like mouse clicks, key presses, when the page is done loading, and a few others. These events allow programmers to create interactive user interfaces.\nAfter that, we will move on to effects and animations. Effects are used to hide and show elements. An example would be a menu that slides open when the mouse hovers over it. JQuery has a few built-in effects that can be implemented with minimal coding. For further customization, we will look at animations, which allow programmers to animate most of the visual properties of HTML elements.\nThen we will learn about changing the HTML content of a webpage. This includes adding and removing entire HTML elements, as well as modifying text and other HTML attributes programmatically. We will also learn about how to navigate the tree-like structure of an HTML document using the concept of parent-, sibling-, and child-elements.\nFinally, we will end the course by looking at AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX allows programmers to interact with external servers. To serve as our example, we will read airport data from a public web service. We will learn how to request data, how to handle the response, and how to handle errors.",

Would we take better care of our environment?\nMany data scientists choose to optimize by using pre-built machine learning libraries.  But we think that this kind of 'plug-and-play' study hinders your learning. That's why this course gets you to build an optimization algorithm from the ground up.\nIn Artificial Intelligence: Optimization Algorithms in Python, you'll get to learn all the logic and math behind optimization algorithms. With two highly practical case studies, you'll also find out how to apply them to solve real-world problems.\nIn the first case study, we'll optimize travel plans for six friends who want to fly out from the same airport. In the second case study, we'll optimize the way university administrators allocate dorm rooms to new students.\nOn the way, we'll learn what optimization algorithms are. We'll find out how they can be applied to daily business practice. And we'll see how they can learn by themselves.\nThis course introduces you to four types of optimization algorithms:\n- random search\n- hill climb\n- simulated annealing, and\n- genetic\nDon't worry if you're not yet sure what any of these are. We'll go through each one in detail, and you'll find out how to build each of them in our two case studies.\"",

There are many changes done to the ACE11 compared to its previous version IBM Integration Bus (IIB10). In ACE11, a standalone integration server is introduced so that the tool is compatible with the docker implementation in the cloud. The configurable services in the previous versions are now part of the policy project. The integration node and the Integration server can be configured using the configuration files. Also provided the facility to override the properties for the node and the server. WebUI feature is introduced for standalone servers, the details about particular integration server can be managed separately. In earlier versions, user Trace and service Trace logs are to be reformatted so that they can be readable, but in ACE11, the trace logs are generated in readable text format.\nThe following features are explained practically to understand the ACE 11 administration.\nGlobal cache configuration.\nJDBC provider policy to connect to database.\nUser-Defined policy to add our own properties and values.\nRecord & Replay Mechanism.\nWebUI security administration, using file-based and queue-based.\nDifferent ways to create nodes and integration servers.\nEnabling User trace and service trace.\nConfiguring the flow monitoring.\nAlso, the course contains the installation procedures of ACE11 and IBM MQ in Windows and Linux.

      "description": "Machine learning models are becoming more and more popular. But not every user is convinced in their utility and usability. How and when can we trust the models? If our model has rejected a loan applicant, can we explain to them why that is the case? What types of explanations about the model or its behavior can we provide? What does it even means to explain a model?\nWe address these and other questions in this course on Machine learning or AI explainability (also called XAI in short). We will introduce theoretical approaches and build a hands-on understanding of various explainability techniques in Python.\nThe course builds an overview of XAI approaches before going into details of different types of explanations: visual, explanations of the overall model behavior (so-called global), as well as of how the model reached its decision for every single prediction(so-called local explanations). We will apply each presented approach to a regression and/or classification task; and you will gain ever more practice with the techniques using the hands on assignments.\nBy the end of the course, you should have an understanding of the current state-of-the-art XAI approaches, their benefits and pitfalls. You will also be able to use the tools learned here in your own use cases and projects.\nXAI is a rapidly developing research field with many open-ended questions. But one thing is certain: it is not going anywhere, the same way Machine learning and AI are here to stay.",

Covers Terraform with AWS different resources with infrastructure as automation\nTerraform has gained a lot in popularity lately and is the tool you need to master if you are or about to get into an Ops / DevOps role. You typically use technology like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to automate the provisioning of software. Terraform starts from the same principle, infrastructure as code, but focuses on the automation of the infrastructure itself. Your whole Cloud infrastructure (instances, volumes, networking, IPs) can be described in terraform.\n\nIn this course, you'll learn how to use terraform to automate your infrastructure. I will first show you the basics of terraform and will then explain how to automate infrastructure on AWS using terraform. You can open an AWS account for free to do the labs. I also provide a lot of code examples that you can immediately use to automate your own infrastructure.\n\n\nThis course also has an exam preparation section with a series of practice tests to verify the candidate's understanding of the topics discussed in the course and verify if the candidate is ready to give the official certification exams.\nKeeping the standards high similar to other best-seller courses of Zeal, this course has a perfect balance, and every topic is explained in a simplified way with practical scenarios.\nWith this exciting set of learnings and practicals, I look forward to seeing you in this course and be part of your journey into getting Terraform certified.\nWho this course is for:\nIndividuals who are interested in mastering Terraform from scratch.\nIndividuals interested in gaining the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate certification.",

When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive abilities.\nThus the impact of disability is radically changed on the Web because the Web removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world.

Start your journey and Level Up in Swift today!\nTestimonials\nOne of the most underrated courses on swift. Great way to refresh your Swift knowledge if you have already been programming in Swift. Captures the practical way of writing programs in swift and is concise. I have been programming on Swift from the time it was released and wanted something I could use as a guide. I actually came across the authors video on youtube , liked his teaching style and way he presents the content. Please keep making these videos on Udemy and also YouTube. This should be one of the top rated courses for swift.\nPersonally this course was exactly what I was looking for. It assumes some programming knowledge but is a really thorough yet concise language description. Jonathan has a great natural delivery style and is and the material is excellent. The concentration on practice and doing is particularly welcome.\nI like the way Jonathan teaches, then gives practice examples for you to code on your own so you can properly apply each concept you've learned. This is the second class I've taken by him and I must say, it is much easier learning swift from an iOS Engineer.\nJonathan is very organized, has great didactics and his course was really fun! His Github repository for this course is excellent, with all the code and complete annotations, providing a great resource to study and review the topics. Many thanks for sharing your expertise with us Jonathan!\nThis is the best Swift course I've taken. Understanding getters and setters totally clicked for me here as well as when and how to use enums effectively as types, pattern matching, so much more. The instructor is engaging and motivating. Can't imagine how awesome it must've been for other dev's to work on the same team as the Instructor, truly! Thank you for the exceptional course!",

      "description": "Some Course Reviews from Similar Courses:\n\"I've also looked at the database with multiple system monitoring products. But really where do I go from here? and when I find the problem what do I really need to do? Mike really shows you the nitty gritty.\"\n\"This was just the course I have been waiting for. Mike's demos and scripts have helped me become a confident tuner. The best thing about this course was that I was able to improve our server performance straightaway.\"\n\"I already have a great deal of DBA related experienced in the real world. What this course did for me was help me establish a model, and strategy for database tuning and performance monitoring.\"\nThank you reviewers for your kind feedback.\nIMPORTANT: In Microsoft nomenclature there are two portals: Classic Portal and Azure Portal. The Classic one is being phased out. This Course is entirely based on Azure Portal, which is the newest version.\nAdditionally, this course is NOT for any of the current Microsoft Certifications.\nIn this course we are going to cover Azure SQL Database. Azure SQL Database is Microsoft’s cloud database service.\nBased on SQL Server database technology and built on Microsoft’s Windows Azure cloud computing platform, SQL Azure enables organizations to store relational data in the cloud and quickly scale the size of their databases up or down as business needs change. Data is hosted, managed and provisioned in Microsoft data centers.\nThis course takes a hands on, real world approach to working with Azure SQL Databases. While there is some theory most the course will be focused on working with the latest version of Windows Azure.\nThis course will give YOU the foundation to become more comfortable working inside Windows Azure.\nAs a SQL Server Consultant I can tell you that many of my customers are MOVING to Windows Azure’s various cloud offerings.\nAs a matter of fact, 30% of Fortune 500 companies use Azure at some level.\nThere are still many LIMITATIONS and nuances to moving SQL Server Databases to the cloud. We will discuss many of these in the course.\nThe code, applications, and TOOLS (like Management Studio) you already use today with your existing databases can be used with Azure SQL Database. Windows Azure patches the database software and backs up your database, storing the backups for a user-defined retention period and enabling point-in-time recovery.\nEnroll Now. Let’s Get Started!!!",

      "description": "Welcome to the Introduction to LangChain course! Very recently, we saw a revolution with the advent of Large Language Models. It is rare that something changes the world of Machine Learning that much, and the hype around LLM is real! That's something that very few experts predicted, and it's essential to be prepared for the future.\n\n\nLangChain is an amazing tool that democratizes machine learning for everybody. With LangChain, every software engineer can use machine learning and build applications with it. Prior to LangChain and LLMs, you needed to be an expert in the field. Now, you can build an application with a couple of lines of code. Think about language models as a layer between humans and software. LangChain is a tool that allows the integration of LLMs within a larger software.\n\n\nTopics covered in that course:\nLangChain Basics\nLoading and Summarizing Data\nPrompt Engineering Fundamentals\nVector Database Basics\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\nRAG Optimization and Multimodal RAG\nAugmenting LLMs with a Graph Database\nAugmenting LLMs with tools\nHow to Build a Smart Voice Assistant\nHow to Automate Writing Novels\nHow to Automate Writing Software\n\n\nThe course is very hands-on! We will work on many examples to build your intuition on the different concepts we will address in this course. By the end of the course, you will be able to build complex software applications powered by Large Language Models!\n\n\nWarning: during the course, I used a lot of the OpenAI models through their API. If you choose to use the OpenAI API as well, be aware that this will generate additional costs. I expect that reproducing all the examples in the course should not require more than $50 in OpenAI credits. However, all the examples can be reproduced for free if you choose to use open-source LLMs.",

Loved this course!\" Rubayet A.\n\"Simply amazing course where every basics are described clearly and precisely. Go for this course.\" Dipesh S\n\"Es claro, preciso en los datos. Las ilustraciones son muy pedagógicas, sobre todo las analogías.\" . Héctor Marañón R.\n\"Good for beginners like me to learn the concepts of Machine Learning and the math behind of it. Great to review this course again. Thanks.\" Clark D\n\"Excelentes conceptos, enfocados hacia las investigaciín de base científica\" Oscar M\nBackground and Introduction\n\nThe trainer of this course is an AI expert and he has observed that many students and young professionals make the mistake of learning machine learning without understanding the core concepts in maths and statistics. This course will help to address that gap in a big way.\nSince Machine Learning is a field at the intersection of multiple disciplines like statistics, probability, computer science, and mathematics, its essential for practitioners and budding enthusiasts to assimilate these core concepts.\nThese concepts will help you to lay a strong foundation to build a thriving career in artificial intelligence.\nThis course teaches you the concepts mathematics and statistics but from an application perspective. It’s one thing to know about the concepts but it is another matter to understand the application of those concepts. Without this understanding, deploying and utilizing machine learning will always remain challenging.\nYou will learn concepts like measures of central tendency vs dispersion, hypothesis testing, population vs sample, outliers and many interesting concepts. You will also gain insights into gradient decent and mathematics behind many algorithms.\nWe cover the below concepts in this course:\nMeasures of Central Tendency vs Dispersion\nMean vs Standard Deviation\nPercentiles\nTypes of Data\nDependent vs independent variables\nProbability\nSample Vs population\nHypothesis testing\nConcept of stability\nTypes of distribution\nOutliers\nMaths behind machine learning algorithms like regression, decision tree and kNN\nGradient descent.\nArrays\nVectors\nDot product\nMagnitude\nEigen vector, eigen value\nCosine similarity ...",

The entire course was created using ManimGL math animation software, so it will be easy on the eyes and a pleasure to watch!\n\n\n-------Why did I make this course?----------\nI was learning Quantum Computing on my own as well as ManimGL. I didn't see a resources online that used both these skills together so I figured I would make such a course. It took 4 months but was worth the effort!\n\n\n--------Why is this course Unique?-----------\nThis is one of the few resources where we have video dialogue, concepts explained with good animations, strong math emphasis, and coding in 1 course! This course covers a wide array of topics and does so elegantly. Hope you think so too!\n\n\n----------Who is this course for?-------------\n- High School/University Graduates\n- Have Experience in Programming\n- Knowledge in Linear Algebra and Quantum Mechanics\n\n\n---------Tips on Taking this course?----------\n- Take Notes and write down all concepts + math equations\n- Try to Write the code on your own!\n- Enjoy the course! There is no stress and no rush\n\n\n----Are you grateful for this opportunity?-----\nYes absolutely! To have the opportunity to teach in front of lots of bright young minds is an honor! On top of that, I am grateful to all the resources (online, textbook, and research papers) that contributed to the creation of this course. I would like to specifically thank IBM's Qiskit Team, Xanadu's Pennylane Team, 3Blue1Brown's ManimGL amazing software, and lastly all of you, the ones interested in taking this course!\n\n\nAnd Remember, most importantly, have fun taking the course!",

This course is specifically designed for those seeking to learn hyperledger fabric deployment on Kubernetes. By the end of the course, you will be able to design, develop and deploy your hyperledger fabric network on any cloud, since we have used the cloud-agnostic approach. This course is completely hands-on and we will be focusing more on the practical approach rather than the theoretical.\nWhat you will learn from this course\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to design, develop and deploy your hyperledger fabric application on Kubernetes. You will learn the following things\nCreating Kubernetes cluster\nSetting up NFS Server\nStarting up Fabric CA Server\nGenerating certificates for peers and orderers\nCreating artifacts like genesis block, channel transaction, and anchor peers\nCreating application channel\nJoining application channel\nConfiguring peers to use external chaincode builder\nStarting up peer nodes\nPackaging chaincode as per external chaincode builder settings\nStarting up chaincode as service in Kubernetes\nApproving chaincode\nCommitting chaincode\nInvoking and querying transactions.\nSetting up REST API Server\nSetting up Frontend Application build over Angular\nHyperledger Explorer Integration\nEnabling Hyperledger Fabric Monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana\nSetting up an ingress controller and domain configuration.\nEnabling SSL on Kubernetes with the help of cert-manager and Let's encrypt\n\n\nVarious Ways for Hyperledger Fabric Deployment\nAs Hyperledger Fabric components are deployed as containers, everything works fine when running in the localhost. When they are running in different hosts, we need to find a way to make these containers talk to one another.\nStatic IP By specifying the host IP where a container is running, containers can communicate with each other. Those host IPs are specified using extra_hosts in docker-compose files, and after a container is running, these entries are seen in, etc/hosts. The downside is that things are statically configured, and there are challenges when one needs to add or change the configuration.\nDocker Swarm Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool natively in the Docker environment. In a nutshell, It provides an overlay network for containers across multiple hosts. Those containers on this overlay network can communicate to one another as if they were on a large host. Obviously, the good side is that the original configuration can be used with minimal modification, and no static information such as IP is coded in the configuration.\nKubernetes (k8s) K8s by far is the most popular container orchestration tool. The mechanism is similar to Docker Swarm. The implementation of this approach is much more challenging than the previous two mechanisms but this approach is much more scalable and recommended by the Hyperledger Fabric team.",

      "description": "Designing Robust Workloads with Cloud Design Patterns\nCloud architects achieve resilient, secure, and high-performing workloads by thoughtfully integrating platform services, functional capabilities, and custom code to meet both business and technical requirements. Effective cloud solutions require a deep understanding of these requirements, as well as careful selection of topologies and methodologies to address the unique challenges and constraints of each workload. Cloud design patterns—proven approaches to recurring architectural problems—offer valuable guidance for overcoming these challenges.\n\n\nThe Importance of Design Patterns in Cloud Architecture\nEstablished design patterns are fundamental building blocks for system architecture. By leveraging these patterns, architects can design infrastructure and distributed systems that are reliable, secure, cost-effective, efficient, and high-performing. The patterns covered in this course are technology-agnostic and can be applied across Microsoft Azure, other cloud platforms, on-premises environments, and hybrid solutions.\n\n\nWhy Cloud Design Patterns Matter\nCloud-based workloads encounter unique challenges, often related to commonly misunderstood assumptions of distributed computing—such as assuming networks are always reliable, latency is zero, bandwidth is unlimited, security is guaranteed, system topologies remain static, administration is consolidated, component versioning is simple, and observability can be postponed. These mistaken assumptions can compromise system reliability and performance. Cloud design patterns do not eliminate these challenges outright, but they help identify potential issues and provide mitigation strategies. Each pattern presents specific trade-offs; understanding why a pattern should be applied is just as crucial as understanding how to implement it.\n\n\nUsing Patterns to Build Well-Architected Workloads\nIndustry-standard design patterns are the foundation for creating robust, scalable, and efficient cloud solutions. Each pattern aligns with key pillars of architectural excellence: reliability, security, performance efficiency, operational excellence, and cost optimization. Some patterns may introduce trade-offs among these pillars, so thoughtful evaluation is essential during the design process\n\n\nKey Cloud Design Patterns Covered\n\nThis course covers a range of primary patterns, including:\n\nAmbassador: Offload client connectivity tasks to a helper service for greater abstraction.\nAnti-Corruption Layer: Implement a façade to safely integrate with legacy systems.\nAsynchronous Request-Reply: Support asynchronous backend processing while providing timely frontend responses.\nBackends for Frontends: Create tailored backend APIs for specific frontend interfaces to achieve better separation of concerns.\nBulkhead: Isolate application components into pools to limit the impact of failures and enhance system resilience.\nCache-Aside: Load data into a cache on demand to improve application responsiveness.\nChoreography: Empower individual services to control business operations independently, removing the need for a central orchestrator.\nClaim Check: Break down large messages to prevent overloading message brokers and streamline message processing.\nCompensating Transaction: Define steps to undo operations as part of eventually consistent workflows.\nCompeting Consumers: Scale processing by allowing multiple consumers to process messages in a queue simultaneously.\nDeployment Stamps: Deploy independent sets of infrastructure components to enhance scalability and isolation.\nExternal Configuration Store: Manage configuration externally, separate from application deployment packages.\nFederated Identity: Delegate authentication processes to external identity providers for improved security.\nGatekeeper: Use an intermediary service to securely validate and broker client requests.\nGateway Aggregation: Combine multiple backend calls into a single request using an API gateway.\nGateway Offloading: Delegate shared or compute-intensive tasks to a specialized proxy gateway.\nGateway Routing: Direct incoming requests to different backend services through a unified endpoint.\nGeodes: Deploy backend services across geographically distributed nodes to maximize availability and performance.\nPriority Queue: Ensure high-priority requests receive expedited processing.",

      "description": "Overview\nJavaScript is a programming language that can be run by all modern web browsers. It is downloaded alongside the HTML code of a webpage. Unlike HTML, which can only be used to display content, JavaScript allows web designers to add functionality and interactivity to their websites.\n\n\nWhat you will learn\nWe will begin the course by learning where to write JavaScript. We will look at writing JavaScript directly inside an HTML tag, then inside of a <script> tag, and then finally in a file separate from the HTML document. We will discuss some of the reasons for using each method.\nAfter that, we will learn about how to manipulate some basic data types. We will learn about how to do simple arithmetic, and also look at some of JavaScript's built-in mathematical capabilities. Then, we will learn about working with words and characters, using a data type known as the \"string\". We will also cover the Boolean type, which is a representation of True and False inside of a programming language.\nThen we will move on to more complex types. We will learn about the array, which is essentially a list. We will look at how to create arrays, how to access elements inside them, and how to modify the contents of an array. Functions will also be covered, which will allow us to organize code into simple, reusable pieces. We will also learn about objects, which are a way of grouping together data and behaviors.\nWe will then move on to control flow. We will look at the \"if\" statement, which allows the script to decide whether or not to execute a block of code based on some condition. We will also look at looping. Looping refers to repeatedly executing a block of code until some condition is met. Then, we will learn about errors, and how to handle them properly so that they do not halt execution of the script.\nNext, we will look at the Document Object Model ( DOM ). This is what allows JavaScript to interact with the HTML code of a webpage. We will look at several ways of finding any particular HTML element on the page. Then we will see what information we can extract from that element (tag name, attributes,etc.). We will learn about adding and removing elements from a page. Finally, we will learn about events, which allows JavaScript to react to things like mouse clicks, mouse movement, key presses, and many others.\nWe will end the course with a practical exercise, in which we will build a simple JavaScript-based webpage. We will put to use most of the concepts covered in the course. We will look at how to validate user input, how to display results, and how to display meaningful error message to the user.\nPrerequisites\nHTML\n: The student must know how to use HTML tags and attributes. Only a very basic understanding of HTML is assumed.\nGoogle Chrome\n(Recommended): Google Chrome is a free web browser and it will be\nused to execute all the examples in this course. Although all browsers can run JavaScript, Chrome has extensive built-in developer tools. In the course, we will be using Chrome's JavaScript console, which will allow us to run quick little examples without the need to create and edit files.\nNotepad++\n(Recommended): Notepad++ is a free, open-source text editor. Although JavaScript and HTML can be written using any text editor, Notepad++ is highly recommended because of features such as syntax highlighting and auto-complete.",

      "description": "Update for course slide ->> All slides of this course has been updated in pdf format in there respective sections.\n\n\nThis course is designed keeping in mind of providing overall understanding of embedded linux. This course does not cover  advanced topic of linux kernel. In this course, you don't really have to buy any embedded hardware or evaluation board. Here first you will learn about linux  basic concepts which will be applicable for all the linux professional. After the linux basic concepts, we will move towards topics especially designed for embedded linux. In embedded linux specific topics, we will cover qemu, toolchain, bootloader, kernel and root filesystem.\nThroughout embedded linux specific topics, we will be taking reference of qemu instead of real target board like RPi or beaglebone black for covering the practical examples.\nBest part of this course unlike other courses on udemy is that you don't have to buy costly embedded linux capable hardware/board. We will do all the practical examples like running u-boot, kernel, rootfs on Qemu which is a hardware emulator. Once you will be comfortable with concept of embedded linux, then based on your requirement and budget, you can buy  a perfect embedded linux board. In this course, you will get to know how to select best possible board for you.\n*** This course is available in both video and slides. Choose anyone or both which work best for you. ***\n\n\n*** Please note that this embedded linux course will keep updating to improve the course and meet any specific area of interest within the scope of the course based on students feedback and demand. ***",
