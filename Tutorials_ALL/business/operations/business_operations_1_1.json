      "description": "Certified Lean Six Sigma White/Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt\nNOTE: At the end of this course, students will obtain a certificate of completion from Udemy. Students also have the option to apply for free, optional, extra Lean Six Sigma examination and certification + official credits. This external, free and optional examination/certification occurs outside the Udemy platform, requires registration (name, email and a link to your relevant Udemy certificate) and is offered by SSAA (Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam) which is an independent, academic-run training and certification institute with dual accreditation: (UK CPD and Dutch higher education BKO).\nLEAN SIX SIGMA\nLean Six Sigma is a decades old methodology. Without going into too much detail, you can summarize the goal of lean six sigma as: Reducing non value adding activities and thereby cutting costs, as well as improving quality by eliminating unwanted deviations from norms. These are goals that we strive for in pretty much every single sector and for that reason Lean Six Sigma is useful in every sector such as for instance the IT sector, health care, manufacturing, banking etc.\nThe mastery of Lean Six Sigma is shown in belt colors. The classic sequence of belts is Lean Six Sigma white belt, followed by Lean Six Sigma yellow belt, Lean Six Sigma green belt and Lean Six Sigma black belt.\nLean Six Sigma professionals have a very concrete set of skills. This set of skills has proven to be extremely useful when improving quality and consistency and reducing costs. It’s great for process improvement. This is the reason why Lean Six Sigma professionals are in high demand in all fields. It’s best if you convince yourself by actually having a look on the internet at job vacancies and associated earnings.\nPlease note that unlike some other subjects, Lean Six Sigma does not have a universally agreed upon body of knowledge, or a universally agreed upon training and certification procedure. We are very open about this issue, because it should be known by every prospective Lean Six Sigma student. Make an informed decision by reviewing your (employer’s) Lean Six Sigma needs/expectations and compare that with what various Lean Six Sigma training institutes are offering in terms of training and certification and subsequently choose the training and certification that best meets those needs.\nOUR LEAN SIX SIGMA WHITE + LEAN SIX SIGMA YELLOW BELT CERTIFICATION COURSE\nWe are offering two Lean Six Sigma courses in one, namely the certified Lean Six Sigma white belt + certified Lean Six Sigma yellow belt.\nIn the certified Lean Six Sigma white belt course you will learn the following:\nYou will see an actual Lean Six Sigma project that we performed some years ago. We will share our experiences about that project with you. This gives you a broad Lean Six Sigma helicopter view. Our experience shows that students appreciate this helicopter view.\nYou will learn the essential goal of Lean Six Sigma.\nYou will learn the various roles in the Lean Six Sigma system of hierarchy.\nYou will learn how Lean Six Sigma compares to some other popular methodologies such as Scrum or Agile.\nIn the certified Lean Sigma Yellow Belt course you will learn the following:\nHow is quality measured and defined in Lean Six Sigma?\nHow can the 7 tools of quality help a Lean Six Sigma practitioner to improve quality?\nSIX SIGMA ACADEMY AMSTERDAM\nSix Sigma academy Amsterdam (SSAA) is an initiative of an international group of university lecturers from Holland who have supervised projects at some of the largest organizations in and outside Holland. The aim was to teach what we already taught offline to university students and make that training more affordable, more accessible, more convenient, whilst making sure that it was practical, fun and easy to grasp. You do not need a particular set of mathematics or statistics skills to keep up. This Lean Six Sigma training is going to be very accessible for people from various educational backgrounds.\n\n\nThe Dutch BKO accreditation is an academic grade type of accreditation which differs from an accreditation that commercial parties offer to training institutes. This type of accreditation can only be obtained by academics. Although it is a Dutch accreditation, our experience shows that it is extremely well received outside Holland as well because of the academic nature.\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n30 day money back guarantee\nUdemy certificate of completion\nPossibility to gain professionalization credits\n12 official CPD credits\nWe hope to welcome you to our combined Lean Six Sigma White Belt + Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt certification course. Thanks for considering us.\nTeam SSAA",

      "description": "CLIENT MANAGEMENT IS CONFLICT MANAGEMENT\nClient management is not an easy position. In fact, any relationship management position is tough.\nNamely, because clients are frequently angry or disappointed at your company.\nAnd whose job is it to fix the mess? Yours.\nNot to mention that you have to both make the company AND the client satisfied.\nAll in all, it's not a very easy position.\nWhat most professionals underestimate, however, is the role of conflict management in client management.\nA lot of the position is about conflict resolution.\nEffectively \"defusing\" the person. Finding out what's wrong. Finding out how it can never happen again.\nTherefore, in order to effectively manage clients, we have to learn how to effectively manage conflict.\nAnd that is what we are here to do.\n\n\n\n\nWHY THIS COURSE?\nNaturally, you will find multiple courses on social skills.\nSo... why this one?\nEasy. Because it's the most complete one out there.\nI've been coaching top executives and professionals for over 5 years, helping with conflict resolution in many different contexts:\nConflicts with co-workers that are competing in terms of workload or credit;\nConflicts with other executives to obtain support for key initiatives;\nConflicts with subordinates or managers in terms of not agreeing with the given performance ratings or reviews;\nAnd many others;\nWhat this mean in practice is that I know the techniques that disarm people. That get people to talk. That make people feel safe to voice their concerns. That reveal the source of conflicts. That make adversaries create alliances.\nAnd many other use cases. You see where I'm going with this.\nFor years, I've been leveraging exclusive, proprietary techniques.\nNow it's time I share some of them with you.\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE STRUCTURE\nThis short course will walk you through some core techniques for conflict resolution, especially if you're leading a team, including showing respect and empathy, analyzing the person's rules, detecting whether the person goes violent or silent, and many others.\nThe course has three major components:\n- The Diagnostic (how to assess what type of conflict you have on your hands, and what rules were broken that led to it);\n- The Techniques (techniques to use to de-escalate the situation including empathy, understanding, respect, guiding towards implementation, and others);\n- The Traps (traps to avoid that can escalate the situation or cause a misalignment of expectations later);\nNot only is it a conflict resolution course, it's also, in many ways a social skills course in general, which means you will be able to transplant many of these techniques from this context to other areas of life (relationships, family, friends, and others).\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn about what is, technically, a conflict with a client, the major types of reasons for it, the usual process to deal with conflicts, and the benefits of being able to effectively resolve issues with clients;\nYou'll learn about the usual client types, grouped by their type and number of purchases/purchase values, the priorities of each type and the best ways to deal with them, and you'll also learn about the various levels of \"touch\" for clients;\nYou'll learn about the major types of client-facing disciplines (customer support, customer success, account managers), the major goals and scope of each role, and where they intersect in dealing with client conflicts. Also, the departments you may have to coordinate with, such as product management, accounting, finance, marketing, and more;\nYou'll learn about diagnosing conflicts with clients. The main causes of the conflict (changes in pricing, personal expectations, breaking of personal rules, etc), the behaviors that clients usually show of two major types (\"hot conflicts\" and \"cold conflicts\"), and how to deal with these, as well as some general best practices to effectively resolve the conflict;\nYou'll learn about using empathy and respect when dealing with the client, which help ramp down their emotions and make them feel understood - especially valuable in tense situations;\nYou'll learn about reassuring and supporting clients that may need it, including spotting the signs of negative emotions (verbal, nonverbal and written), the major methods you can use to reassure them, and the dilemmas present, such as possibly overpromising or promising things beyond our control;\nYou'll learn about making the client focused on implementation - getting them to focus on a solution, even when they're not inclined on doing that - as well as getting them to come up with options, which increases their satisfaction when a solution is found, having come from them;\nYou'll learn about how to optimise the four major modes of communication with clients - your words, your body language, your tone, and your emotions - including tips such as being clear, having open body language, not showing overtly negative emotions, and others;\nYou'll learn about the major traps in terms of disrespecting the other side, such as rushing the client, being patronising, simply not caring, and more, and how to avoid them;\nYou'll learn about the major traps in terms of lack of alignment, including mismatches in expectations, glossing over important details, false promises, being naive, and more, and how to avoid these;\nYou'll learn about the major traps in terms of the interaction with the client, including taking things personally, getting into arguments, lecturing the other side or playing favorites, as well as how to avoid these;\nYou'll learn about the major spectrums of behavior, or dichotomies, and the consequences of being on the extremes of each of these spectrums, such as providing automated versus human support, being an objective advisor versus being salesy, going the extra mile versus just being \"good enough\", being formal versus informal, and a lot more;\nYou'll learn about how to protect yourself using personal boundaries, politely refusing requests which are not acceptable, or attitudes which you do not tolerate;\nYou'll learn about effectively dealing with stress, be it due to dealing with large volumes of clients, difficult clients, tension due to important clients, or emotional labor in general, ways to recognise the signs of stress in yourself, and ways to deal with that stress;\nYou'll learn about effectively dealing with compassion fatigue, be it due to emotionally intense interactions, prolonged emotional interactions, or lack of recovery time, for example, ways to recognise the signs of emotional fatigue in yourself, and coping strategies to diminish that effect in yourself;\nYou'll learn about the role of technology in customer conflicts, both in terms of technology helping identify - and resolve - conflicts. You'll learn about behavioral and sentiment analysis using various tools, the major traps to avoid with technology (detection issues, overreliance, data privacy issues, others), as well as specific tips when using ChatGPT (including matching the tone and language, fact-checking for hallucinations, and so on);\nYou'll learn about dealing with pain points and \"combustion points\" - points in the customer journey where the client faces an issue, and points that are usually neutral but that can become pain points very quickly, respectively. You'll learn about the usual types of pain points that must be hedged (product quality issues, lack of employee training, unnecessary hurdles, not having contingencies for breakdowns), and also the usual \"combustion points\" in various industries (such as inventory issues in retail, appointment issues and wait times in healthcare, and many others) that must be hedged;\nYou'll see some examples of dealing with upset customers in specific scenarios, such as a client angry with raised fees in banking, customers that feel wronged by a promotion in retail, and more;\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit. I don't want you to waste your money.\nIf you think this course is a fit and can take your knowledge to the next level... it would be a pleasure to have you as a student.\nSee on the other side!",

      "description": "My mentor once said that the biggest constraint that any organization has is “Management Attention.” He also said that, no matter how difficult or complex the problem may seem, if the leaders of the organization were able to put their heads together and think clearly, they could solve any problem they were facing. I truly believe that.\nWhat poisons organizations today is a lack of focus, specifically from the leadership team. Trying to improve everything everywhere is a sure way to fail. Or worse, playing whack-a-mole and only addressing the latest issue that is on everyone’s mind.\nLeaders need a process to answer the question: “Out of all the things that we could be doing, what should we be doing to improve our company?” - What they need is a systematic, scientific approach to help leaders focus on the most important area of their business. Applying the concepts of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) has been the most effective way I have seen for leaders to do such thing.\nIn this course, you will learn how identify what needs to be changed in your organization in order to increase throughput, and also learn what should you do instead. This course helps you answer the three most important questions any manager faces:\n- What to change?\n- What to change to?\n- How to cause the change?\n\n\nWhat is the aim of this course?\nMy goal with this course is to help you look at your organization through a different lens. If every decision you make is through the eyes of the “Throughput World,” as I call it, then you are better positioned to challenge the areas of the organization that matter, leave the ones that don’t alone, and create a process of ongoing improvement so that you are always one step ahead.\nBy focusing on how things flow in your organization you can find the key leverage points that will really make a difference, instead of trying to improve a little bit everywhere, hoping that at the end it will make things better.\n\n\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is divided into the find the following sections:\n· Introduction. We begin with a little intro to the course\n· The right Mindset First things first. I discuss the mindset that you need to have if you want to quickly improve your operations. It is easy to become overwhelmed and believe that complex environments need complex solutions. If you can swift through the noise, you can identify what needs to change in order to quickly improve the organization\n· Why focus on Flow I discuss here the business case as to why it is better to focus on flow than anything else. The giants of industry have been focusing on flow and seeing results that others want to copy, so why not do the same for your organization. You will learn from Henry Ford, Taiichi Ohno and the Toyota Production System, or lean.\n· Barriers to Flow I will share the typical barriers to flow, how to recognize them, understand how much they affect the way things run in the operation.\n· Improving Flow Once I share the principles of flow, there are many ways to practically implement it. In this section I share some ideas and concepts you can use to improve your operation.\n· Wrapping it all up In this section I go over a couple of examples on how to apply the principles of flow, and leave you with some final thoughts for you to take it with you as you begin your journey to transforming your operations.\n\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to…\n· Know where to focus in your organization\n· Understand where should your effort and resources be spent for the best outcome\n· Have the right mindset and lens to which approach your operation\n\n\nWho should take this course?\n· Professionals interested in making better decisions\n· Management Consultants\n· Business Analysts\n· Small and medium business owners\n· Startups founders\n· Operational Leaders",

      "description": "CERTIFIED LEAN SIX SIGMA BLACK BELT\nNOTE: At the end of this course, students will obtain a certificate of completion from Udemy. Students also have the option to apply for free, optional, extra Lean Six Sigma examination and certification + official credits. This external, free and optional examination/certification occurs outside the Udemy platform, requires registration (name, email and a link to your relevant Udemy certificate) and is offered by SSAA (Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam) which is an independent, academic-run training and certification institute with dual accreditation: (UK CPD and Dutch higher education BKO). Please note that unlike some other subjects, Lean Six Sigma does not have a universally agreed upon body of knowledge, or a universally agreed upon training and certification procedure. We are very open about this issue, because it should be known by every prospective Lean Six Sigma student. Make an informed decision by reviewing your (employer’s) Lean Six Sigma needs/expectations and compare that with what various Lean Six Sigma training institutes are offering in terms of training and certification and subsequently choose the training and certification that best meets those needs.\nLEAN SIX SIGMA\nLean Six Sigma has a rich history that spans many decades. Lean Six Sigma’s aim is to improve quality whilst cutting costs. Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that is suitable in every single sector, precisely because cutting costs and improving quality is something that is relevant in every sector.\nCertified Lean Six Sigma black belt professionals are in high demand because they posses a very useful set of skills. The skill level of Lean Six Sigma professionals is usually shown by a belt color. The toolbox of a certified Lean Six Sigma professional starts modestly as this person becomes a certified Lean Six Sigma white belt. This toolbox gradually increases as this practitioner becomes a certified Lean Six Sigma yellow belt, then a certified Lean Six Sigma green belt and a Lean Six Sigma black belt. The aforementioned sequence is the classic hierarchy in Lean Six Sigma.\nOUR LEAN SIX SIGMA GREEN BELT TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION COURSE\nIn our Lean Six Sigma black belt training and certification course, we introduce you to some more advanced Lean Six Sigma tools that can be viewed as the finishing touches of your Lean Six Sigma training and certification.\nThese include the most advanced Lean Six Sigma tools and techniques. However, like in previous courses, we have done our best to keep this Lean Six Sigma black belt training and certification very accessible so that students do not need to have a mathematical background.\nIf you have no prior experience with Lean Six Sigma, we advise you to not immediately start with this black belt course since this is the most advanced course in Lean Six Sigma and should be considered as the finishing touch in a sequence.\nSIX SIGMA ACADEMY AMSTERDAM\nSix Sigma academy Amsterdam (SSAA) is an initiative of an international group of university lecturers from Holland who have supervised projects at some of the largest organizations in and outside Holland. The aim was to teach what we already taught offline to university students and make that training more affordable, more accessible, more convenient, whilst making sure that it was practical, fun and easy to grasp. You do not need a particular set of mathematics or statistics skills to keep up. This Lean Six Sigma training is going to be very accessible for people from various educational backgrounds. As part of the BKO accreditation, our curriculum is periodically reviewed and modified if necessary.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n\n30 day money back guarantee\nUdemy certificate of completion for those who do not want the SSAA certification procedure\nPossibility to earn professionalization credits with this course\n15 official CPD groups\nWe hope to welcome you to our course. Thanks for considering us.\nTeam SSAA",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in optimizing any company's supply chain through a series of practical cases. It is designed for people who want to become management consultants, business analysts or have to run and optimize supply chai on a daily basis. In the course you will learn 3 things:\nHow to understand supply chain activities\nHow to optimize the supply chain to get more things done, cheaper at higher quality with fewer resources\nWhere to look for savings and improvements, how to calculate potential savings in Excel and implement them\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. Based on what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COOs, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nMost consultants and business analysts are terrible at organizing operational issues. They treat the operations, especially the supply chain, as a black box and try to avoid it at any cost. Technical things overwhelm them and they shy away from them.  This approach is not the right one as you find elements of the supply chain in every business. To make matters worse supply chain efficiency and performance have a huge impact on the ability of any business to compete and grow. Everywhere you have some supply chain that you can optimize by using techniques that I will show in this course.  Supply chains influence heavily other areas especially sales and marketing as well as production. Therefore, it is a good idea to have at least a general knowledge of the supply chain. The funny thing is that you do not even have to be technical at all to be good at the supply chain. I have not finished any technical school and I am pretty good at finding significant improvements in the supply chain.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to build or to find improvements in any business you should master techniques related to optimizing the supply chain. That is why I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or business analysts who have to advise their customers but also to owners, founders of businesses as well as supply chain managers, and directors.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you find and analyze the supply chain. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience, and other notable examples worth mentioning. We intend that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to understand the supply chain\nHow to optimize the supply chain\nWhere to look for savings and improvements\nHow to calculate the impact of proposed changes in Excel\nHow to find the strategic fit when it comes to the supply chain\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on production\nGeneral information on Supply Chain. In the second section, I will discuss the strategic part of the supply chain, how to find the strategic fit, and what aspect you have to pay attention to.\nRetail - Examples of business analyses of Supply Chain. This section will start a series of sections devoted to a specific type of business where are will show you detailed cases. In this section, I will show you an overview of the Retail Supply Chain, the main challenges, and a series of cases that will show you how to reach the full potential of the supply chain.\nFMCG - Examples of business analyses of Supply Chain. In the 4th section, I will show you an overview of the FMCG Supply Chain, the main challenges, and a series of cases that will show you how to reach the full potential of the Supply Chain.\nSMCG - Examples of business analyses of Supply Chain. In the 5th section, I will show you an overview of the SMCG Supply Chain, the main challenges, and a series of cases that will show you how to reach the full potential of the Supply Chain.\nCommodity - Examples of business analyses of Supply Chain. In this section, I will show you an overview of the Commodity Supply Chain, the main challenges, and a series of cases that will show you how to reach the full potential of the Supply Chain.\nDistribution model - general information. Distribution (logistics and warehousing) is the powerhouse of the supply chain moving physically the goods. In this section, I will show you: the goals of the distribution model, the basic laws of distribution, different types of distribution,  Where you can find savings, and typical problems in Distribution.\nSales forecasting and customer service - general information. Sales forecasting gives the input data for the whole supply chain. Even small glitches in this part cause huge problems in the whole supply chain. In this section, I will show you: the goals of sales forecasting, Sales forecasting, customer service value drivers, and typical problems in sales forecasting and customer service.\nProduction planning - general information. Production planning is the brain of the supply chain. If you get this wrong the other things won’t matter.  In this section, I will show you: the goals of production planning, production planning value drivers, and typical problems in production planning.\nPurchasing - general information. Purchasing has a big impact not only on cost but also the inventory levels. The wrong quality of products bought will lead to problems both in sales and in production. In this section, I will show you: the goals of purchasing, purchasing value drivers, and typical problems in purchasing.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAdditional Resources",

This gives insights on the importance of the tool and makes it possible for the student to compare with his/her own experience and background. It also a basis to make the important before & after comparisons. Each step of 5S is explained, first with simple animations and after with a real implementation case in a manufacturing company.\nIn the animations, our friend Joe has a problem which he decides to never let happen again with 5S. Joe’s problem will make the need for 5S clear for you, as well as the concepts behind each step. In a real production company, there are tricky issues that typically emerge in this process. These issues are brought up, and so are the countermeasures and success hints learned by experience to make your program a success.\n5S builds the basis to all Lean approaches, so it is fair to say that the journey starts here.\nIn a single course, we give you the chance to minimize the implementation risks, to avoid typical failure modes and to radically improve the processes of your company!",

In fact, there’s a new boss in town, named Customer CEO.\nThis course is based on Chuck Wall’s book, Customer CEO: How to Profit from the Power of Your Customers.  Customer CEO was selected by an international panel of judges as one of the top two marketing books published in 2013.\nThis course will help you confront a new market reality: that customers choose which companies to do business with entirely on their own terms. Contrary to popular opinion, Chuck shows you that the customer is not always right. But, they still hold the cards in today’s fragmented, highly competitive, social commerce marketplace. This reality effectively inverts the power, control, and direction of decision-making. To survive and prosper in this new landscape, leaders, managers, and employees must quickly adapt or face extinction.\nThis course offers much more than theory. Chuck’s primary research with over 100,000 consumers has revealed that every customer possesses nine powers. He lays out each power for you and explains how you can take advantage of it for your company.\nThe course features numerous case studies of companies that enjoy competitive advantage by understanding this new reality.",

      "description": "In today's fast-paced world, consumers and industries alike demand products that perform flawlessly—not just today, but for years to come. That's where reliability engineering comes in.\nReliability is often referred to as \"quality over time\". And this idea of measuring, analyzing and improving product reliability that was birthed in the early days of electronics and aviation, now extends into every sector of consumer and industrial products. Automobiles, airplanes, appliances, smart phones and more have all found their way into the hands of everyday consumers because of the advancement in reliability engineering.\nIntroduction to Reliability Engineering equips quality, manufacturing, and engineering professionals with the introductory tools and techniques needed to reduce failures, improve product performance, and ensure customer satisfaction.  will give you a foundational understanding of these key ideas and prepare you for more advanced training.\nWhile an advanced understanding of statistics is required to become a reliability engineer, only a basic understanding of manufacturing, mathematics and Microsoft Excel is required to get started in this class.\n\n\nWhat Can You Expect to Learn?\nWe cover a wide range of essential concepts to give you a solid foundation in the field, including:\nUnderstanding the Core Causes of Product Failure: Learn why things fail and how to prevent it.\nStrength vs. Load Analysis: Explore the relationship between product strength and the stresses it faces in real-world use.\nStatistical Analysis: Learn how the Normal and Exponential distributions are used to analyze and predict reliability.\nAccelerated Life Testing (ALT): Discover how to simulate years of product use in a fraction of the time.\nReliability Block Diagrams: Learn how to model and assess the reliability of complex systems.\nSystem Reliability Assessment: Understand how to evaluate and improve the reliability of entire systems, not just individual components.\nReliability Improvement: Gain techniques to enhance product performance over time.\nHighly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) & Highly Accelerated Stress Screening (HASS): Understand accelerate testing to find weaknesses early in product development.\nPreventive and Predictive Maintenance: Learn how to reduce downtime and extend the lifespan of equipment.\nAnd much more! Each topic is designed to give you practical tools you can apply in your work, whether you're focused on product development, quality control, or process improvement.\n\n\nWhat Have Former Students Said About This Course:\n\"This course was absolutely fantastic. The instructor is very engaging and knowledgeable of the topic ...

      "description": "Clients are eager to hire virtual assistants who bring a wide variety of strong skills to the table. While clients (should) provide you some sense of how they like their tasks to be completed, they don't usually have the time or resources to train you on basic tasks.\n\n\nThat's where this course comes in. This course will train you on must-have skills and provide downloadable templates and scripts for you to use with your own clients.\n\n\nThis course has three main goals:\nTo give you training on the most common tasks/requests.\nTo give you basic training and tips on the common back-of-office things you'll need to do as a VA (think how to send clients an invoice, how to store client data securely, and even how fast you should aim to respond to client emails).\nTo help you \"standardize\" your work, enabling you to work smarter and not harder.\n\n\nSKILLS YOU WILL LEARN\nCalendar Management: Learn to access client's calendars, schedule appointments/meetings, best online tools, and more.\nInbox Management: Learn to request access to client's inboxes, send emails on client's behalf, create filters and priority systems.\nExpense Reporting: Learn the basics of expense reporting and about some of the most common corporate expense systems.\nSocial Media Maintenance: Learn how to automate social media posts, including a mix of free and paid tools, and track metrics.\nResearch: Learn how to provide easy-to-digest comparative, data, and informational research to your clients.\nLead generation: Learn how to find any email and create lists of leads (or potential clients) for your own client's business.\nEvent planning: Learn how to research and book vendors and manage guest lists and budgets.\nTravel booking: Learn to research the best flights, hotels, vacation rentals, car rentals, book with peace of mind, and check clients into travel ahead of time.\nPhoto/Presentation Editing: Learn the basics of editing photos and presentations, including the best free online tools that go way beyond Canva.\nMaking purchases: Learn the proper way to make a purchase on a client's behalf.\n\n\nBut wait! What if your client requests something that you're totally unfamiliar with? The double-edged sword of working as a freelance VA is that you are responsible for your own continuing education. You'll learn about strategies to help you manage tasks that are WAY above your head (without losing your clients).\n\n\nWe'll also cover basics about back-off-office training, like how to invoice clients, keep their data stored safely, and why you might consider end-of-week reports or weekly check-ins.\n\n\nTHIS COURSE INCLUDES\nTemplates, templates, templates! Standardize your work and save yourself precious time by downloading or bookmarking my pre-made templates. Skip the \"building\" and start using these documents with your own clients, including but not limited to:\ntravel\nresearch\nsocial media\npurchasing\nevent planning\nChecklists to ensure you're not skipping any step for any task.\nPre-made spreadsheets to help you track projects, like social media management.\nScripts to use with your own clients.\nA free delegation eBook to give to your clients. Delegation is a skill and not all clients are innately great at delegating tasks. If you have a client who struggles to give you tasks, slip them this eBook to help get their creative juices flowing.\n\n\nWho this course is for: New to beginner virtual assistants looking for some extra training on commonly requested tasks.\n\n\nWho this course is not for: This course will not teach you how to find clients. Start with the course \"How to Find Your FIRST Virtual Assistant Clients\" instead.\nAdditionally, if you're a well established VA who already has a good handle on common tasks, you might not find more value from this content.\n\n\nTHIS COURSE IS BEST VIEWED ON THE WEB (AND NOT ON A MOBILE PHONE).\n\n\nMore about the teacher:\nI'm Erin, I've been a Virtual Assistant since 2012. Nearly 10 years later, there is still no true standardization of work across the VA industry. You technically don't need any training to become a VA, which is both a good...and not-so-good thing. It can take years for independent VAs to learn these skills and develop systems that work for their business. My goal is to help VAs like yourself skip the hard part and start working with better, higher-paying clients, faster.\nJoin 45,000 happy students online and start your VA journey with me today!",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?    This course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in optimizing the production, and operations of any company through a series of practical cases. It is designed for people who want to become consultants, or business analysts, or have to run and optimize production on a daily basis. In the course you will learn 3 things:\nHow to understand any production or operational activities\nHow to optimize the production and operations in order to get more things done, cheaper at higher quality with fewer resources using elements from lean manufacturing, theory constraints\nWhere to look for savings and improvements, how to calculate potential savings in Excel and implement them\nI will concentrate here on lean manufacturing techniques as well as things related to the theory of constraints (removing bottlenecks and critical chains).\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nMost consultants and business analysts are terrible at organizing operational issues. They treat the operations, especially production, as a black box and try to avoid it at any cost. Technical things overwhelm them and they shy away from them. This approach is not the right one as you find elements that resemble production everywhere. In hospitals, most procedures performed are very similar to production issues. The same goes for running a call center, a chain of restaurants, a logistics company, or a firm delivering specialized services. Everywhere you have operations that you can optimize by using techniques that I will show in this course.  Production heavily influences other areas, especially sales and marketing. Therefore, it is a good idea to have at least a general knowledge of production. The funny thing is that to be good at production you do not even have to be technical at all. I have not finished any technical school and I am pretty good at finding significant improvements in production. One of the best Production Directors I know has finished Pedagogical Studies.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to build or to find improvements in any business you should master techniques related to optimizing production. That is why I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or business analysts who have to advise their customers but also to owners, founders of businesses as well as production directors.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you find and analyze production. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to understand the production\nHow to optimize it\nWhere to look for savings and improvement in production\nHow to calculate the impact of proposed changes in Excel\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on production\nBasic methods of improving production. In the second section, I will discuss the basic techniques that you can use to optimize your business. Here you will find the potential low-hanging fruits. Here I will show you basic lean manufacturing methods as well as elements of the theory of constraints. You will also see how to calculate potential savings in Excel\nContinuous Flow. The ideal in production is the so-called continuous flow in which production goes smoothly and fast. Products are being produced fast and cheaply. In this section, I will tell you how to achieve it. This is one of the pivotal elements of lean manufacturing\nAdvanced methods of improving production. In this section, I will continue with the more advanced ways in which you can improve your production such as SMED, TPM, Automation, Critical Chain\nCapacity management. Apart from optimizing the production you have to think strategically and know when you have to add a new capacity/factory. In this section, I will show you how you can do that\nProduction planning. Production planning is the brain of production. If you get this wrong the other things won’t matter. In this section, I will show you some ways in which you can analyze and improve production planning\nA case study in Optimization of in-store processes using Lean Manufacturing. In this section, I will show you how you can use lean manufacturing techniques to optimize processes in stores.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nAnalyze production process\nImprove production process – make it faster, cheaper, and at higher quality\nCalculate in Excel the potential impact of proposed changes\nApply improvement techniques to other fields and industries\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nConsultants\nProduction Directors\nBusiness analysts\nSmall and medium business owners\nStartups founders\nControllers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

      "description": "The warehouse continues to play a major role within supply chains and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The growth in fulfilment centres for e-commerce, for example, is certainly changing the warehousing landscape. Finished stock needs to be held as close to the point of consumption as possible to reduce ever-increasing transportation costs and to meet increasingly demanding customer delivery requirements. This has led to many warehouses transforming into cross-dock and transhipment centres, fulfilment centres, sortation and consolidation points, reverse logistics centres as well as fulfilling their roles as storage facilities.\n\n\nThis course's core concept is to discuss the warehouse processes together with putting the role of the warehouse into context within the overall supply chain. At the same time, it will demonstrate how to manage your warehouse's costs and discuss a variety of performance metrics and models.\n\n\nThe course focuses on the areas that challenge today’s warehousing and logistics managers. These include:\nimproving efficiency and productivity whilst reducing costs;\nimproving quality and accuracy;\nreduced lead times from customers;\ntechnological advancements;\nworkforce availability and management; and\nhealth and safety.\nThe use of AI in warehouse management\nThis course has been created in such a way that I hope it will be a useful reference point for all the staff involved in the day-to-day operations of a warehouse; senior managers who require a basic understanding of warehouses; designers and planners; external agencies needing a basic understanding; and, finally, those who are considering a career in warehousing and logistics.",

      "description": "Lean Management Certification | Lean Expert | Accredited (For all sectors)\nNOTE: At the end of this course, students will obtain a certificate of completion from Udemy. Students also have the option to apply for free, optional, extra Lean (Six Sigma) examination and certification + official credits. This external, free and optional examination/certification occurs outside the Udemy platform, requires registration (name, email and a link to your relevant Udemy certificate) and is offered by SSAA (Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam) which is an independent, academic-run training and certification institute with dual accreditation: (UK CPD and Dutch higher education BKO). Please note that unlike some other subjects, Lean Six Sigma does not have a universally agreed upon body of knowledge, or a universally agreed upon training and certification procedure. We are very open about this issue, because it should be known by every prospective Lean Six Sigma student. Make an informed decision by reviewing your (employer’s) Lean Six Sigma needs/expectations and compare that with what various Lean Six Sigma training institutes are offering in terms of training and certification and subsequently choose the training and certification that best meets those needs.\nLEAN (SIX SIGMA)\nLean Six Sigma has a rich history that spans many decades. Lean Six Sigma’s aim is to improve quality whilst cutting costs. Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that is suitable in every single sector, precisely because cutting costs and improving quality is something that is relevant in every sector.\nCertified Lean Six Sigma black belt professionals are in high demand because they posses a very useful set of skills. The skill level of Lean Six Sigma professionals is usually shown by a belt color. The toolbox of a certified Lean Six Sigma professional starts modestly as this person becomes a certified Lean Six Sigma white belt. This toolbox gradually increases as this practitioner becomes a certified Lean Six Sigma yellow belt, then a certified Lean Six Sigma green belt and a Lean Six Sigma black belt. The aforementioned sequence is the classic hierarchy in Lean Six Sigma.\nOUR LEAN MANAGEMENT AND LEAN MANUFACTURING TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION COURSE\nTechnically speaking, Lean and Six Sigma are two separate methodologies. Lean is a Japanese methodology that is much older than its American younger sibling, Six Sigma. Unlike Six Sigma, Lean does not have belts. So when you hear that someone is a Lean Six Sigma black belt, this means that this person is a Lean expert and also has a Six Sigma black belt. This being said, Lean and Six Sigma work very well together, a bit like biscuits and tea! And for this reason, almost every Lean specialist is also a Six Sigma specialist and the other way around.\nIn this course we will teach you the foundations of this old Japanese teaching which is also knows as the Toyota Production System. The parts of Lean that mostly apply to manufacturing, are referred to as Lean Manufacturing and the parts of Lean that are more general in nature are simply referred to as Lean or Lean Management. Here in this course, we discuss them both and this Lean Management and Lean Manufacturing training and certification course is suitable for all sectors.\nIn our Lean Management and Lean Manufacturing course, you will learn how to identify non value adding activities in a process. You will also learn how to eliminate these with very concrete Lean tools and Lean techniques. When you do that, your organization becomes more ‘Lean’ and you can serve your customers faster and cheaper, whilst still providing the same quality.\nSIX SIGMA ACADEMY AMSTERDAM\nSix Sigma academy Amsterdam (SSAA) is an initiative of an international group of university lecturers from Holland who have supervised projects at some of the largest organizations in and outside Holland. The aim was to teach what we already taught offline to university students and make that training more affordable, more accessible, more convenient, whilst making sure that it was practical, fun and easy to grasp. You do not need a particular set of mathematics or statistics skills to keep up. This Lean Six Sigma training is going to be very accessible for people from various educational backgrounds. As part of the BKO accreditation, our curriculum is periodically reviewed and modified if necessary.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n30 day money back guarantee\nUdemy certificate of completion for those who do not want the SSAA certification procedure\nPossibility to earn professionalization credits with this course\n15 official CPD credits\nWe hope to welcome you to our course. Thanks for considering us.\nTeam SSAA",

      "description": "In today’s competitive marketplace, companies are under constant pressure to perform in a business environment of reduced capital, slowing growth rates, and increased shareholder demands. Now more than ever, it’s important that your organisation learns to maximise the power of its working capital by cutting costs and reducing the expenses associated with its Supply Chain Operations.\nEvery organisation, whether it manufactures goods or provides services, needs a reliable flow of materials. Global logistics operations play an essential role in the commercial supply chain function, and are responsible for all aspects of material movement. In fact, wise business owners and managers are quickly realising that, rather than being an isolated operation, their supply chain occupies a unique position in linking external suppliers with customers. If you want your organisation to benefit from a more competitive position, it’s crucial that you take steps to develop and implement an effective logistics strategy as part of your supply chain integration.\nLogistics and Supply Chain Management is a particularly fast-moving field whose ultimate goal is to delight and satisfy the customer. The methods and management strategies your business adopts for everything from procurement of goods to control of inventory will have a profound impact on costs, customer service, and your company’s overall profitability.\nNo business works in isolation, and recent developments in how companies operate in terms of integrating fresh technologies, exploiting global markets, and serving and communicating with customers are making new demands on planning and controlling the flow of materials. This course has been designed to give business owners and managers a current view of supply chain management, and an introduction to the best methods for responding to modern demands through improvements in areas like capacity, warehouse, and transportation strategies.\nThis course will teach you everything you need to know to successfully manage the end-to-end, forward and backward flow of materials and information across your supply chain. Together, we’ll examine the concepts, tactics, and applications of various logistics tools and technologies in order to promote a big-picture understanding that extends well beyond internal operations.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a valuable and practical skill set that will allow you to create, implement, and oversee the activities of a global supply chain involving suppliers, distributors, and customers world-wide. You’ll know how to consistently adhere to best practices, and you’ll understand the common terminology that’s used in corporate communications. By showing you how to modernise your approach to supply chain management, this course will make it possible to improve your position in the marketplace through the efficient flow of goods and materials from the supplier, to your business, to the customer – and back again.",

      "description": "CERTIFIED LEAN SIX SIGMA GREEN BELT\nNOTE: At the end of this course, students will obtain a certificate of completion from Udemy. Students also have the option to apply for free, optional, extra Lean Six Sigma examination and certification + official credits. This external, free and optional examination/certification occurs outside the Udemy platform, requires registration (name, email and a link to your relevant Udemy certificate) and is offered by SSAA (Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam) which is an independent, academic-run training and certification institute with dual accreditation: (UK CPD and Dutch higher education BKO).\nLEAN SIX SIGMA\nLean Six Sigma is not a new methodology. It actually has a history that goes back many decades. So what does Lean Six Sigma do? What is the aim? At this point we won’t go into too much detail, but the absolute essential goal of Lean Six Sigma is first of all to reduce waste or non-value adding activities. This saves costs. The second goal is to deliver quality goods or quality service that matches the norms as set by the organization. The aforementioned goals are goals that are relevant for every sector and for that reason we can state that Lean Six Sigma is beneficial in every single sector.\nThere is a hierarchy in Lean Six Sigma that is shown by belt colors. You start as a certified Lean Six Sigma white belt, then you progress to become a certified Lean Six Sigma yellow belt, after which you can continue to become a Lean Six Sigma green bet and a Lean Six Sigma black belt.\nAs you progress from certified Lean Six Sigma white belt to other belts, you gradually increase your Lean Six Sigma skills. These skills are very concrete and quite in demand in the job market. At this point, we do not ask you to take our word for it, but we invite you to actually do a bit of online research and find out for yourself.\nPlease note that unlike some other subjects, Lean Six Sigma does not have a universally agreed upon body of knowledge, or a universally agreed upon training and certification procedure. We are very open about this issue, because it should be known by every prospective Lean Six Sigma student. Make an informed decision by reviewing your (employer’s) Lean Six Sigma needs/expectations and compare that with what various Lean Six Sigma training institutes are offering in terms of training and certification and subsequently choose the training and certification that best meets those needs.\nOUR LEAN SIX SIGMA GREEN BELT CERTIFICATION COURSE\nOur Lean Six Sigma green belt training and certification course is going to take you through the entire DMAIC sequence of Six Sigma. The Six Sigma DMAIC sequence is the sequence of phases that a Lean Six Sigma project goes through. In each phase of Lean Six Sigma DMAIC, our Lean Six Sigma green belt training and certification course will introduce you to a number of tools that can help you in the phase. As a certified Lean Six Sigma green belt you are expected to play a major role in the execution of Lean Six Sigma projects, so you will be equipped with a lot of Lean Six Sigma tools that ensure that you can be of substantial added value in the Lean Six Sigma project. The Lean Six Sigma tools that you learn range from qualitative ones to quantitative Lean Six Sigma tools. Please note that we have constructed the Lean Six Sigma green belt training and certification course in such that it is accessible to a wide audience. So there is no need for a specific (mathematical) background in terms of previous education.\nSIX SIGMA ACADEMY AMSTERDAM\nSix Sigma academy Amsterdam (SSAA) is an initiative of an international group of university lecturers from Holland who have supervised projects at some of the largest organizations in and outside Holland. The aim was to teach what we already taught offline to university students and make that training more affordable, more accessible, more convenient, whilst making sure that it was practical, fun and easy to grasp. You do not need a particular set of mathematics or statistics skills to keep up. This Lean Six Sigma training is going to be very accessible for people from various educational backgrounds.\nThe Dutch BKO accreditation is an academic grade type of accreditation which differs from an accreditation that commercial parties offer to training institutes. This type of accreditation can only be obtained by academics. Although it is a Dutch accreditation, our experience shows that it is extremely well received outside Holland as well because of the academic nature.\nSIX SIGMA, LEAN SIX SIGMA AND LEAN\nSometimes you hear six sigma, sometimes lean six sigma and sometimes lean. What's the story? Lean and Six Sigma are separate. Lean is primarily about reducing waste. Six Sigma is primarily about reducing defects. Lean Six Sigma is Six Sigma with Lean techniques and Lean tools incorporated in it. Lean Six Sigma does not incorporate the whole Lean philosophy in itself. Lean Six Sigma only borrows from Lean pragmatically. So Six Sigma is the pure Six Sigma methodology without Lean elements. Lean is a separate management philosophy and Lean Six Sigma borrows some Lean tools and techniques. Lean has no belts. Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma do have belts to indicate level of mastery.\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n\n30 day money back guarantee\nUdemy certificate of completion for those who do not want to use the SSAA certification procedure\nPossibility to gain professionalization credits by finishing this course\n20 official CPD credits\nWe hope to welcome you to our course. Thanks for considering us.\nTeam Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam (SSAA)",

      "description": "The Operations and Supply Chain Management is part of the larger series of short courses on Operations Management. The first one was Product and Service Management, but this is a modular series, so that you can easily learn various aspect of Operations Management.\nThe supply chain is a network of operations running across an organization, which are needed to design, make, deliver, and service products or services for customers. Production, inventory, location, transportation, and information are performance drivers that can be managed to produce the capabilities for a given supply chain.\nAs a part of their overall strategy, organizations also employ many supply chain strategies to survive and compete in a dynamic and competitive marketplace. However, it is also essential from an organization's point of view to use effective performance measures to ensure continuous improvement of the supply chain and also to set directions of its current supply chain strategies.\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\nsequence the components of the supply chain,\nidentify the key drivers of supply chain management,\nidentify the characteristics of supply chain management in service organizations,\nmatch supply chain strategies of service organizations with their key characteristics,\nidentify criteria for selecting and combining different supply chain strategies, and\nmatch supply chain areas with key indicators of their performance.\nYou will have not much more than 2 hours of video lessons, written documents, quizzes, examples and exercises, and a small course project.\nThis course provides a basic understanding of supply chain management in manufacturing and service organizations. Key characteristics of common supply chain strategies and criteria for their selection are also presented. This course also introduces key performance metrics for supply chain management.\nAnyone working in operations management or another functional area, who is looking to gain a working understanding of the operations functions in a service or manufacturing organization will benefit from this course.\n(HARVEL-37T8B)\nYou have 30 days money back guarantee!

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in optimizing the production and operations of any company through a series of practical cases. It is designed for people who want to become consultants, business analysts, or have to run and optimize production on a daily basis. In the course you will learn 3 things:\nHow to understand any production or operational activities\nHow to optimize the production and operations in order to get more things done, cheaper at higher quality with fewer resources\nWhere to look for savings and improvements, how to calculate potential savings in Excel and implement them\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nMost consultants and business analysts are terrible at organizing operational issues. They treat the operations, especially production, as a black box and try to avoid it at any cost. Technical things overwhelm them and they shy away from them. This approach is not the right one as you find elements that resemble production everywhere. In hospitals, most procedures performed are very similar to production issues. The same goes for running a call center, a chain of restaurants, a logistics company, or a firm delivering specialized services. Everywhere you have operations that you can optimize by using techniques that I will show in this course.  Production influences heavily other areas, especially sales and marketing. Therefore, it is a good idea to have at least a general knowledge of production. The funny thing is that to be good at production you do not even have to be technical at all. I have not finished any technical school and I am pretty good at finding significant improvements in production. One of the best Production Directors I know has finished Pedagogical Studies.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to build or to find improvements in any business you should master techniques related to optimizing production. That is why I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or business analysts who have to advise their customers but also to owners, founders of businesses as well as production directors.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you find and analyze production. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to understand the production\nHow to optimize it\nWhere to look for savings and improvement in production\nHow to calculate the impact of proposed changes in Excel\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on production\nBasic methods of improving production. In the second section, I will discuss the basic techniques that you can use to optimize your business. Here you will find the potential low-hanging fruits\nContinuous Flow. The ideal in production is the so-called continuous flow in which everything goes smoothly and fast. Products are being produced fast and cheaply. In this section, I will tell you how to achieve it.\nAdvanced methods of improving production. In section 4 I will continue with more advanced ways in which you can improve your production such as SMED, TPM, Automation, Critical Chain\nCapacity management. Apart from optimizing the production you have to think strategically and know when you have to add a new capacity/factory. In this section, I will show you how you can do that\nInvestment Analysis. In this section, I will show you how to analyze whether an investment makes sense or not. We will have a look at different case studies. We will analyze replacement investments, investments required by customers, cost-reducing investments, and investments in bottlenecks\nProduction planning. Production planning is the brain of production. If you get this wrong the other things won’t matter. In this section, I will show you some ways in which you can analyze and improve production planning\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nAnalyze production process\nImprove production process – make it faster, cheaper, and at higher quality\nCalculate in Excel the potential impact of proposed changes\nApply improvement techniques to other fields and industries\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nConsultants\nProduction Directors\nBusiness analysts\nSmall and medium business owners\nStartups founders\nControllers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance\nEnjoy the course!",
