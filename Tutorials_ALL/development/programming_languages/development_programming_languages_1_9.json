Python, in comparison to other programming languages (Java, C #) has its own way of presenting certain object-oriented programming concepts, which can be unusual for people who did not use Python before.\n\nKnowledge of object-oriented programming is necessary when applying for a Junior Developer job. Therefore at the end of the course, I prepared 10 interview questions that might appear during the recruitment process. Each question has a proposed answer.\n\nIn each chapter, I am explaining the theory of a given topic with an example of implementation in Python. In addition, at the end of each chapter, I have prepared homework to test your knowledge. So you can write a practical task and check your understanding of the particular section. There is available also a solution for each homework.\n\nCourse content:\nBasic information about classes and objects\nEncapsulation - getters, setters and @property\nInheritance\nSpecial / magic methods in Python\nInstance, class, and static methods in Python\nPolymorphism in Python\n\n\nIf you would like to learn how object-oriented programming is used in Python, I think I can help you :)",

Because its global it is always available to Node.js applications without using require()\nnpm registry contains packages, many of which are also Node modules, or contain Node module\nDemo how to setup your development environment setting up Editor\nVisual Studio Code as an Editor with ready terminal\nCreating your first Node File and running the code\nHow Node Works and examples of simple node syntax\nWhere you can find out more about Node with more examples.\nHow to debug and output content into the terminal various command line and console outputs\nNodeJS programming language environment REPL Read Evaluate Print Loop\nExamples of Node\nProcess Object - with examples\nWhat Node Packages and NPM\n#2 JavaScript Fundamentals quick review of JavaScript Coding\nExplore the fundamentals of JavaScript and writing JavaScript code within the Node.   Loaded with examples about the basics of coding JavaScript.   Back to the basics of JavaScript code .  Because node uses JavaScript code this section will provide a refresher and quick overview of JavaScript.   Designed to cover the core JavaScript required for the upcoming sections and writing Node.\nVariables and the Data Types.  How to declare variables and examples of different Data Types.\nAdding Comments to code\nHow to create Objects and Array\nWhat JavaScript Functions are and how they work\nAdvanced Functions Immediately invoked Function Expression IIFE, Arrow format for functions, JavaScript Closure example\nDifferent JavaScript operators and examples\nUse of conditions for logic, turthy and falsey.  How to use the  Ternary Operator.\nExamples of logic switch statement, and condition statement\nJavaScript loop Structures For Loop, While Loop, DO-While Loop with code examples\nUse of Objects and objects with methods.\nJavaScript Arrays, adding, updating and removing items from an array. lots of commonly used useful array methods for array manipulation.\nArray and Object Values, iterating through the contents of each.\nUse of Template literals to set string values\nMath and Data Method examples, generating random numbers and dates in JavaScript\nGlobal object in Node with the use of timeout\nEvent Queue and Asynchronous operations with JavaScript\nExamples of JavaScript Node Timer module\nHow to Construct promises and Resolve and Reject Promises\nDebugging - use of Try, Catch, Finally which are used to handle exceptions in the JavaScript\nJavaScript Async and Await examples and how the order of output on promise completion.\n#3 JavaScript Asynchronous programming\nAsynchrony, in computer programming, refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events. How to add callbacks that run once a stack is complete.\nCovering Input Output which accesses anything outside the application.  Once the application is started it will be loaded into the machine memory.\nCoding Examples, and practice code outputting into the console when ready\nEvent Driven programming which makes Node.js fairly fast compared to other similar technologies.  Once the application starts it initiates its variables, declares its functions and then waits for the event to occur.\nThe two types of API functions in Node.js, Asynchronous, non-blocking functions and Synchronous, blocking functions.\nThe differences difference between blocking and non-blocking calls in Node.js.\nBlocking occurs when the execution of additional JavaScript in the Node.js process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes. The event loop is unable to continue running JavaScript while a blocking operation is occurring.  All the IO methods in node.js provide asynchronous versions, which are non-blocking.\nNode keeps an event loop, which monitors when a task gets completed, which would then fire the corresponding events.  Node.js overcomes the problem of blocking of I/O operations by using the event loop instead of threads.\nRecursive functions, Function that calls itself is called a recursive function - must have a condition to break the loop.\nThe EventEmitter module makes possible the communication and interaction between objects in Node.  EventEmitter provides properties like on and emit. The on property is used to bind a function with the event and emit property is used to fire an event.\nNodeJS works on the Google v8 environment utilizing JavaScript as its scripting language.\nHow a callback works, Callback added to the background will run once stack is complete\nUse of setTimeout and how it works in the queue.\nCallback example Create a function that returns the results from another function\nEvent Loop with an Example of a Recursive Function\nThe three states of promises\nHow to create promises and more promises examples\nNode process object\nNode Event EventEmitter\nhow to setup events and trigger emit of events\n#4 Node Modules\nEach module in NodeJS has its own context and cannot interfere with other modules.  Modules are like libraries that you can include into your application.  Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation like http, fs, path, and url.\nYou can create your own modules, and easily include them in your applications. Save them locally and use within your node application as needed.  Perfect to separate functionality for your application. To make properties and methods available outside the module file use the keyword exports.\nNPM hosts thousands of third party modules, free packages to download and use.  A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module.\nDebugging - The try...catch statement marks a block of statements to try and specifies a response should an exception be thrown.\nHow you can create your own module locally\nCommonly used builtin modules like http, fs, path and url\nUsing FS module to update file contents, delete files, create new files\nGetting file information including file size with fs.stat()\nUse of node package manager NPM explore some popular node packages.\nUse of package.json - adding and removing packages\nNode Package Manager Module lodash\nNode Buffers how to copy and slice buffer contents\nDebugging node use of Throw, try and catch\n#5  Node Web Application with Express\nExpress is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.  Explore how to setup a web application quickly with Express.\nThe arguments which are available to an Express JS route handler function are request (request Object), response (response Object) and optional Next which can pass control to one of the subsequent route handlers.\nHow to setup express and output html into a localhost webpage\nHow to Serve files from  a static directory using Express\nValues that can be used in route filtering, pattern match and reg exp\nRoute parameters with req.params\nExpress Route with full CRUD Create Read Update Delete Methods\nReturning JSON response\nUse of bodyparser\nSending data from a frontend form to node express to output into the terminal\nReturning a JSON response to the frontend from a frontend request\n#6 MongoDB with Frontend web page interaction using Node and Express\nThe official MongoDB Node. js driver allows Node. js applications to connect to MongoDB and work with data. The driver features an asynchronous API which allows you to access method return values through Promises or specify callbacks to access them when communicating with MongoDB.\nHow to setup a cloud base mongo Database to use in practice development\nConnecting to a mongoDB\nUse of mongoDB client in Node\nChecking a connection to the database\nHow to connect to a MongoDB and select the collections, create collections\nHow to output database collections to the frontend using Express and Node.\nCreating a fully functional node application that uses Express to run a web application.

      "description": "CILIUM:A microservices- based application is split into small independent services that communicate with each other via APIs using lightweight protocols like HTTP, gRPC, Kafka and more. However, existing Linux network security mechanisms (e.g., iptables) only operate at the network and transport layers (i.e., IP addresses and ports) and lack visibility into the microservices layer.\n\nCilium brings API-aware network security filtering to Linux container frameworks like Docker &Kubernetes. Using a new Linux kernel technology called BPF, Cilium provides a simple and efficient way to define and enforce both network-layer and application-layer security policies based on container/pod identity.\nWe believe in a future where Linux has deep network visibility and control for microservice at the API layer, making applications more secure than ever before. If this goal excites you too, we invite you to join us by contributing ideas, code, and documentation to Cilium.\nIdentity Based Security:Cilium visibility and security policies are based on the container orchestrator identity (e.g., Kubernetes labels). Never again worry about network subnets or container IP addresses when writing security policies, auditing, or troubleshooting.\nBlazing Performance:BPF is the underlying Linux superpower to do the heavy lifting on the datapath by providing sandboxed programmability of the Linux kernel with incredible performance\nAPI-Protocol Visibility + Security:\nTraditional firewalls only see and filter packets based on network headers like IP address and ports. Cilium can do this as well, but also understands and filters the individual HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka requests that stitch microservices together.\nDesigned for Scale:\nCilium was designed for scale, with no node-to-node interactions required when new pods are deployed, and all coordination through a highly scalable key-value store.\nSpinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence.\nCreated at Netflix, it has been battle-tested in production by hundreds of teams over millions of deployments. It combines a powerful and flexible pipeline management system with integrations to the major cloud providers.\nMulti-Cloud\nDeploy across multiple cloud providers including AWS EC2, Kubernetes, Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure, and Openstack, with Oracle Bare Metal and DC/OS coming soon.\nAutomated Releases\nCreate deployment pipelines that run integration and system tests, spin up and down server groups, and monitor your rollouts. Trigger pipelines via git events, Jenkins, Travis CI, Docker, CRON, or other Spinnaker pipelines.\nBuilt-in Deployment Best Practices\nCreate and deploy immutable images for faster rollouts, easier rollbacks, and the elimination of hard to debug configuration drift issues. Leverage an immutable infrastructure in the cloud with built-in deployment strategies such as red/black and canary deployments.\nActive Community\nJoin a community that includes Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Veritas, Target, Kenzan, Schibsted, and many others, actively working to maintain and improve Spinnaker.\nMany companies are moving away from “big bang” software releases every six months or so to a continuous delivery (CD) model that enables IT to release updates frequently, even if that means several times a day. Using Netflix and its open source Spinnaker CD platform as examples, this practical ebook demonstrates how a new host of tools can help you deploy software changes to production quickly, safely, and automatically.\nA team of experts from Netflix and Google show you how to automate deployments with Spinnaker across multiple cloud accounts, regions, and even across multiple cloud platforms into continuous deployment pipelines. You’ll learn how Spinnaker enables your company to design and automate a delivery process that not only fits your release cadence, but also the business criticality of your application.\nLearn about the organizational and technical practices that enable continuous delivery\nUnderstand the fundamental considerations you need to solve before successfully deploying software to the cloud\nManage cloud resources for consistency across accounts, regions, and cloud providers\nUse Spinnaker’s pipelines to structure deployments from customizable pieces\nUnderstand how CD pipelines to Kubernetes differ from pipelines to VM-based clouds\nExamine how Spinnaker ensures safety across cluster deployments and pipeline executions\nLearn how to integrate automated testing techniques such as chaos engineering or automated canary analysis into the delivery process",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Python NumPy Programming and Project Development course by Uplatz.\n\n\nNumPy stands for Numerical Python and it is a core scientific computing library in Python. NumPy provides efficient multi-dimensional array objects and various operations to work with these array objects.\nNumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely. NumPy is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.\n\n\nPurpose of using NumPy\nIn Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.\nNumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently. This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science. This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.\nNumPy is essentially a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.\n\n\nNumPy lies at the core of a rich ecosystem of data science libraries. A typical exploratory data science workflow might look like:\nExtract, Transform, Load: Pandas, Intake, PyJanitor\nExploratory analysis: Jupyter, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Altair\nModel and evaluate: scikit-learn, statsmodels, PyMC3, spaCy\nReport in a dashboard: Dash, Panel, Voila\n\n\nFeatures of NumPy\nPOWERFUL N-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS\nFast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today.\nNUMERICAL COMPUTING TOOLS\nNumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.\nINTEROPERABLE\nNumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries.\nPERFORMANT\nThe core of NumPy is well-optimized C code. Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.\nEASY TO USE\nNumPy’s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.\nOPEN SOURCE\nDistributed under a liberal BSD license, NumPy is developed and maintained publicly on GitHub by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse community.\nUsing NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations −\nMathematical and logical operations on arrays.\nFourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.\nOperations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.\n\n\nUplatz provides this in-depth training on Python programming using NumPy. This NumPy course explains the concepts & structure of NumPy including its architecture and environment. The course discusses the various array functions, types of indexing, etc. and moves on to using NumPy for creating and managing multi-dimensional arrays with functions and operations. This Python NumPy course also discusses the practical implementation of NumPy to develop prediction models & projects.\n\n\n\n\nNumPy Python Programming and Project Development - Course Syllabus\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO NUMPY\nNUMPY TUTORIAL BASICS\nNUMPY ATTRIBUTES AND FUNCTIONS\nCREATING ARRAYS FROM EXISTING DATA\nCREATING ARRAYS FROM RANGES\nINDEXING AND SLICING IN NUMPY\nADVANCED SLICING IN NUMPY\nAPPEND AND RESIZE FUNCTIONS\nNDITER AND BROADCASTING\nNUMPY BROADCASTING\nNDITER FUNCTION\nARRAY MANIPULATION FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY UNIQUE()\nNUMPY DELETE()\nNUMPY INSERT FUNCTION\nNUMPY RAVEL AND SWAPAXES()\nSPLIT FUNCTION\nHSPLIT FUNCTION\nVSPLIT FUNCTION\nLEFTSHIFT AND RIGHTSHIFT FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY ROUND FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY ARITHMATIC FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY POWER AND RECIPROCAL FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY MOD FUNCTION\nNUMPY IMAG() AND REAL() FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY CONCATENATE()\nNUMPY STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS\nSTATISTICAL FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY AVERAGE FUNCTION\nNUMPY SEARCH SORT FUNCTIONS\nSORT FUNCTION\nNUMPY SORT FUNCTION\nNUMPY ARGSORT()\nNONZERO AND WHERE FUNCTIONS\nEXTRACT FUNCTION\nNUMPY ARGMAX ARGMIN()\nBYTESWAP COPIES AND VIEWS\nNUMPY STRING FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY CENTER FUNCTION\nCAPITALIZE AND CENTER()\nNUMPY TITLE FUNCTION\nSTRING FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY MATRIX LIBRARY\nNUMPY JOIN ARRAYS\nLINEAR ALGEBRA\nRANDOM MODULE\nSECRETS MODULE\nRANDOM MODULE UNIFORM FUNCTION\nRANDOM MODULE GENERATE NUMBER EXCEPT K\nSECRETSMODULE GENERATE TOKENS\nRANDOM MODULE GENERATE BINARY STRING\nNUMPY MODULE REVISE\nNUMPY INDEXING\nNUMPY BASIC OPERATIONS\nNUMPY UNARY OPERATORS\nBINARY OPERATORS IN NUMPY\nNUMPY UNIVERSAL FUNCTIONS\nNUMPY FILTER ARRAYS\nNUMPY MODULE PROJECTS",

Once we have configured the environment, work with Git in your day to day activities. Set up the workflows in Git. You’ll learn Basic Workflow, Forking Workflow, Feature workflow, open source workflow and Gitflow Workflow.\nThe second course, Hands-On Version Control with Git, covers better project workflows with Distributed Version Control. Explore the Git data model and how you can navigate through databases with simple commands. Debug your application with Git and use various techniques to find faulty commits. Go remote with your repository with GitHub, updating and cloning remote repositories. Set up your repositories in BitBucket cloud. You will set up your own Git repositories, configure access, find and recover from repository errors, and perform repository maintenance and troubleshooting. Finally you will work with centralized and distributed version control systems and see how to use Git to bring order to the chaos of collaborative software development. By the end of the tutorial you'll have figured out how to use Git, mastered workflows (from basic to open source), and adopted the one that fits your needs\nThe third course, Conquering Git: Advanced Training Guide, covers mastering versioning and managing your code with Git by controlling its workflow and using it for your projects.. Delve into more intriguing features of Git such as rebase, stash, aliases, and patches. Explore several examples of these commands to improve your efficiency in using Git. Finally, when you have mastered the various tools provided byGit, you'll be provided with some suggestions to help you to move forward with Git. By the end of the course, you'll have a solid understanding of Git and version control so you can use them in your own projects; perhaps you will be the one providing answers to others in trouble!\nBy the end of the course, you’ll master versioning and manage your code with Git by controlling its workflow and using it for your projects.\nAbout the Authors\nPaul Hacker, a Principal Consultant with AgileThought, has over 15 years of application architecture, design, development, and management expertise in Microsoft technologies.

My goal is to get you up and ready to start coding in Python and Pandas as soon as possible.\nThis program is designed for professionals curious about data analysis and data engineering with Python and the Pandas Data Analysis Library. You don't need to be an experienced programmer to learn in these tutorials. I will give you some code and explain how it works. You will be able to take that code and use it in your day to day learning. In my experience learning to program really boils down to learning some code and then tinkering until you understand how things work. This program is designed that way.\nThis program is spite into 3 sections. The section on the Anaconda Notebook will walk you through the basics of the Anaconda Notebook. The section on Python will get you familiar with the Python language and the code you will need to get started with the Pandas library.

Even copying and pasting the lyrics of your favourite song is a form of web scraping! However, the words “web scraping” usually refer to a process that involves automation. Some websites don’t like it when automatic scrapers gather their data, while others don’t mind.\nIf you’re scraping a page respectfully for educational purposes, then you’re unlikely to have any problems. Still, it’s a good idea to do some research on your own and make sure that you’re not violating any Terms of Service before you start a large-scale project.\nYou can scrape any site on the Internet that you can look at, but the difficulty of doing so depends on the site.\nThis course offers you an introduction to web scraping to help you understand the overall process. Then, you can apply this same process for every website you’ll want to scrape..\nBefore you write any Python code, you need to get to know the website that you want to scrape. That should be your first step for any web scraping project you want to tackle. You’ll need to understand the site structure to extract the information that’s relevant for you.

In 7 sections you will watch high-quality funny videos where Jason, a cartoon with a unique personality, will guide you through various lesson activities to conquer important educational goals.\nInitially, you will get to know Edison through a short series of playful activities using simple barcode programming: Clap controlled driving, following the light, staying in borders, sumo wrestling, and many more!\nThen you will make your own programs for Edison to do more: drive through a maze, avoid the light, play music, dance, even become a train and so many more.\nProgramming Edison is straightforward through EdBlocks: Drag and drop the blocks you want to build a program.\n\n\nLearning Subject: Robotics\nAges addressed: 8+ years old\n24 Funny Cartoon Video Clips\n7 Sections\n24 Quizzes\n2 Projects\nProject – Let's make a train\nIn this project, students initially create a track for the train and then they are asked to program the robot to behave like a train. They are also asked to build (with Lego blocks) and program a second robot to behave like an automatic bar that opens and closes upon the arrival and departure of the train to and from the boarding station.\n\n\nProject – Let’s find the blocks\nIn this activity, after the students have become familiar with EdBlocks, they apply the inverse process trying to find out which blocks consist of an unknown (‘hidden’) program. As such, they get to know and apply ‘reverse engineering techniques.\n\n\nI have to mention that the projects and quizzes are signed by a magnificent teacher and good friend of mine Serafeim Iakovidis. Serafeim helped a lot for the creation of this course and I really thank him very much!",

      "description": "Welcome to the best class you will ever take in your science and engineering career!\nLet me ask you this - How much would you pay for...\n\n\n...actually enjoying your Spring Break without worry because you got your homework done and submitted before the break starts?\n...going to bed earlier because your bug was an engineering units error that was super easy to find and fix in Python?\n...having your professor cite your homework as the solution because its both correct and well presented?\n...actually knowing what is going on in class because you know how to let software handle the heavy math so you can interpret the physical results?\nI was a teaching assistant for 3rd year Nuclear Engineering students at North Carolina State University, and I helped my students transition from writing on engineering paper with hand calculators to using software for their homework assignments. Common errors - unit conversions, simple algebra mistakes, labeling your final answer for your grader - dropped significantly after they became proficient in using their chosen software tool. With better homework grades they felt they understood the concepts more, relieving them of stress, and making them feel better prepared for their paper exams. An unfortunate reality is that as you advance in your engineering coursework, you will absolutely need some type of software tool.\nWhether you are studying Nuclear Engineering specifically, or are a science student choosing among many different Python courses, I want to help you overcome that sense of imposter syndrome and give you confidence in your work. My hope is that this course will make it easier for you to solve challenging homework problems in your engineering coursework, and give you the confidence to solve real-world problems that pop up in your engineering career.\nHow can learning Python make my life as a college student easier?\nYou have enough theory in your science and engineering courses. I'm here to teach you how to use Python how to solve problems in a straight-and-to-the-point practical sense.\nHere is what I will teach you in this course that will make your student life immensely easier:\n\n\nMake the best-looking homework submissions your graders will ever see with Jupyter Notebooks\nLearn how to type fancy mathematical equations just like your professors using LaTeX\nNever be afraid of Linear Algebra again by letting Python's numpy package handle matrix operations\nUse Python's SymPy package to solve Calculus and Differential Equations problems for you\nBreeze through analyzing laboratory data using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib packages to do statistical analyses and plotting of data from your lab classes - you will (almost) never need to touch Microsoft Excel again!\nSay goodbye to unit conversion errors with Python's Pint package that automatically handles units and conversions for you\nDevelop confidence for your future by learning your rights as a worker, how much you can expect to make in your career, and exploring if remote work is right for you (or if you'd rather play with expensive science toys at a national laboratory)\nMy name is William Roysdon Murray - I've spent too many sleepless nights figuring out how to get my work done as a Nuclear Engineering student. I want to spare you the hassles I went through and return your nights back to you. It will be my pleasure to have you in my course!\n\n\nDisclaimer: No organizations mentioned in this video series have endorsed the contents of this series, nor does the lecturer claim to speak on official behalf of any organizations mentioned in this series.",

However, sometimes we are limited by the features of the programming language and this was the case with Java too. Code written in Java was sometimes considered verbose, which in turn made it difficult to understand. However, this started to change since Java 8 and subsequent releases. Java 8 is one of the major Java releases and it incorporated Functional-style Programming paradigm into the language by introducing constructs such as lambdas & streams. Functional programming helps us in writing code that is compact, clean and efficient.\nThis course will give you an in-depth understanding of Functional-style Programming in Java. All the relevant features like Lambdas, Functional Interfaces, Method & Constructor references, and Streams will be explained in great detail. You will learn how we can write compact & clean code via declarative-style programming using Streams. Every concept is clearly explained with well thought out & realistic examples, nice illustrations and demonstrated in code. Several challenging coding exercises are included to validate what you have learnt and to help you get comfortable with functional-style programming paradigm. With over 6 hours of high quality video lectures, the course is self-paced with life-time access. You get a certificate upon course completion.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the C and Embedded C Programming course by Uplatz.\n\n\nThe C Standards Committee created the Embedded C as a collection of language extensions for the C programming language to address commonality concerns that emerge with C extensions for various embedded systems. It's used to create microcontroller programming software Fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces, and essential I/O hardware addressing are all characteristics not accessible in normal C. In simple words, Embedded C is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the C Standards Committee to address commonality issues that exist between C extensions for different embedded systems.\nC is a general-purpose programming language that is frequently used to create desktop programs of all types. Dennis Ritchie created it to design the operating system as a system programming language. Low-level memory access, a basic set of keywords, and a clean style are all properties of the C programming language that make it suited for system programming such as OS or compiler development. In its natural state, it employs a native platform development strategy, meaning that the application's development is platform-dependent and limited to a single platform. Embedded C is a microcontroller-based programming language that is an extension of the C language. I/O Hardware Addressing, fixed-point arithmetic operations, accessing address spaces, and other features distinguish the Embedded C language from traditional C programming. The Basic Structures of an Embedded C Program are organized in five tiers.\nEmbedded C is unarguably the most popular languages among Embedded Programmers for programming Embedded Systems. There are many popular programming languages like Assembly, BASIC, C++, Python etc. that are often used for developing Embedded Systems but Embedded C remains popular due to its efficiency, less development time and portability.\n\n\nAn Embedded System can be best described as a system which has both the hardware and software and is designed to do a specific task. Some examples of the embedded systems in a modern-age car are Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Temperature Monitoring System, Automatic Climate Control, Tire Pressure Monitoring System, Engine Oil Level Monitor, etc.\nEmbedded Systems consists of both hardware and software. If we consider a simple Embedded System, the primary hardware module is the Processor. The Processor is the heart of the Embedded System and it can be anything like a Microprocessor, Microcontroller, DSP, CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) or an FPGA (Field Programmable Gated Array). All these devices have one thing in common: they are programmable i.e., we can write a program (which is the software part of the Embedded System) to define how the device actually works.\nEmbedded software/program allows hardware to monitor external events (Inputs / Sensors) and control external devices (outputs) accordingly. During this process, the program for an embedded system may have to directly manipulate the internal architecture of the embedded hardware (usually the processor) such as Timers, Serial Communications Interface, Interrupt Handling, and I/O Ports etc.\nIt is obvious that the software component of an embedded system is more or at least equally important as the hardware part. There is no point in having advanced hardware components with poorly written programs (software) since otherwise you won't be able to optimize your hardware to the effect you want.\nThere are many programming languages that are used for Embedded Systems like Assembly (low-level Programming Language), C, C++, JAVA (high-level programming languages), Visual Basic, JavaScript (Application level Programming Languages), etc. In the process of making a better embedded system, the programming of the system plays a vital role and hence, the selection of the programming language is very important.\n\n\nKey advantages of choosing C as the preferred language of programming for embedded systems:\n\n\nIt is significantly easy to write code in C\nFast execution\nHigh performance\nMaintenance of code is very simple\nMake use of rich library functions to reduce the complexity of the main code\nVersatility - can easily port the code to other architecture with very little modifications\nRobustness and scalability\n\n\nDifference between C and Embedded C\nThere is actually not much difference between C and Embedded C apart from few extensions and the operating environment. Both C and Embedded C are ISO Standards that have almost same syntax, datatypes, functions, etc. Embedded C is basically an extension to the Standard C Programming Language with additional features like Addressing I/O, multiple memory addressing and fixed-point arithmetic, etc. C Programming Language is generally used for developing desktop applications, while Embedded C is used in the development of Microcontroller based applications.\n\n\nThis course on C and Embedded C Programming explains how to use C in embedded systems. This course teaches delegates how to program a contemporary embedded microcontroller utilizing real-time development tools, in addition to providing them a thorough understanding of the C programming language. The C Programming for Embedded Systems course is designed to provide you with real-world coding experience as well as hands-on project work using ARM-based microcontrollers. You'll learn how to create embedded software applications and handle software configuration management. This C and Embedded C programming course is for everyone, whether you're a student or a working professional wishing to change careers.\nThe Embedded C course gives a step-by-step approach to mastering the C programming language for novices. By studying c in a methodical manner, you may fine-tune your coding abilities and turn your ideas into applications, laying a solid basis for embedded systems and more sophisticated electronics systems.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\n\n\nDevelop C/Embedded C programs in a systematic manner\nCreate applications based on the fundamental notions\nDevelop your coding abilities. in an expert manner\nGet a thorough understanding of C/Embedded C by starting with the basics\nDevelop your debugging abilities and find solutions to your code's problems\nConstruct a foundation for future programming languages and embedded programming\n\n\nC and Embedded C Programming - Course Syllabus\n\n\nIntroduction to Embedded C\nDeep-dive into C Programming\nEmbedded C - Practice\nEmbedded C - Preprocessing\nC Traps and Pitfalls\nSecrets of printf in C\nStandard C Library",

      "description": "Scala's functional programming features are a boon to help you design “easy to reason about” systems to control growing software complexities.In this course we practise many functional techniques by solving various graph problems. We start by looking at how we can represent graph structures in an efficient functional manner. Then we explore both the breadth and depth first search graph traversal techniques. Later we use this techniques to show how they can be used for topological sorting and cycle detection. In this course we also describe more complex algorithms such as finding the shortest path and maximal flow networks. All of these solutions are illustrated with easy to understand diagrams and animations. Special care is taken when writing solution so that the principles of functional programming are followed.\nBy the end of the course, you will be well-versed in all the functional concepts of Scala and you will have refreshed your knowledge of graph algorithms.\nAbout the author\nJames Cutajar is a software developer with interests in scalable, high-performance computing and distributed algorithms.

      "description": "Hello students,\nThank you very much for showing interest in this course Python Pyqt5 Database Programming with MySql in Qt Designer.\n\n\nThis course is going to be very useful for the students who want to create to develop a complete software application using python pyqt5 and mysql server as back end.\n\n\nPython pyqt5 is a moden GUI development library. We can develop a lot of GUI Applications using python pyqt5. If we want to develop GUI based application software, we require a database to store our datas. Mysql server is one of the most used database server in the world. It is very important to store our customer and  companies data in a secured way. So using mysql server to store our data is very important in software development.\n\n\nIn this course you are going  learn the following concepts\n\n\nSoftware installation\n1. How to install python latest version\n2. Install Pyqt5 through pip\n3. Install Pyqt5 Tools through pip\n4. Configure Qt Designer\n5. Install Xampp server for Mysql\n6. Install mysql connector\n7. Install Python program Editor\n\n\nMysql Database creation through Python PyQt5 using Qt Designer\nWe will design a form in Qt Designer that contains a Line edit and a Push Button. After enter the database name we want to create in the line edit, If we click the push button, the database will be created in the mysql server. We can check the mysql server by opening the in the web browser. Initially we have to start the mysql server and apache server from the xampp control panel.\n\n\nMysql Database deletion through Python PyQt5 using Qt Designer\nWe will design a form in Qt Designer that contains a Line edit and a Push Button. After enter the database name we want to delete in the line edit, If we click the push button, the database will be deleted or dropped in the mysql server. We can check the mysql server by opening the in the web browser. Initially we have to start the mysql server and apache server from the xampp control panel.\n\n\nInsert into mysql database table through Python PyQt5 using Qt Designer\nWe will design a form in Qt Designer that contains input for name, address, phone and email. After fill all the details in the Pyqt5 Gui form, If we click the push button, the the entered details will be inserted in the mysql server database table. We can check the mysql server by opening the in the web browser.\n\n\nUpdate the data in mysql database table through Python PyQt5 using Qt Designer\nWe will design a form in Qt Designer that contains combobox filled with all email id in the mysql database table. We use email id as unique field because each persons email id will be unique. When we select a email id from the combo box, the name, address, phone number will be filled in the corresponding input controls. After we made the required changes, if we click the push button, the modified details will be updated in the mysql database table for the selected email id. We can chech the updates in the mysql server database.\n\n\nDelete the data in mysql database table through Python PyQt5 using Qt Designer\nWe will design a form in Qt Designer that contains combobox filled with all email id in the mysql database table. We use email id as unique field because each persons email id will be unique. When we select a email id from the combo box and  if we click the push button, the details in the complete row will be deleted in the mysql database table for the selected email id. We can chech the deleted in the mysql server database.\n\n\nDisplay the data from mysql database table in the Python PyQt5 using Qt Designer Table widget\nWe will design a form in Qt Designer that contains QTable Widget filled with all data in the mysql database table. The program will collect all the data from the mysql database table and save it in to an array. Then the data will be added to qtable widget in rows and columns.\n\n\nThis course will be very useful for the students who want to learn how to develop a GUI application using python pyqt5 GUI development library using mysql database.\nI welcome you all to join this course and get a strong knowledge in the mysql database programming using python pyqt5 library\n\n\nThank you very much.. I will see you in the course.....",

As one of the fastest growing languages in terms of popularity, its a great time to pick up the basics of Go!\nWe start with how to install golang on your system and then we proceed to developing our first golang hello world program.  Then we start diving into golang structure and syntax. Once we become familiarized with initial go structure, we will start working with more advanced topics like concurrant programming and working with packages. During our course, we will explore a lot of aspects of golang in detail and use important packages for everyday tasks.\nGolang is very easy to pick up and its syntax is fairly simple as compared to other programming language. However golang requires a lot of effort and practice to master its concepts (for example concurrancy) which could be very tricky for programmers to understand at first. This course aims to make golang learning easy and simpler by working with simple yet useful examples to make the concepts clear.",

      "description": "Apple has brought new programming language this june, 2014. Out of no where Apple declared Swift. It's innovative language for both Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. The fun part is interactive coding. It's a type safe language. Swift code can run besides Objective-C.\nSwift cares lot of things automatically. If you already have a bit of experience from C, C++, PHP or Javascript, you already know a bit of Swift programming. This course will show those feature and pretty cool features of Swift.\nAs it is a new language, it is the right time to start right away. If you have developer license, you can download Xcode 6. By the time, I am making this tutorial, Apple has released Xcode 6 beta version. It will be possible to learn Swift without Xcode, cause these courses will show all code and output side by side. Courses come up with quizzes. So, you can practice always what you have learned. The more you practice, the more experience you will get. So why wait, let's dive in!!\nThis course will cover basics of Swift, operators, strings, collection types, control flow and functions. All of these has pretty cool features.\nFinally, any kind of feedback is very much welcome. It is your input which will make this course more attractive. If you need any explanation, feel free to contact always.",

      "description": "What is Etherum ?\nEthereum is an open source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts. It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the system’s state changes, along with a cryptocurrency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs.\nThe Ethereum platform enables developers to build powerful decentralized applications with built-in economic functions. While providing high availability, auditability, transparency and neutrality, it also reduces or eliminates censorship, and reduces certain counterparty risks.\n\n\nWhat is a smart contract ?\nThe term smart contract has been used over the years to describe a wide variety of different things. In the 1990s, cryptographer Nick Szabo coined the term and defined it as “a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on the other promises”. Since then, the concept of smart contracts has evolved, especially after the introduction of decentralized blockchain platforms with the invention of Bitcoin in 2009. In the context of Ethereum, the term is actually a bit of a misnomer, given that Ethereum smart contracts are neither smart nor legal contracts, but the term has stuck. In this book, we use the term “smart contract” to refer to immutable computer programs that run deterministically in the context of an Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the Ethereum network protocol, i.e. on the decentralized Ethereum world computer.\n\n\nWhat is a DApp?\nA Decentralized Application, or DApp, is an application which is mostly or entirely decentralized.\nConsider all the possible aspects of an application that may be decentralized:\nFront-end software\nBack-end software (logic)\nData storage\nName resolution\nMessage communications\nTools will be used in this course\nIn this course you will learn all tools which use for develop decentralize application : truffle frame work, ganache, metamask, visual studio code, geth, infura, ipfs, javascript, jquery. This course is design to practically guide you real life skill on development of Ethereum Dapp. Following topics are covered.\nUnderstand the big picture of decentralize application\nInstall development tool : nodejs, truffle framework, ganache, metamask, visual studio code, and plugins\nStart project with truffle unbox\nSolidiy smart contract coding\nInteract with smart contract use truffle console\nDevelop automation test for smart contract\nLayout html\nJavascript code to communicate with smart contract and update webui\nDeploy smart contract to rinkeby test network use geth node\nDeploy smart contract to ropsten test network use hdwallet and infura\nDeploy webui to distributed file system with ipfs\nMake the app fully decentralized\nBlockchain and Ethereum dapp right now are very hot technical trend.

      "description": "Learning is incomplete without challenging questions to assess the knowledge gained. There are courses and books available on Functional Programming & Stream API, which cover these topics in detail, but simply watching the video lectures or finishing the book will not give enough confidence unless the knowledge is validated.\nPractice tests in this course will not only help you to assess your current knowledge of these topics but will also help you to revise the topics quickly. Questions are designed to challenge your understanding of the topics. Detailed explanations for all the questions are also provided for your reference.\nFunctional programming is not a new concept. Lambdas were implemented in other languages much before they were introduced in Java.\n\nBefore JDK 8, anonymous inner classes with a single method was the closest Java came to functional programming but with lots of boilerplate code. If anyone wants to really appreciate the implementation of lambda expressions in java, it is necessary to know the anonymous inner classes in depth and to understand anonymous inner class you need to have knowledge of Regular and method-local inner classes.\nYou may face lots of questions in interviews or written tests where you are asked to convert anonymous inner class syntax to lambda expression and vice versa. Therefore, I decided to start with questions on inner classes and then go on with Lambda expression, method references, built-in functional interfaces and finally end this test series with questions on Stream API.\n\n\n1st practice test covers questions on:\n\nRegular Inner class:\n\n\nRegular inner class and its syntax\nUsage of this reference with Regular inner classes\nShadowing of Outer class variable by Inner class variable\nAllowed access and non-access modifiers for Regular inner class\nAccessing Regular inner class's name from within outer class and outside of outer class\nInstantiating Regular inner class\nAllowed and not allowed components inside a Regular inner class\n\n\nMethod-local inner class:\n\n\nMethod-local inner class and its syntax\nModifiers used with method local inner classes\nRelationship between method local inner class and top-level class\nWhere to create the instance of method local inner class?\nUsage of local variables with method-local inner class\n\n\nAnonymous inner class:\n\n\nSyntax of anonymous inner class\nInheritance and Polymorphism with anonymous inner class\nDefining non-overriding methods in anonymous inner classes\nInstance of anonymous inner class can be assigned to static variable, instance variable, local variable, method parameter and return value\nAnonymous inner class extending from concrete class or abstract class or implementing an interface\nConstructors and anonymous inner class\nStatic nested class:\n\n\nSyntax of static nested class\nAccessing instance and static members of static nested class\nAllowed access modifiers with static nested class\nNested interface defined within a class\nNested interface and nested class defined within an interface\n\n\n2nd practice test will test, how well you know lambda expressions.\n2nd Practice test covers questions on:\nLambda expression and its syntax\nArrow (->) operator\nSimplified Lambda expression syntax\n@FunctionalInterface annotation\nRequirements for an interface to be a Functional interface\nConvert anonymous inner class code to Lambda expression\nthis within anonymous inner class vs this within lambda expression\nUsage of local variables with Lambda expression\n\n\nOnce you are comfortable with lambda expressions, then you can take 3rd practice test to assess your method references concepts.\n3rd Practice test covers questions on:\nMethod reference and its syntax\nDouble colon (::) operator\n4 types of method references:\nMethod Reference to Constructor\nMethod Reference to Static Method\nMethod reference to an Instance Method of a Particular Object\nMethod Reference to an Instance Method of an Arbitrary Object of a Particular Type\nPossibility of ambiguous call when a method reference syntax refers to both static and instance method of the class\n\n\nJava 8 has provided various built-in functional interfaces, out of which 4 are most important and rest are dependent upon these 4 interfaces.\n4th practice test covers questions on:\n\nSupplier interface\nConsumer interface and its default method: andThen\nPredicate interface and its default methods: and, or, negate\nFunction interface and its default methods: compose, andThen\nComparator interface, its static method: comparing and default methods: thenComparing, reversed\n\n\nStream API made the life of Java developers a lot easier.\n5th practice test covers questions on:\n\nGeneric Stream interface and its primitive counterparts\nCreating sequential streams\nImportant methods of Stream interface\nGeneric Optional class and its primitive counterparts\nConvert arrays and collections to streams\nSort a collection using Stream API\n\n\nAfter Stream support in Collection API, processing collection elements became a lot easier. Parallel streams can run tasks in parallel without writing cumbersome logic.\n\n6th practice test covers questions on:\n\nMethod stream() of Collection interface\nSave results to a collection using the collect method and group/partition data using the Collectors class\nforEach(Consumer) method of Iterator<T> interface\nConvert arrays and collections to streams\nstream() and parallelStream() methods of Collection interface\nparallel() and sequential() method of Stream interface\nBehavior of various methods such as forEach, reduce, forEachOrdered, findFirst with parallel streams\nNOTE: All the codes in this practice test are tested against JDK 8.\n\n\nSo, grab a cup of coffee or your favourite drink and test your Java Functional Programming skills.\nFeatures of Practice Tests:\nYou can pause the test at any time and resume later.\nYou can retake the test as many times as you would like.\nThe progress bar at the top of the screen will show your progress as well as the time remaining in the test. If you run out of time, don’t worry; you will still be able to finish the test.\nYou can skip a question to come back to at the end of the exam.\nYou can also use “Mark for Review” to come back to questions you are unsure about before you submit your test.\nIf you want to finish the test and see your results immediately, press the stop button.\n\n\nCopyright 2025 Udayan Khattry\nAll rights reserved.

There are plenty of items that can be used in order to gamify a Moodle course. There are simple steps to bear in mind when designing and then applying for a Moodle course. Students can get badges for specific goals within the course. There are plenty of other elements that can be added to a Moodle course in order to make it more attractive to students. Blocks are also explored and added according to the needs of the course. Gamified courses need gamification blocks as well as certain plugins.\nAbout the Authors:\nSilvina P. Hillar is Italian and has been teaching English since 1993. She has always had a great interest in teaching and has done a lot of research on teaching methodologies and management techniques, and embedding them into e-learning and teaching. She has also explored different types of e-learning combining them with Moodle.\nShe also researches multimedia assets that enhance teaching and learning through VLE platforms. She tries to embed the learning of students through new resources that are appealing and innovative for them. In this way, she ensures that multimedia stimulates different thinking skills as well as multiple types of intelligence.\nShe is an English teacher, a Certified Legal Translator (English/Spanish), and has a postgraduate degree in Education (graduated with honors).She has worked at several schools and institutions with native English speaking students and students of English as a foreign language, and as an independent consultant for many international companies in the capacity of an Interpreter, Translator, and Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) Course Designer.\nShe has always had a passion for technological devices concerning education. Formerly, videos and cassettes were a must in her teaching lessons; the computer was, and still does, play a big role. Her brother, Gastón C. Hillar, designed some programs and games for her teaching. Lately, she has been teaching using Moodle and the Web. She believes that one of the most amazing challenges in education is bridging the gap between classic education and modern technologies.She has authored: Moodle 1.9: The English Teacher's Cookbook, Moodle 2.0 Multimedia Cookbook, Moodle 2.5 Multimedia Cookbook second edition, Mind Mapping with FreeMind, and Moodle 2.3 Multimedia Video Course.When not tinkering with computers, she enjoys traveling with her son, Nico and her love, Jorge, with whom she spends wonderful time.",

      "description": "THE BEST DEDICATED LOGSTASH FUNDAMENTALS COURSE\nThe primary objective of this course is to help students learn the basic fundamentals of Logstash and how to process events.\nLogstash is a log aggregator that collects data from various input sources, executes different transformations and enhancements and then ships the data to various supported output destinations.\nIf you want to learn how to process such a variety of data with easy json like a configuration file, you are in the right place.\nThis Logstash Fundamental course is all you need to take your skills to the next level and position yourself for a pay-raise.\nThe course is for beginners with a basic understanding of JSON and web technologies. Additionally, it will be helpful for students to be familiar with Logging Techniques and Regex patterns.\nAs the title suggests – this course aims to provide you enough knowledge about Logstash so that you can run and operate your own data ingestion pipelines using ELK. But specifically:\nYou will get familiar with the features and benefits offered by Logstash.\nSince this course provides detailed demos of installation and configuration of Logstash, it will equip you well for future use of this technology.\nWorking with data types\nData aggregation\nParching logs demonstrations\nOverview of different beats (Filebeat, Metricbeat, Packetbeat etc.)\nHow to work with plugins\nPractical exercises for you to try out your Logstash skills\nMuch more...\n\n\nIn this course, we will cover two practical activities.\nOne of them deals with structured data in a CSV file and the other deals with semi-structured Apache web server logs.\nThe course is a step-by-step introduction on Logstash, ELK, and configuration of logstash pipeline to read the csv file and apache logs. In this course you will learn about different types of plugins and use cases.\nThis course will give you a solid theoretical understanding of Logstash programming, as well as the practical skills of Logstash.\n\n\n\nWHAT IS LOGSTASH & ELK?\nLogstash is a technology to collect logs then manipulate the input data and finally put into destination source like Elasticsearch. Logstash is a log aggregator that collects data from various input sources, executes different transformations and enhancements and then ships the data to various supported output destinations.\nIn recent years – the term BigData has been gaining popularity. And there has been a paradigm shift in the volume of information and the ways in which it can be extracted from this data.\nELK is one of the few new-age frameworks which is capable of handling Big Data demands and scale. Over the years the ELK stack has become quite popular. And for a good reason. It is a very robust, mature and feature-rich framework. Logstash is the Heart of the ELK.\n\n\n\n\nTOP 3 BENEFITS OF LOGSTASH\n1: Get a job The demand for ELK experts increases every day and Logstash is the heart of ELK.\n2: A usable skill Knowing Logstash programming makes you a better and more well-rounded programmer. You will be able to complete many tasks, that your colleagues will not know how to do.\n3: Further your career. Software companies all around the world are actively seeking out, competent Logstash experts. There are not a lot of them, so the pay is good. If you become a Logstash programmer, it will open up many new options in your career going forward\n\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nAny paid software is required to learn this course?\nNo paid software is required to learn this course. Logstash is an open-source project.\n\nHow is this course different from other ELK courses?\nAlong with hands-on Logstash demonstrations and exercises, you also get in-depth theoretical knowledge focused on the heart of ELK - Logstash.\nOther courses, may only briefly touch on Logstash and focus more on eg. Kibana.\nAfter completing this course you will learn the basic concept of Logstash, like what is ELK, how to configure Logstash, how to create a Logstash pipeline to read logs and ingestion into Elasticsearch etc.\nYou will also learn about different types of plugins like input, filter, output plugins, and their use cases.\n\n\n\n\nGUARANTEE\nIf within 30 days of buying the course you decide that it's not for you, please get a refund. We only want happy students.\n\n\n\n\nARE YOU READY TO LEARN LOGSTASH PROGRAMMING?\nPlease press the \"Take This Course\" button and start learning 2 minutes from now!",

Instead of reading the concepts we will learn the them by coding and debugging, and will experience what kind of errors and bugs can be expected in our journey to learn Rust. Being a developer myself, I have kept in mind the expectations of both new and experienced developers. This course is designed for all types of programmers with different backgrounds. Starting from basic print statement we will go through learning IO concepts, basic and advanced data types, defining functions, covering the Object Oriented aspect of Rust, writing multi threaded code, learning concepts of referencing and ownership, asynchronous coding,  calling APIs, building Web servers and clients and will end up with a complete data persistent Web Backend. Instead of short and pre-planned videos, this course has been divided into lessons according to the concept in being discussed. The lessons were coded live and bugs were solved to give a realistic expectation to developer about what to expect. I hope to see you in this course and Good Luck for your journey with Rust.",

      "description": "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteve Jobs, the man who brought us the iPhone said:\n\n\"I think every body in this country should learn how to program a computer.. should learn a computer language... because it teaches you how to think.\"\n\n\"I view computer science as a liberal art. It should be something that everybody learns... takes a year in their lives.. one of the courses they take is .. learning how to program.\"   [ -- Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, 1995]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis course teaches you how to think, about computer programs; it doesn't just teach you a programming language.\nAlong the way, want to learn programming? Eager to become a software engineer? How about learning the basics of the world's hottest programming language Python, wildly popular software engineering tools, and excellent programming methodology?\nThis hands-on, continuously evolving course that will grow to have 20+ hours of screen-cast programming-session recordings will teach you -- a novice -- how to create useful computer programs that people can use, and how to continually upgrade your programs with new features based on user requirements. In fact, you will build and evolve your own program, \"myPlanner\", during the course, alongside evolving your programming skills. Read the storyline of the program's evolution in the resources section of the very first lecture or the \"Future Lectures!\" section, both of which are available for free preview.\n\nThe Python programming language is ranked as the hottest programming language on the planet right now. (Search the internet for \"Python popularity\" and see for yourself!) Python is also a popular platform for the wildly in-demand programming job of data scientist. This course teaches Python and how to use it in a professional manner.\n\nSoftware engineering tools such as Integrated Development Environments and Version Control Systems, program development methodologies such as Agile, and programming skills  such as requirement specification, top-down design, object-oriented design, and software testing are essential requirements for a software engineer. This course teaches the basics of all these tools, methodologies, and skills.\nThe attraction of this  course is that it is designed to help you learn the basics of all the above in a natural and easy manner by taking you on a guided tour of evolving your own computer program. At each stage of your program's evolution you will learn the necessary tools, processes, and methodologies just exactly when you need them, thus building in your mind a nice, complete and memorable storyline of all the things you learn.\nThis holistic course is a combination of two courses that are often taught separately: a programming language course and a software engineering course. Each video lecture is a programming session captured on screen rather than a talking head and power-point slides, and downloadable for every lecture is the fully working program developed in that lecture!\n\nHere are some of the highly marketable skills you will acquire from  this course:\nPython programming language\nAgile Methodolgy\nRequirements specification\nTop-down Program design\nFlowcharts\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP)\nSoftware Testing\nPyCharm IDE (Integrated Development Environment)\nGIT Version Control System\nUser Interface (UI) design\netc., etc., etc.\nSo, hop on board, join the class and become a software engineer!\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience:\nYou want to become a professional programmer but have  no prior programming background\n\nYou want to learn the Python programming language and the basics of software engineering\nYou want to re-learn programming in a better way\n\n\nSkills Needed:\nYou already have or are willing to develop the habits of precise, logical, and systematic thinking and expression, being organized in your work, and persistence and patience. This course will not only make you a very good beginning programmer, but also perhaps make your approach to all other work as well more methodical.\n\n\nCourse Mechanics:\nIn the very first lecture you will build your very first program, and with each subsequent lecture you will grow your program organically into something bigger, along the way learning all the different tools, methods, processes and methodologies required.\nThus, you will pickup the basics of all the different skills needed towards becoming a professional programmer, not just a particular programming language. Just as becoming a good writer involves much more than learning English grammar and vocabulary, becoming a good programmer involves much more than just learning a programming language. This course will start you on the path to becoming a good programmer.\nAs you progress in the course, not only will you have your own working Planner program that you can show off to your friends, but also you will grow a beginner programmer skill set of the most in-demand things in the software industry.\n\n\nAdditional Course Lectures:\nThis course provides you a unique opportunity to shape the lectures to your benefit. The course has been seeded with an initial 20 lectures, and at least as many more lectures are in preparation and will be added to the course in the near future. These latter lectures will take into account all student feedback on the initial seed lectures. Such development of any product, based on user feedback and involving many releases/upgrades, is referred to as Agile Product Development, a methodology that is taught in this course. Your feedback will shape not only what is taught next but also how it is taught. The earlier you join the course and the more feedback you give, the more you can shape this course to your liking!\n\n\n\n\nCourse Outcomes:\nComputer programming is not just about learning a programming language. In this course you will learn in an easy, enjoyable, and motivating manner how to develop working software programs, that is, the basics of Software Engineering. You will be learning the Python programming language along the way.",

Is to teach you with practical examples how to use all resources on your computer and also how to monitor them.\nThe course is divided into many sections:\nThe first is an introduction to the hardware of the CPUs, cores, and GPUs. It is better to understand the basic components of these items to be able to get the best utilization when you use them.\nThe second section is explaining two concepts. The multi-threading and the multi-workers. The first is a built-in mechanism to run some functions in parallel using many cores but we can't control the number of cores and the way that the functions execute. The second one (multi-workers) is used to run any function on multiple cores but here we can control the number of cores to optimize the program execution. Also, I explained some examples and measured the performance parameters to differentiate between the two concepts.\nThe third section is the GPU section. In the section, I explained how to run any function on the GPUs to make use of the hundred or thousands of cores that the GPUs have. There are some notations to get the best results and I explained all of these notations with examples.\nDeep learning and neural networks: in this section, you will learn how to train any neural network in parallel on GPUs or multi-cores.

They are critical to various problems and their suitable implementation can provide a complete solution that acts like reusable code. In this course, you will learn how to use various data structures while developing in the C# language as well as how to implement some of the most common algorithms used with such data structures.\nInitially, you will get to know arrays, lists, dictionaries, and sets together with real-world examples of your application. Then you will learn how to create and use stacks and queues. In the following part of the book, more complex data structures will be introduced—trees and graphs—together with some algorithms for searching the shortest path in a graph. We will also discuss how to organize code in a manageable, consistent, and extendable way. By the end of the course, you will have learned how to build components that are easy to understand, debug, and use in different applications.\nAbout the Author\nMarcin Jamro, PhD, is an entrepreneur and researcher, as well as a developer and architect of various kinds of applications.

Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++,C#,Java  etc.\nThe purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) ..\nProgramming can be fun as well as challenging.\nThis course provides the core knowledge to begin programming in any language.\nI will use the JavaScript programming language to explore the core syntax of a programming language,\nand show you how to write and execute programs.\nI will be using JavaScript , the most popular scripting language in the world to  explore the core concepts\nof programming . It is responsible for the interactivity like games, online forms or surveys and other activities user’s can engage with on a website. Most dynamic if not all website contains some element of JavaScript.\nJavaScript programming language drives millions of interactive web sites, powers fast web servers and can even be used to build desktop and mobile applications\n\n\nComputer programs (or software) are what make computers work. Without software, modern computers are just complicated machines for turning electricity into heat. It’s software on your computer that runs your operating system, browser, email, games, movie player – just about everything.Programming is a creative task: there is no right or wrong way to solve a problem, in the same way that there is no right or wrong way to paint a picture. There are choices to be made, and one way may seem better than another, but that doesn’t mean the other is wrong! With the right skills and experience, a programmer can craft software to solve an unlimited number of problems – from telling you when your next train will arrive to playing your favourite music. The possibilities are constrained only by your imagination.\n\n\nThe course will teach you topics like:\nExpressions\nOutput\nInput\nStatements\nMixing data types\nVariables\nVariable naming convention.\nData Types\nArrays\nFunctions\nConditional Statements",

This is a fun way of learning the basics and you'll also be able to apply your newly-acquired knowledge to other non-graphics programs.\nA Turtle Tale starts from the basics and introduces all the key topics that are central to programming and Python. All the projects are graphics-based, including creating animations and some games, too. However, the key Python topics you'll learn are universal.\nI've been teaching Python for a decade and I believe in clear communication and in making sure students understand why things happen the way they do, and not just how to get things done. My teaching style is different. Try out the first few lessons and if it's your style, then we'll be together for a many hours.\nNo prior experience of Python or coding is required. This is a beginner's course.\nOr perhaps you're not a beginner, but you've done a bit of coding in the past but didn't carry on. It wasn't you, it's likely you didn't find the resources that speak directly to you. I can't promise my style is what you're looking for, but you'll know after the first few lessons!\nIn this course you'll learn:\nHow to apply the key principles and mindset for communicating with a computer through programming\nHow to repeat blocks of code using `for` loops and `while` loops\nHow to store data using variables and using various data types\nHow to define your own functions to re-use code\nHow to use data structures including lists, dictionaries, and tuples\nHow to apply best practices when coding\nThis course will teach you all the fundamental tools, of course, but more importantly, it will teach you the right mindset for programming. This is just as important as learning all the programming techniques—if not more important.",

Python is what is referred to as a high level language. That means it is a language that is closer to humans than computer. It is also known as a general purpose programming language due to it's flexibility.\nPython has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world in recent years. It's used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alike.\nPython is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today.\nIn this course, you  learn the basics of  graphical user interface (GUI) programming. The primary GUI toolkit we will be using is Tk, Python’s default  GUI. We’ll access Tk from its Python interface called Tkinter (short for “Tk interface”).Tkinter is Python’s default GUI library Python, along with Tkinter, provides a fast and exciting way to build useful applications\n\n\nWe will create the following projects:\n\n\nApp to download youtube videos\nApp to convert mp4 videos to Mp3 Audio\nImage slider\nCurrency converter\nApp to play MP3\nDigital calculator\nLoan Calculator\nConvert text to speech\nDigital clock\nRandom Password Generator",

      "description": "In Python, it's easy to overlook types. You can simply write a = 10, and it works without needing to specify its type. However, beneath Python’s simple and intuitive syntax lies a surprisingly complex type system. In fact, as you'll discover in this course, Python integrates multiple type systems to manage data and behavior effectively.\nYou might ask—why study types at all? After all, you probably use them every day in Python without thinking much about it. And that’s true: it’s entirely possible to write functioning code without understanding the details of how the type system works. But, as with many aspects of software engineering, gaining a deeper understanding of the how and why allows you to make smarter, more intentional design decisions in your code and systems.\n\n\nTarget audience\n\nDevelopers who especially benefit from this course, are:\nBeginners and intermediates who want to know the mechanics and purpose of types and type systems in Python\nSoftware engineers who want to use the type system as an extra development tool by adding type hints to improve their code quality\nDevelopers who want to learn the proper terminology to make discussing code in your team and searching for information online more efficient\n\n\nChallenges\n\nPython is an easy language to learn. It hides many of the nuances about data types. But when developers get more experienced, they are more confronted with Python’s unique way to create, instantiate and work with data types. It is at this moment where it helps to take a deep dive into Types and Type Systems.\n\n\nWhat can you do after this course?\nFix bugs faster by understanding error messages better\nPrevent common type problems by knowing type system techniques\nMake classes more efficient by using Python’s unique language features\nCreate clean modular design by using Protocol classes and type hints\nDiscuss pro’s and con’s of proposed solutions by learning proper technical terms\nMake the transition from another language to Python more efficient\n\n\nTopics\nIntroduction to type systems: Type system categories and their basic building blocks: types.\nImplicit vs. explicit typing: Literals, variables and attributes.\nDynamic vs. static typing: Duck typing, Python protocols and the Python Datamodel, Compilers and interpreters.\nType Hints: Annotations, static type checkers, kind of types, special typing constructs.\nType flexibility: Safe, sound, complete. Promotion, conversion and comparison.\nNominal vs. structural typing: Using composite classes and protocols to design interfaces for modular systems.\n\n\nDuration\n\n3 hours video time.\nThe teacher\n\nThis course is taught by Loek van den Ouweland, a senior software engineer with 30 years of professional experience.

      "description": "Audio is what Apple is known for. The iPod and Apple’s dedication to audio is what ultimately led to the iPhone and the whole iOS ecosystem. In this course, you’ll learn how to work with and harness the power of audio in your iOS development.\nThe two fundamental skills that you will master in this course are playing and recording audio. We’ll start by playing an audio file. Whether you want background music in a game or need to play podcast files, you’ll learn how to work with the audio frameworks Apple has developed. Then we’ll move on to recording audio with built-in microphones in iOS devices.\nYou’ll end the course by taking your learning and practically applying it to create a Soundboard app that connects to a Core Data database. Through this, a user can record a sound, give it a name, and be able to play the sound with the touch of a button.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nNick Walter is an iOS developer who has been focused on mobile app design and creation for over 5 years. His involvement in the iOS community started off with a bang, and in 2013 he was one of the 25 students worldwide to be invited to Apple's \"Cocoa Camp.\" Within the community, he is also co-president of an Apple developer group called \"Cocoa Heads.”\nHe always wanted to transform brand new ideas into reality but growing up in a small town he had limited access to the required programming resources. This led to his early interest in online education. After experimenting with various companies, learning styles, and teaching processes, he adopted the best strategies and applied them while creating his courses.\nSince the announcement of the new Swift programming language by Apple, he devoted himself to the Apple documentation and any online resource that was available. Prior to teaching the internet's first course on Swift, he created five iOS apps from scratch that are currently live in the App Store and are being used by thousands of users worldwide.",

Building upon the concepts presented in GNU C/C++ 1000, students should be familiar with the complete keyword set as presently defined by the modern standard for C programmers.\n\n\nClassics Matter!\nWriting C/C++ for decades I believe students need to also know how to work with those huge legacy code bases? Never soon to be updated, if it isn't broken then we should understand why many will want us to work with those classic standards!\n\nRollings Review\nIf C and / or C++ are new to you, we start our with a review of the core concepts. I think you'll appreciate the review, as well as the additional extended topics that we're going to be presenting in this 2000 level - or intermediate C/C++ educational opportunity. If you are familiar with C and basic C++ then you will also feel confident jumping right into this intermediate, 2000 level, lesson set.\n\n\nNote also that we will be talking about a state machine and revisiting many concepts that were presented in the C/C++ 1000 series.\n\n\nAdditional Learning 'Ops\nThe reason why I like to present a concept more than once and in several different ways is as to make sure people understand the key concepts that are required for topical mastery. No practice, no glory?\n\n\nSo I hope you'll enjoy the review and if you didn't take C++ 1000 you might want to enroll in the beginning programming lessons as well.",

However, in this video, we strip away all the confusion and look at both producing and consuming XML. You will learn how to create XML files in a straightforward manner and also how to read and process XML. We look at several ways of doing this, both when the structure of the file is known and unknown. We then look at some methods for manipulating the structure of XML files. Delphi XE3 is used throughout, and we build our example code using the FireMonkey framework (the examples are simple enough to translate into the VCL). The video is over an hour and a half long, and anyone with a basic (or better) understanding of Delphi should be able to follow.\nWhether you're just starting out or brushing up, this hands-on guide is tailored for developers with a basic or better grasp of Delphi. By the end, you’ll be equipped to tackle real-world XML tasks with ease.\nWhile this was recorded with Delphi XE3, the code will work exactly the same in any more recent version of Delphi.",

      "description": "Course overview\nIn recent compilers implementation, it became popular to translate from one high-level language to another high-level language. Examples might be desugaring new version of JavaScript to an older version of JavaScript, or languages like TypeScript, etc. Such high-level compilers are known today as transpilers, and what is the topic of our course.\nIt proved to be very practical, since we can fully rely on an existing runtime such as a JavaScript engine, avoid dealing with lower-level constructs like memory, bytecode instructions, etc.\nIf you would like to explore the world of compilers and implement your own programming language, starting from the high-level compilation is a good hands-on practical approach, and which we apply in this class.\nOften related books on compilers go to theoretical aspects, stucking in parsing, regular grammars, etc – not explaining how actually to build a practical transpiler. I believe we should be able to build a transpiler for a full programming language, end-to-end, in 2-4 hours — with a content going straight to the point, showed in live coding sessions as pair-programming and described in a comprehensible way.\nIn the Building a Transpiler from scratch class we focus on compiling a high-level concurrent programming language with message-passing processes, down to JavaScript. That is, in addition to the deep dive on the transpiling, you will get a better understanding of how concurrent functional languages, such as Erlang, or even an operating system itself with its processes and threads, work today.\nImplementing a transpiler will also increase your engineering level, as it touches several aspects of data structures and algorithms.\nPrerequisites\nAn optional prerequisite for this class is the Building an Interpreter from scratch (aka Essentials of Interpretation) course, where we build an AST-interpreter for a full programming language. Unless you already have understanding of how programming languages work at this level, i.e. what eval, a closure, a scope chain, environments, and other constructs are — it is recommended to take the interpreters class as a prerequisite.\nWho this class is for?\nThis class is for any curious engineer, who would like to gain skills of building complex systems (and building a transpiler for a programming language is an advanced engineering task!), and obtain a transferable knowledge for building such systems.\nIf you are interested specifically in compilers, PL and Type theory, and want to build a transpiler for your programming language, this class is also for you.\nWhat is used for implementation?\nWe build the transpiler in JavaScript, compiling to JavaScript.\nJavaScript, being the most popular programming language, should be accessible for many engineers, and also our goal is to provide a simple and concise implementation, not focusing on specifics of a host language. So the code should be portable to any language of your taste and choice: TypeScript, Rust, OCaml, C++, Python, etc.\nNote: we want our students to actually follow, understand and implement every detail of the Transpiler themselves, instead of just copy-pasting from final solution. Even though the full source code for the transpiler is presented in the video lectures, the code repository for the project contains /* Implement here */ assignments, which students have to solve.\nWhat’s specific in this class?\nThe main features of these lectures are:\nConcise and straight to the point. Each lecture is self-sufficient, concise, and describes information directly related to the topic, not distracting on unrelated materials or talks.\nAnimated presentation combined with live-editing notes. This makes understanding of the topics easier, and shows how the object structures are connected. Static slides simply don’t work for a complex content.\nLive coding session end-to-end with assignments. The full source code, starting from scratch, and up to the very end is presented in the video lectures\nWhat is in the course?\nThe course is divided into four parts, in total of 18 lectures, and many sub-topics in each lecture. Below is the table of contents and curriculum.\nPart 1: Transpiler pipeline\nIn this part we start talking about transpiler pipeline, parsing, code generation, and exploring AST nodes.\nPart 2: Functions and Processes\nIn this part we focus implementing our runtime components, such as Process and Scheduler classes, and discuss cooperative multitasking.\nPart 3: Pattern matching\nIn this part we implement packed data structures, such as Lists and Records, and also build support for pattern matching.\nPart 4: Message passing\nIn the final part we implement the message passing mechanism, do a case study analysis, using the compiled code from Web, and build the final executable.",

      "description": "Kubernetes is one of the largest open source projects in the world, according to data from GitHub. It’s so big that the tools to manage the development and deployment of Kubernetes are constantly catching up to the momentum behind the open source technology.\nThis continual evolution makes Kubernetes deployment a bit of an unsteady, fast-moving target. Still, the Kubernetes movement is the center of attention for organizations at the leading edge of technology innovation and adoption. Container technologies remain of great importance, but now the deepest issues are about scaling containers in orchestration environments. Containers are considered in context with Kubernetes. There is no other standard to speak of that can support the market scale that will be needed for containers to be used in production. The only standard is Kubernetes. Others are supporters of the technology, but only Kubernetes has enough wind behind it to steer the cloud-native technology market.\nFrom this context, I present my course about Kubernetes. The market is now beyond the wonder of containers. It’s beyond the early fascination with distributed architectures that may be used across multiple cloud platforms. Even the Kubernetes technology itself is getting boring, despite the fast pace of change. That’s a welcome sign for an early market primed for its next big test. The big question is now about the technology’s maturity: How well does Kubernetes work in production? We still don’t know. It’s a question that cannot be resolved quickly. And until it’s resolved, we won’t know how much of an impact Kubernetes will truly have.\nContainerization is the most important and useful technique in todays world.People along with business and organisations are looking for an easy way to manage their apps.No one needs to do so much work when managing business applications.There is a great need for organizations to scale up to growing number of applications.The best way is to automate this. Kubernetes is the best answer for the same.This container is very flexible , highly reliable and can be automated in the most efficient way.This course would Completely guide you on how to use Kubernetes and get the best out !This course will help you to gain understanding how to deploy, use, and maintain your applications on Kubernetes. If you are into DevOps, this is a technology you need to master. Kubernetes has gained a lot of popularity lately and it is a well sought skill by companies.This Course focusses only on LAB and Commands with no theory at all.\nLooking forward for your participation !",

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.\nPython has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that’s built into the Python standard library. Tkinter has several strengths. It’s cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Visual elements are rendered using native operating system elements, so applications built with Tkinter look like they belong on the platform where they’re run.\nFor python application to interact with a Microsoft Access database it requires a database connector adaptor called pypyodbc\nBefore you can run SQL statements to create, update, delete, or retrieve data, you must connect to a database. You can use the pypyodbc to connect to a database .\nIn this course we will a build a CRUD application from scratch using Python and Microsoft Access database.",

Python is a fantastic programming language for beginners, but it is also widely used in engineering and data science for practical applications.The Python programming language is incredibly powerful, and we are seeing more and more of its uses across a wide range of industries.  . builtin functions, file operations, and exception are just a few of the topics it covers. You will be able to write Python programmes for a range of applications once you complete this course..Python by default treats every input as a string input. We must explicitly transform the input in order to convert it to any other data type.A file is a crucial piece of data that is kept on a computer. Each file's filename and file extension can be used to identify it. we will introduce methods for reading data from and writing data to a file. One of its marvels is file management and handling, which would help us save a lot of time.An occurrence that takes place during the execution of a programme and obstructs the regular flow of its instructions is an exception.Any programmer should be able to identify the source of potential errors and implement code to handle those errors. This unit introduces the syntax necessary for achieving this goal.",

      "description": "4.5 Full HD Content | 12 Sections | 48 Lectures | Quizzes and Assignments | 60 Lessons to be released on weekly basis\nDespite never having programmed before, you may have been told that C was a good place to start. Perhaps you have a little bit of experience with other programming languages but would like to learn C. It's indeed a good language to add to your resume!\nIf you've never learned C, then this is the time, it can lead you onto a better career path. If you want to learn the C programming language, then this course is perfect for you. This course will teach you all the basics of the C programming language in a very easy-to-understand way.\nIntroduction to the language and its benefits What is C? The C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie, who worked with Ken Thompson to develop the Unix operating system. C is one of the most popular programming languages to date, and there are many resources available to learn it. This article will give you a short introduction to mastering this popular programming language.\nWhy Learn C Programming?\nC is a Middle-Level Language: The middle-level languages are somewhere between the Low-level machine-understandable assembly languages and High-Level user-friendly languages. Being a middle-level language, C reduces the gap between the low-level and high-level languages. It can be used for writing operating systems as well as doing application-level programming.\nHelps to Understand the Fundamentals of Computer Theories: Most of the theories related to computers like Computer Networks, Compiler Designing, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems are based on the C programming language and require a good knowledge of C programming if you are working on them.\nFewer Libraries: C programming language has fewer libraries in comparison with other high-level languages. So, learning C programming also clears programming concepts to a great extent as you have to write a lot of things from scratch.\nC is Very Fast in Terms of Execution Time: Programs written and compiled in C execute much faster than compared to any other programming language. C programming language is very fast in terms of execution as it does not have any additional processing overheads such as garbage collection or preventing memory leaks etc.\nEmbedded Programming: C is extensively used in Embedded Programming. Embedded Programming is also referred to as micro-controller programming, where the C program is used to control micro-controllers. Microcontrollers and embedded programming is widely used in automotives, Robotics, Hardware, etc.\nTraining Can Enhance Your Understanding of Other Languages: Including C++, Java, and C#, by teaching you how your source code is interpreted by computers.\nThis Course Includes:\nQuizzes\nAssignments\nHomework\nSource Codes\nInteractive learning methods\nFinal Project\nNew lessons will be added weekly\nLive Q&A Sessions to answer students questions\nThis course is not only designed to teach you to code in C, but the included material will also teach you how to analyze solutions and solve certain problems. You will learn to do more than just counting numbers when you get to the end of the course.\nAshraf has been an online Instructor for over 12 years, teaching college students through online classes at over 5 universities. He co-created a variety of lesson plans that cover a wide range of topics, such as embedded application development, C programming, system design, and C programming.\nAlmost every lecture and section of the course is delivered with one goal in mind, which is to give you a quick look and get you started quickly in Programming using C language + Additional Comprehensive C Material to Help You Practice Basic C Concepts Easily with Real-Life Examples.\nWhy you should take this course?\nYou will learn to use C languages for programming Microcontrollers\nYou will learn the difference between these two languages\nYou will learn how to program a microcontroller from scratch\nYou will gain a strong understanding of how a Microcontroller works\nYou will become a master in embedded system technology\nThis course will provide you with a strong understanding of how Microcontrollers work. You will also gain an insight into what programming is about.\nWelcome to this course. The course does not waste your time.

Then you need to go to page by page,\ntry to understand syntax and semantic info of the language. This way of learning is very fragmented and inefficient. Have you feel frustrated  when you read to the 101th page and find out you nearly forgotten any everything in the previous 100 pages!\n\n\nMay be by your pains taking effort, you read all 1000 pages, then very likely that you are in a quantum  state that you are feeling that you seems to familiar and unfamiliar of the topic. You may have a powerful tool but you have no confident about it\nbecause you never use that tool to build anything, and you are uncertain you can use the tool to build any meaningful thing or not.\n\n\nIn this course we will give up the traditional and inefficient way of learning. We will have one stone with two birds. You will from a rookie of Rust programming and blockchain to become and expert of both. We will learn the Rust programming by building a blockchain from scratch. Learning by doing is the most powerful way.\n\n\nThrough out this course you will gain expert level skills on two domain, for Rust programming, you will have:\nBasic rust programming syntax and Common Rust Collectors\nEnums, Traits, Structures, Generics, Lifetimes and Closures\nRust Module System, the use of External Crates and Publishing Crates\nSmart Pointers and Commonly used Data Structures including linklists, trees, BST and doubly linklist\nAdvance Techniques including macros, Concurrency and Aysnc Programming\nReal Life Problem where we will learn 13 Real Life Applications in rust from Scratch\nEfficient programming skills including Design Patterns, Efficient handling of Options, Strings and Structures\nTextual Processing and Directory Handling\nand for blockchain building, you will have:\na hands-on approach to learning about Blockchain concepts, intuition, and implementation. In this course, we'll be utilizing Blockchain technology and Go to develop a money transfer system.\nEasy to understand: Confused by Blockchain? With much of Blockchain technology explained in complicated technical documents, many people may think of Blockchain as something that's confusing. But Blockchain and the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency, has the potential to revolutionize the platform for future network distribution systems.\nBy taking this course, you will become a fluent in RUST programming and you'll be so good so that you can confidently and professionly code in the language. And  Blockchain is the future and by understanding the concept and actually creating it from scratch, you'll be able to apply Blockchain in the real world.",

Most students who learn NumPy for the first time say that it feels different from the core Python they learnt. And they're right.\nNumPy requires a different mindset. There's a reason why NumPy does things differently and if you understand why things are the way they are in NumPy, the rest of your NumPy journey will be easier.\nThis course doesn't try to cover everything in the NumPy package. That's impossible and not desirable. Instead, I designed this course to be concise and to focus on what really matters:\nUnderstanding the core topics in NumPy\nUnderstanding the NumPy mindset\nThis course covers the following topics:\nNumPy's main data structure, the ndarray\nVectorisation in NumPy\nArrays in higher dimensions\nThe basics of broadcasting\nFiltering NumPy arrays using Boolean operations and Boolean indexing\nReading external data using NumPy\nRepresenting equations with NumPy\nAnd of course, throughout the whole course you'll get familiar with the NumPy mindset.\n---\nAbout me, your instructor\nI've been teaching Python and NumPy for a decade. Before that, I worked as a physicist and used numerical and scientific programming in my research work for over a decade.\nMy focus is on communicating clearly, in a friendly and relaxed manner. I'm the author of the The Python Coding Book (you can ask Google for a \"python book\" and you'll find this book as one of the first entries) and I have taught Python to individuals and corporations around the world.\nAnd I'm approachable. You can ask me questions and I'll always reply, whether here on social media or anywhere else you can find me!",

She didn't even complete the course!\n\n\"Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course. I decided to switch career paths and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated. Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing. With gratitude, Laura\"\n\nThe course is a whopping 100 hours long. Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it. Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?\nFirstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.\nSecondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java.\nThe core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total). The Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through.\n\nFor example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces. JavaFX (which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on. So you could skip that section entirely. But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you. And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.\nIf you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.\nWhat version of Java should you learn?\n\nGenerally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but that's not the case with Java.\nOracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java. Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support. Other versions have long-term support, for many years.\nYou can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time.\nA company using Java technology (big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support. They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates.\nRight now, in December 2022, the version of Java that offers this long-term support (LTS) is Java 17 - It's being fully supported until at least 2029 and likely will be extended from there.\nAs such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that's Java 17.\nThe course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle.\nBOTTOM LINE: You will learn the RIGHT VERSION of JAVA in this course! Right meaning the right version to maximize your future Java potential with clients or Employers.\n\nWill this course give me core java skills?\nYes, it will. Core Java is the fundamental part of the Java JDK (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.\nWhat makes this course a bestseller?\nLike you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff, as well as thick, college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep.\nLike you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics, and confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.\n\nThis course assumes no previous coding experience and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program. You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one-stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.\nHere’s just some of what you’ll learn\n(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)\nAll the essential Java keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating\nYou will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class, What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps.\nHow to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups\nComplete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales)\nHow to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier. IntelliJ has both a FREE and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.\n(Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse, NetBeans, or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course)\nLearn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development, the Spring framework, Java EE (Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies, you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks. That's what this course will help you to achieve.",

      "description": "This course is designed for beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript functions, objects, and classes. Participants will gain a solid understanding of these essential concepts and how to use them to build dynamic and interactive web applications.\nObjects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects like a cup or car..\nIn JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.\nA JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:\n\n\nFunctions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.\n\n\nClasses are in fact \"special functions\", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, the class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.\n\n\nAn important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not. You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise code like the following will throw a ReferenceError.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn how to create objects ,functions and classes.",

The benefits of using functions as the building blocks of a language are manifold, and when it comes to JavaScript, the advantages are only exponential.\nThis Video Learning Path delivers the building blocks of the functional paradigm in a way that makes sense to JavaScript developers. We’ll look at animated visualizations that’ll help explain difficult concepts such as higher-order functions, lenses and persistent data, partial application, currying, ES6, asynchronous code with promises, and ES2017 async/await.\nWhile we anchor these techniques into your mind with the practical usage, you will also learn about techniques to write maintainable software, test-driven development, top-down design, and bottom-up design. Finally, we will use Mocha and Chai to write unit tests for the functional part of the applications.\nBy the end of this Video Learning Path, you will get a hands-on functional application development experience.\nFor this course, we have combined the best works of this esteemed authors:\nMichael Rosata has been a professional JavaScript Developer for 4 years now. He started building web pages. He has worked on a couple of large web apps using JavaScript as well as Apache Cordova. He loves the JavaScript ecosystem and the web community and adopted functional programming as his passion.\nZsolt Nagy is a web development team lead, mentor, and software engineer living in Berlin, Germany. As a software engineer, he continuously challenges himself to stick to the highest possible standards when improving his own knowledge. The best way of learning is to create a meaningful product on the way.",

      "description": "In this foundational course, we embark on a journey to create sophisticated data-aware applications in Delphi. To achieve this goal, it's essential to grasp the fundamentals of datasets and how they power modern applications.\nAt the heart of every data-aware application lies a dataset, and among these, TClientDataSet stands out as one of the most widely used and versatile components. Its ubiquity in various data-driven projects makes understanding its inner workings crucial for any Delphi developer aiming to build robust and efficient applications.\nIn Part 1, we delve into the properties and methods that make TClientDataSet such a powerful tool. Through hands-on examples using the VCL (Visual Component Library), you'll learn how to leverage its capabilities to:\nLoad and save data efficiently\nUtilize its flexibility in handling various data formats\nThese exercises are designed to be accessible with even older versions of Delphi, ensuring that everyone can follow along and build a strong foundation in data-aware development.\nBy the end of this part, you'll have a solid grasp of TClientDataSet's capabilities and be well-equipped to tackle more complex projects involving datasets. This foundational knowledge will serve as a springboard for further exploration into advanced data management techniques, making it an ideal starting point for your journey into Delphi's world of data-aware application development.\n\n\nAbout TClientDataSet\nThe TClientDataSet is a powerful and flexible data access component in Borland's (now Embarcadero's) Delphi development environment. It was introduced as part of Delphi 2, released in late 1995. The TClientDataSet allows your application to store and manipulate data locally on the client machine without needing to connect to a database server.\nHere are some key features and uses of the TClientDataSet:\nKey Features\nLocal Data Storage: It can store data locally, allowing your applications to work offline or with limited network connectivity.\nData Editing: It supports editing data in place within the dataset, making it suitable for applications where users need to update their own records directly.\nData Encryption and Password Protection: It supports encryption and password protection for added security when storing sensitive data locally.\nMulti-Tenant Support: Allows for multiple datasets (or \"tables\") to be stored in one file, which can be useful for applications that handle different users' data separately.\nSQL-Driven Operations: Supports SQL queries for fetching and manipulating data.\nUses\nOffline Capable Applications: Useful for creating desktop applications that don't require a constant internet connection but still want the ability to access, edit, or view local data.\nDatabase Prototyping: Because of its ease of use and flexibility, TClientDataSet is often used in prototyping phases where developers can quickly create mock databases to test their application's logic.\nData Migration Tools: It has been used as part of migration tools from older database systems to newer ones by providing a way to store data temporarily on the client for manipulation before being uploaded.\nArchitecture\nThe TClientDataSet works with other Delphi components, like DBGrid, DBNavigator, and DBEdit, to provide a user interface for managing its data. It also interacts with SQL-based services for fetching or modifying data, though it doesn't directly require database connectivity in the traditional sense.\nIn summary, the TClientDataSet offers an efficient way to manage local data within Delphi applications without needing server-side databases, making it useful for offline-capable apps and prototyping phases.",

      "description": "Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990 Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language\n\n\nWhy to Learn Python?\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages\n\n\nPython is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\nPython is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP\nPython is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs\nPython is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects\nPython is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games\n\n\nCharacteristics of Python\nFollowing are important characteristics of Python Programming −\n\n\nIt supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP\nIt can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications\nIt provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking\nIt supports automatic garbage collection\nIt can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java\n\n\nPython is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:\nEasy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly\nEasy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes\nEasy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain\nA broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh\nInteractive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code\nPortable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms\nExtendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient\nDatabases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases\nGUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix\nScalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting",

      "description": "Java – the basics\nLet’s address the basics before we dive into the details of Java. If you’re looking to learn a programming language, this will help you to determine whether Java is the best one to start with.\nWhat is Java?\nSun Microsystems first published Java in 1995 as a programming language and computing platform. It has grown from humble origins to power much of today’s digital world by offering a secure platform on which many services and applications are built. New, innovative goods and digital services still use Java as a platform, showing its versatility and how future-proof it is.\nJava is fast, secure, and reliable. Developers use Java to construct applications in laptops, data centres, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, and other devices.\nWhy is Java so popular? The features of Java\nJava is the world’s third most popular programming language, after Python and C – according to the TIOBE index, which evaluates programming language popularity. We can attribute the language’s widespread use to several notable features of Java:\nVersatility. Java has long been the de-facto programming language for creating Web apps, Android apps, and software development tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans IDE.\nDevelopment tools. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is one of Java’s most intriguing features. The Java IDE is a collection of automation tools, editors, and debuggers.\nUser-friendliness. Java features an English-like grammar, making it ideal for novices. You can learn Java in two stages: core Java first, then advanced Java.\nGood documentation. Because Java is an open-source programming language, it is completely free. Java is well-documented, which is an important feature of the language. It includes a full guide that will explain any issues you may encounter when coding in Java.\nA robust API. Although Java only has about fifty keywords, its Application Programming Interface (API) is wide and comprehensive, with various methods that may be used directly in any code.\nA large community. The community support for Java is one of the drivers behind its popularity. It has the distinction of being the second-largest Stack Overflow community.\nJava vs JavaScript – what’s the difference?\nDespite both having ‘Java’ in their name, Java and JavaScript are two separate languages. While Java is an object-oriented programming language, JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language. Java is mainly used for server-side development, while JavaScript focuses more on client-side scripts.\nYou can read more about what JavaScript is used for in our full blog post. If you’re interested in learning how to use JavaScript, our course from the University of Michigan can help you get started.\nWhy learn Java?\nSo, now that we know why Java is so popular, why should you learn how to use it? Aside from the simplicity of usage and versatility, there are several reasons to learn Java:\nJava programmers earn big\nOver the next decade, software developer jobs are predicted to expand by 22%, with backend developers in particularly great demand due to their specialised skill set. Furthermore, the average base wage for backend developers in the United States is $80,000, which is 54 percent higher than the national median income.\nThese figures are encouraging for Java developers, who are among the best-paid programmers in the industry. Java developers now earn an average of $91,465 per year, which is comparable to that of other mainstream language developers.\nJava is easy to learn\nThe programming language was created with new developers in mind, providing a safe environment for them to experiment with the language and make mistakes. Java is a broad and high-level language that focuses on programming rather than complicated details.\nJava is a great starting point for other programming languages\nAfter learning Java, it’s relatively easy to learn other coding languages such as C, C#, C++, Python, and more. Java teaches novice coders how to think like a programmer, going through processes using logic and putting ideas to the test.\nJava is a widely used and popular programming language\nAlmost every operating system uses Java, from the web to mobile to desktop. The Java programming language, which is widely used with corporate applications and Android mobile operating systems, is regularly updated to stay up-to-date with industry developments and can support a wide range of languages throughout its platform.\nJava isn’t going anywhere\nThe digital world is constantly changing, and developers are looking for new languages and frameworks to give them an advantage. While being current is crucial, staying on trend can be costly and ineffective when industries shift. As a result, the importance of Java cannot be emphasised, especially as new languages and technologies emerge.\nJava is a flexible language\nJava is not only widely used in technology, but it is also easily scalable and, most importantly, highly portable, as it must be run on a cross-platform Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This JVM transmits platform-specific instructions to your computer, which means that once a developer produces code, they can port it to another system on almost any computing device.",

This course has been created to introduce students to Carbon in its current form. As the language continues to grow and develop, this course will be further expanded.\n\n\nSo why should students explore Carbon now?\nLearn about language design\nSee how we are tackling specific challenges\nLearn about compiler design\nLearn about tooling beyond compilers\nThe language will be familiar to anyone with some knowledge of C++\nThis is the cutting edge! Carbon is still an experimental language that's growing, so users have the chance to contribute to and feedback about it to Google!\n'Carbon ... is a promising alternative for C and C++ for systems programming, and for Rust for safety and performance'\nThis 3 hour course is a brilliant introduction to Carbon and, as the language develops, so will this course! A v1 version of the language is expected in 2024, and Codestars will be adding more updates and new content as and when the language expands further.\nAt the end of each section is a Section Project which draws together everything you've learnt in the section. The three section projects are a great way to practice what you've learnt, and test yourself with a challenge!\nThis course is for anyone new to Carbon, or programmers who are interested in tackling a new experimental language from the ground up.\nHappy coding!",

This can be that of another value located in computer memory, or in some cases, that of memory-mapped computer hardware. A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on that page.

I usually get the same set of questions from the people who are starting their careers as salesforce developers or from the people who are moving to Salesforce from strong Java background.\n\n\nLet me share a small secret here. Learning Apex trigger needs time and guidance.\n\n\nIt's not you. it is about Apex triggers. you heard it right.\n\n\nIf you ask me why? from experience and understanding, all I could say is. the starting point of Learning of trigger involves multiple points.\n\n\nyes, we need to learn and keep a track of multiple points at once to get started. Even though you are good with apex. If you are starting with apex triggers you tend to make mistakes.\n\n\nLet me share my story here. I had written the logic for one of my requirements. Insert scenario was working fine but not the update scenario.\n\n\nI had wasted half an hour debugging and validating the logic written but I didn't find any reasons why it wasn't working.\n\n\nYou will laugh when you hear the reason why it was not working but trust me it left no stone unturned to figure out the reason.\n\n\nfinally, I admitted the fact that I need some help. I went to a senior developer for assistance, after sharing the requirement and the issue that I was facing. The first question he asked me helped me figure out what was the issue and also pointed out my understanding of triggers.\n\n\nhe asked me, \"is the trigger listening to update event?\". that's it. His question was my answer. Just by adding the trigger event, my issue was resolved.\n\n\nI still remember his question. when I begin to write my trigger. :D\n\n\nwhen I think back and that incident. I was good with the logic part of the requirement. I failed in terms of technical understanding of triggers/working of triggers.\n\n\nIf I had scared you with the technical terms above. My apologies, I wanted to share my exact story.\n\n\nAs they say, \"Every master is once a beginner\". I wouldn't consider myself as a master, there is always room for improvement.\n\n\nI shared this story to let you know that with time and practice things would fall into place.\n\n\nYou will relish your moments when you could help/assist a person who is going through the same struggle.\n\n\nthis course is just that. over my years of experience, I found a way to learn the triggers the easy way. yes, you need to put in some effort but that would be very less compared to debugging my update scenario.\n_______________________\nHow does this course help me?\nsimple, just by presenting Apex trigger in a presentable way to impress you. :D\n\n\nTo grab the concept, I took the example of a security guard/watchman. After this course, you will realize all these years security guards was teaching these concepts. we just ignored them. Next time when you meet a security guard/watchman, please thank them.\n\n\nHow can you be sure that I can start writing triggers after this course?\nonce you understand the working of the triggers, you will be in the right space to put your logic into the salesforce org. even though if your trigger is not working, you will know where to look and fix it accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:  A little bit of practice is needed to retain the concepts for a longer time. :) . I can see that look on your face. Yes, I wanted to be realistic. without practice on Day 1, you feel that you mastered it. Week 1, you will feel low on confidence. Month 1, you will rarely remember that you took the time to learn Apex triggers.\nwhy give half a try. if you really want to learn to code.\n\n\nIf you are reading this line. My job is half done. we can talk about the summary of what would you learn in this course.\n\n\nwhat are Apex triggers?\nwhat are context variables?\nwhat kind of logic goes in before and after context triggers?\nBest practices in apex triggers.\ncommon errors in apex triggers.\nconfusion with apex triggers.\nif you are wondering, I know these concepts. Do I really need to take this course?\n\n\nI have a simple question for you. are you struggling with the working of the trigger or are you struggling with the implementation of the requirement.\nif it has to do with the working of triggers, feel free to check out this course.\nif it has to do with the implementation part, couple of points.\n1) are you clear with the requirement.\n2) is there any limitations from salesforce.",

The course will also delve into object-oriented design patterns, debugging techniques, and best practices in programming. By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and be ready to develop complex, object-oriented software applications.\nPython course covers inheritance, one of the most important foundational concepts in object-oriented programming. The course begins by exploring the basics of inheritance and then delves into the different types of inheritance, such as single and multiple inheritance. It also reviews methods for overriding and extending parent class functionality\nThe Python course delves into the concept of Composition, which involves the construction of complex objects by combining simple ones. Students learn how to achieve code reusability and maintainability through composition, by using classes that have objects of other classes as instance variables\nEncapsulation is a concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the bundling of data and methods within a single unit, hiding the implementation details from the user. This enables developers to create more secure and robust code by preventing direct access to the internal state of an object and limiting the scope of its functionality",

Designed for developers familiar with basic C++ syntax, the course bridges the gap between traditional manual memory allocation techniques and robust, exception-safe smart pointer usage that empowers modern C++ applications.\nYou will start with a foundational understanding of dynamic memory allocation, delving into functions like malloc, calloc, and realloc, and exposing common pitfalls, such as uninitialized memory bugs. Progress through modern C++ allocation using new, including its nuances, error handling, array management, and advanced placement techniques.\nExplore the evolution from deprecated pointers such as auto_ptr to the type-safe and resource-managing smart pointers introduced in C++11. The heart of the course focuses on unique_ptr: its basic and advanced usage, function signatures, pass-by-value and pass-by-const-reference patterns, and application as parameter and return types. Uncover how unique_ptr prevents dangling pointers, boosts exception safety, integrates with containers, and leverages helper functions like make_unique.\nDive even further as you examine advanced idioms such as the PIMPL (Pointer to IMPLementation) pattern and custom deleters, illustrating how to manage resources with precision in real-world scenarios. Finally, you'll get to apply these skills by building and optimizing an object pool, both with and without pooling strategies.",

(5/20/2024)\nTo be a real programmer, you must know loops. This course gives an introduction to the most common loops: for, while, do while and foreach. Loops allow us to perform an action repeatedly without having to write a great amount of code. Loops do have a reputation as being a stumbling block for many aspiring programmers. This course is designed to introduce to loops in the most understandable way the author has been able to come up with.  The concepts presented in this course carry over to other languages like Java, C++, C, Python and so on. Each lesson is an HD video with heavily commented code. I explain both the \"why\" and \"how\" of loops. The \"why\" part corresponds to understanding how to translate a given requirement into C# code. The \"how\" part walks you through the execution of a loop, step by step because respecting each step is required for total understanding. You can also access a PDF version of the code under lesson resources. It's best if you have already worked with C# to the extent of having made simple C# console programs. The code presented deals only with console programs, and not graphical windows. Thanks for reading, friends, and let's dive right in!",

      "description": "Build a recommendation engine using Django & a Machine Learning technique called Collaborative Filtering.\n\n\nUsers will rate movies and the system will automatically recommend new ones. These recommendations will be done in batches (ie not in real time) to unlock a more scalable system for training and helping thousands and thousands of users.\n\n\nFor this course, we'll use a real dataset called MovieLens; this dataset is downloaded in CSV and is used on all kinds of machine learning tutorials. What's special about this course is you'll load this dataset into a SQL database through a Django model. This alone might be worth watching the course as SQL databases are far more powerful than CSV files.\n\n\nTo do the batch inference we implement the incredibly powerful background worker process called Celery. If you haven't used Celery before, this will be an eye opening experience and when you couple it with Django you have a truly powerful worker process that can run tasks in the background, run tasks on a schedule, or a combination of both. Tasks in Celery are simply Python functions with a special decorator.\n\n\nFor rating movies, we'll be using HTMX. HTMX is a way to dynamically update content *without* reloading the page at all. I am sure you know the experience whenever you click \"like\" or \"subscribe\" , that's what HTMX gives us without the overhead of using 1 line of JavaScript. This course shows us a practical implementation of using HTMX not just for rating movies, but also sorting them, loading them, and doing much more.\n\n\nThe recommendation engine in Django is really a collection of 3 parts:\nWeb Process: Setup up Django to collect user's interest and provide recommendations once available.\nMachine Learning Pipeline: Extract data from Django, transform it, and train a Collaborative Filtering model.\nWorker Process: This is the glue. We'll use Celery to schedule/run the trained model predictions and update data for Django-related user recommendations.\n\n\nRecommended Experience\nPython 3.6+ (such as 30 Days of Python)\nDjango 3.2+ (such as Your First Django Web Project or Try Django 3.2)\nCelery with Django (such as Time & Tasks 2 or this blog post)",

      "description": "This video training was designed for JavaScript programmers who want to learn how to use the Vue.js 2 framework. Unlike other JavaScript frameworks, Vue.js can be adopted as and when required. It can also coexist with existing JavaScript logic without interfering with it.\nYou will use Vue.js to:\nCreate responsive user interfaces from scratch\nAdd features to an existing Web project\nCreate SPA web applications\nCreate applications for mobiles (both Android and iOS)\nToday Vue.js is a very popular framework. Certainly because it is easy to set up, offers very good performance and can be used more or less extensively, depending on what is needed.\nWhen I started creating this video training course, I had two choices:\nCreate a common thread and gradually integrate the different concepts learned throughout the training.\nCreate independent examples to easily and quickly learn the different concepts of Vue.js.\nI am a face-to-face trainer and I was able to experiment these two approaches. Although the first has its fervent followers, the second gives better results in terms of learning, because each example can be chosen in an extremely precise way, without having to follow a logic of global integration which could neglect certain aspects of what needs to be learned. It is therefore this second approach that was adopted.\nEach topic is approached independently and illustrates a particular aspect of Vue.js: computed properties, data binding, directives, event management, conditional classes, props, custom events, lifecycle hooks, etc. etc ..\nMany exercises are available to you. When you are asked to stop scrolling the video, play the game: stop the video and code as you like, starting with a standard skeleton or a blank page. You will see that by doing so, your learning curve will be very fast. When you have finished coding, you can resume scrolling the video: a correction will be offered.\nThis training is very comprehensive. Here are some of the topics covered:\nStandard view and ViewModel programming: methods, computed, data binding, bidirectional binding, directives (v-model, v-bind, v-html, v-for, v-cloak, v-once, v-if and many others).\nLocal and global components, communication between components and the ViewModel, prioritization of an application using components, slots, filters, watchers, transitions and animations.\nSPA applications (routing, navigation guards).\nVue-Cli command line interface (application creation, render methods, JSX, functional components).\nVuex state manager, Vue.observable, plugins.\nMixins, personalized directives, NuxtJS, mobile applications.\nAll the source codes of the training are available.\nI can only advise you one thing: experience the code for yourself, code and progress at your own pace. Little by little, Vue.js will seem more and more familiar to you and you will appreciate its power and flexibility.\nSo ... Happy coding!",

Running the code in the command-line will make it harder for the users to adopt your applications, so what if you want your application to have a fancy user interface this requires that your applications have a GUI.\nIn simple terms, GUI is a desktop app that provides you with an interface that helps you to interact with the script and enriches the user experience.\n\n\nMy name is Yasser Abbass. I'm a software engineer and I will be your instructor for this course\nI have been in programming for the past 30 years and specifically in python for the past decade.\n\n\nThis course assumes that you have previous Python knowledge for instance (data types, conditional logic, loops, collections, etc)  and it will teach you how to create a professional python GUI by creating a contact management application\n\n\nThe course is divided into multiple sections that will teach everything you need to create python desktop applications\nThis course will take you on a journey to learn how to create desktop applications, including design of the interface, creating database models, and the necessary CRUD operations\nDuring this course, you will learn:\n- How to install MongoDB on your computer\n- How to install the PySimple GUI.\n- How to create and work with PySimpleGUI elements.\n- How to create and work with Windows.\n- How to create and work with Layouts.\n- How to create dynamic Layouts.\n- How to create MongoDB models\n- How to authenticate users\n- How to create fake data\n- How to download images from the internet\nand much much more\nFinally, if you are stuck you can drop a question in the Q&A and me, or one of my teaching assistants will answer you promptly",

That's why we regularly update our practice tests to reflect the latest trends, techniques, and best practices in C#. This ensures that you're always preparing with the most current and relevant interview questions, giving you an edge in today's competitive job market.\nSample Practice Test Questions:\nQuestion 1: What is the primary purpose of the 'using' statement in C#?\nA) To include namespaces\nB) To handle exceptions\nC) To manage resource disposal\nD) To declare variables\nAnswer: C) To manage resource disposal\nExplanation: The 'using' statement in C# is designed for automatic resource management. It ensures that resources (like file handles, database connections, etc.) are properly disposed of once they are no longer needed. This is crucial for preventing resource leaks and ensuring efficient resource utilization. When the 'using' block is exited, either after the execution of the block or due to an exception, the Dispose method of the object is automatically called, freeing up resources.\nQuestion 2: In C#, which keyword is used to define a method that can be overridden in a derived class?\nA) static\nB) sealed\nC) virtual\nD) abstract\nAnswer: C) virtual\nExplanation: The 'virtual' keyword in C# is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and indicates that the entity can be overridden in any derived class. This is a fundamental aspect of polymorphism in object-oriented programming. By marking a method as 'virtual', you allow a derived class to provide a specific implementation of that method while maintaining a contract with the base class.\nQuestion 3: What is the purpose of LINQ in C#?\nA) Error handling\nB) Memory management\nC) Data querying\nD) Code optimization\nAnswer: C) Data querying\nExplanation: LINQ, which stands for Language Integrated Query, is a powerful feature in C# that provides a consistent model for querying various data sources, such as in-memory collections, databases, XML documents, and more. LINQ allows you to write expressive, readable, and concise code for complex data manipulation and retrieval operations. It brings the ability to query data using C# directly without having to use separate query languages for different data sources.\nQuestion 4: Which design pattern is commonly used in C# to create a single instance of a class?\nA) Singleton\nB) Factory Method\nC) Prototype\nD) Builder\nAnswer: A) Singleton\nExplanation: The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is particularly useful in scenarios where having more than one instance of a class could lead to issues (e.g., configurations, database connections). The Singleton pattern is implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. If an instance already exists, it simply returns a reference to that object.\nQuestion 5: What is the significance of an Interface in C#?\nA) To provide default implementation of methods\nB) To enforce a contract for what a class can do\nC) To enable multiple inheritance of implementation\nD) To declare static methods only\nAnswer: B) To enforce a contract for what a class can do\nExplanation: An interface in C# specifies a contract or a set of guidelines that a class or a struct can implement. Interfaces define properties, methods, and events, which are the members of the interface. However, it does not provide any implementation for these members. It is up to the implementing class or struct to provide the implementation details. Interfaces are used to achieve polymorphism and abstraction in C#, allowing different classes to implement the same interface in diverse ways while ensuring a certain level of consistency and predictability in their behavior.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a solid grasp of C# and be well-prepared to tackle interview questions with confidence. Enroll now and take the first step towards becoming a C# expert and acing your next job interview!",

      "description": "Python GUI (Graphical User Interface) development is the process of creating desktop or web-based applications with a graphical user interface using the Python programming language. GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through visual elements such as buttons, menus, textboxes, and other graphical widgets.\nPython is a popular programming language for GUI development because it offers a wide range of tools and libraries for creating graphical user interfaces. These tools and libraries simplify the process of building complex user interfaces, allowing developers to focus on the core functionality of their application. Some of the popular libraries for Python GUI development include Tkinter, PyQt, PySide, wxPython, Kivy, and PyGTK.\nPython GUI development can be used to create a wide range of applications, from simple utilities and tools to complex desktop applications and web-based applications. Some examples of Python GUI applications include image editors, video players, text editors, web browsers, and scientific tools. Python's versatility and ease of use make it a popular choice for developers who want to create user-friendly and interactive applications.\nTkinter is a standard Python module for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a set of tools and widgets that allow developers to create desktop applications with graphical user interfaces in a straightforward manner. Tkinter is based on the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit, which was developed for the Tcl programming language, but it has been ported to Python.\nTkinter provides a wide range of GUI elements, such as buttons, labels, textboxes, menus, and dialogs, which developers can use to build their applications. These elements are customizable, and developers can change their appearance and behavior using various properties and methods. Tkinter also offers a layout management system that allows developers to arrange the widgets on the screen in a way that is intuitive and visually appealing.\nOne of the main advantages of Tkinter is that it is included in the standard Python distribution, so it does not require any additional installation or setup. This makes it easy for developers to get started with GUI development in Python. Additionally, Tkinter provides cross-platform support, which means that GUI applications developed with Tkinter can run on different operating systems without any modifications.\nTkinter allows you to develop desktop applications using Python with very little code. You can use various widgets such as buttons, labels, entries, text boxes, scrollbars, comboboxes, radio buttons, etc. to create interactive GUIs with Tkinter You can also use different geometry managers such as pack, grid and place to arrange the widgets on a window or frame\n\n\nOverall, Tkinter is a powerful and flexible tool for building GUI applications in Python. It offers a wide range of features and functionality that can be used to create applications with sophisticated graphical interfaces.",

We presently have thousands of drone pilots, but eventually the ratio of manually piloted drones to autonomously coded drones will become lower and lower.  This course will introduce the concepts and methods in coding drones to complete real world tasks.  Students will complete missions that allow the small and versatile Tello drone to fly without manual control. We hope to embrace your desire to achieve greatness with the need for fun.  W will break this course into 6 Modules.  Each will build on the basics of  block coding and drone missions.  We will incorporate life beyond coding as we attempt to inspire the growth of the student.  Our students WILL contribute to a greater, more efficient technical world and embrace an appreciation for the beauty of our natural world.\nThe six modules include:\n1.  Introduction to Block Coding\n2.  Basic Navigations\n3.  The DroneBlocks App\n4. Flips and Loops\n5.  Missions Possible\n6.  Let's Explore Missions\nEach module will consist of a Prologue, 3 lessons and an Epilogue.\nThe Prologue will set up the module by diving into quotes and discussing what can be done to prepare for the upcoming lessons.\nThe lessons will consist of videos but will have Google Docs and PowerPoints to compliment the videos.\nFinally the Epilogue will ask students to go back to connecting to the world around him/her beyond coding.",

We make learning quick and easy by teaching you the essentials needed to start programming right away with no prior experience required. Throughout the course, you will be exposed to the fundamentals to become a beginner Python programmer. There are several mini-projects and challenges along the way to reinforce your understanding of each of the lessons. The course builds upon previous lessons to help you grow as a Python programmer each day. You will not feel lost at any time in this course. We have you covered by providing you with source files containing the code for each lesson. That means if you are following along and lose track of where you are in the code, you can download the source file for the video to continue. Having the source file also makes checking your work much easier. Here is a little of what you can expect to learn in this course:\n- Create variables of all data types and assign values\n- Generate lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries\n- How to perform math calculations and even create a calculator program\n- Compare values, variables, and conditions using operators\n- Take in user inputs and provide responses\n- Make decisions using if-else statements, while, and for loops\n- Handling errors by exceptions that would typically cause a program to crash or halt\n- Importing modules and packages that provide the programmer with additional code functionalities\n- Integrate files that are not Python within an application\n- Create Classes and Objects as an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming",

Rather than learning things you might not need to know, students can choose the topics that they are most interested in.\n\n\nIn Python 2100: Objects, Factories, & Frameworks we will discover that Object Orientation is more than Inheritance. Much like we see all around us in the modern world, the ability to use Factories to create and initialize our Objects properly is a very important technique to master.\n\n\nOnce created however, providing a well designed Object Framework also ensures that our Factories will be able to support our object creation needs now, as well as well after our Packages have been completed.\n\n\nAbout This Series\nWritten by a Principal Trainer & Principal Software Development Engineer, in order to insure mastery key topics are presented several times, as well as at ever-increasing depth. Students will also be using professional programming interfaces - the same tools that software developers use - to create their software.\n\n\nFrom keywords & tabs, to testing & documentation, hints & tips on how to use Python in the professional world abound!\n\n\nAfter completing the Python 1000 series, in the Python 2000 series students will complete keyword mastery by exploring a large collection of activity-related topics.

      "description": "Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as Java, Python, and C++ and C#.\n\n\nC++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.   C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.\nC++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.  C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.  C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.\nC# (pronounced \"See Sharp\") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java,  and JavaScript programmers\nJava is a programming language, designed to be concurrent, class-based and object-oriented, as well as a computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. An enormous amount of applications and websites will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.\nPython is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.",

We will be using a few faces, to compare and to recognize. Do they belong to the same person?\n\n\nSection 2:\nWe will be using Streamlit. Streamlit is a new tool, an opensource tool, mainly used to display and interact with our machine learning models.\nYou will learn the basics of Streamlit. There is so much to learn from Streamlit. Instead of bogging you down with all the stuff, we will learn, just enough, to create our apps!\n\n\nSection 3:\nWith the knowledge we have learnt in the previous two sections, we will combine it and create our very own Face Recognition App.\n\n\nIn line with our Weekend Project series, the course is designed to allow you to learn the basics and the specific skills in a short span of time.

This is an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build an online banking app from scratch. Although an online banking app or payment gateway might sound complex and impossible to be built by beginners, however, this course will offer you unique and valuable experience of building the basic version of an online banking app. Indeed, it’s only going to be the basic one as this course was designed and intended for beginners, nevertheless, you will definitely get to create features in banking apps and understand the logic behind those functionalities. Most importantly, you will know what the backend of a banking app actually looks like.\n\n\nAs the nature of this project based course is aimed toward beginners, hence, this course will include a basic Python warm up session where you will be taught basic fundamentals of Python which you need to master before getting to the project. Those are including but not limited to data/variable types, mathematical operations, conditional statements (if/else), for loop, while loop, getting data input from the user, creating function as well as its parameter. Therefore, if you are not confident with your Python skills, this course will provide you with what you need.\n\n\nThe online banking app project which you will build in this course is going to have the following features:\nSign in/ Log in\nForgot pin\nDeposit\nWithdraw\nTransfer to another bank account\nCheck current balance\nCheck interest rate based on the current balance\nFuture Value of investment\n\n\nThe fantastic aspect of this course is the fact that you are not only learning Python programming, due to the complex nature of this project, you will also be exposed to some mathematics and economics to some extent. In Particular, you will learn basic concepts of continuous compound interest since the function for calculating future investment valuation would be built based on that formula. Last but not least, the most efficient way to be an expert is to learn by doing and that is exactly what you will do in this course.",

      "description": "This course is designed for people who have not had contact with the Python language and want to join the programming world. The course structure helps you to understand everything you need to know to get started. We will discuss both the theory and practice (code that we will create ourselves). There will be also many tips and hints to help you understand the discussed concepts. The course starts with an introduction to the Python language (the differences between versions 2 and 3, how to use Python from the console and Jupyter Notebook or conventions and naming). On the first programming classes, you'll learn the scalars and sequential types of Python objects, along with their methods, arithmetic, indexing rules, and the operations you can perform on them. We will close the topic on object types with dictionaries and sets. Next large block of material will be the flow control, that is logical instructions, where you will learn the rules for creating and operating on conditions, loops, comprehension expressions or matrices (creating loops in other loops). The next will be the topic of functions. You will learn to write your own code blocks that execute series of instructions, how to get from and return values to the user, what is polymorphism, recursion or decorators. The whole block will end with object-oriented programming, its principles and method of working with classes, their fields and methods. In the last section of the course you will find the topics that can help you with your own further projects, that is: how to handle text and CSV files, how to combine Python code with a database written in MySQL, or how to create and use a regular expression. At the beginning we will keep the code simple, but with time as your knowledge will increase, the code will grow. For each material, you will also find a text notes that will summarize the discussed knowledge. In addition, in each section you will find the exercises (on different difficulty levels) that will allow you to test your new skills and knowledge. If you want to learn programming in Python check the curriculum of the course and preview materials. And see you soon inside the course!",

Once we have worked (or studied), slept, spent some time with friends and family there is little time left to think about a career.\nIn order to become a software developer you need programming skills.  But how can you get those skills in the minimum amount of time and still have a life along the way?\nThis course was designed to teach you the essential Kotlin programming skills you need to get your first programming job, or perhaps a promotion to a more senior position.  And to do it in the shortest possible amount of time.\n\nDo I need to learn 100% of the Kotlin language?\nNo!  To understand how this course can help you, there is a need to understand how programming languages are constructed.  The creators of these languages try and add every single feature they think someone might need, ever.\n\nA large part of the language rarely gets used, and sometimes not at all.  It's the same with software.  If you have used a spreadsheet in the past, I'd lay odds that you use it for basic spreadsheet work, and you rarely, if ever go into some of the advanced functionality.  The basic functions of the spreadsheet are what most people use.\nImagine if you had to learn every feature of the spreadsheet program?  How long would it take, and would most of that information be useful to you?  Especially if you were learning it to get a job and that job only required basic spreadsheet skills.\nSwitching back to programming, if your goal is to get your first programming job, then why not only learn what you need to achieve that goal.  And worry about the other stuff if and when you need it.\nThat's what this course is all about - giving you the skills you need quickly without any fluff or useless information.\n\nThe course is aimed at complete beginners.\nWe assume you have never programmed before in this course and start from scratch and show you step by step how to download and install the tools, through to writing your first programs, and from there we move to more and more of parts of the Kotlin language that you need to understand.\nIf you are already a programmer, you will still find value in this course - It's very common for programmers to want to learn a second or third programming language, and doing so makes you more valuable and opens up career opportunities.\nAs this is a crash course you can get skilled in Kotlin, fast.\nHere is what a student said about another of the instructors courses.\n\"Above expectations because bunch of other people don't do as good on this topic. Goran, Congratz, you've always done a clear and excellent job. You aren't lazy. I always take few courses on same topic so i can compare content and quality of explaining, really, thank you.\" - cris S.\n\nWhat version of Kotlin will I learn?\nAll videos in the course have been recorded using the very latest version of Kotlin.  It's recommended that you follow along with that version, but if you have an older version most of the course should work just fine.\nKeep in mind there are constant updates to Kotlin.  So if you see a newer version when you are installing it, then use that version.\n\nWhat will you learn in the course?\nYou'll learn the essential Kotlin skills needed to become employable as a Kotlin developer.\nCreating a Kotlin basic program\nAll about the setting up and running Kotlin programs\nData Types, Variables, Conditional Processing, Loops, Classes, Operators, Expressions - all the good stuff.\nCheck out the curriculum on this page for a list of what is covered in the course.\nIn the course you will work with a lot of Kotlin example code.  You will start with Kotlin code that was badly written.  You'll see why it's bad, and then as you progress through the course, you will improve it and make the code bug free.\n\nThis approach, along with smaller snippers of code will help you become a programmer as well as think as a programmer.  And as a result you will learn how to get the most out of Kotlin.\n\nWhat about the instructors?\nYour instructor Goran has been a software developer for over 14 years (12 commercially), creating Desktop, Web, and Mobile applications during this time.\nHe is a fully certified Java Developer (Java Oracle Certificate Associate programmer Java SE 8) and have a lot of experience with Java, Kotlin, JPA, Java Enterprise Edition, Spring, Spring Boot, Maven, Gradle, and JavaFX.\nIn addition, he has been heavily involved in game development and frameworks used to create games. He is also a Unity Certified Expert Programmer.\nHere is another comment from a student in one of Goran's Udemy courses.\n\"Amazing , above expectation. All lectures are supported with essential examples showing the secrets of Java.I think I understand everything that Goran explains.I would really like to ask him a question, but for now I just understand everything. Very clear and precise instructions on what and how it happens.Goran reveals tricky questions that the examiners like to ask in the exam. Still, we are all here to prepare so well that we pass the exam with a minimum of 80 %, why not 100 %. I believe in myself and my own strength.Great job on making it halfway!I am keep learning!I love Udemy.\" - Valentin G.\nWhat about if you have questions?\nAs if this course wasn’t complete enough, Goran offers  full support, answering any questions you have 7 days a week (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, or not at all).\nThis means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With his hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks.\nStudent Quote: \"This is one of the best Unity and C# courses I've done on Udemy, and I've done a lot.\nI initially didn't bother with the C# lectures since I've been programming with C# since 2003, but I decided to go back over the list of lectures after finishing the Game Development sections to see if there were areas of C# I wasn't 100% sure about, since it's continually changing.\nI found the C# lectures I watched were all excellent. Goran is very good at explaining the more complicated C# topics, and I learnt a lot from them and came away feeling like I'd learnt a lot from them.” - Keith L.\n\nThere’s no risk either!\nThis course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let the instructors know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.\nYou either end up with Kotlin skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it…\nYou literally can’t lose.\nReady to get started, developer?\nEnrol now using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to a career as a Kotlin Programmer.  You can also check out some of the course using the preview feature on this page, so you’re 100% certain this course is for you.\nSee you on the inside (hurry, the Kotlin class is waiting!)",

Python for beginners has the second largest number of job postings relative to all other languages. So it will earn you a lot of money and will bring a great change in your resume.\n\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\n\n\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in data science , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\n\n\n\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too.

In this course, you will learn from the basic of how to make classes and methods to be generic, to advanced techniques such as bounded type parameters, generics with inheritance, wildcards, rawtypes, and so on. And to help learners have a clear and comprehensive picture of generics, some behind-the-scene topics will be presented, including: autoboxing, unboxing, type erasure, and generic restrictions.\nThe course comes with 2 quizzes, one for each section with many questions designed to help you remember and have a more understanding of the new concepts in the lectures. Questions in the 2 quizzes cover all the topics who have come across in the course.\nAfter complete all lectures, solidify your collections and generics skills with mini exercises. The solutions for each exercise is also attached.\nFinally, challenge your programming skills with the big exercise.\nThe complete source code for the big exercise is also provided but I would highly recommend you should try to complete yourself first before taking a look at the provided solution.",

      "description": "Scala's functional programming features are a boon when it comes to designing easy-to-reason-about systems to curb growing software complexities. In this course, we will learn about many concepts and tools available in the Scala language by implementing, in a functional manner, some sorting and searching algorithms.\nMost algorithms are traditionally defined in an imperative manner, typically consisting of repetitions in the form of conditional looping and altering states. Writing these in a functional manner is not always a trivial process. In this course, we will do just that. We will also show how to implement search data structures in a functional and immutable manner. We will look at number sorting, substring searches, hash tables, red black binary trees, and the closest pair algorithm. Along the way, we will talk about bubble sort, merge sort, Knuth-Morris-Pratt string searching, structural sharing in functional data structures, and various problems with immutable data structures. Further, we will explore the classic closest pair algorithm and show how we can solve the problem efficiently in a functional manner.\nBy the end of the course, you will have gained a thorough knowledge of many functional Scala concepts and will understand these algorithms and data structures.\nAbout the Author\nJames Cutajar is a software developer with interests in scalable high-performance computing and distributed algorithms. He is also an open source contributor, author, blogger, and tech evangelist. When he is not writing software, he rides his motorbike, surfs, or flies light aircraft. He was born in Malta, lived for almost a decade in London, and is now working in Portugal.",

As you go through the sections you can run the application and see how it develops and builds on the previous sections.\nAt the end of the course you will be able to take the techniques covered in the course and apply these to your own development projects",

I also found that most tutorials, do not go through every element of a game, such as the start screen, all of the power ups, the score screens, etc.\nThey usually only take you as far as the basic building blocks, and then leave you to create the rest, should you wish to continue.\nMost of these tutorials, have left me with a directory filled with what would be deemed as unfinished games.\nHence I thought it would be great to put together a course on creating a game, with all of the game elements created and implemented in a step by step process, that leaves you at the end of the course, with a fully functional, and complete game.\nMy hope is that you are able to understand how each element of this game is created and implemented, so that you gain further insight when deciding to tackle a challenge of your own.\nI also find the old games from the 80's and 90's as fantastic coding challenges, in particular when it comes to trying to understand how something may have been implemented.",

Scrapy is useful for web scraping and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival. This Python Scrapy tutorial covers the fundamentals of Scrapy.\nWeb scraping is a technique for gathering data or information on web pages. You could revisit your favorite website every time it updates for new information, or you could write a web scraper to have it do it for you!\nWeb crawling is usually the very first step of data research. Whether you are looking to obtain data from a website, track changes on the internet, or use a website API, web crawlers are a great way to get the data you need.\nA web crawler, also known as a web spider, is an application able to scan the World Wide Web and extract information in an automatic manner. While they have many components, web crawlers fundamentally use a simple process: download the raw data, process and extract it, and, if desired, store the data in a file or database. There are many ways to do this, and many languages you can build your web crawler or spider in.\nBefore Scrapy, developers have relied upon various software packages for this job using Python such as urllib2 and BeautifulSoup which are widely used. Scrapy is a new Python package that aims at easy, fast, and automated web crawling, which recently gained much popularity.\nScrapy is now widely requested by many employers, for both freelancing and in-house jobs, and that was one important reason for creating this Python Scrapy course, and that was one important reason for creating this Python Scrapy tutorial to help you enhance your skills and earn more income.",

      "description": "Welcome to \"Mastering GUI Development: Build 10 Practical C++ Applications with OOP,\" a comprehensive journey into modern C++ programming and graphical user interface (GUI) design. This course is your definitive guide to transforming theoretical C++ knowledge into tangible, real-world applications. Moving beyond the command-line interface, you'll learn how to build interactive, visually appealing software that users will love. By focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, we’ll not only build functional applications but also learn how to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.\nIn today's software development landscape, C++ remains an indispensable language for high-performance computing, game development, and system-level applications. However, its power is often hidden behind complex syntax and a steep learning curve. This course is designed to flatten that curve by showing you how to harness C++'s capabilities to create practical, user-friendly software. You'll gain hands-on experience with some of the most popular and powerful GUI frameworks available, allowing you to choose the best tool for any future project.\n\n\nThe Core Philosophy: Learning by Doing\n\n\nOur philosophy is simple: the best way to learn is by building. This course is not a series of passive lectures. Instead, it's a project-based curriculum where each application serves as a new chapter in your development journey. We'll start with the foundational concepts of GUI programming and gradually move to more complex, feature-rich applications. Each project is carefully selected to teach you a new set of skills, from file handling and data management to event-driven programming and system-level interactions.\n\n\nThis course bridges the gap between C++ theory and practical software development by guiding you through the step-by-step creation of 10 fully-functional GUI applications. Along the way, you will learn how to properly structure your code using OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism — all while building useful tools like password managers, screen recorders, and more.\nWhether you're a beginner who's comfortable with the basics of C++, or an intermediate developer looking to level up your GUI and OOP skills, this course is for you.",

      "description": "Recent Updates: Added a new section on JPMS Services, which help in creating completely decoupled services\nThis course provides an in-depth understanding of the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) and how it enables the creation of modular, strongly encapsulated, and space-optimized software that is extensible. JPMS is a major feature of Java 9, introduced as part of Project Jigsaw to address challenges faced by earlier versions of Java.\nWhen building large, complex software, it is crucial that the code is easy to understand, maintain, secure, and extend. These are essential goals for any well-designed system. Prior to Java 9, achieving these goals relied heavily on design principles like Information Hiding, which utilized packages and access modifiers. However, in some cases, packages and access modifiers fell short, compromising these objectives. Java also faced significant issues with configuration (commonly referred to as JAR hell) and the tendency to ship as a monolithic library. JPMS resolves these limitations by introducing modules, a new layer of abstraction that ensures better encapsulation, more reliable configuration, and the ability to create space-optimized, extensible software.\nIn this course, we begin by exploring the problems JPMS was designed to solve, helping you understand its purpose clearly. Next, we’ll dive into the anatomy of a module and how to create them from both the command line and Eclipse. You’ll also learn how modular and non-modular code can interoperate. One of the most exciting features of JPMS is the ability to create custom runtime images (JREs) or smaller distributables, and in this course, you’ll learn exactly how to do that—an essential skill for every developer. Finally, we learn about JPMS Services. Considered the cornerstone of modular programming, JPMS Services enable our application to be extensible allowing us to add new services at runtime.\nEach concept is thoroughly explained with realistic examples, clear illustrations, and practical demonstrations to ensure you grasp the material fully.",

The answer is the technical design itself.\nok. no more suspense. validation rule would stop the user who acts on the record. it can stop the new records if the above conditions are met or if the user edits the old record which satisfies the conditions.\n\n\nFor the new records, users would be able to get the information from the end user when creating the case. what about the old case records? do we need to correct these records as well? if we don't if any user wants to change anything on the records they will get the validation. this would stop them from saving the changes on that records.\n\n\nso what should we do? in such cases we need to check with the business/clients on what should happen on the old case records. do we leave it to the user to figure it out?\nIf the answer is yes, we are good. if the answer is no. then we need to correct the old case records in the org.\n\n\nNow, if you are wondering there would be a large volume of case records in the org. How do we edit those records?\n\n\nI am glad that you asked for it. There are two options here.\n1) data loading.\n2) Batch class.\n\n\nLet's review option 1 first. To operate on large volumes of records, we are choosing the Data Loader as an option here. In order to proceed first we need to get the extract of the records that we need to proceed then prepare the csv file with the correction on the necessary fields. followed by updating this file again to the Data Loader for the update operation on the case object.\n\n\nLooks cool right?\nyes, it is. we can do this approach. if we have one sandbox and prod org. what if there are 5 sandboxes and prod as part of your application/deployment lifecycle?\n\n\nIt would lead to 3 problems.\n1) Resource bandwidth.\n2) delayed timelines for project delivery.\n3) manual effort and may cause manual errors.\n\n\nif you are thinking is there any alternative? yes, there is one.\n\n\nwhat is it?\nBatch class.\n\n\nwhat are the advantages of it?\nyou write the code once. it can be used in others org as well. all it takes is to just deploy the code to the orgs you need it and run it using two lines of code.  FYI... we can put that into one line as well. :D\n\n\nif you are looking for where can i get started in learning the batch class?\nyou are at the right place. we had made this course covering from basics to the most advance sections in batch class concepts including all the best practices that you need to keep in mind while writing your batch class. In fact, who would want their code to fail in higher orgs and get rejected in the code review?\n\n\nif you are reading this line, I hope you had made a decision. I am eagerly waiting for you inside the course. Let's together jump on this roller-coaster ride. see you on the other side!!!",

It does not cover object-oriented programming.\nThe course utilizes a new approach to learn the basic concepts of programming utilizing the Java language by using the shell which is included since Java 9 within the Java installation package which is called JShell. So, the as minimum Java 9 is needed for practical examples within the course but any other higher version of the Java Developer Kit (JDK) which is downable for free is also suitable.\nThe shell enables you to run small programs while you type. Each and every line of the program which is typed in is immediately executed. This release you from the burden to learn the write-compile-run loop at the beginning and gives you a quick start. Of course for more complex development task like object oriented programming this is needed and also the learning of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) should be done. But these are more complex lectures which are excluded from the course by using the included shell JShell to give you a jump start.",

the Google file the Apps Script is attached to is known as the container. Bound scripts behave just like Standalone scripts but they have several special functions, they do not show up in drive and they cannot be detached from their container files. Script can be bound to Sheets, Docs, Slides, or Forms. To reopen the script in the future you can open the container file and select the script editor, or you can go directly to the dashboard. Apps Script home page, and select the project from there. For bound scripts it will show the container file icon, with a small Apps Script logo on it indicating that it is a bound script.\nApps Script Web app Data transfer from ClientSide to ServerSide WebApp Sheet data and more\nClientSide to ServerSide WebApp\nGoogle web apps can run client side code that can easily be used to connect to server side Apps Script functionality. To execute server-side functions from client-side code, use services RUN is an asynchronous client-side JavaScript API available in web app HTML-service pages that can call server-side Apps Script functions.\nIn this example we will demonstrate how to send data objects from the Apps Script server side into the client side and use the data object within JavaScript. Also how we can send data from the client side input field values to the server side script to then be used to update and append content into a selected spreadsheet.\nGoogle Apps Script Triggers Simple Triggers automation and more\nGoogle Apps Script Triggers for Automation\nTriggers allow you to run a function automatically within Apps Script. There are simple triggers that are built in and use custom functions in order to start and invoke the function. Within the event object of each event, the triggered function contains an event object that has information about the context in which the event occurred. Some commonly used simple triggers are onOpen() which runs when the spreadsheet, document, is opened. There is onEdit() that runs when the user changes a value in a spreadsheet. Also for web apps doGet() and doPost() are simple triggers that get invoked when the user visits the web application on either method.\nSimple triggers must be in a bound script in order to run the application triggers, they also fire automatically without asking for user permissions. They will not run if the file is opened in read only mode. They are also limited in some services that would require authorization. They cannot run for longer than 30 seconds. Simple triggers are subject to Apps Script trigger quota limits.\nInstallable triggers provide more flexibility for users, they let Apps Script run a function automatically and can also run services that require authorization. Just like the simple triggers the event object is included in each event, that contains information about the context of the event. Installable triggers always run under the account of the person who created them. Installable triggers are subject to Apps Script trigger quota limits.\nTaught by a Google Developer Expert for Workspace ready to help you learn and answer any questions you might have.\nIn 2019 Laurence Svekis was recognized by Google as a GDE (Google Developer Expert) for Google Workspace. Having a real passion for the amazing things that can be done with Google Apps Script it's been a real joy to create this project based course, so that others can learn and try Google Apps Script. The contents of this coruse contains many coding exercises to practice and learn more about how to apply Google Apps Script code. Please note that having prior JavaScript coding experience although not required is strongly suggested as Google Apps Script uses the JavaScript code syntax and it renders in the JavaScript engine.\nJOIN TODAY and START Coding....\nThe Document Service allows scripts to create, access, and modify Google Docs files. DocumentApp is the parent class for the Documents, which contains properties that can be used to update the styling of elements, methods to create and open the documents. Once you have created a Document you can select the Document as an object and use the Classes to interact with it.  You can create or select an existing document or with a bound script get the active document.  The body is an element representing a document body. First get the body so you can use the contents of the document and interact with it.\nHow to send an email auto response on form submission, setup custom logging into a sheet of data.   Go to Drive and select to create a new form. Within the form, setup questions to collect an email, and first and last name from the user. In the setting tab of the form you can customize the setting options. Select the response tab, and connect the form to a new spreadsheet by pressing the 3 dots icon. This will create a new spreadsheet where we will write the Apps Script code. In the new spreadsheet select under the extensions tab to open a new Apps Script which will be a bound script to the spreadsheet container.   To setup a trigger use the ScriptApp service and add a new trigger to run a function called added on the form submitted into the sheet.\nCreate Forms with Google Apps Script Code Forms Service Creating form.  How to create forms with Google Form Service  Forms service allows scripts to create, access, and modify Google Forms.  Forms can be created with code, you can set the parameters, questions and set the type of questions all within the form service using Google Apps Script.   Create a form from scratch, send the form link to an email address. Forms will automatically collect results of the responses directly within the main form file, this can be accessed from your drive once the form is created.\nHow to use Spreadsheet Service SpreadsheetApp with Google Apps Script. SpreadsheetApp Class and Sheets Service Code examples  The Spreadsheet service allows scripts to create, access, and modify Google Sheets files. You can use sheets to store and hold data for other Apps Script applications. Sheets can serve as a database for data as the content is presented in a table format with rows and columns of cells each containing data.  How to create new sheets checking to see if the sheet exists or not.  Using the spreadsheetApp class you can select all the sheets contained in a spreadsheet. Select and create a sheet if it does not exist. Sheet names must be unique, if you try to create a sheet name within the spreadsheet that already exists you will see an error.  How to select sheet cells and update content within those cells.  Selecting the range can then use the range to get values from cells as well as set values within cells. Use the range methods to make a selection of cells that you want to update. There are several ways to select the range, be careful that the range dimensions match the content dimension for the array so that data can be added into the selected range.  How to add content and create additional content for columns of data.  You can append rows of content, setting the content within an array in Apps Script. Using the LanguageApp you can select to translate strings into other languages. How to remove empty sheets from your spreadsheet  Using getDataRange() you can select the entire available set of data within a sheet. This can then be used to get the values, returning all the values within that selected sheet.\nApps Script How to use SpreadsheetApp update Sheets data in Spreadsheet. How to Update Sheets and Spreadsheet content  and prepend rows to sheets.  There are many methods that can be used within sheets, we can also use JavaScript methods to do a lot of adjustments when creating code.   How to create a new sheet and get the id to use in the sheet selection. Once your sheet is created, you might want to reorder the sheets, create a sheet with a specific name and use that sheet. You can check to see if the sheet exists, add headings if they do not exist.

How to select an existing event by ID and how to get the ID of an event.  Once an event is created you can also update the event, below are some common updates to an event object.\nHow to create Apps Script code to access Drive Service DriveApp functions.   Apps Script Drive Service DriveApp. Drive service will let scripts create, find, and modify files and folders within the users Google Drive.  The DriveApp class allows scripts to interact with files and folders by allowing the script to create, find, and modify files and folders within Google Drive.  MimeType is an Enum (enumeration) that provides access to MIME-type declarations without typing the strings explicitly.  How to create a folder using DriveApp Class  Set the folder name in the parameters, to add the folder to the root folder of your drive you can use the DriveApp class directly, and if no folder is specified the files and folders get created directly in the main drive folder.  How to select a folder and add new folders into it.  Select the folder, this is most commonly done using the id of the target folder.  To create a folder you need to specify the name of the folder in the createFolder method.  If you want to add it to a specific location, select the folder object using DriveApp class first.  Add editors to the folder using addEditor().  How to loop through a folderIterator object.  You can select the starting point for the folder selection within the folder object, which can be selected using the folder id value.   Select all the editors of the folder, this will return an array object which can use typical array methods including the forEach() to loop through the contents.  Get the email of the editor from the DriveUser object.  Get all the folders from a selected folder.  This returns a folder Iterator object. Using the while loop check if the hasNext() returns true, if it does select the next folder in the list using the next() method.  Output the folder names into the Logger execution log output.  How to create files adding editors to the file that gets created.  Using the createFile and setting a filename and contents will create a file type which cannot be viewed within the browser.  Although still recognized as a file the file type is not set and therefore the file is not able to be opened properly.  Setting a file type with MimeType and file extension in the name .\nCreate Move Updates Files and Folders within your Google Drive with Code.  How to search for a file with a value that is contained within the file name.  If you know the location of the files and want to retrieve files only that have a file name with a given value as part of the name, you can select all the files and then using the string method check if the file names contain the string value.  How to Search files using string methods.  Select the folder you want to search.   Return all the files within that folder. Loop through the files and check the filename which will be returned as a string value.  Since it's a string you can use string methods to check if the string includes a value.  Apply a condition depending on the results: update the file with a star or move it to trashed.  How to make copies of files and move files within the drive.  Select the folder you want to search. Get the files as file objects so that you can rename and move the files. Using makeCopy() create a copy of the file, setting a new name and moving it to a target folder.  Move the selected file into a folder by its id location.    file.moveTo(moveFolder). How to update the contents of a file, and change the name.  Select the file folder you want to use to update the containing files.  Add a viewer to the file. Set the name of the file with the extension .html. Set the content of the file as HTML structured content file.setContent(html); Go to the drive location of the file, download it and open the downloaded file in your browser as an html file.  How to get the id of a file.  Select the folder with the files, iterate through the file in order to return all the file ids.  Each file will have a unique id value.  For html and text files you cannot open them directly in the drive so the id is not in the browser as it is with other file types and folders. How to get the file editors array . Having the id of the file you can now directly select the file object.  If you have the name of the file you can search for the file to return it as an object. Return the array of file editors into the Logger.  How to select an html file or text file and turn it into a PDF that gets emailed.  Select the file object, then convert the file into a blob.  Not all file types can be converted easily. Get the email of the active user, or set a value for the email.  Create some html content. Using the MailApp service send an html email, add an attachment with the file as a blob and set it as a mime type of PDF.  How to create and add Sheets and Docs files into a drive.  Using the DocumentApp class, create a file.  Get the id of the file.  Once you have the file as a file object you can then use the moveTo to move the file into another folder by selecting the folder as a folder object.  Using the SpreadsheetApp class, create a sheet file.  Select the id of the file, and get it as a file object using the DriveApp class.  Using the moveTo() and set the argument to the value of the destination folder object.\nSending Emails Messages Thread updates with GmailApp Gmail Service Functions.  Gmail Service GmailApp Class  Gmail Service GmailApp Class.

      "description": "Now that we have the easy stuff out of the way, we take delve into some of Scala's more powerful features. Pattern matching is Scala's tremendous ability to deconstruct data in intuitive and readable ways, letting you write safely in a few lines of code what other languages can take tens of buggy lines to get across. We'll explore the various ways that patterns can be used, as well as some of the more advanced functionality that they hide. A quick detour into testing will introduce the specs2 library and how to use it to do behavior-driven development in Scala. Then we'll dig into Scala's collections some more; Scala's collections library is vast, and holds many powerful tools for dealing with data. Finally, we'll go through a few tricks that let you get readable and type-safe frameworks in place to describe your domain.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAntonio Salazar Cardozo is a developer who has led small teams from his classes at Georgia Tech and through each company he has contributed to.

      "description": "OpenSCAD software\nOpenSCAD is a 3D modeling software that is Open Source. It is free and easily accessible. OpenSCAD is different from many 3D modeling software. Indeed, the design is done with code. Therefore, it allows to create 3D models with programming. It is difficult to master the software when you don't know the programming language. It is also difficult to get started when you have used modeling software that uses features to create 3D models. Thus, the models are visualized from the moment the code is created. The software is ideal for people who want to create 3D models for printing, but also 3D models that can be exported for different uses. The advantages of coding 3D models are impressive. It is possible to modify models by using variables, or by modifying values on the code.\n\n\nWhy to use OpenSCAD\n- Ergonomic software\n- Free software\n- Parametric design\n- Fast rendering\n- Data accuracy\n- Software different from other modeling software\n- Programming code\n- Many possibilities with code\n- Creation of models for 3D printing\n- Creation of models for different uses\n- Use of variables\n\n\nTraining course\nIn this training, you will learn OpenSCAD software from scratch. With a step by step course structure, you will be able to master the software to create 3D models using code. Starting with the dashboard, mastering navigation and parameter management. You will learn how to add shapes and add transformations using the different programming languages. You will see how to master operations between objects, create repetitions, add variables. At the end of the training, you will be able to work with OpenSCAD to create your 3D models with the programming language.",

You will get an in-depth knowledge in writing encryption tools, connecting to the Tor privacy network, and how to write safe, un-hackable C code by making a safe string library.\nWhen doing all of this practically, I will explain all the necessary theory while we're coding. So there are no dense sections of heavy theory but you will still learn everything you need in order to fully understand the things we are building. While on this journey, you will also improve your knowledge of some of the more advanced features of the C language. Like how dynamic memory works, how you deal with linked lists, everything about advanced pointers, operating system functions (syscalls) as well as some binary bitwise operations, etc.\nYou will also learn the basics of Linux file system security and a whole lot more. And, as always, in 1080p resolution. Enjoy!\nBest regards,\nJB\n\n\nFree preview\nDo not miss out of the free preview. You can watch the entire first episode (40min!) for free. That contains the most part of one of my best C projects, the Toralizer. It is a command-line tool which lets you redirect any other Linux command through the Tor network.\nExample:\nbash$ toralize curl http://website-url\nThis will connect to the Tor privacy network and access the website. This works with any Linux command and we will code this tool from scratch to the finish line, in this course.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis is not a beginner course in the C language (I have courses like that too). This is for people who already knows the basics of C and wants to take the next step to intermediate-advanced level knowledge of the C language.\nThis course is also for C coders who wish to know more about Cyber Security.\n\n\nThe author\ndr. Jonas Birch has been programming the C language for more than 25 years and he's been teaching for the last 7-8 years. He has a background in the Cyber Security industry and he's a Senior network engineer. His videos are very popular (some are the highest rated courses on Udemy, in its category) and he's got a very soothing voice which is easy for the ears.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n00:00:00 Toralizer part 1\n01:27:29 Xor encryption\n01:39:09 Coding a real encryption library\n04:05:41 How to install your own C library\n04:15:13 Learn Linux file system security\n04:44:51 Coding a file encryptor, part 1\n05:37:21 Coding a file encryptor, part 2\n06:05:00 Write unhackable code (safe string lib)\n07:19:47 Toralizer part 2",
