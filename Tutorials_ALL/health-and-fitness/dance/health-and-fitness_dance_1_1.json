      "description": "Hello,\n\n\nHow are you?\n\n\nThis is Mohamed. I am super happy to share my Bachata passion with you and help you get your personal results.\n\n\n\"Dance first. Think later. It's the natural order.\" - Samuel Beckett.\n\n\nThis course is the natural continuity of our previous courses: see our classes for beginner, intermediate, advanced via our course directory on Udemy.\nThis new course you are about to start, created in 2020, will help you to include some dominican steps in your routine.\n\n\nYOU DO NOT NEED TO BE BORN IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC TO ENJOY DOMINICAN BACHATA ?\n\n\nDO YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELF IN THIS SITUATION? ?\n- You have never tried to learn Dominican bachata because you think it is too hard.\n- You would like to try but you think it is not accessible for you.\n- You have tried and it was so hard that indeed you think it is definitely not made for you…\n- The worst: you have always stayed aside, sat down with your drink at the party every time the Dj plays a Dominican song.\n- You invite a girl for a Dominican song but you only dance sensual or modern bachata and she let you know about her frustration by her non verbal communication . Too late, the dance experience is already a disaster.\n- You are invited by a man that knows how to dance Dominican but you do not know any footwork or partnerwork to follow.\n- You think you will have to train Dominican steps for 1 year to finally enjoy dancing a full song…\n- You have the feeling that there is a curiosity inside you, but this is never the right time and you search for some excuses to always postpone your Dominican bachata learning…\n- You want to know an easy method with easy steps to be able to lead, follow few steps no more, and start enjoying the whole dance party. But you haven't found it yet..\n- You think you cannot do any footwork and your body has not the competence to footwork & partnerwork during the dance…\n\nBUT TODAY I AM GOING TO HELP YOU TO END WITH THOSE FRUSTRATIONS ?\n\n\nWHY IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO DANCE DOMINICAN BACHATA FOR YOU?\nFirst, let me tell you, this is not your fault...\n\nNowadays, most of the workshops are about sensual or modern bachata.\nThere is a wrong perception about dancing Dominican bachata. People think you are either a professional, born in the Dominican Republic who has it in the blood and make it naturally. Or you are nothing…\n\nBut that’s wrong…\n\nWhat about the people who just would like to be in the middle like you and I?\nWhat the people who just wanna try accessible steps, footwork, partnerwork to enjoy a 4 min-song from Raulin Rodriguez & Romeo Santos -La Demanda for example.\n\nThat is possible for you !\n\nThat’s why my first objective with you is to show you that you can start today. This is easier & more accessible than you think. The method is to teach you first the footwork and then reproduce it with your partner in couple using the leading & following codes.\n\nI selected among my Dominican bachata congresses the steps you could easily remember and reproduce in the social dance. It worked for me ! I have already filtered the steps for you. I removed the difficult steps and those which are not reproducible in social. You just need to do it with Petra & I.\n\nTHAT’S WHY I CREATED \"DOMINICAN BACHATA For Dummies ” ? ♀️♂️\n-5 complete online workshops to be able to do & express 20 different Dominican steps and kill the dancefloor like never before…\n-We teach you footwork without & with music and we do with you. So that, you are able to dance individually which is very important in the Dominican Bachata.\n-We teach you how to partnerwork with your partner without & with music and we do with you. So that, you are able to provide a clear signal if you are leader, and get the right interpretation of the signal if you are follower.\n-In every workshop we detail everything to make you progress step by step. That’s why each workshop lasts around 45min+ in average.\n-At the end of every workshop, we provide you some extra tips for the follower & leader to feed your learning process & dance experience with your partner.\n-At the end of the program, we dance together a full Dominican bachata song using exclusively the traditional steps you have learnt along the way during the program.\n\nWHY I DECIDED TO BUILD THIS DOMINICAN BACHATA PROGRAM? BECAUSE I HAVE ALSO SUFFERED (secret)… ?\nToday I am very satisfied about dancing Dominican bachata at Salsa-Bachata-Kizomba parties but that was not the case during the 90% of my bachata dance period (I have been dancing since 2010 and just implemented Dominican at the early 2020 when I invested myself intensively to Dominican Bachata workshops & festival).\n\nDuring 9 years of dancing I have considered that I did not need traditional bachata in my directory of steps because I enjoyed enough dancing sensual in social. But I realized that sensual has got too mainstream and ladies got bored with this monotonous rythm of sensual. The whole night the same...repeated weeks after weeks. I realized that I needed to diversify my bachata to boost myself first (i do not like comfort zone) and offer different sensations to the partners on the dance floor (better experience).\n\nBefore, when a dominican song was played, I admit, I was doing bullshit. I looked alike a clown trying to make some footwork that are certainly not considered as Dominican footwork at all in the directory of steps hehe. Or worst, I was naïve to think that if a girl liked my sensual dancing on modern songs so, she would probably like my sensual moves even during a Dominican song…\n\nMISTAKE !\n(They were to polite to tell me directly but, i felt a difference by their expression and non verbal communication...).\n\nSo, i decided to be really curious and engage myself on the dominican bachata culture (history, music, steps, energy). I started to be more cautious about what really was Dominican bachata. I wrote a long article on this topic on my blog and talked more about it around me. I started listening more Dominican music. I investigate on the history of the bachata to understand its roots and spirit.\n\nThen , it convinced myself to work seriously on the Dominican bachata steps here in Europe. n January 2020, I attended a 100% Dominican bachata Festival in Amsterdam. And these 3 days of Dominican workshops, food, live talk and concerts have changed the dancer in me. Since that day I want to offer the possibility to the dancers to explore Dominican dance, music and culture. Beacause it is simply an injection of pure joy, humility and sharing on the dance floor. By Bachata nights are not the same anymore !\n\nBut, was not easy. I tell you. In the congress parties, only Dominican songs were played so you imagine my pain to fill every single song with great dancers in front me for 3 nights in row….\n\nI felt like a beginner again after 9 years of intense “modern” bachata training and parties…\n\nSuch a shock !\n\nSo I trained more & more.\n\nWhen I come back to my local community , the change was obvious: I am now siper enthusiastic when a traditional bachata song is played by a dj. The partners are so happy because they know I can produce diversity of steps more adapted to the traditional genre. I feel more creativity now in my bachata dance. Before I was a sensual dancer who were not able to move his own body. Today, I am more complete because able to dance Dominican Bachata … The heart of the Bachata dance by the way...\n\nI never spend anymore my time alone when a traditional song is playing…I invite the closest partner.\n\nAnd do you know the best part of the story?\n\nI also implement Dominican song during the modern bachata music when musicality (example when the guitar is played like in palabras que Matan from Dustin Richie) allows it.\n\n\nPs: did I tell you that after every workshop in the program, we will also practice the new steps on a modern bachata music. So that you will know that it can work for the two types of music. Whereas, sensual bachata steps (body moves) cannot work at all with Dominican music…\n\nTODAY THIS IS ALREADY AN OLD STORY … ?\nI assume to be a sensual dancer AND a traditional dancer too.\nI decided to filter the steps I have learned because the goal is to enjoy a full Dominican song. No need to be a Dominican dancer born in DR… That's not the point.\nI purely decided to dance and teach an accessible traditional bachata . Straight to the point: you have fun on the dance floor & you stand out because 80% of the bachata dancers do not know more than 5 traditional steps...\nToday, I want to train a maximum of motivated dancers to dance Dominican bachata and don’t stay aside during the parties.\n\nYou can dance sensual bachata AND Traditional Bachata. It is not OR but AND.\n80% dance modern bachata and only 20% dance Dominican.\n\nPs: I've learnt from the Best to become better than before. i am here with Sammy El Magico & Carolina one of the experts of Dominican Bachata in the World.\nTIME TO FINISH WITH FRUSTRATIONS. LET’s MAKE IT! LET’S TALK RESULTS AT THE END OF THIS PROGRAM, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO:\n-Dance a full bachata song with exclusively the traditional steps you have been taught in the program.\n-You will apply the steps in your social dancing at night.\n-You will be able to apply your Dominican steps on the dominican songs & modern songs too.\n\n\nMOTIVATED? YOU HAVE THE CHOICE… ?\n\n\nEITHER\n\n-You continue what you have done until now and you avoid exceptional experiences.\n-You go on collecting bad experiences when you will try dancing on Dominican music at parties saying “if I have known…”.\n-You remain ignorant that to be a real bachata dancer you need to know the traditional dance which is the root of what is Bachata.\n\nOR\n\n-You feel SO GOOD because you discover that Dominican bachata is simply Joy & Smile.\n-You finally become more attractive on the dancefloor.\n-You finally stand out from 80% dancers around you.\n\nSO, Get Excited ... !\n\n\nWhat our students say about our Online Bachata Classes :\n\n\n· \" You are a fantastic teacher. Very patient and kind! \" Kneox26 (USA)\n· 'Hi Mohamed, I like the kindness that shines from you and the global philosophy/attitude when dancing with your partner.

        "Busy women who want to have more fun, joy and health in their lives and want to be able to do it in short bite sized chunks. Learning to belly dance and incorporating it in short movement bursts sounds like a really great way to do this."

Or, that men are typically goofy on a dance floor and are only after one thing. Or... that you just suck at dancing. The truth is that men haven't been given the chance to dance. That's why in this course, we'll rise to the status of a true \"gentle man\" and seize the power of self-expression!\nIn this meticulously designed 10 video series - where each lesson is no longer than 10-15 minutes - you'll learn 3 to 4 concepts and/or dance moves per lesson and instantly be able to put it into practice through drills and simple audio tasks. You'll also only learn moves that can (and should) be performed with a drink in hand.\nUnlike other dance courses, this guide teaches you how to dance and interact with the world around you. It's not about showing off or impressing anyone. It's about interacting and connecting with everyone. What makes this course truly unique, though, is the concept of S.P.I.C.E. (Space, Position, Intent, Concentration, and Energy).\nIn Module 1 you'll learn:\nfour basic moves - the Bounce, Rock, Step Tap, and Freeze\nthe concept of S.P.I.C.E. and how to apply it your moves\nhow to share these moves with someone else on the dance floor using S.P.I.C.E.\nIn Module 2 you'll learn:\ntwo more challenging moves - the Three Step and the Shuffle\nhow to apply S.P.I.C.E. to these new moves\nhow to share these moves with someone else (as above)\nIn Module 3 you'll learn:\nthree slightly sexier moves - the Hip Swing, Hip Circle, and Chest Circle\nhow to apply S.P.I.C.E. to these new moves and the importance of body awareness\nhow to share these moves with someone else (as above)\nIn just three days (or even three hours), you can learn how to genuinely attract more of the right people into your space when you dance at social events.\nI'll see you on the dance floor, gentlemen.",

      "description": "Learn the basics of Samba no Pe with Ella: a dancer who was a passista in Rio Carnival in 2006 and Rainha Da Bateria for the London School of Samba in 2007.\nMade by Element Arts a dance company based in London UK who specialise in Samba from Brazil, Rumba from Cuba and Salsa from NYC, this course will teach you all you need to know to begin your journey dancing Samba: a beautiful dance from Brazil (Salvador da Bahia originally).\nWe will teach our twist on Rio style Samba taking you through the basics, body movement, styling, footwork and a combination. Samba no Pe is an improvised dance, so whilst we teach a combination, we always encourage you to freestyle.\nSamba is frequently identified as a musical expression of urban Rio de Janeiro, where it developed during the first years of the 20th century, though the Samba de Roda (which came first) is said to be from Salvador da Bahia. The word ‘samba’ is thought to be derived from the Kimbundu (Angolan) term ‘semba’, which referred to an ‘invitation to dance’.\nArtists used samba music to express their opinions on the social, economic and political issues in the country. In the 1870s, politicians attempted to prohibit samba on the pretext that folkloric dances shamed Brazil’s national image, but it is widely believed that artists were censored during the country’s dictatorships for disguising protest messages in songs.\nBy the 1980s, samba became associated with a more ethnically aware political movement, aligned both with the Black Power movement in the United States and the Caribbean as well as the Pan-African movement in Africa\nAll you need for this class is yourself, your enthusiasm, a warm body and a space to dance. The full course is 2 hours and 15 minutes long and takes you through the basics.",

That’s why I teach with a crystal clear method that ensures you have great form from the get go.\n\n\n\nI had a lot of fun putting this course together but if for some reason you’re not feeling it there’s a 30 day money back guarantee. Once you own this course, it’s yours forever to learn in your own time, unlike many of the online monthly subscriptions.\n\n\n\nOne more thing,\n\n\n\nBesides all the health benefits and the changes in my social life nothing can beat that feeling when the mind stops and the body takes over.\n\n\n\nBefore shuffling I’d NEVER felt anything like it before. It’s hard to put it into words but through this course and daily practice I know you will discover it for yourself.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nLizzie x",

Learn two fun, sexy routines from this performance dance!\nThis program is part of a series of six dance programs for beginner women featuring these styles of dance: Bollywood, Belly Dance, Contemporary Hip Hop, Chair Dance, Burlesque, and Alter Ego (Music Video). Try all of them today!\nBased on the most popular new dances of today, we've put together an exciting dance program that combines fun, fitness, and dancing. Best of all, the program is designed for absolute beginners, so you can take your time learning from the comfort of your own home. The variety of the Beginner Dance For Women program dances will take you everywhere from the zany fun of Bollywood dancing to the sexy, seductive chair dancing routines.\nAnd of course, the program is designed specifically for women. Since this program is ladies first, we go where the boys don't dare - shimmying, flirting, teasing, moving our hips, rolling our bodies, and showing off all our sexiness.\nFor each unique, exciting dance, Angela will teach you two full beginner dance routines. The dance routines will follow the structure of a dance class, except you have the option to go through the dance steps and practices, if you're stuck on any one move, or wish to perfect it.\nThe dance routines are built gradually, learning one or two sets of dance moves (called counts of 8 in dance terminology) at a time, and then doing a practice to the newly-learned moves. Afterwards, another set of dance moves are built on the existing dance moves and practiced until the full routine is learned.\nDon't worry if you don't the moves right away. Angela has plenty of experience teaching beginners, and we've created the dance program with that in mind. The moves have been carefully designed for easy \"body memorization\". We've chosen moves for beginner dancers, BUT if you think you've got it down, we've put in plenty of extras to keep you busy and coming back to the program.\nFinally, we finish with a workout in each style of dance that either focuses on stretching, cardio, or strength.",

      "description": "This course contains all of the instruction videos for my students for belly dance technique over two years of teaching.  Every move from every choreo I have created is broken down in full - around 88 moves, plus variations.  This is includes some unusual or rare moves as well as all the well known moves.  Where there are different ways to do the move, I have  included info on that - for instance, different styles of belly dance (Fusion, Turkish, Egyptian, Fantasy, Standard) and different flavours (Contained, Juicy, Syncopated).   In addition, I've included some combos to practise, a couple of Warm Ups and a couple of Stretching sessions, plus a 30 minute Deep Stretch.  This course is suitable for complete beginners, but if you are more an intermediate level, it will give you tips on how to improve the quality of your movements.  If you are interested in teaching belly dance, this course will show you how to break down moves for your students.  I also provide a course which breaks down 18 different choreos, across all styles of belly dance (coming soon) and a course which provides a different combo for every week (coming soon).  So, if you are looking for somewhere to apply all of the moves you've learned in this course, then please head over there and get dancing!  Thanks so much - Susan",

The level is advanced, but if you consider yourself intermediate level, you will absolutely benefit from this video, it will just require a bit more focus and practice.\nThe instructional thrust here is adopting and practicing elements that give bellydance high visual impact and a meaningful, evocative air in the eyes of Western audiences.\nIt’s great to be skilled at subtle isolations and cascading hip and torso accents that are the essence of belly dance, but if you stay true to its village and social dance origins, you will lose your modern-day Western audience for whom enjoyable dance involves dramatic full-body movement, sophisticated footwork, and story-telling elements such as gestures and universal body language that expresses and portrays emotions.\nAlong with classic belly dance hip work, well resolved footwork, and clean elegant lines, Neon included in this dance lots of material that has modern, high-impact flair - dramatic elongated poses like the images of art deco dancers, beautiful arm patterns that go beyond framing your hipwork, evocative gestures and the clean and uncluttered pacing that gives your audience a chance to savor the bold strokes with which you are painting the canvas of your dance.\nIn this video workshop Neon’s focus is on speaking the language of our audience, reaching out to them with your story and maximizing the impact of every move.",

      "description": "This course is your unique story of encountering the incredible ancient folk dance Lezginka. Preserved in the civilization cradle of Caucasian mountains, this ancient and ever-young Warrior dance has its place not only as a stage performance but as an authentic and natural part of most holidays and celebrations. Lezginka has a lot of animalistic scripts, which directly connect a performer with the powerful natural forces of the mighty mountains.\nIn the abundance of movements, you can find copied motions of eagles, mouflons, turs, and horses.\nWidely spread arms in the shape of eagle`s wings, over pointed toes recalling birds of prey claws, vigorous and highly agile foot movements so much resembling various horse allures, and incredible hovering leaps which you can see if you are witnessing life and death battle between wild tur and Caucasian leopard.\nAll these pictures will appear while watching or practicing the Caucasian dance Lezginka. It is a certain way to invocate sleeping powers in your body.\nThis dance was claimed to be a male one and, honestly, it's not only for men, there are plenty of Amazonian-empowered female dances which usually have different names often connected with specific locations of the Nation. During previous eras women were practicing those dances away from male eyes, leaving more humble dances for open auditions. Nowadays it has become a usual thing to see warrior female dances where participants are wearing pants instead of long skirts, they fly above the floor, jump on their frontal toe-bones surfaces, scream as a wolf pack between hunting sessions, and compete with each other on their level of legerity, legs strength and the ability to perform pirouettes and leaps.\nJust keep in mind that in contemporary reality male performance of any Caucasian warrior dance is still bolder and more expressive. If you are a future female performer of Caucasian warrior dance, try to find a balance between arising driving vital energies and that specific strictness of an iconic chaste woman from ancient Caucasian mountains.\nLet's celebrate life through dance. Almost any dance can bring us mental and physical health along with a general vitality increase but Warrior lezginka dance is beyond the usual reality and expectations.\nLet's discover it together! Carefully with a temperate pace and alterations for the different levels of students. Let`s jump to the dancing class!",

Gym clothes are ideal, along with either a pair of ballet shoes or socks and long hair should be tied up. Avoid dancing on a slippery floor and check with a medical professional if you have any existing injuries or health conditions that could be aggravated by a dance lesson. It is recommended to do a short warm-up and gentle stretch before starting the lesson.\n\n\nThe course does not need to be completed in exactly 5 days, so you should feel free to progress at your own pace. For best results, only move on to the next lesson once you feel confident with the exercises you have learnt in previous lessons.\n\n\nEnjoy yourself and don't forget to leave a review!",

      "description": "Traditionally, to learn how to break, you could spend anywhere from $200-$1,200 in studio and private lessons just to get the basics. The problem is most studio instructors are unqualified; they learn a few moves on Youtube, watch some dance movies and decide to start teaching. You end up with a watered down experience that’s a waste of time and money. To really get the basics, you need the right trainer.\nMy name is Huy and I’ve spent the last 20 years traveling the globe learning from pioneers and innovators in the dance. I’ve used the knowledge to train my crew, win numerous battles and develop a teaching method that works. Thanks to Udemy, my Breakdancing Basics course is now available online. Now it's more convenient to learn and much more affordable. Sign up today. It's your time to own the dance floor!\nHow The A.B.A. Method Works\nA.B.A stands for awareness, breakdown, and application. I developed this method to teach difficult moves to my crew but realized it works equally well for beginners. It's like learning a new language: moves are the vocabulary and combos are like sentences. You start by learning to pronounce words (body awareness). Then, you learn simple conjugation (breakdown). Finally, you use what you've learned in simple sentences (application to music) and repeat in intervals till you have it committed to muscle memory. The course includes both basic and intermediate moves, warm-ups, cool-downs, conditioning exercises, contexts for application (your Bar Mitzvah or office party is just the tip of the iceberg), history, practice mixes, list of videos to study and an invitation to a private community forum to share progress, get mentorship and find local events to attend.\nWhy I’m Doing This Project\nThis dance gave me direction in my early teens, introduced me to my wife in my 20s and now, in my 30s, still brings me joy in a way that’s hard to put into words. My intention is to share that happiness with you.",

Join me Simeon Weedall (Dorrance Dance, Percussive Feet, STOMP NYC & London, About Time Tap Co.) on this tap dancing course. I have spent thirty-one years of my life as a tap dancer and throughout my journey so far, nothing has inspired me more than the masters of tap. It is entirely thanks to these amazing people that I am able to do what I do today. We are standing on the shoulders of giants. In this course, I will take you through some of the steps that I have stolen over the years - created by the masters of tap. Learn from Bill Robinson AKA Mr Bojangles, John Bubbles - The Father of Rhythm Tap and other greats such as Teddy Hale, Chuck Green, Jimmy Slyde and Gregory Hines. I can think no better way to develop as a tap dancer than to learn from the best. These steps include complex rhythm, weight change and dynamic combinations that will change the way you dance for the better. I will also discuss and teach how it is that I go about stealing steps (an important part of the art form), so you can go ahead and become a step thief yourself.",

I give tips and techniques to make the movements look more juicy and isolated. We explore the difference of hip technique in belly dance and in Tahitian dance and talk about common technical mistakes dancers make in the movements.\n\n\nIn Part 2 we will be learning Tahitian fusion choreography. The part is divided into 6 sections. In each section I will be giving a combination without music first, then we practice it a few times with music. At the end we connect all the sections together, and you can practice as many times as you need until the choreography settles in your body.\n\n\nNote for beginners:\nI do NOT recommend this course if you have never danced before. It can be challenging and overwhelming to the point you feel disappointed in your abilities and never want to dance again. Besides, the tempo of choreography is quite fast so even experienced dancers will need to train well before they totally get it. We know that hip work in belly dance and Tahitian dance is very specific and requires a lot of practice. That’s why if you are a beginner get familiar with the basics first and once you are ready - jump in and let’s enjoy together!\n\n\nMusic:\nThe music I use in the class was composed by a great drummer of Lebanese background and a good friend of mine, Khader Ahmad. His style is truly unique, his drum work is truly inspiring and his music normally gets everybody up from a chair!\nThe track I use for the drum solo is called Tablahiti. The first part consists mainly of Arabic Rhythms then it merges with the second part where we find mostly Tahitian rhythms. Its original length is 4.03 min. I cut it down to 2.35 as the tempo of the music is quite intense and requires a good techniqality. In my opinion, short and energetic performances have a lasting impression.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this course as much as I did when I was recording it for you.\nAre you ready? Let’s dive in!",

      "description": "If you've ever wanted to try out the beautiful art form of Belly Dance, but you've been too nervous to try out a group class or perhaps you just don't have a class nearby; then this is for you. Learn the basics, the foundations, the stuff you need to get your head around; in the comfort of your own home / space. There is no difficult confusing choreography in this course; it is aimed at complete beginners to give them a chance to really get these movements into their bodies.\n\n\nWhen I first wanted to learn belly dance, I was 15yrs old... but it would be another 10 years before I set foot in a 'scary' classroom full of strangers. I went with a friend, who dropped out after only a few classes, but I was hooked. I was lucky; my first dance teacher was kind, patient and nurturing. I wish I hadn't waited so long to get started.... but it's scary being a beginner.\n\n\nWith this course I hope to enable the complete beginner to confidently take their first steps on their belly dance journey.\nAlmost every move in our dance form is created with these basic movements. If you can master these isolations and get them in your muscle memory (which can take some time so do be patient with yourself!) then you should feel confident either taking a real live class, or, moving on to more advanced online classes.\nIf you feel like you already have the basics under your dance belt; then this course can be used as a deeper dive into the anatomy used to create the movement, as dancers, drilling the basic movements is always a good thing to come back to.",

Our goal is to go from basic shimmy in the direction of advanced shimmy layering, but we’ll just make only the first steps. However, our first steps will be the best shimmy steps you’ve ever been taught, because we’ll look in detail at the techniques that are simply never covered in class systematically. So, it looks like it’s the best kept secret of how to develop your shimmies from beginner to advanced.\"\n\n\nClass 3 Shimmy Burst - adding shimmy to belly dance hipwork and footwork combinations\n\"If you perform for Western audiences, it's hard to get away with the never-ending shimmy sections, Egyptian-style, because the Western eye expects more movement from a dancer, and our Western dance is always footwork-driven. A strategy I want to play with today is using shimmy in bursts or splashes, so that you never go for more than 4 counts shimmying. We'll weave 2- and 4-count shimmy bursts into combinations rich in hipwork and footwork.\"",

You will be taught exercises, drills and vocabulary moves ranging from complete beginner to intermediate moves.\n\nRob (the instructor) teaches from his home town dance studio and includes slow motion, varied angles, close ups and annotations to help improve the learning.  You will need to put the practice in and also stop and rest when you need to, as the moves are quite intensive on certain leg muscles.  The course lasts approx. 1 hour, and will really help those who are trying to understand exactly how the illusion of the slide/glide actually works.\nRob is also available for any questions regarding the video so if there is anything you are stuck on then just ask!\nThe thing with gliding is that it looks easy, but at first it really isn’t.  Don’t expect results too quickly and don’t be disappointed if you don’t see an improvement as soon as you would like.  Keep practicing, take your time and with discipline and perseverance (like most things in life) you will get there!\nIf you like the course please give us a rating and a review!  Spread the word!",

Learning Kathak takes a lot of practice and it is extremely important to know the basics of this art form before practicing as a professional.\nKathak includes three specific forms or gharanas or houses (families). Jaipur, Benaras and Lucknow gharanas. Each of these three gharanas carries its own unique style, Lucknow gharana depicts delicate movements, Benaras gharana is more driven towards spirituality, and Jaipur gharana has movements depicting a warrior.\nHowever, before you jump to the technicalities of these three variations, you need to learn the basics first.

To this end we explore a range of fun interpersonal dance activities as well as more typical activities that involve mindfulness, embodiment, and visualisations.\n\n\nActivities range from the silly to the serious, some focus on interpersonal development whilst others focus on intrapersonal healing, some ideas are fully-developed whilst others are 'half-baked' and put forward in the hope that you will add seasoning; the course aims to explore as wide a range of possibilities and ideas as possible and I hope to add new ideas to the course as students contribute to it.\n\n\nThe activities and exercises in this course are based on my 15+ years of attending ecstatic dance workshops and groups around the world, the countless hours I've spent in personal private ecstatic dance practice, many nights dancing like a lunatic on psytrance dancefloors, a lot of reading on the subject, as well as my own imagination!\n\n\nThe ideas, activities, and exercises explored in this session are offered in the hope that ecstatic dance facilitators will use them in more experimental approaches to ecstatic dance: I hope that you'll try some of them out and see what works for your group and which ideas are of benefit to your ecstatic dance workshop participants.\n\n\nThe course is light-hearted, unpretentious, casual and informal! It's aimed at ecstatic dance facilitators, dance instructors wishing to explore ecstatic dance in their work,  and dance and movement therapists.\n\n\nKeywords: ecstatic dance, conscious dance, dance rituals, ecstatic dance facilitator training, ecstatic dance workshops, ecstatic dance activities, ecstatic dance group exercises, professional development",

Veil dancing relies a lot on various veil tricks - ways to manipulate veil to create sophisticated silk waves and cascades in the air. With wings, you can't rely on tricks, because there is not much you can do trick-wise. You can’t change hands, let go of wings, wrap them around you - wings are a very flashy prop, but far less versatile than the veil. One thing they have in common is that both cover a multitude of sins when it comes to the actual dance, because everyone’s eyes are on your veil or wings, not on your hips or feet or even hands. So you can get away with a lot. Also, since both props are of Western origin, they are compatible with bellydance vocabulary, but not really bellydance - you can add a lot of hipwork to your wings or veil dance, but your hips do not coordinate with wither veil or wings, your hips and your prop remain strangers, they dance their own dance no matter how closely they follow either beat or melody.\"\nMusic: \"Ottoman Lobotomy\"  from the album Kara Nomadica by Kara Nomadica; \"Saptak-Samaya Mix-Solace\"  from the album Eastern Grooves by DJ Cary; \"Azzuri-Middle\"  from the album Lavender by Middle-Earth Ensemble; \"Breathing\"  from the album Ethnic by Shiva in Exile; \"Sah'de\"  from the album Nour by Shiva in Exile,  \"Karuna\"  from the album Star Of The Sea by Stellamara",

This is because we know that you learn better what you repeat more.\nAlso, listening and practicing always based on the same tango will develop your musical awareness of music, making it easier to pay attention to other tangos and develop your musicality faster than the rest of tango dancers. And all this, without having to know anything about music, but just applying some automatic intuitive impulses that make everything \"logical\" at the moment of dancing. So don't worry, you don't need to know \"music theory\" before you start with this training. In fact, they are made for people who have no idea about music.\nRemember that these trainings are not \"courses\" about musicality, but they are more practical than theoretical.

I'm really excited to be introducing this program to you as it's been newly updated, totally revamped, and is now the BEST Club Dance Program out there. I created the first and original Club Dance For Men program a few years ago when I was frustrated with the club dance scene. It was the same dance scene, same dance moves, same so-so experiences with women.\nI wanted more. I wanted something different. I wanted to have fun. I wanted to challenge myself. I wanted to face my fears. I love facing my fears. In fact, I keep a whole separate blog on this topic. So, I went out to the clubs every night, experimented a LOT, learned all kinds of dance, mixed and matched, and came up my with my unique dance programs.\nMy Youtube Channel has received millions of views since then, but the core of my interest is developing a program based on my teaching experiences and feedback from my original program. Over the years, I re-released revisions of the program as it evolved, but this time around, I've gone back and re-filmed the entire program to make it the best program out there.  In fact, it's so full and jam-packed, that I consider it more to be a dance course than just a program.\nThe fact is, dancing at a club or social venue doesn't have to be intimidating. It should be fun. Here's the deal. You've probably have a long life to live, and it's much better to be dancing through it. Whether I'm traveling in exotic countries or at home, I always find myself in situations where dancing is useful.\nThe Club Dance For Men program is all based on real teaching and dance experiences. The women in it are real girls I've met dancing and in clubs. The students I've taught are real. I've taught men of all shapes, sizes, and dance levels - ESPECIALLY beginners and ultra-beginners. I've heard it all: I can't dance. I have no rhythm. I'm the worst dancer in the world.  And yes, I can help.\nThe dance system taught on this program was created from learning and combining years of experience in different dance styles, spending countless (but enjoyable!) hours in the club refining the moves, and most importantly, actually teaching guys how to dance in clubs!  This is the original program that's the most popular out there because it works.  Watch, learn, and step up your dancing today!\nIn Club Dance For Men Level 1, I put together all the core, basic dance moves you need to learn to get comfortable and to start building your confidence on the dance floor. Rather than covering a whole lot of dance moves and losing you, I spend time working on styling and making it look right and natural, along with plenty of practices, which is more important.\nThis newly updated, beginner course features:\nBasic rhythm exercises designed for ultra-beginners\nEasy, beginner dance moves to get you moving\nImportant practices at slow and club speeds, and to urban and electronic music\nOver 50 licensed commerical club tracks, with an increased emphasis on electronic dance music\nSeparate lessons covering hand movements for each dance step\nIntroduction to transitioning dance moves and customizing your dance to the music (musicality)\nBasic dance moves with a girl with demos\nOver 5 hours of dance lessons and practices",

I quickly and somewhat awkwardly move a “safe distance” from the dance         floor.”\n· “I make “pre-dance apologies” to potential partners who won’t take “No“ for an answer.”\n· “I would like to learn to dance but I just can’t find the time to do it.”\n\n\nWell, NOW you can put that all behind you…\nBallroom 101 is designed specifically for single individuals. There is so much you will learn, in terms of basic dance patterns, postures and rhythms without the need of a partner.\nBut, before we look at the course, let's look at some of the many incredible ways that learning to dance can enhance and even change your life.\n· Dance is like exercise, but its fun exercise.\n· It raises your heart rate and speeds up your metabolism.\n· Dancing releases endorphins, serotonins and dopamine in your bloodstream that raise your spirit, make you feel good in your body, and can help chase away the blues.\n· Dance done right, will naturally improve your posture, balance, and coordination. You will feel more alive in your body, which translates to greater confidence as you move through your everyday world.\n· Learning to dance is one of the very best activities to support brain plasticity - keeping your brain active and healthy as you age.\n· It’s an activity you can share with friends, family and partners for the rest of your life. You are never too old to dance.\n· Most of all dancing is fun. Really fun. AND, Everybody loves a good dancer!\n\n\nIn the first lesson in ballroom 101, we’ll start by learning four elements of movement that are common in ALL dances.\nThese elements are like building blocks, that begin to create a foundation of skills from which more patterns can be learned in the future. from these four simple elemental skills we’ll build six popular ballroom dances…\nThe elegant Waltz, the romantic Rumba, the all-American East Coast swing, the cheeky cha-cha, the classy foxtrot and finally, the spicy Salsa!\nThese foundation lessons in Ballroom 101 have introduced thousands of new students, “singles AND couples”, to the unexpected simplicity of learning to social dance with a partner.\nAt the end of this course and with some practice, you’ll be able to get out on any social dance floor, feel more assured, more confident and have lots more fun!\nIf you’re ready to increase your self-confidence, look and feel better, meet new people connect more deeply with your dance partner and CREATE YOUR BEST LIFE… Now’s your time!\nClick the \"Enroll Now\" button to start your exciting journey into the world of social dance and get the attention you deserve!

This style is full of feeling!\nThe movements are earthier without many spins nor big travelling steps; steps are mostly on flat feet and the style is funky, bouncy and upbeat. The melodies and remixes can be hypnotic and trance-like and often invoke the aid of a higher being.This new music is quite popular in Shaabi weddings as the repetitive rhythms and lyrics pull the audience in and are very danceable, getting you on your feet!\nAs a musical form, Shaabi is the voice of the street, an urban expression full of feeling, double entendres, and social commentary.\nAs a dance, Shaabi reflects a true and authentic expression of the Egyptian people and their humor and playfulness..",

Not only it's a great way to exercise safely, but it also boosts your self-esteem, helps develop musicality & connects you to like-minded people!\nThis course focuses of the very basic moves of belly dance and consists of three parts:\n- Safety & posture, a warmup, and upper body work (including the belly)\n- Hip work (lower body work)\n- Belly dance combinations\nAll the belly dance moves can be divided in three categories: staccato-like moves (pops & locks), flowing moves (circles, rolls etc.) and shimmies. We are going to work with all these types of moves, so be patient and repeat the moves as many times as you need until it sinks into your body.\nThe main Arabic rhythm we are going to use during this course is baladi (masmoudi saghir). You will hear it in most of the training videos.\nI have been teaching and performing belly dance around the world for over 12 years (Europe, Asia, Australia) and feel very passionate about passing the love for the dance to others. My students are generally women (and sometimes man) of all ages (the most senior student is 82!) so safety is my main priority.\nMy goal is to teach you to gain a better control over your body, to loosen up tight chest and hip area, to help you discover hidden abilities of your body through belly dance!\nIf you have any questions about the course - please, do not hesitate to contact me via DM.\nI hope this course helps you fall in love with belly dance like I do every day, when I teach dozens of my students.\nEnjoy :)",

      "description": "Introducing SHINES BUNDLES - A NEW TEACHING METHODOLOGY / CONCEPT to Teach & Learn SALSA SHINES & FOOTWORK.\n\nWait No More and learn an amazingly effective method of learning SALSA SHINES & FOOTWORK so that you can remember, recall & recreate all the SHINES that you learn when you hit the Salsa Social Dancing floor.\n\n\nWhat do we mean by Shines & Footwork? Why do we need these? What are the benefits, advantages and takeaways from Shines/Footwork?\nSolo Dancing or Shines & Footwork, are well-worth learning & is helpful for many reasons in Partner dance styles. 'Shines' are usually referred to patterns, steps & footwork beyond just the basic steps. 'Footwork' is generally means any kind of Footwork including basic steps & Shines. Learning basics is one thing, but footwork & shines, surprisingly is an extremely important factor in learning partner-work & improving your whole self dance in general. This applies to all partner dance styles, including Salsa, Mambo, Cha Cha, Bachata & yes even Kizomba.\n\n\nAdvantages: Dancers who spend allot of time on shines or footwork have quite a few advantages; they can have a more fun with social dancing because they have more tools in their tool kit. They can break away from their dance partner and freestyle with shines they have learnt and even create new ones of the fly. This allows them to express in ways that many don’t. It you are confident enough to dance without the rules of partner work, allow your partner to express themselves in new ways, and generally increase the variety in your movements. Their body-movement is better, they can turn quicker when executing turn patterns that required them to turn, 'male or female'. They look better because of their own personal style, fluidity of movement, body movement, styling, musical interpretation and their technique, timing and speed. While social dancing it also adds more variety to the dance and there are sections in the music that can require solo dancing.\n\n\nBenefits from Shines & Footwork: Timing, Musicality, Control, Expression, Foot speed, Weight shifting & Transfer, Foot placement, Styling, Flavor, Fluidity, Posture, Mastering basic steps, Body position & angles, Acceleration & deceleration, Directions Changes, Sharp vs Smooth movements, Move more easily, Body Movement, Muscle memory, Grounding & Floor Pressure, Solo dance technique, Turns, Pivots & Spins, Balance, Confidence, Learning Routines Faster and.....Finally having fun!\nMost of these benefits above, you can’t learn from partner-work alone and only benefit your dancing a whole.\n\nYou do need a good chunk of above such as body movement, speed, styling, flavor, Fluidity, etc. Once you make these building blocks muscle memory, through practice and repetition, your dancing will grow massively to the point you can express in a way that relates to the music, known as musicality.\n\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of beginners & unexperienced dancers, or not well trained ones, tend to dismiss shines and think that they are a waste of time. They will never be used and should be for performing only! They also may believe that learning partner-work should be the main focus of on learning to dance. This just shows a lack of understanding of these dance styles. You actually need both!\n\n\nSo in a nutshell, if you want to be a great partner-work dancer or even a well balanced dancer, you really do need shines & footwork!\n\n\nNow, Once you have read the above details about SALSA SHINES & FOOTWORK, Do you wish to learn these the right way, in extremely detailed manner, step by step? Or to improve your Salsa Body Movements / Language & Musicality? Did you always want to make your Shines, Turn patterns, Partner Work look much more smoother, richer, fluid, graceful, attractive & inspiring to people who are looking at you while you dance in Salsa Socials or in stage performances?\n\n\nDo you feel you have been dancing Salsa for a while, have been taking lessons, doing shines and partner-work classes, attending workshops & Latin Dance festival but still you feel that there is something missing and your dancing is not as smooth, technically correct or attractive as much as you want it to be? Then Perhaps, Salsa Shines & Footwork is one thing that you might be lacking in your skillset !!

Designed for experienced dancers, this program unlocks the depth of five iconic Mongolian dances, from the powerful rhythms of tribal movements to the elegance of the chopstick dance and the wild spirit of animal-inspired choreography.\n\n\nBeyond steps and techniques, you’ll explore the philosophy behind each dance—how Mongolian herders express their bond with nature, horses, and the vast steppe through movement. Students will analyze the symbolic gestures of eagle dances (symbolizing freedom) and the rhythmic symbolism of Biyelgee’s knee bends (reflecting horseback life). Through live demonstrations by cultural experts, you’ll gain insider perspectives on how dances are adapted for modern stages while preserving ancestral meanings.\n\n\nExpect dynamic combinations, nuanced expressions, and cultural storytelling that transforms dance into a living connection to Mongolia’s heritage. The course culminates in a collaborative performance where students choreograph their own interpretations, blending traditional steps with personal creativity. By the end, you’ll not only master techniques but also understand how Mongolian dance serves as a bridge between past and present—a living art form that evolves while honoring its roots.\n\n\nWhether refining your stage presence or uncovering new creative inspiration, this course will elevate your artistry to the level of a cultural ambassador. Join a global community of dancers who have trained with Mongolian masters in Ulaanbaatar’s National Theatre, and take your place in this centuries-old legacy. Gallop, leap, and sway with the spirit of the Mongol plains.",

Dreaming about being invited by a charming gentleman for a dance...This prince invites you for a dance...and that is real now...how do you feel the energy?\n\nMaybe you are a boy and dancing is your way to make a difference. You are not anyone. What do you think about standing out ? 97% of the men in the planet do not know how to dance...imagine your value added ! how do you feel this empowerment?\nNew kind of holidays\nHave you ever watched a bachata clip with dancers on a beach by sunset? This could be you. Music is playing from your smartphone. People around are watching you. You feel and enjoy the present moment. You are the happiest person with your partner at this moment. Welcome to bachata…\nPs: i experience it in Benidorm in Spain in 2017 with my girl friend. I took her by a sunset, to the beach and we improvised a bachata dance. And we danced like nobody's watching us. Total freedom. People remarked us and enjoy watching us dancing. A pure life memory still in my head...\nFeeling good even working\nImagine a usual day at work. You’re smiling. Your colleagues are asking you why you are feeling so good? And you answer: “Right after work I’m going to attend a Bachata class and then go to a Latin party. What about you?”. “Well, I am going to chill on Netflix, the routine…”. Voilà, there is nothing else left to say. Sometimes during your work week, just even getting the thought of dancing can make you feel good.\nNew mornings\nImagine that the day after a great party, you wake up with a great sensation of feeling good. You still have the great Latino vibes of yesterday’s night in your mind and you just need one thing: to share it with your loved ones, family, friends…\nHave a break, listen to bachata\nEvery time you have a break you listen to some bachata music and discover that you have some favorite ones. The type of music that turns a bad day into a good one.\nA dancing therapy\nWe all have concerns, issues, problems. But, once you start dancing bachata at home or at a party, all the problems are going away. You just think about enjoying the good vibes the dance & music provide you.\n\n\n2- The Problem is that it is often difficult... It happens to everyone :)\n\n\nYou think you are not made to be a dancer.\nYou lack of self confidence.\nYou think you cannot have a flexible body to move.\nYou have the fear to be ridiculous.\nYou think it will be a long process.\nYou repeat steps and you tend to forget.\nThe first results come fast and then...desert.\nYou compare yourself with the dancers around you.\nYou have fear to dance on public.\nYou have a busy schedule.\n\"They\" progress faster than you...\n\n\nTHIS IS JUST NORMAL !\n\n\nThis is not your fault.\n\nNobody has already provided you the 'guide\" to dance Bachata and be a dancer with the right mindset when you start.\n\nYou love dancing and you would love to invest in yourself?\n\nSo, go on reading the next section :)\n\n\n3-Would you love to...\n\n\nGet a step by step guide?\nEnjoy Accessible & Creative steps\nPractice WITH us slowly?\nGet a complete program which prepares you to feel excited to your first social dances in public?

In this course you are taught by someone who didn't start dancing professionally until their mid 30's. I had to learn how to move my body from scratch, dissect movement and learn how to re-teach what I understood.\nThis is often a skill overlooked by life long professionals where dancing came easily and naturally for them.\n\n\nThis course is for all levels with a willingness to learn the progressions of the harder moves.\nPRE REQUISITE :\nA basic plow is needed to be able to access the moves beyond the flare/backspin section.",

Still typically we think of the moves as static - predominantly done in place, even though most of them came from folk dance steps where they were elements layered on walking or rocking steps. So we'll do ‘layering’ - turning these elements into steps again, but with a much bigger amplitude and a different feel than they have in folk dances - these are display moves, not just trajectory components of traveling steps.\n\n\nClass 1 - 45 min - Circles and Steps - Circular belly dance hipwork trajectories layered on steps\nWe’ll start with 10 minutes of warmup, and then play with a few combinations where we’ll layer circular trajectories on steps. We have 2 versions of this class - instruction and practice version, and a shorter 30-minute segment - non-stop practice of all the combinations with music and voice cues.\n\n\nClass 2 - 45 min. - Infinity Loops and Steps Belly - Infinity Loops belly dance hipwork trajectories layered on steps\nWe’ll rehearse various travel steps with different types of hips and chest figure 8s, or infinity loops layered on them.\n\n\nClass 3 Full Body and Upper Body Belly Dance Moves Technique Drills\nTo balance our hipwork-focused series, this is a technique practice flow featuring single moves and mini combinations involving upper body, full body and undulating motion - regular undulation, reversed undulation, side undulation and various torso tilts combined with elements of fluid hipwork and simple travel steps.",

If you want to learn how to twerk, you came to the right place!\nWe are going to learn together 10 different techniques.\nTwo Twerk dance combinations - an easy one and more challenging one.\nYou are going to strengthen your body, work on acceptance and self-love.\nYou will learn to take time for yourself.\nAnd the most important part - to have lots of fun!\nThe course fits for whoever wanted to twerk, with no previous experience, and also for those who know how to twerk and wish to improve their technique.\n\n\nThe Twerk program is designed to teach you how to twerk most effectively, step by step, with detailed explanations for each move.\nThe program is set up, for three sessions per week, with each session lasting 35 minutes – an effective workout that fits your routine!\nSince all the content is recorded and available for watching at any time, you can do less than three workouts a week, or if you want, you can do more.\nAnother advantage of the digital program is that you can practice at the pace that suits you! You can stop the video and repeat it until you succeed.\nEvery session includes a warm-up and cool-down that is very recommended to do before and after the Twerkout.\nDespite the program being focused on your booty, you will also work on other muscle groups: legs, back, abs, and arms.\nDuring the program, you will learn 12 different Twerk techniques. Each week you will be learning two twerk techniques. Once you have learned them all, we will combine and practice everything through two Twerk choreographies that will strengthen your technique even more and take you to the ‘next level’.\nTo make the workout program even more comfortable, you will get a pdf format of the full workouts plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotography, edited and directed by: Yogev Azriel & Tomer Freyman\nMakeup: Moran Lang\nDancers: Gal Avichzer & Eden Bar- Nahum\nMusic by:\n1.

It covers the following topics:\n\n1. Introduction: The Nature & Benefits of Ecstatic Dance & Conscious Dance\n2. The History of Ecstatic Dance, Ritualistic Dance & Dance in Religious Settings\n3. Modern Approaches to Ecstatic Dance & Conscious Dance\n4. Practical Matters: Organising & Operating Ecstatic & Conscious Dance Events\n5. Creating & Developing Your Ecstatic Dance or Conscious Dance Philosophy\n6. Structuring Ecstatic Dance & Conscious Dance Sessions\n7. Selecting Music for Ecstatic & Conscious Dance\n8. Applying Principles from Dance Movement Therapy (DMT)\n9. Financial, Legal, and Health & Safety Considerations\n10. Growing Your Ecstatic Dance or Conscious Dance Community\n\n\nIn this course Adam Godwin (MA) advocates an experimental and integrative approach to creating new and unique ecstatic and conscious dance practices. Instead of teaching about just one specific approach to conscious and ecstatic dance (such as 5Rhythms, Open Floor, or Biodanza) this course explores a massive variety of approaches: both ancient and modern! By the end of the course you will be able to create your own ecstatic or conscious dance philosophy and practice; and you'll know how to establish and grow your unique dance community.\n\n\nThe course includes the following:\nOver 20 hours of exclusive video content\nA 70+ page printable guide and workbook\nA printable 'Facilitator Guidance Phrase' guide\nA printable 'Dancer Feedback Sheet' to use at the end of dance sessions\nAn E-Book: 'The Philosophy of Dance: A Complete Overview of Key Philosophers & Thinkers'* (.pdf & Kindle format)\nA massive range of external resources & links to enhance learning\nInteractive quiz questions to assess learning throughout the course\n\n\nThe course was designed for people who have no prior facilitator training. However, those currently serving as ecstatic dance or conscious dance facilitators will find the course both useful as a refresher and to deepen their knowledge with more advanced sections - such as 'applying Principles from Dance Movement Therapy (DMT)'  which explores the theories and practices that have evolved in dance-based approaches to psychotherapy more generally.\n\n\nIt was designed with the following people in mind:\n• Anyone who wishes to share their love of conscious or ecstatic dance\n• Those wishing to start their own ecstatic dance or conscious dance community\n• People wishing to organise and facilitate ecstatic or conscious dance events\n• Conscious/Ecstatic Dance Facilitators who want to enhance their practice\n• Dance Movement Therapists wishing to broaden their approach\n• General Dance Teachers & Instructors wishing to explore new approaches & modalities\n\n\nThe course will also be of interest and relevance to students of dance; for example, those undergoing courses such as Dance Performance, Performing Arts, Choreography and Creative Practice, Dance Studies, Musical Theatre and Dance, and Dance Science at university level.\n\n\nEarn An Ecstatic Dance & Conscious Start Facilitator Training Certificate!\nUpon completion of the course students are automatically given a certificate by Udemy. An additional (very pretty) certificate can be claimed once 100% of video content has been completed and all quiz questions have been answered (with a 95%+ success rate). Whilst this certificate is not formally accredited, it will serve as valuable evidence for the substantial learning you will accrue in this course and provide you with all the required theoretical and practical knowledge to suceed as a facilitator.\n\n\nBy the end of the course you will be able to:\n1. Create your own unique philosophy of conscious or ecstatic dance\n2. Establish your own ecstatic dance or conscious dance community\n3. Design & structure powerful ecstatic and conscious dance sessions\n4. Incorporate ideas from ancient and modern approaches to conscious and ecstatic dance\n5. Integrating theories and practices from Dance Movement Therapy (DMT)\n6. Develop, promote & grow a financially sustainable (and profitable!) practice\n7. Bring a powerful spiritual and therapeutic practice into the lives of countless people\n\n\nI hope you'll register today and that you'll find the course interesting, enjoyable, and useful. My hope is that by working together we can share this powerful spiritual and therapeutic practice with people in your local community and around the world!\n\nYours faithfully,\nAdam Godwin (MA)\nUdemy Instructor\n\n\nPlease note:\n\nThis course seeks to train facilitators in 'Ecstatic Dance & Conscious Dance' as a general practice and not in any one specific modality of conscious dance or ecstatic dance (e.g. 5Rythms or any other approach discussed in the course)\nThe aim of this course is to allow you to create your own approach to conscious and ecstatic dance practice based on your own unique philosophy whilst drawing on ancient and modern approaches to conscious and ecstatic dance.\nWhilst we will study many different contemporary approaches to conscious dance and ecstatic dance, this course does not qualify (or seek to qualify) students to serve as facilitators of those specific approaches, or of any specific pre-established approach (such as 5Rythms, Open Floor, Biodanza etc.) as these practices are legally protected in terms of trademarks, copyright, etc.\nThis course is not a substitute for formal training in specific pre-existing ecstatic dance or conscious dance approaches that already have training programs led by the organisations they are assosicated with (such as 5Rythms, Open Floor, or Biodanza etc). If you wish to call yourself, for example, 'A 5Rythms Facilitator' you must do training that is approved and accredited by the appropraite organisation (i.e. not me!). Such training is beyond the scope of this course.\nI encourage the use of the titles  'Conscious Dance Facilitator', 'Ecstatic Dance Facilitator' or 'Conscious & Ecstatic Dance Facilitator' (etc). The term \"Conscious Dance Facilitator\" is a more general term that encompasses various movement and dance practices aimed at promoting mindfulness and self-awareness. This term is not tied to a specific trademarked methodology and is used broadly across different disciplines. Likewise, the term \"Ecstatic Dance\" is not trademarked and is considered an open-source practice. This means that anyone can organise or facilitate an Ecstatic Dance (or an ecstatic dance) without needing specific certification or authorization. The aim of this course is to substantiate your use of such terms with comprehensive training.\nThis course refers to 'ecstatic dance' in its broadest possible conception: whilst we look at 'Ecstatic Dance' as a distinct form of conscious dance and a formalised approach to ecstatic dance, the training and assosciate certificate refer to 'Ecstatic Dance & Conscious Dance' in terms of this broader conception of 'ecstatic dance'.\nThis course is also ideal in serving as an affordable foundational springboard before training in specific established modalities (such as 5Rythms, Open Floor, or Biodanza etc) for those who wish to do so.\nThe fifth section of the course will help you create your own unique philosophy of conscious and ecstatic dance practice and facilitation so that you can operate without reference to pre-established approaches (such as 5Rythms, Open Floor, Biodanza etc.) You must not claim to be trained in specific pre-existing conscious and ecstatic dance modalities with reference to this course.\nNonetheless: this course is comprehensive, complete, and entirely sufficient for anyone who wishes to start their own conscious or ecstatic dance practice based on their own unique philosophy - a philosophy this course will help you to develop and formalise!\n\n\nAll course contents are the intellectual property of Adam Godwin (2024)\nCopyright Adam Godwin (2024)",

Each section is broken down so you can focus on clean technique while still enjoying the artistic side of exotic pole.\nWe begin with a warm-up that prepares your body for movement, improves mobility, and includes front split tips to help you build flexibility over time. Then, you’ll learn the choreography piece by piece, with tips for creating smooth, connected flow. Finally, we finish with a cooldown to stretch your muscles, protect your joints, and support long-term progress.\nKnee pads are required for safety and comfort, while high platform heels are optional — barefoot works beautifully too.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a stunning full routine, improved flow, stronger technique, and the confidence to perform the choreography to your own favorite music.",

      "description": "PARTIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN!!!\nYet not all of us really enjoy them. Some of us actually stay seated or by the bar watching our phones, checking if we have new messages but we all know that very few people text at this type of hour... At some point we look up at the dance floor and... WOAAW some people are busting a small move together, swinging while smiling and having fun, all of this in sync.\n\"Have they rehearsed together?\" \"Do they know each other?\" \"Are they dancers?\" Most of the time the answer is none of the above.\nThen, \"How do they do that??\"  \"Oh I wish I could do that too\"  \"Well anyways, I'm not cut out for that\"  \"It looks too complicated\"  \"Wait, the thing they're doing, what is that even called?\"  \"You know what, I think I actually don't like parties, I'm bored!\"...\nIf you have gone through similar experiences, let me tell you that you're not the only one and that it does really SUCKS!\n\n\nPARTIES ARE NOT FUN\nYou may have felt it for the last months, or maybe years, but parties are not fun anymore when we get stuck in a corner while others are having fun. To the point where you get nervous if someone mentions about the next party you WILL HAVE to attend (because yes, some of your \"friends\" force you) just thinking about going through the same boring and frustrating experience. Meanwhile how can some people comparatively have so much fun on the dance floor?? They're obviously not dancers but they have a minimum of moves which allows them to catch on the vibe and be \"part of the party\".\n\n\nWHERE DOES IT COME FROM?\nSo what is it? Shyness? If so how to compensate that shyness? Some would suggest to just \"forget about anyone and dance for yourself without caring about what other people think and bla bla bla...\" Seriously, if it was that easy don't you think we would be already doing it??\n*New Approach\nSuppose you had mastered the moves, would it make a difference? I bet it would! What you get good at you also get confident at, right? Leads us to the next question: How to get good at it? (Assuming we even know what moves or what it is we're looking for, which is yet another story itself...)\n\n\nYOUTUBE WON'T HELP\nYou have tried, I have tried it, we have all tried it. Why Youtube doesn't work for us? Sadly, I found that YouTubers care a lot more about their views and how cool they look rather than teaching to a real beginner (which doesn't look that cool). You may or may not relate to it but most of the time I have tried YouTube dance tutorials, they were skipping a lot of things in-between, assuming \"it made sense\" to naturally guess whatever was not explicitly mentioned.\n\n\nIS THERE A MIRACLE SOLUTION?\nUnfortunately not! BUT THERE IS A METHOD THAT YOU CAN LEARN! I called this the breakdown method: Most of the steps have core moves and the rest is just layers of energy that are added to make it look \"better\"\n*METHOD:\n--> Remove every layers of energy (BREAKDOWN)\n--> Get to the core move and master it (Very easy)\n--> Start adding back layers of energy little by little\nMost of the time people learn the step in its entirety and that's why it so difficult to get! You have to focus on everything at the same time: your rhythm, your legs, your arms, hips...No way, we're beginners! I have spent time to study and understand the nature of steps and have tested it to my private dancing classes, re-crafting it over and over so it could be easily applied today, online.\n\n\nIn this course you will:\n- use this Breakdown method to master 5 of the most popular moves and enjoy your next party\n- Get familiar with the process so learning moves will become faster for you as you progress throughout the course\n- Understand the right timing and the right use of these moves\n- Get feedback from me so I can tell you some personal suggestions\n- Stay up-to-date with the current trend, as I am always scouting for the freshest moves\n*Bonus\nYou will also learn a way to multiply those moves with a secret trick so that your range gets even broader than 5 moves\n\n\nTHERE IS NOT BETTER TIME TO LEARN THAN NOW\nYour next party could be next week, in a month from now, or for Christmas and New Year's eve! Let's change the game this time and make it one to remember as the new YOU, who enjoys busting a move and have fun at parties!\n\n\nHope to see you in class and dramatically improve your game!!  :)",

Can you see yourself dancing bachata as you dream it? Would that make your life better for you? Give it a try.\n\nThe most important is not that you learn how to do dance. The most exciting is to feel who you become when you dance...\n\nMaybe you are a girl and you have grown with some Walt Disney pictures in your mind. Dreaming about being invited by a charming gentleman for a dance...This prince invites you for a dance...and that is real now...how do you feel the energy?\n\nMaybe you are a boy and dancing is your way to make a difference.

This could be you. Music is playing from your smartphone. People around are watching you. You feel and enjoy the present moment. You are the happiest person with your partner at this moment. Welcome to bachata…\nPs: i experience it in Benidorm in Spain in 2017 with my girl friend. I took her by a sunset, to the beach and we improvised a bachata dance. And we danced like nobody's watching us. Total freedom. People remarked us and enjoy watching us dancing. A pure life memory still in my head...\nFeeling good even working\nImagine a usual day at work. You’re smiling. Your colleagues are asking you why you are feeling so good? And you answer: “Right after work I’m going to attend a Bachata class and then go to a Latin party. What about you?”. “Well, I am going to chill on Netflix, the routine…”. Voilà, there is nothing else left to say. Sometimes during your work week, just even getting the thought of dancing can make you feel good.\nNew mornings\nImagine that the day after a great party, you wake up with a great sensation of feeling good. You still have the great Latino vibes of yesterday’s night in your mind and you just need one thing: to share it with your loved ones, family, friends…\nHave a break, listen to bachata\nEvery time you have a break you listen to some bachata music and discover that you have some favorite ones. The type of music that turns a bad day into a good one.\nA dancing therapy\nWe all have concerns, issues, problems. But, once you start dancing bachata at home or at a party, all the problems are going away. You just think about enjoying the good vibes the dance & music provide you.\n\n\n2-The Problem is that it is often difficult...

As we go, we will look at a series of foundation-level concepts about mastery. You will learn to beautify your planes, rhythm and timing, footwork and turns, and to disassemble and explore the moves so that you can become truly expressive with them. The idea is to shift from knowing moves to being empowered to poi movement, where you will begin to play poi freely.\nYou should be able to go through all the videos in a couple of weeks, but putting the concepts into practice will take months. In fact, to truly achieve \"mastery\" with all these concepts would take years. Fortunately, playing with any of these concepts will immediately begin to impact your poi spinning in positive ways.\nThis course will help you to feel empowered with the poi moves you already know, and it will prepare you to go onwards into intermediate and advanced poi.\n\nOnce finishing this course, you may wish to consider my Advanced Poi Dancing course.",

In this course, I teach you to pole dance while demonstrating moves and combos from Level 1 with voiceover and subtitles in English. Warming up and stretching properly is essential before you begin dancing on the pole. Stretching will increase your flexibility during your workout by loosening up your muscles and tendons. Additionally, the increased blood flow to your muscles will get them ready for your workout.\nTo keep your bones and muscles in top condition, always pay attention to how you sit and stand.\nBody awareness is crucial if you want to get in shape for training. You can make sure you're constantly in the right position if you're conscious of your posture. Better form and posture provide long-term benefits because they not only make you more Pole Fit but also improve blood flow, reduce aches and pains, help you avoid injuries, and improve your overall well-being. Remember to love your body and yourself. You can find me at @ria_vitafit on Instagram if you need anything. Aerial yoga, HooP, Chair Acrobatics, and other skills to learn will be covered in future courses.\nI hope you enjoy honing your pole dancing techniques. Enjoy being a pole dancer!",

Bollywood is an insanely popular style of dance imported from Indian films and are first and foremost fun-focused! Learn two Bollywood dance routines with Angela, then a longer combination routine, and finally a fun cardio-based workout.\nThis program is part of a series of six dance programs for beginner women featuring these styles of dance: Bollywood, Belly Dance, Contemporary Hip Hop, Chair Dance, Burlesque, and Alter Ego (Music Video). Try all of them today!\nBased on the most popular new dances of today, we've put together an exciting dance program that combines fun, fitness, and dancing. Best of all, the program is designed for absolute beginners, so you can take your time learning from the comfort of your own home. The variety of the Beginner Dance For Women program dances will take you everywhere from the zany fun of Bollywood dancing to the sexy, seductive chair dancing routines.\nAnd of course, the program is designed specifically for women. Since this program is ladies first, we go where the boys don't dare - shimmying, flirting, teasing, moving our hips, rolling our bodies, and showing off all our sexiness.\nFor each unique, exciting dance, Angela will teach you two full beginner dance routines. The dance routines will follow the structure of a dance class, except you have the option to go through the dance steps and practices, if you're stuck on any one move, or wish to perfect it.\nThe dance routines are built gradually, learning one or two sets of dance moves (called counts of 8 in dance terminology) at a time, and then doing a practice to the newly-learned moves. Afterwards, another set of dance moves are built on the existing dance moves and practiced until the full routine is learned.\nDon't worry if you don't the moves right away. Angela has plenty of experience teaching beginners, and we've created the dance program with that in mind. The moves have been carefully designed for easy \"body memorization\". We've chosen moves for beginner dancers, BUT if you think you've got it down, we've put in plenty of extras to keep you busy and coming back to the program.\nFinally, we finish with a workout in each style of dance that either focuses on stretching, cardio, or strength!",

And it's not just for balancing acts. If you are not interested in balancing a sword, a tray of candles or a shemadan, resist the temptation to skip this class. These drills will make you a better dancer with more organic and precise isolations, simply because balancing an object on your head forces your whole body to mobilize and perform with more control.\"\n\n\nClass 2 Belly Dance Balancing Drills - percussive moves\n\"Today we continue our balancing drills - we'll cover percussive moves: hipwork and upper body percussive accents.\"\n\n\nClass 3 Orientalist Fantasy Belly Dance Candelabrum / Shemadan Combinations\nThe candelabrum dance tradition emerged in the early 20th century in Egypt, and it’s typically performed at weddings, to zeffa, Egyptian wedding procession music, with a specific beat. However, if you dance at a family party, a corporate event or in a nightclub here in the US or Europe or anywhere outside of the middle east, you may want to go with Western pop music or, if it’s a stage performance, and you want that exotic bellydance flavor, you may choose the route of Orientalist fantasy, and find a piece of music that has an exotic Arabian taste, but it’s just a sylization - it is not taxing the patience of your audience with traditional instruments or rhythms. And that’s what we’ll be doing today - learning candelabrum dance combinations you can use in such a performance.",

But in order to be all that we need to put ourselves first. You can’t serve from an empty vessel, they say. This is so very true!\nThese techniques help develop posture alignment, flexibility, body control; loosen up tight upper and lower back areas. With constant practice, over a period of time, you will feel a boost of sensuality & confidence, and improvement of the overall body image. The stretching exercises given in the module will result in you feeling graceful and light.\n\n\nBelly dance is a translation of the French term danse du ventre (dance of the belly). The name first appeared in 19 century, however the dance itself existed in different forms for thousands of years. It takes its origins in ancient Egyptian land. The dance has accompanied major life events of people from birthdays to funerals. It has been the most primal expression of life, a tool to connect to the body & the world around and live through the various emotions with ease.\n\n\nThere are undeniable health benefits of belly dance for women. Firstly, this dance style works for all ages (my most senior student was 82!). It has a low impact on joints. Secondly, the dance includes isolated movements of different parts of the body which improves lymphatic flow in each area from top to toe.\nThe two main areas of stress in a human body are shoulders and lower back. Our chest and arms are the area we express our emotions with. Unfortunately, a lot of women, for various reasons, are unable to express feelings freely. It results in hunched shoulders and tight chest. Upper body work (shimmies, waves, circles etc.) help to loosen up the stiffness. Lower body movements and shimmies help to release the tension pelvic area and gain a better connection to the sacred power center (underneath the belly)\nMind-body connection is truly powerful! I always say dance can be a dynamic meditation. We will be learning to connect the flowing, staccato and shimmy-like movements with breathing and the music at the same time. It’s a whole body experience. You will find it’s nearly impossible to think of anything else while you are dancing, so it helps to clear the head too!\nI have taught belly dance around the globe and I firmly believe that the value of it for women’s health is enormous. All that is learned in the class is applicable to everyday life. Flexible body - flexible mind. Relaxed rib cage causes expressing emotions more freely, released blockage in the hip area causes more connection to your feminine power center. Belly exercises result in improved digestion and graceful waistline.\nOur posture is at the core of our physical health, youth and blood circulation (especially in the brain area). In this technological century our eyes are glued to the phone screens all the time and vision is not the only thing that suffers unfortunately. It’s also our posture. The shoulders are very often hunched which naturally makes the skin of our face weigh down (hang, if you like) earlier than it’s supposed to be. Posture alignment exercises will be presented throughout the entire course to keep us young, beautiful and radiant.\nPelvic floor muscle exercises included in this course are vital for women’s health. These muscles never get toned during weight lifting, running, swimming, dancing or other fitness activities. However this muscles carry a few very important functions, such as defecation and urination regulation, carrying and delivering babies, holding internal organs, sexual drive, motivation, charisma, stimulation of ovaries (that produce hormones, vital for women’s health) and more. These exercises deserve a few minutes of your time daily.\nBack in 2013 I completed a nearly 400h training as a Thai massage therapist at one of the best massage schools in Thailand. These techniques helped me tremendously throughout my dance journey. I do self massage every night before I go to bed to help relax tired leg muscles to improve the blood circulation in my feet and to have a good night sleep.\nThe course will be concluded with Dr. Toshiki Fukutsudzi’s towel roll stretches which helps the spine to become straight, gets the body in shape and places the internal organs in the most favorable position for them.\nDisclaimer: if you have any injuries, serious health conditions  or recovering from an operation please consult your doctor before taking the course. Your health is #1 priority.\nYou were born a woman for a reason. We are naturally very powerful beings. Since the beginning of time women have had the capacity to connect to higher forces and preserve the unity of people and nature. This connection to nature and body awareness can develop through belly dance. We are the bearers of life. The longer we remain connected to our inner feminine source, the brighter our life is, the more beautiful we feel and the longer we live.\nI’m excited to share my knowledge with you and my biggest wish is your longevity, beauty, attractiveness and ability to live a joyful and fulfilled life!\nLet’s start.",

How softly can we get down on the floor? How can you avoid hurting yourself when you reach the floor?).I teach certain fixed techniques that contribute to muscle development, stretch the body and improve coordination.\nThere are also elements/methods of improvisation in the courses. In these, you can experience yourself within flexible boundaries.

You need to face your challenges within the framework of movement. Why would we miss any opportunity when we can dance, be ourselves, find a form of expression?

      "description": "Acharuli or Adjarian dance is a totally fascinating performing art that originated in Southern Georgia (South of the Caucasian mountains). The charming energy of this Caucasian dance makes a direct connection with the powerful nature of ancient mountains and with the joyful vibration of the Black sea coast.\nGeorgian dance is a pure celebration of natural life and is dedicated to the abundance which comes through the Sun. If you haven’t heard the shining rhythmical melodies of Acharuli, check it out now! They will make you dance immediately!\nIn the Acharuli dance course, you will learn basic movements of this style which are simple enough to catch them in a short time and be ready to make your first Caucasian dance improvisation. Many years of active performing have shown me how the watching audience is sensitive to Georgian dances and to the Acharuli style especially.\nMy name is Alima Chichibabina. I am a professional choreographer and a human physiologist. I have been dancing and teaching Caucasian and Middle Asian dances for the last 10 years. In my instructor practice were many students of adult and kids ages, so I know how to explain complicated body coordination in a simple way.\nThe most common feedback from my offline adult students was that they felt inner-growing Feminine energy during dancing.\nI definitely can say that this type of plasticity and body language is a unique method to develop self-esteem and a very delicate sensuality for any contemporary woman.\nAll Caucasian female dances are about searching for our inner Queen through motion.\nIf you haven't seen Caucasian dances before I will briefly explain that they are still keeping the wisdom of nature in a very pure way. Male and female parties are extremely different and they are manifestations of the Sun and the Moon. Or in animalistic meaning, they are embodiments of the Eagle and the Swan Spirits. It means that through any female Caucasian dance you can directly invocate inside your being very powerful patterns of the Woman essence.\nAll you need to start is just to be ready to meet with the Beauty which is waiting inside you to flourish through the dance. Focus on your intention, some patience, positive mood, and let us start!",

      "description": "Do you currently dance a certain style but feel tired or bored with the monotony of steps and moves you take? Or maybe you have always wanted to learn how to partner dance, but have been overwhelmed with counting steps or memorizing complicated moves?\nI believe you can feel ease, comfort, and filled with variety within your partner dance today—you do not have to go through months or years of lessons to be a fluid, fluent dancer. By learning more about your body, how you relate to your environment, and the expansive array of human contact points possible beyond touch, you will gain a new awareness of how to lead, follow, and have a conversational dance flow. The concept of flow in this course is used to describe the practice of dancing with a steady stream of mindfulness and without prescribed patterns, steps, moves, or specified partner roles.\nWhen you gift someone your focused attention and presence, your partnership is filled with freedom and exhilaration. Exploring the rapture of conscious human connection liberates you from the historical, gender-based social roles of command and compliance. Leading and following become actions that anyone can take at any time during a dance together—not roles that define who you are or what you can do.\nWith this mindset of leading and following being actions rather than roles, coupled movement will intuitively flow in celebration of the shared moment—neither partner will have to remember a single step or try to fit into a particular box. Exploring the universal language of dance allows you to listen and respond to partners within an authentic, interpersonal dialog. When you acutely tune into your comprehensive portfolio of human senses, you find insight into your emotions, desires, primal needs, and limitless human connection potential.\nMany of the concepts that you will discover in this course can be applied far beyond the dance floor into your everyday family and social lives. Connecting with a partner through movement opens up new possibilities for how you can relate and interact within your community. You will gain essential skills to lead with empowerment, follow with greater attention to detail, and switch actions with ease. You will explore a rainbow of creative movement tools with which to broaden your physical musicality. You will discover both solo and partner dance expressions while moving free of strict stylistic rules and self-judgment.\nWe will spend about four hours together over 25 lessons. You will also have the opportunity during the course to download a copy of my book, Lead Follow Flow, to help expand your dance experience. On top of that, you'll have two opportunities to remotely interact with me one-on-one to get the most personalized online course possible. I believe you will dance away from this experience with the ability to feel confident and at ease in any social setting. Shall we dance?",

The performance also involves dressing up in the traditional Bharatanatyam attire, wearing \"Salangai\" - i.e. the Bharatanatyam Anklets.\nOver the lessons in this course, we will embark on a journey towards \"Salangai Poojai\", where we will learn:\nPrepping our body for the style of Bharatanatyam: Basic steps to build the Rhythm and Coordination in the body\nParaval Adavu\nKuthitha MettAdavu\nHasta Mudras or Hand movements\nChoreography 1: A Classical Dance piece on the Goddess of Wisdom - Saraswati Vandana!\nChoreography 1: Fusion of Bharatanatyam with western beats!\nChoreography 2: A Classical Prayer dance on Lord Ganesha!\n\n\nBy the end of this course (within a few weeks), you will be able to learn and skillfully perform 3 beautiful Bharatanatyam choreographies!

I feel like I have improved so much more with these online courses than I ever did trying to learn bachata during bachata parties... Now I know, learn hard (online), dance hard (at parties) :D\" - Chris\n\n\nHello,\n\n\nHow are you?\n\n\nThis is Mohamed. I am super happy to share my Bachata passion with you and help you get your personal results.\n\n\n\"Dance first. Think later. It's the natural order.\" - Samuel Beckett.\n\n\nThis course is the natural continuity of our previous courses: you are between the class for beginners & advanced dancers, we deliver on UDEMY (see our classes directory on Udemy).\nThis new course you are about to start, created in 2020, will help you to include new stylish combinations & Sharing a feeling for each combination learnt ! You will shine on the Dance Floor ! Hence the name: \"20 bachata Steps for Intermediate: Technique  Feeling\".\n\n\n\"Dance first. Think later. It's the natural order.\" - Samuel Beckett.\n\n\n1-Imagine\n\n\nMaybe, you love Bachata & Social Dancing...\nMaybe you are in love for Bachata dance & music...\n\nMaybe you are well integrated in a very nice local & international dance community...\n\nMaybe you invest time, money to be the dancer you secretly dream to become...\n\nMaybe what you prefer the most is to social dancing during some nights...\n\nMaybe this is for you the occasion to meet known and new friends...\n\nMaybe this is the occasion for you to put away the daily problems...\n\nMaybe, social dancing is for you a dance therapy, you simply feel good when you are on the dance floor...\n\nMaybe you like when you dance and the partner enjoy dancing with you...\n\nMaybe you like when you can share a good connection during the dance with your partner...\n\n\n2-But, you are Frustrated because...\n\n\nYou have a big directory of steps in your smartphone but 80% are hardly reproducible during your bachata nights...\n\nMaybe the steps are wonderful but more accessible for artists, because taught by artists...\n\nMaybe most of the steps you have learnt require too much training and time and you do not have enough time ...\n\nMaybe you are bored about just learning technique, technique, technique.\n\nMaybe, your ambition is to enjoy more during the nights without thinking exclusively about how to follow that technique or to lead that technique....\n\nMaybe the girls you are dancing with are bored because you just repeat the same 4 or 5 steps during every dance whatever the music...\n\nMaybe you & the girl are bored in the social dancing...when it should be a place to fully enjoy...\n\nMaybe you experienced it, you invite a partner and during the first 2min you do your best and then nothing, you lack of inspiration because you have already placed all your technique. And the end of the dance is like a dead bachata dance...\n\nMaybe some of your bachata Nights are like this? Or a moment in your dance night it is really like this! A Basic routine...\n\nYour dance is the same as the previous one...\n\nYour party is the same as the previous one...\n\nMaybe you want to invest your time to work on the emotional part of the dance to share it with your partner...\n\nMaybe you are watching some other dancers with envy. Because they have something more than the technique...Like the energy, the feeling they put into the dance. The diversity of their bachata style etc...\n\n\n3-What would be your social dance experience if...\n\n\nYou learnt cool moves from a variety of bachata styles?\nYou learnt how to interpret the steps you are learning?\nYou combined these steps with a specific emotion?\nThe girl learnt how to follow a new urban bachata step?\nThe boy learnt how to lead this new urban bachata step?\nBehind the step, there is a story: the story to \"set the fire on dance floor\"?\nBoth of the dancers, boy & girl, shared this story together\nIt increased the level of connection...?\nShe remembered you...?\nHe remembered you...?\nThe people around remembered you...?\nThey were watching you...?\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you were not (just) dancing anymore...\n\nYou were more...\n\nYou were one of these rare Leaders or Followers who created an experience on the dance floor...\n\n\nThat is why we created this special course...\n\n\n4-The concept is ...\n\nBefore going to a Latino party, learn a short combination of 3 steps.\n\nEasy to memorize & Adapted for social dance only!\n\nEvery combo tells a story.\n\n\n5-The result is...\n\nBring some new cool moves & a story on a dance floor with you.\n\nYou are not just a dancer, you are an experience maker!\n\n\n6-OUR Method of Teaching :\n\n\nFor each class, we teach:\nHow to lead for the boy?\nHow to follow for the girl?\nWhen to add the emotional part ?\nPs! No choreography, only lead & follow via signal !\n\n\n7-The Method of Learning\nTake a partner\nWatch us!\nGet your role as a leader or follower!\nDo it with us without music!\nDo it with us with music adding technique & emotional part.\nDo it alone personally to make it before the party.\nMake it during the party & Enjoy...\n8-Structure of each class\nWe introduce you the course.\nWe do the course with you\nWe provide you some extra bachata tips at the end of each class.\n\n\nSO, Get Excited ... !\n\n\nWhat our students say about our Online Bachata Classes :\n\n\n· \" You are a fantastic teacher. Very patient and kind! \" Kneox26 (USA)\n· 'Hi Mohamed, I like the kindness that shines from you and the global philosophy/attitude when dancing with your partner.

I have no doubt your channel will be a success with time , perseverance is key ;-) Your dance partner also rocks, you together makes an excellent combination ! '' -Jim (New Zealand)\n· « The training is really good. There is the part how to dance & the mindset what is also important for me” -Mimi (France)\n· « I really like it. We dance at home plugging the classes in our TV. The lessons are very accessible for us beginner and we are progressing faster than we thought because it is well explained what we need to do: follower, leader of the dance.

The music is called Adarabuka, composed by Khader Ahmad.\nPart three is your assessment. This assessment is optional. You will be offered to learn, practice and record yourself doing Adarabuka choreography.\n\n\nThe techniques learnt in this course are focused on improving the hip range of motion, joint flexibility, body control & isolations. Shimmies and dynamic stretches are a great way to loosen up tight hips and to create more energy in the area.\n\n\nThe Adarabuka choreography can be learned and performed solo or a group number. This choreography would work for various occasions whether it’s a belly dance student hafla or a professional performance at a large celebration.\n\n\nI picked this music because it’s very dynamic and energizing with a unique drum beat. Everytime I perform this choreo I find people have a hard time staying seated! Although the music is fast paced and dynamic it has some slower sections with takasim & soft melody. Some of these sections can be improvised if desired, but keep in mind: the best improvisation - is a well prepared improvisation!\n\n\nPlease do not hesitate contacting me if you have any questions or suggestions. Have loads of fun while learning!",

Through learning this dance, you will learn three essential components of Classical Japanese Dance technique: suriashi sliding steps, eye and chin movements, and how to use the sensu. The choreography utilizes techniques introduced in the courses, \"Basic technique\" and \"Using the sensu,\" so taking all these courses together will give you a solid foundation.\nThis dance is also useful for intermediate and advanced learners to master finer nuances of expression in Classical Japanese Dance.\nThe song Sakura Sakura is a well-known traditional tune originally composed for the koto (a large, rounded wooden instrument with 13 strings) in the mid-nineteenth century. It is probably one of the best known melodies of Japan.\nThis course introduces three variations of the dance: (1) the basic version using a sensu, (2) the basic version using a cherry blossom branch, and (3) the advanced longer version using two sensu. Start with the basic version with a sensu, and once you have mastered it, experiment with other variations.\nYou will also find information on recommended costumes, where to buy sensu, and where to find the music in the resources section at the end of the course.",

And that's what this course is about.\nIf you've ever wanted to move like a professional - this is the course for you.\n=== In this course you're going to learn\n->> How to lead the foot (like the pros do it)\nIt's a small thing, and utterly \"invisible\" to the untrained eye.

      "description": "'Rain Dance' telecourse teaches you to embrace the rain through dance and express your emotions in the style of Bollywood. The choreography incorporates the Bollywood folk style. Music is “Baruso Re” from the Bollywood film “Guru” (Hindi).\n\n\nIn India, eight classical dances and thousands of Indian folk dances have remained relatively unchanged from ancient times until today. Thanks to the spirited people who recognized the importance of their traditions, they've been passed down and preserved from generation to generation.\nThe word “Bollywood” is a combination of two words: “Bombay” (the city now called Mumbai) and “Hollywood.” This form of dance emerged as Western hip-hop and Eastern folk dances began to influence Indian traditional dance and music. Bollywood has become so popular that it’s now a full-blown entertainment industry, drawing from the language and traditions of many different states in India.\nRepresenting the many vibrant colors, expressions, and emotions of Indian culture, Bollywood dance is fun and energetic. So, as you can imagine… it’s a great workout!\n\n\nBollywood dance course…\nThis Bollywood dance course introduces you to some of the more prominent forms of the expression. Learning new steps can be challenging, so we take care to break them all down, making learning comfortable for all ages and abilities.\nWe want you to enjoy the process more than focus on performance. Sure, you’ll learn new dance movements, but we want you to love the learning itself as you broaden your perspective on another culture and your own life around you. We think you’ll find these classes to be a wonderful tool for improving your confidence, renewing your enthusiasm for life, and combatting stress, anxiety, and depression.\nThese dances should come from the heart, so it’s not about competition. It’s about exploring your potential, expressing yourself with joy, and having fun while getting fit!\n\n\nThese classes are for anyone…\nNo matter your age, gender, or fitness level, you can do Bollywood dance!\nBut be aware that classically feminine qualities like receptivity, sensitivity to life, nurturing, listening, kindness, beauty, exuberance, love, care, compassion, and motherliness are key themes expressed in our Bollywood dance courses.",

      "description": "Hi! I’m Darren from NBC's World of Dance crew the Kinjaz and I will be your online dance teacher.\n\nNot too long ago I was a shy introverted kid, who you would probably not even notice was in the room, who didn’t know how to dance… but flash forward to today, I am now dancing, performing, and teaching for hundreds, of thousands of people around the world. I have had the great fortune to dance, train, and perform with some amazing dance companies such as the Kinjaz, Culture Shock Los Angeles, and Kaba Modern and it is my goal to spread all of the knowledge and experience I have uncovered through my 18 years in the Hip Hop industry to new dancers searching to get started[...]\n\n\nNew Dancer Question\nThe question I get asked the most by new dancers is how do I get better? My immediate answer is, that you need to figure out how to be comfortable dancing in front of people or you won’t keep pursuing dance and therefore never get better. Every great dancer knows that to become comfortable dancing in front of people hinges on these 3 things:\nFirst is the knowledge of basic fundamental steps and how to execute them with good technique...\nSecond is your ability to understand basic rhythm in music and how to move on beat to it…\nAnd finally the amount of confidence you have in YOURSELF to get out there and show off what you got\nSo with this in mind…\nLogic would tell us that the greater knowledge you have of basic techniques, and the greater understanding you have of music, and the greater confidence you have…\nThe greater dancer you will be… and therein lies the problem because most of the dance classes you have taken (or thought about taking) actually skip over this stuff making it difficult for you to build the confidence you need to become better.\n\n\nThe All To Common Class Reality\nThink about it…\nHave you ever been in a class struggling to learn a move/combination they are teaching while self consciously feeling embarrassed thinking that everyone is seeing you struggle. Maybe somehow you managed to copy a move but just can’t put your finger on why you don’t look the same as the instructor and when the music comes on you feel like everyone else knows some secret code to stay on beat and somehow you are left out. This is unfortunately an all to common reality for new dancers. The reason this happens is because most classes fail to break down basic movements to it’s simplest form in order for you to understand them. This could be because…\nThe skill level of dancers is different in most classes…\nThere are too many people in the class for the instructor to really focus on you…\nSadly some amazing dancers just don’t know how to teach which leaves you both lost and confused as to why you don’t look like them\nYou can agree that this is not how you are going to get better. You need someone who can patiently breakdown a move to it’s simplest core so you can understand it no matter how long it takes. Someone who can help you understand the music and get you on beat. Someone who teaches you the basics and then gradually guides you to more advanced movements/combinations. I want to be that person for you and I have great news…\nI have created a course that will do all of this for you. Better yet, when you enroll in this course, I will be able to improve your dancing whenever and wherever you want online.\n\n\nWhy Take An Online Course\nNow, you might be thinking why would you take a course online to learn how to dance? Well, I’m glad you asked. The reason why I created an online course is that quite frankly, you and I can agree that sometimes there are just no dance studios, classes, or instructors near you who provide the type of dance training you need to get better. Sure, you can travel far and wide to find the classes and teachers you need. They are out there, but this becomes very expensive and time-consuming.\nSure…\nYou could turn to other online tutorials that you can find on YouTube. However, everyone has seen those tutorials that...\nAre likely in no logical order for you to progress from basic to more advance movements (Sorry, you can’t run before you know how to walk)\nDon’t break the move/combo down simply enough for you to understand it\nNever show you how to execute the move/combo to music\nTeach the move incorrectly leading you to practice bad technique and risk getting injured (and worse waste your time)\nSadly, There is no way I could physically reach everyone who needs this course in person and to be honest it would cost a HUGE amount of money to take the amount of private lessons needed with me to learn all of the advanced strategies, tips and techniques I show you in this course.\nThat is why I have created this online course to allow people from around the world access to an experienced teacher who wants to help them every step of the way.\n\n\nThe Benefits Of An Online Course\nSo how will you learn and benefit from the course being online? I created a structured course curriculum that will guide you by the hand through basic fundamental movements in a progressive order (basic to advanced movements) just as if we were having a private, one on one lesson together. Everyone knows that it is difficult to learn anything when you are first introduced to it. The beauty of having this course is that...\nYou can learn and master movements at your own pace by returning to any movement lesson as many times as you need\nYou can pick up on the small but important details you probably would have missed in a\nclass by being able to skip around each lesson\nYou can truly dance like no one is watching you since you can access the course whenever and wherever you want\nEvery dancer knows that it is easier to dance when no one is there. You can feel stress-free learning new moves/combinations and build up your confidence to show others whenever you are ready to from the comfort of your home\nThat’s why you need my course. The amount of information that I have gathered and will teach you will save you all that time, money and wasted effort you will spend trying to learn from someone who is not qualified or doesn’t understand how to teach you.\n\n\nLet Me Show You What You Are Getting\nOver the past 18 years, I have cultivated the knowledge and experience of teaching dancers of all different kinds of backgrounds and skill levels how to dance. I’ve documented what teaching methods work and what methods are just flat out ineffective and created a simple, easy to follow course curriculum that you can easily learn from and apply immediately to your dancing\nThere are 4 sections that cover the 4 main grooves you must know to learn Hip Hop Dance. In each section, you will learn and be guided through every detail on how to execute one of the 4 grooves with perfect technique whether you are standing still or moving around. As an extra bonus, I have provided a number of drills and combos so you can feel completely confident utilizing each move before taking on the next, more advanced lesson. Finally, I give you a blueprint on how to combine all of your new movements that you have mastered into a plug and play template to get you started right away.\n\n\n\nStart Improving Right Now\nFor a one on one private training session that provides you with over 4 hours of concepts, strategies and technique shown in this course, not including the extra hours you gain by being able to rewatch the course as many times as you want, I would normally charge a minimum of $400 (and that’s if we could even get through all this great information in 4 one hour sessions)\nBut today, I’d like to give you the course for [$49.99] just for taking a look at my brand new course. That’s right, I am offering to show you the path to reaching your Hip Hop dancing goals quickly, safely, and efficiently by providing you new movements, drills, exercises ad warm ups to get you to your goal faster for less than the price of one 30min private lesson with me.\nThis course is offered at this price for a limited time only. As I continue to update the course and add more lessons, I will have no choice but to raise the price. This course is already priced far below what it is worth, so enroll in the course now and receive the added benefit of having access to all future lessons without having to pay the increased price.\nNaturally, I’m sure you have some hesitation. I know when I buy stuff, especially something from the web where I can’t see it, feel it, or toy with it, I feel like I am taking a bit of a risk. So here is my guarantee to you. Enroll in this course risk free and If within 30 days of your enrollment you don’t agree that this course is helping you become a better dancer by learning correct technique and execution of movements to music and advanced concepts and strategies then Udemy offers a full refund of your purchase price.\n\n\nHere’s The Deal:\nThis is a killer bargain. What you get in this course is worth literally hundreds of dollars not just in lesson fees but in all the extra cash you will save by not needing to travel to some class that is getting you nowhere. The price of this course will only continue to increase once more lessons are added so when you enroll now for [$49.99] you will have lifetime access to the course and all of the future lessons when they are added and not have to pay a cent more. Plus you do all of this risk free because you are covered by a 30 day full refund if you don’t like the course. I am in the position to help you at this point. If you read this far here’s what you need to do for me to actually help you make this real in your life.\n\n\nHere’s What You Need To Do Now:\nFirst I want you to get your wallet and enroll in this course (remember you are under no obligation to keep this and if you want a refund within the first 30 days of enrolling for any reason at all you will get it immediately and we will still be friends). Here’s what’s going to happen next. You will have instant access to the course and I want you to browse through the entire course and decide if this is for you (which I know it will be or else I wouldn’t have wasted your time and made you read this far) to prove to yourself that you have made the right decision because I know what it’s like to be in a position wondering what’s going to happen. Then… enjoy the course and feel free to ask me any questions along the way. See you inside.\n\n\n-Darren\nP.s. As you know, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result. Is that what you are doing? Aren’t you tired of waiting to learn how to Hip Hop dance? Tired of practicing and getting no where? I want to help you out but you need to take action. Enroll in the course now.\nP.p.s. Remember, I have spent 18 years teaching, correcting, and guiding hundreds of dancers of all skill levels how to master their movements. I am offering to show you the path to reaching your Hip Hop dance goals quickly, safely, and efficiently by providing you new movements, drills, exercises, and warm-ups to get you to your goal faster for less than the price of one 30min private lesson. On top of that, you can’t possibly lose because of Udemy’s 30 day money back guarantee so what are you waiting for. Enroll in the course now before the price increases",

      "description": "This Intermediate level course will take the student from the basic principles and concepts found in the Udemy Beginner level course, and will guide them through the next step in the evolutionary process of Shifting Roots – the Alegado Movement Language.\n\nThe main characteristics of each Shifting Roots class are the arms and hands working on top of a fluid and shifting pelvis. In the Beginner level class, the arms and the hands work symmetrically. In the Intermediate level, these same basic arm and hand gestures are taken to another level by applying the use of canon, whereby, one arm and hand will start, followed by the second.\n\nThe use of canon in the arms creates a physical cascading effect in the entire body. The separate timing of each arm movement, initiates different responses from the rest of the body.\n\nThis individual timing takes the body into a more three dimensional exploration of space which, in turn, requires a more advanced response from the foundation (the plié).\n\nIn the Beginner level course, the first exercise standing, happens within a relative stationary position in space. In the Intermediate level course, the use of canon of the arms and its resulting three dimensional exploration of space, takes the student into a study not limited to frontal movement. The use of canon in the arms initiates a wider scope of movement which takes the student into a 360 degree exploration of their bodies moving through space.\n\nThis new spectrum of movement possibilities creates a greater need for a more sensitive physical response to the body in motion yet, it must be said, this new awareness can best be applied by, first, going through the Beginner level course. In doing so, the body will be better equipped to deal with the new information coming to it from the Intermediate level.",

      "description": "Belly dance is a fascinating art form that started in the Middle East, but today it is practiced all across the globe by people of all shapes, sizes and ages.\nThrough belly dance you can train muscles that no other activity can reach, strengthen your core, develop flexibility and achieve graceful and fluid body coordination. Moreover, belly dance will give you benefits beyond just physical ones, such as a boost in self-confidence, reconnecting your mind with your body and practicing self-love and self-care.\nMy name is Iana Komarnytska. I came to my first belly dance class 16 years ago, and I had no idea it would change my life so much. Today I’m a full-time award winning professional dancer and choreographer, and I have been teaching and performing belly dance in many countries around the world.\nI created this course with one thought in my mind: to create the resource I wish I had when I was starting my belly dance journey! The result is a complete belly dance guide for beginners, with over 100 video tutorials teaching you step-by-step all basic movements (shimmies, belly rolls, circles, undulations and more), in more than 14 hours of dance practice, lectures, drills and combinations.\nThis course is ideal for those who never had any experience in belly dance, or even dance in general, as well as for those who may have already began their belly dance journey and want to take their skills to the next level with solid foundations.\nI designed this course in a simple manner that you can adapt to your needs, whether you have only 15 mins or several hours to practice. Each section combines a related group of movements with a detailed explanation of each one, and a summary dance combination to practice new skills. You will also get an overview of the most important rhythms, folklore styles, principles of dancing with veil, and dozens of dance combinations for polishing your technique.\nOur final sections consist of dance practice to four different types of belly dance songs, and learning a complete belly dance routine to an exciting drum solo music. In addition, you will find several bonus sections with lectures about topics related to belly dance such as costumes, props, music, and the cultural environment of this dance, as well as resources to continue your belly dance learning.\nBy the end of the course you will be able not only to perform all major belly dance moves such as hip drops, undulations, figure 8, and maya, but also layer them on top of different shimmies, perform to specific rhythms, and even to incorporate some props into your dance.\nAll you need to begin is to be interested in exploring the beauty of dance, transforming your body and spirit with a fun physical activity, and learning to appreciate and love yourself.\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Jump in and start belly dancing today.",

As you know veil moves fall into 2 main groups - veil tricks, really sophisticated ways to maneuver your veil for spectacular effects, and simpler moves that accompany travel steps, turns, sways, arabesques and so on. We'll use some tricks, and a lot of veil flares, body frames, some high-drama moves and so on. We'll stay with fairly simple vocabulary, focusing on developing autopiot mode with the veil - so that no matter what you do, you feel confident about your veil moves, not panicking if the veil is not behaving, staying with clean technique and moderate pace. Many veil performances lack hipwork altogether, because veil dance is all about full and upper body moves and angles, about travel steps and turns. But I feel we should always try to squeeze some hipwork into our veil routines, just so they look a bit more exotic and bellydancey.\"\n\n\nWe'll also learn switching between Oriental music sections with a distinctive melody line great for dramatic high-impact veilwork, to filling sections of instrumental improvisations with steps and moves helping to recover from potential mishaps, prepare for the next round, and interact with our audience. We'll cover a few flashy veil tricks from the classic American Cabaret style veilwork repertoire.",

Try all of them today!\nBased on the most popular new dances of today, we've put together an exciting dance program that combines fun, fitness, and dancing. Best of all, the program is designed for absolute beginners, so you can take your time learning from the comfort of your own home. The variety of the Beginner Dance For Women program dances will take you everywhere from the zany fun of Bollywood dancing to the sexy, seductive chair dancing routines.\nAnd of course, the program is designed specifically for women. Since this program is ladies first, we go where the boys don't dare - shimmying, flirting, teasing, moving our hips, rolling our bodies, and showing off all our sexiness.\nFor each unique, exciting dance, Angela will teach you two full beginner dance routines. The dance routines will follow the structure of a dance class, except you have the option to go through the dance steps and practices, if you're stuck on any one move, or wish to perfect it.\nThe dance routines are built gradually, learning one or two sets of dance moves (called counts of 8 in dance terminology) at a time, and then doing a practice to the newly-learned moves. Afterwards, another set of dance moves are built on the existing dance moves and practiced until the full routine is learned.\nDon't worry if you don't the moves right away. Angela has plenty of experience teaching beginners, and we've created the dance program with that in mind. The moves have been carefully designed for easy \"body memorization\". We've chosen moves for beginner dancers, BUT if you think you've got it down, we've put in plenty of extras to keep you busy and coming back to the program.\nFinally, we finish with a workout in each style of dance that either focuses on stretching, cardio, or strength.",

      "description": "Introducing SHINES BUNDLES - A NEW TEACHING METHODOLOGY / CONCEPT to Teach & Learn SALSA SHINES & FOOTWORK.\n\nWait No More and learn an amazingly effective method of learning SALSA SHINES & FOOTWORK so that you can remember, recall & recreate all the SHINES that you learn when you hit the Salsa Social Dancing floor.\n\n\nWhat do we mean by Shines & Footwork? Why do we need these? What are the benefits, advantages and takeaways from Shines/Footwork?\nSolo Dancing or Shines & Footwork, are well-worth learning & is helpful for many reasons in Partner dance styles. 'Shines' are usually referred to patterns, steps & footwork beyond just the basic steps. 'Footwork' is generally means any kind of Footwork including basic steps & Shines. Learning basics is one thing, but footwork & shines, surprisingly is an extremely important factor in learning partner-work & improving your whole self dance in general. This applies to all partner dance styles, including Salsa, Mambo, Cha Cha, Bachata & yes even Kizomba.\n\n\nAdvantages: Dancers who spend allot of time on shines or footwork have quite a few advantages; they can have a more fun with social dancing because they have more tools in their tool kit. They can break away from their dance partner and freestyle with shines they have learnt and even create new ones of the fly. This allows them to express in ways that many don’t. It you are confident enough to dance without the rules of partner work, allow your partner to express themselves in new ways, and generally increase the variety in your movements. Their body-movement is better, they can turn quicker when executing turn patterns that required them to turn, 'male or female'. They look better because of their own personal style, fluidity of movement, body movement, styling, musical interpretation and their technique, timing and speed. While social dancing it also adds more variety to the dance and there are sections in the music that can require solo dancing.\n\n\nBenefits from Shines & Footwork: Timing, Musicality, Control, Expression, Foot speed, Weight shifting & Transfer, Foot placement, Styling, Flavor, Fluidity, Posture, Mastering basic steps, Body position & angles, Acceleration & deceleration, Directions Changes, Sharp vs Smooth movements, Move more easily, Body Movement, Muscle memory, Grounding & Floor Pressure, Solo dance technique, Turns, Pivots & Spins, Balance, Confidence, Learning Routines Faster and.....Finally having fun!\nMost of these benefits above, you can’t learn from partner-work alone and only benefit your dancing a whole.\n\nYou do need a good chunk of above such as body movement, speed, styling, flavor, Fluidity, etc. Once you make these building blocks muscle memory, through practice and repetition, your dancing will grow massively to the point you can express in a way that relates to the music, known as musicality.\n\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of beginners & unexperienced dancers, or not well trained ones, tend to dismiss shines and think that they are a waste of time. They will never be used and should be for performing only! They also may believe that learning partner-work should be the main focus of on learning to dance. This just shows a lack of understanding of these dance styles. You actually need both!\n\n\nSo in a nutshell, if you want to be a great partner-work dancer or even a well balanced dancer, you really do need shines & footwork!\n\n\nNow, Once you have read the above details about SALSA SHINES & FOOTWORK, Do you wish to learn these the right way, in extremely detailed manner, step by step? Or to improve your Salsa Body Movements / Language & Musicality? Did you always want to make your Shines, Turn patterns, Partner Work look much more smoother, richer, fluid, graceful, attractive & inspiring to people who are looking at you while you dance in Salsa Socials or in stage performances?\n\n\nDo you feel you have been dancing Salsa for a while, have been taking lessons, doing shines and partner-work classes, attending workshops & Latin Dance festival but still you feel that there is something missing and your dancing is not as smooth, technically correct or attractive as much as you want it to be?

This course is designed for beginners and will take you from no knowledge to dancing to Irish music in no time at all!

Progress at your own pace.\nThis introduction course covers some very basic steps, then beginner level 1 steps and then beginner level 2 steps. Hopefully even if you are a professional dancer you can still learn something from this course. When appropriate, notes on technique are given but it is understood that is aspirational and not a requirement!\nLearning Irish dance can help with balance, strength, and agility. No special requirements only wear something comfortable that you are able to move your legs in. As for shoes, socks, tennis shoes or bare feet are acceptable as well as any type of soft dance shoe.\nTake a deep breath and give this a shot!

Each movement is broken down into incremental lectures that build upon the one previous. Before long you will be dancing along to the music.\nSometimes called the Hard Jig, Treble Jig, or Double Jig - all mean the same thing!\nHard shoe is the percussive side of Irish Dance - For the more lyrical/balletic side please see the Reel, Light Jig, Single Jig and Slip Jig. The hard shoe is where we get to make some NOISE!\nAs with most Irish Dance steps - the right leg of the step is taught first. The movements are broken down so that they can be easily mastered. The left leg of the first step is then taught. We then put both sides of the one step together before moving on to the next step.\nThe second step follows a similar pattern, but the pace is a little quicker as there are moves that have already been learnt. Same idea though, right leg first then the left side and then both together.\nFinally both steps are put together and danced.\nRepetitions build throughout the course - starting with no music, then very slow music and gradually picking up the pace to traditional speed music that is danced to at competition.\nFeel free to take as much time as is needed to master each part of the step before moving on. Repetition is key to retaining the knowledge so rewatch sections and follow along until it makes sense.",

Voilà, there is nothing else left to say. Sometimes during your work week, just even getting the thought of dancing can make you feel good.\nNew mornings\nImagine that the day after a great party, you wake up with a great sensation of feeling good. You still have the great Latino vibes of yesterday’s night in your mind and you just need one thing: to share it with your loved ones, family, friends…\nHave a break, listen to bachata\nEvery time you have a break you listen to some bachata music and discover that you have some favorite ones. The type of music that turns a bad day into a good one.\nA dancing therapy\nWe all have concerns, issues, problems.

This is especially true of Street Dance Styles.\nYou will understand the basic structure of Grooves, and be able to add these to your movement vocabulary.\nIf you have never danced before and don't know where to start, this will be a perfect introduction to help you understand the basics so you can get to dancing right away. If you have danced before, this may be a refresher, and may also help you find ways to branch out and expand your dance vocabulary to other styles of movement.",

These are the elements of expressivity, all here for you to add-to or layer-on your dance steps to infuse them with meaning and emotional color, make them evocative, and tell a story. You will quickly find yourself stringing poses and gestures together to transform separate elements into the body language phrases that make bellydance speak.\n\n\nThe Movement Catalog Series is not traditional dance instruction. Rather, this program is like an interactive dictionary where you can look up demonstrations of specific dance elements. Each element is displayed with an accompanying commentary. The program is 'open level,' appropriate for anyone who is creating choreography.\n\n\nWhen you are working on a choreography with The Body Language of Belly Dance on your screen, you will find you have a ready source of moves and inspiration. It is also helpful as a learning tool in that it provides an entire system of moves - not just the few select steps that can be offered in a class or the typical instructional video.\n\n\nThe first section of The Body Language of Belly Dance catalog arranges a collection of dance body language phrases by theme and emotion: Spiritual experience...majesty...sensual goddess... drama and flirtation...compassion...ritual...dream...inspiration...mystery, and other archetypes: A dictionary of emotional flavors. If you are seeking to infuse your dance with meaning and amplify its emotional expressivity, the pose and gesture combinations in this section will help you unlock the story-telling potential in your dance without sacrificing dance in favor of pantomime.\n\n\nThe next section is a collection of arm trajectories - including poses that derive from them, and steps that can be embellished with these arm patterns.\n\n\nThe Trajectories into Phrases section presents elements that turn arm patterns into gestures, and poses into phrases: Entering and exiting poses, preparation and resolution, how to achieve subtle changes of emotional color and high-contrast effects.\n\n\nThe Accents & Angles section explores the role of body, head, and face angles, wrist circles, flips and infinity loops, an array of weight shift variations, turns, and accents, such as head turn, head toss, chest lift, and torso drop, featuring the expressive potential of these elements to form evocative, meaningful dance body language phrases.",

In each class you’ll have a great balance of easy step-by-step instructions and practice time, plus some cool challenges thrown in. In only three sessions we’ll take you into the world of jazz, giving you everything you need to move and groove along to amazing swinging tunes!\nYou’ll learn some important jazz steps, as well as the fundamental techniques behind them.

      "description": "Introducing SHINES BUNDLES - A NEW TEACHING METHODOLOGY / CONCEPT to Teach & Learn SALSA SHINES & FOOTWORK.\n\nWait No More and learn an amazingly effective method of learning SALSA SHINES & FOOTWORK so that you can remember, recall & recreate all the SHINES that you learn when you hit the Salsa Social Dancing floor.\n\n\nWhat do we mean by Shines & Footwork? Why do we need these? What are the benefits, advantages and takeaways from Shines/Footwork?\nSolo Dancing or Shines & Footwork, are well-worth learning & is helpful for many reasons in Partner dance styles. 'Shines' are usually referred to patterns, steps & footwork beyond just the basic steps. 'Footwork' is generally means any kind of Footwork including basic steps & Shines. Learning basics is one thing, but footwork & shines, surprisingly is an extremely important factor in learning partner-work & improving your whole self dance in general. This applies to all partner dance styles, including Salsa, Mambo, Cha Cha, Bachata & yes even Kizomba.\n\n\nAdvantages: Dancers who spend allot of time on shines or footwork have quite a few advantages; they can have a more fun with social dancing because they have more tools in their tool kit. They can break away from their dance partner and freestyle with shines they have learnt and even create new ones of the fly. This allows them to express in ways that many don’t. It you are confident enough to dance without the rules of partner work, allow your partner to express themselves in new ways, and generally increase the variety in your movements. Their body-movement is better, they can turn quicker when executing turn patterns that required them to turn, 'male or female'. They look better because of their own personal style, fluidity of movement, body movement, styling, musical interpretation and their technique, timing and speed. While social dancing it also adds more variety to the dance and there are sections in the music that can require solo dancing.\n\n\nBenefits from Shines & Footwork: Timing, Musicality, Control, Expression, Foot speed, Weight shifting & Transfer, Foot placement, Styling, Flavor, Fluidity, Posture, Mastering basic steps, Body position & angles, Acceleration & deceleration, Directions Changes, Sharp vs Smooth movements, Move more easily, Body Movement, Muscle memory, Grounding & Floor Pressure, Solo dance technique, Turns, Pivots & Spins, Balance, Confidence, Learning Routines Faster and.....Finally having fun!\nMost of these benefits above, you can’t learn from partner-work alone and only benefit your dancing a whole.\n\nYou do need a good chunk of above such as body movement, speed, styling, flavor, Fluidity, etc. Once you make these building blocks muscle memory, through practice and repetition, your dancing will grow massively to the point you can express in a way that relates to the music, known as musicality.\n\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of beginners & unexperienced dancers, or not well trained ones, tend to dismiss shines and think that they are a waste of time. They will never be used and should be for performing only! They also may believe that learning partner-work should be the main focus of on learning to dance. This just shows a lack of understanding of these dance styles. You actually need both!\n\n\nSo in a nutshell, if you want to be a great partner-work dancer or even a well balanced dancer, you really do need shines & footwork!\n\n\nNow, Once you have read the above details about SALSA SHINES & FOOTWORK, Do you wish to learn these the right way, in extremely detailed manner, step by step? Or to improve your Salsa Body Movements / Language & Musicality? Did you always want to make your Shines, Turn patterns, Partner Work look much more smoother, richer, fluid, graceful, attractive & inspiring to people who are looking at you while you dance in Salsa Socials or in stage performances?\n\n\nDo you feel you have been dancing Salsa for a while, have been taking lessons, doing shines and partner-work classes, attending workshops & Latin Dance festival but still you feel that there is something missing and your dancing is not as smooth, technically correct or attractive as much as you want it to be?

It is  characterized by elegance, ethereal motion and hard work. It develops  special muscles, employs the stretching techniques of yoga, and develops  coordination to an exceptional extent. Through a system of techniques, I help you to get  closer to yourself.\n\nWe practise perseverance, concentration,  self-discipline approached through the body, as well as body awareness.  While in ballet the form is significant, it is only of secondary  importance in my classes. What really matters is what is happening  within you. In classical ballet, there is a fixed order and system of  ballet movements, which anyone can learn. The best part of this form of  dance is that we reach to the sky , going higher and higher to achieve our dreams.\n\n\nClassical ballet for beginners. We suggest this cours for all those practioner who have had attend a ballet class before or/and took our Online Ballet Basics cours!\nIt is important because there are details, principal what we are not explaning in the beginner course.\n\nThis course is more then 75 min and most of the time we only demostrate the excercises to one side. Please do all excercises to both sides: right (when your left hend is on the barre, and your „working sde” is your riht side, which is away from the barre), and left (when your right hend is on the barre, and your „working side” is your left side.)\nWhat the course includes:\nbasic excersises at the barre- in the correct order, basic preparation excercises at the center, 1 small jump and 2 different diadonal turn preparation.\nAt all excercises we demonstrate the common mistakes and we show the correct way of performing the excercises\nCourse description:\nWe do everything in the correct order of the classical ballet. Please follow the order!\n1.barre excercises:  the correct posture, warm up with relevé-s (half pointe), plié (knee bending). Always explaning the incorrect way and the correct way of performing the specific excercises.\n2.barre excercises: tendus, jetés. Always explaning the incorrect way and the correct way of performing the specific excercises.\n3. barre excercises:  rond de jambe par terre, fondu, passé, frappé.

      "description": "Hi! I’m Darren from NBC's World of Dance crew the Kinjaz and I will be your online dance teacher.\nNot too long ago I was a shy introverted kid, who you would probably not even notice was in the room, who didn’t know how to dance… but flash forward to today, I am now dancing, performing, and teaching for hundreds, of thousands of people around the world. I have had the great fortune to dance, train, and perform with some amazing dance companies such as the Kinjaz, Culture Shock Los Angeles, and Kaba Modern and it is my goal to spread all of the knowledge and experience I have uncovered through my 18 years in the Hip Hop industry to new dancers searching to get started[...]\n\nNew Dancer Question\nThe question I get asked the most by new dancers is how do I get better? My immediate answer is, that you need to figure out how to be comfortable dancing in front of people or you won’t keep pursuing dance and therefore never get better. Every great dancer knows that to become comfortable dancing in front of people hinges on these 3 things:[...]\nFirst is the knowledge of basic fundamental steps and how to execute them with good technique...\nSecond is your ability to understand basic rhythm in music and how to move on beat to it…\nAnd finally the amount of confidence you have in YOURSELF to get out there and show off what you got\nSo with this in mind… Logic would tell us that the greater knowledge you have of basic techniques, the greater understanding you have of music, and the greater confidence you have…The greater dancer you will be… and therein lies the problem because most of the dance classes you have taken (or thought about taking) actually skip over this stuff making it difficult for you to build the confidence you need to become better.\nThe All Too Common Class Reality\nThink about it…Have you ever been in a class struggling to learn a move they are teaching while self-consciously feeling embarrassed thinking that everyone is seeing you struggle? Maybe somehow you managed to copy a move but just can’t put your finger on why you don’t look the same as the instructor and when the music comes on you feel like everyone else knows some secret code to stay on beat and somehow you are left out. This is unfortunately an all too common reality for new dancers. The reason this happens is that most classes fail to break down basic movements to it’s simplest form in order for you to understand them. This could be because…\nThe skill level of dancers is different in most classes…\nThere are too many people in the class for the instructor to really focus on you…\nSadly some amazing dancers just don’t know how to teach which leaves you both lost and confused as to why you don’t look like them\n\n\nYou can agree that this is not how you are going to get better. You need someone who can patiently break down a move to its simplest core so you can understand it no matter how long it takes. Someone who can help you understand the music and get you on beat. Someone who teaches you the basics and then gradually guides you to more advanced movements. I want to be that person for you and I have great news…\nI have created a course that will do all of this for you. Better yet, when you enroll in this course, I will be able to improve your dancing whenever and wherever you want online.\nWhy Take An Online Course\nNow, you might be thinking why would you take a course online to learn how to dance? Well, I’m glad you asked. The reason why I created an online course is that quite frankly, you and I can agree that sometimes there just are not any dance studios, classes, or instructors near you who provide the type of dance training you need to get better. Sure, you can travel far and wide to find the classes and teachers you need. They are out there, but this becomes very expensive and time-consuming.\nSure…You could turn to other online tutorials that you can find on YouTube. However, everyone has seen those tutorials that\nAre likely in no logical order for you to progress from basic to more advanced movements (Sorry, you can’t run before you know how to walk)\nDon’t break the move down simply enough for you to understand it\nNever show you how to execute the move to music\nTeach the move incorrectly leading you to practice bad technique and risk getting injured (and worse waste your time)\nSadly, There is no way I could physically reach everyone who needs this course in person and to be honest it would cost a HUGE amount of money to take the number of private lessons needed with me to learn all of the advanced strategies, tips, and techniques I show you in this course. That is why I have created this online course to allow people from around the world access to an experienced teacher who wants to help them every step of the way.\nThe Benefits Of An Online Course\nSo how will you learn and benefit from the course being online? I created a structured course curriculum that will guide you by the hand through basic fundamental movements in a progressive order (basic to advanced movements) just as if we were having a private, one on one lesson together. Everyone knows that it is difficult to learn anything when you are first introduced to it. The beauty of having this course is that\nYou can learn and master movements at your own pace by returning to any movement lesson as many times as you need\nYou can pick up on the small but important details you probably would have missed in a class by being able to skip around each lesson\nYou can truly dance like no one is watching you since you can access the course whenever and wherever you want\nEvery dancer knows that it is easier to dance when no one is there. You can feel stress-free learning new moves and build up your confidence to show others whenever you are ready to from the comfort of your home\nThat’s why you need my course. The amount of information that I have gathered and will teach you will save you all that time, money, and wasted effort you will spend trying to learn from someone who is not qualified or doesn’t understand how to teach you.\nLet Me Show You What You Are Getting\nOver the past 18 years, I have cultivated the knowledge and experience of teaching dancers of all different kinds of backgrounds and skill levels how to dance. I’ve documented what teaching methods work and what methods are just flat-out ineffective and created a simple, easy-to-follow course curriculum that you can easily learn from and apply immediately to your dancing\nThe first section of the course will take you through my personal head-to-toe warm-up. Now…I know that doesn’t seem exciting but this is a very important thing that most dance classes, let alone dancers in general miss or rush through. Everyone knows that once you injure yourself, you will be unable to do anything until you recover, which means the longer it will take for you to get better. You and I both can agree that we want to make you better as fast as possible. By doing this warm-up, you will ensure that your joints and muscles are ready and primed for your training, which means less chance of you getting injured and being able to continue your training without any delays and advance quicker.\nThe next section is the “Advanced Concepts and Strategies”. In this section, you will learn concepts and strategies I wish someone told me when I got started dancing. This section alone will give you the upper hand on over 90% of new dancers. Concepts such as using levels and how to position your body will allow you to make one move look like multiple moves that are customized to your liking. The concepts and strategies shared in this section will double, even triple the number of moves you will be able to execute in your dancing.\nThe next section is the “Toprock Fundamental Steps”. This is where you will learn and be guided through every detail on how to execute a move with perfect technique. On top of that, I will show you how the move is done with music at 3 different tempos which means you will be ready for all types of different music regardless of the speed. As an extra bonus, I have provided a number of Drills and Combos in between new movement lessons so you can feel completely confident utilizing each move before taking on the next, more advanced move. Finally, I give you a blueprint on how to combine all of your new moves that you have mastered into a plug-and-play template to get you started right away.\nThe final section is the \"Entrance Toprocks\". This is where you will learn steps you can use to enter the circle or dance floor to gain attention and create some space before you show off your new Toprock steps you learned from the previous section. Not only will you learn new steps to command attention,  I also show you how to combine an entrance step with a Toprock step so you can easily transition and make your movements look smooth and cohesive.\nStart Improving Right Now\nFor a one-on-one private training session that provides you with over 4 hours of concepts, strategies, and techniques shown in this course, not including the extra hours you gain by being able to rewatch the course as many times as you want, I would normally charge a minimum of $400 (and that’s if we could even get through all this great information in 4 one hour sessions)\nBut today, I’d like to give you the course for $49.99 just for taking a look at my brand new course.\nThat’s right, I am offering to show you the path to reaching your Breakin' goals quickly, safely, and efficiently by providing you with new movements, drills, exercises, and warm-ups to get you to your goal faster for less than it would cost you to take one 30min private session with me.\nThis course is offered at this price for a limited time only. As I continue to update the course and add more lessons, I will have no choice but to start charging for the course. This course is already priced far below what it is worth, so enroll in the course now and receive the added benefit of having access to all future lessons without having to pay an extra penny.\nNaturally, I’m sure you have some hesitation. I know when I buy stuff, especially something from the web where I can’t see it, feel it, or toy with it, I feel like I am taking a bit of a risk. So here is my guarantee to you. Enroll in this course risk-free and If within 30 days of your enrollment you don’t agree that this course is helping you become a better dancer by learning the correct technique and execution of movements to music and advanced concepts and strategies then Udemy offers a full refund of your purchase price.\nHere’s the deal: This is a killer bargain. What you get in this course is worth literally hundreds of dollars not just in lesson fees but in all the extra cash you will save by not needing to travel to some class that is getting you nowhere. The price of this course will only continue to increase once more lessons are added so when you enroll now for $49.99 you will have lifetime access to the course and all of the future lessons when they are added and not have to pay a cent more. Plus you do all of this risk-free because you are covered by a 30-day full refund if you don’t like the course. I am in the position to help you at this point. If you read this far here’s what you need to do for me to actually help you make this real in your life.\nHere’s what you need to do now: First I want you to grab your wallet and enroll in this course (remember you are under no obligation to keep this and if you want a refund within the first 30 days of enrolling for any reason at all you will get it immediately and we will still be friends). Here’s what’s going to happen next. You will have instant access to the course and I want you to browse through the entire course and decide if this is for you (which I know it will be or else I wouldn’t have wasted your time and made you read this far) to prove to yourself that you have made the right decision because I know what it’s like to be in a position wondering what’s going to happen. Then… enjoy the course and feel free to ask me any questions along the way. See you inside.\n-Darren\nP.s. As you know, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Is that what you are doing? Aren’t you tired of waiting to learn how to break? Tired of practicing and getting nowhere? I want to help you out but you need to take action. Enroll in the course now.\nP.p.s. Remember, I have spent 18 years teaching, correcting, and guiding hundreds of dancers of all skill levels on how to master their movements. I am offering to show you the path to reaching your Breakin' goals quickly, safely, and efficiently by providing you with new movements, drills, exercises, and warm-ups to get you to your goal faster for the price of one 30min private lesson. On top of that, you can’t possibly lose because of Udemy’s 30-day money-back guarantee so what are you waiting for? Enroll in the course now before the price increases",

Learn to fully engage your spine on every step. Level: Intermediate\n\n\nClass 2 Coordination Drills for Fluidity in Belly Dance\nInstruction and practice of belly dance moves and trajectories essential for developing and enhancing fluidity of your dance. We'll work on the upper-lower body coordinations needed to support your hipwork and full body angle changes in belly dance. The drills from this class are also available as a non-stop 30-minute practice session.\n\n\nClass 3 Twisting Undulation: Intermediate-Advanced Belly Dance Technique and 30-min. Non-Stop Practice. Combinations and choreography taught in a non-stop dance with music format. \"Belly dance is taught through isolations, an important element of belly dance aesthetics. However, focusing on isolations often results in stiffness - you end up dancing with frozen spine and chest. As intermediate/advanced dancers, we need to graduate from isolations to grasping the full body dynamics. The \"twisting undulation\" is a good shortcut to connecting your lower and upper body in a number of dance movement contexts.\"\n\n\nClass 4 Full Body and Upper Body - connecting trajectories - Technique Drills\nHow to keep your upper body belly dance moves organically woven into the texture of your dance movement, as opposed to having them thrown in as random embellishments? \"We learn belly dance through isolations and one of the side effects is, sometimes we keep this totally isolated mode even when we are not beginners any more. When you see a dancer who is a great mover, and especially if she is improvising, not implementing a choreography she created for her students, you often can’t see where one so-called move ends and the other begins, the movement trajectories are natuarally interwoven. So today we’ll try to work on combinations where we’ll connect the upper body trajectories to full body or other upper body trajectories. It’s the same thing that I always repeat to you in our classes - the key feature of advanced bellydance is that you don’t cut your movement trajectories, you weave them into longer continuous strings. \" Level: Intermediate-Advanced",

Your journey culminates in an immersive 1 hour 11 minute guided dance meditation that brings it all together. The somatic anchors are designed to be immediately applicable—you'll notice shifts in your body awareness from the very first practice.\nBy the end of this course, you'll have a comprehensive toolkit for embodied living that you can return to again and again, adapting the practices to meet your changing needs and continuing to discover new dimensions of freedom in both your dance and your life.\nNo dance experience is necessary—just an open heart and a desire to explore the wisdom of your body.

      "description": "About the Course\nJose Limón & the Limón Technique\n\n\nJosé Limón can be added to the list of choreographers who developed their own signature training styles. In the dance world today, it is typical within professional training programs for students to be trained in both the Graham Technique and Limón Technique styles of Modern Dance.\nModern Dance has evolved with each subsequent generation of participating artists. Artistic content has morphed and shifted from one choreographer to another, as have styles and techniques. Even elements of urban dance have become well represented in this genre.\nIn this course, we will focus on the basics of the Limón style whose technique was informed by Humphrey's ideas about the dynamics of body weight as the body rose, fell, and remained in suspension during a dance. This technique improves a dancer's quality of movement and adds strength while developing dynamic and exciting movement qualities.\nBecause of Limón’s unique use of space, weight, and music, it’s an excellent introduction to dance in general. It can be broken down into simple exercises that can be later enhanced to challenge more seasoned dancers. Limón Technique improves one’s coordination significantly. The style differs from other techniques often by; working off-balance, with multiple layers of movements, and with the body in an inverted position. Thus, making; turns, jumps, and extensions more difficult.\n\n\nAfter this course you will be able to:\n● use dance vocabulary to describe movement;\n● understand the foundational steps within the Limón Technique;\n● be able to join a recreational modern dance class;\n● apply this movement vocabulary to other dance forms.\n\n\nIn addition, you will have improved your:\n● body’s strength and flexibility;\n● coordination\n● musical understanding;\n● movement vocabulary\n\n\nThis is an excellent course for non-dancers interested in learning Modern Dance, beginner dancers wanting to improve their abilities, or seasoned dancers who’ve never studied this particular style but wish to understand the different use of body weight, fall, suspension, and coordination that the Limón Technique offers.",

That is, it will be easy for you to adjust for larger spaces.\n\nAlso, we all know that attending online classes is very different than face to face session.

Don’t worry, you can get in touch with me and you will also be invited to a private Facebook group to join like-minded students.\n\nYou will be supported and answers will be given. most of all, have fun!",

This program is part of a series of six dance programs for beginner women featuring these styles of dance: Bollywood, Belly Dance, Contemporary Hip Hop, Chair Dance, Burlesque, and Alter Ego (Music Video). Try all of them today!\nBased on the most popular new dances of today, we've put together an exciting dance program that combines fun, fitness, and dancing. Best of all, the program is designed for absolute beginners, so you can take your time learning from the comfort of your own home. The variety of the Beginner Dance For Women program dances will take you everywhere from the zany fun of Bollywood dancing to the sexy, seductive chair dancing routines.\nAnd of course, the program is designed specifically for women. Since this program is ladies first, we go where the boys don't dare - shimmying, flirting, teasing, moving our hips, rolling our bodies, and showing off all our sexiness.\nFor each unique, exciting dance, Angela will teach you two full beginner dance routines. The dance routines will follow the structure of a dance class, except you have the option to go through the dance steps and practices, if you're stuck on any one move, or wish to perfect it.\nThe dance routines are built gradually, learning one or two sets of dance moves (called counts of 8 in dance terminology) at a time, and then doing a practice to the newly-learned moves. Afterwards, another set of dance moves are built on the existing dance moves and practiced until the full routine is learned.\nDon't worry if you don't the moves right away. Angela has plenty of experience teaching beginners, and we've created the dance program with that in mind. The moves have been carefully designed for easy \"body memorization\". We've chosen moves for beginner dancers, BUT if you think you've got it down, we've put in plenty of extras to keep you busy and coming back to the program.\nFinally, we finish with a workout in each style of dance that either focuses on stretching, cardio, or strength.",

I designed this programme for complete beginners or those with some skills, who’d love to be able to dance with others, creating beautiful, dynamic, improvised dance. It’s easier than you’d think. This is perfect for practice-simple, safe and easy to follow.\nUnlike many tribal dance formats, Pedralta World Fusion® Dance uses vocabularies of movements to interpret particular musical styles, and to correspond more closely to the cultural roots of the music.\nWhen dancing to Spanish fusion music Pedralta dancers would use basics such as Arabic (trad. Camels), Egyptian, Hip Bump (trad. Hip Lift) and shimmy, combined with a palette of Flamenco-inspired movements and combinations developed by Donna Gardner for improvised group dance. A Banjara-inspired (Indian folk dance) move such as re-shamka would not be used.\nWe use specific movement palettes for props such as shawl, stick (where saaidi moves and combinations feature strongly) and even movements for dancing with a frame drum.\nOn this course you'll learn some basic \"root\" moves and some progression moves, how to follow a lead dancer, how to move smoothly between moves and begin to improvise your own dance, either solo or in a group. We'll\n· Warm Up\n· Posture\n· Cool Down & Stretch\n· Learn Root Moves\n· Drill Root Moves\n· Progressive Moves\n\n\nI break each move down into components, demonstrate from behind and facing, and I lead you in practicing all the moves you've learned, switching between 5 basic movements.\nTransitions\nI'll explain and demonstrate how to move smoothly from one move to the next and how to cue fellow dancers.\nNow you’ll be able to improvise solo or in a small group with other dancers.

These four techniques form the basis of popping and act as a foundation for all further learning.\nWe will cover:\nHitting: Also referred to as popping which is the contraction of key muscle groups.\nWaving: Basic joint isolation that gives the illusion of traveling motion across your body.\nTutting: Covers the movement of arms and hands to create ninety degree angels.\nMind Set: We talk about ways to combine the first three techniques in order to create your own personal style.\nThis series of introductory videos cover the theory behind our teaching system and why we believe that these four elements make up the basis of Popping. Then there are separate detailed explanation for Hitting, Waving, Tutting and Mind Set. We also have a final lesson in this series that talks about how to use your newly learned techniques as a beginner and how to practice. Or for seasoned dancers how to apply your new moves to what you already know. The course will take about 30 minutes to complete.\nIf you are just trying popping for the first time this is an excellent resource for you. This set of videos talk about the moves that form the basis of all other popping techniques. Once mastered these can be used to learn more advanced styles and moves. We will be adding more videos to this course . So watch often and practice to your favorite funk songs!",

      "description": "For adults who have never taken a ballet class before…\nYou need to take this course first, before you go to your first class. Here’s why:\nWalking into the typical adult beginner level ballet class can be a bit like visiting a foreign country where you do not speak the language. This is because unless you are enrolled in an absolute beginner class where every student has never taken a ballet class before, it is extremely unlikely that the teacher will have the time to explain the basic information that you need to know.\nAs a teacher and a retired professional ballet dancer, I still attend ballet class regularly. I take beginner ballet classes, despite having been professional, because of my age. Whether I am teaching beginning ballet, or attending beginner ballet class, I see the same problem recur over and over again.\nA beginning student with no prior experience walks in, takes class, is overwhelmed, and never returns to ballet class again. This is a true shame, because, while beginning studies in ballet can be initially overwhelming, once you understand the basics it becomes enormously rewarding, not only physically, but mentally and emotionally, as well.\n“All You Need to Know Before You Begin Ballet Class” is designed to provide you with all of the basic information that you need to be prepared before you go to your first ballet class, so that you can enjoy the experience and you can organize both your body and your mind to make the most of your studies.\nIn four 40-45 minute lessons plus one 70 minute lesson, this course covers everything from the practical issues of what to wear to class and how to hold the barre, to the essentials of basic ballet, to the structure and routine of class, to how to approach ballet class mentally.\nBallet is a practice, and it promotes not only physical wellness, it promotes emotional wellness, too. There is also something else about ballet that you might not know, and that is that ballet is not only great for your body, but it is fantastic for your brain! Ballet is a bit like doing crosswords with your body. The central activity of ballet class is to learn patterns and reverse patterns, using both sides of your brain.\nSo, if you are interested in beginning ballet but have no prior experience, do not go into your first class unprepared!",

      "description": "In this course we take a very methodical approach where we take your Cha-Cha basics and bring them to a more professional level. If you really want to stand out on the dance-floor, this is the course for you.\n\n\nListen up, here's a top secret that applies not just to Cha Cha, but any dance\n\n\nIf you take a dance, look at it's basic step and learn to dance the basic step like a professional, you will be able to dance at least 90% of the dance like a professional.\n1) So in this course the first thing we do is go and break down the basic step in its component parts, and show you how to dance each of those components as a professional.\n2) However, Cha Cha has one more component (not present in the basic step), and that's the lock step. So we threw that in there as well so you get an extra lecture on doing the lock step as a professional.\n3) Then we go through and apply this to bunch of steps and even combinations you can practice with\nIf you dance these 4 elements as a pro you can actually dance 95% of all Cha Cha steps like a pro*, and and most definitely all the steps in the standardized Cha Cha curricula.\n\n\nNote - This Course only includes the pro techniques specific to Cha Cha\n\n\nIn this course we only go through the pro techniques specific to Cha Cha. When we say \"look like a pro\", this assumes you also use the universal concepts that are universal to all the dances, such as for example good dance posture, which is a separate course.\nIn order to get the true full \"pro\" look when dancing a certain dance, you need to apply both the pro techniques specific to that dance, as well as the universal \"pro\" techniques and concepts, which are covered in the \"how to move like a pro\" course.\n\n=== Question: Is previous Cha Cha knowledge required? ===\nIn the course we review the basics first before we actually upgrade them to this higher level.\nIf you're a complete beginner to dance and do not know the Cha Cha basics:\n- It's possible you might need to learn them first from a slower-paced tutorial on YouTube or something.\n- Or you might be able to just jump in and learn them in this course. You can always slow down and rewind the videos if you want.\nIf you have any dance experience:\n- You probably can learn the steps from the review section alone, even if you've never learned Cha Cha on its own.",

This will give you the confidence and control you need to play the cymbals seamlessly as you dance.\n\n\nNext, we'll guide you through the step-by-step choreography, starting with a slower speed to ensure that you can coordinate your movements with the cymbals. Our experienced instructor will break down each movement and transition in detail, so you can learn and practice at your own pace.\n\n\nFinally, you'll be able to practice the full dance with a slower music at 80% speed and whenever you're ready go for the 100% original speed.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll have learned a beautiful and captivating choreography that integrates finger cymbals seamlessly with the music and the dance.

      "description": "Across the great span of the ages, and across all cultures all over the world, Sacred Dance as a way for us humans to transcend our mortality, and connect with the Divine, is as old as time itself. Dance has always been the way our Ancestors have connected with the primal energy that stirs deep within us, and the spiralling Geodynamic Torque of the force of creation within the Earth.\nYou are invited into the temple of Kundalini Dance as an initiate into the Serpent Mysteries, as we follow in the footsteps of our ancestors. As they once did, so will we use Ecstatic Dance and Trance as a way of Shamanic Journeying into direct communion with both the Goddess, and the Godhead.\nThis is a course like no other, it is designed to completely wake you up on every level, and have some serious fun at the same time, by dancing your socks off, and connecting your bare feet with our Sacred Earth!\nThis course is for those who resonate with the idea of reaching natural states of ecstasy, through dancing without the need for drugs.\nThe amazing thing about Kundalini Dance, is that you can do it wherever you are on this Earth, and whenever you want, even right now! No matter where you are, anytime that you feel you need to cathartically release tension, or really reconnect with your  inner joy, and something greater, then your initiation into Kundalini Dance awaits you.\nThe roadmap for your dance journey is the Seven Chakra system which you embody, so it is in essence, a Chakra Dance. You will be activating your Kundalini life force energy, which rises up through these seven primary energy centres. You will learn how to clear through any blocks that you might have, which may be holding you back in your life, whether physical, emotional, mental, pranic or Spiritual.\nThe key to this form of Ecstatic Dance, is that by learning how to release old stuck energies, and inviting new, fresh ones in, you will begin to experience some real freedom in the way that you think, feel and act. We often cling to these fears in our minds and bodies, quite unconsciously, to keep us safe, which can prevent us from moving forward in our lives. Once your 'Shakti' energy gets released, and begins to flow through your body, it dissolves all your fears, and raises your vibration!\nYes dear initiate, it is time to dance out your inner demons of fear, doubt, confusion, and the ego in its many forms, once and for all. You can finally begin to move through any stuck energies that linger within you, such as anxiety, depression, stress, frustration, boredom, inertia, apathy etc.. the invitation, is for you to let all of this go now.\nIt is time to dance your way into complete and utter freedom, both in how you feel, and in how you choose to live your life.\nI, Mark T.J Keane, have 20 years of experience teaching Kundalini Dance, and am the founder of Kundalini Dance UK.  I trained with the creator Leyolah Antara on the world's very first ever Kundalini Dance training in Australia in 2005.\nIn my experience, this journey can be the most fun that you have had in a long time, or maybe ever had, after all you were born to dance, as life is a cosmic dance. In completing this course, you will be fully inspired to dance with life, empowered by a renewed enthusiasm and celebration of it. You will transcend the many roles you play in your life, and any limiting or negative patterns of behaviour or the beliefs behind them. This will deeply reconnect with your essence, and reveal your true glory, beneath the masks you hide behind.\n1. You will activate and align your DNA, and your chakras, using the upward flowing. self healing energy of your own Kundalini life force, and the Earth Energy rising from Mother Earth herself.\n2. You will learn how to connect with the downward flowing, Divine Source Energy, and channel the codes of higher frequencies of consciousness into your bodies.\n3. You will form the Sacred Union of the Alchemy of both of these Divine Feminine and Divine Masculine energies, which will lead you into your Heart Chakra, where you can live your life as Loving Awareness.\n\nLearn the Sacred Keys to Kundalini Dance:\n\nSacred Dance Movement - Learn to move and dance intuitively, and trust the natural energy flow of your seven chakras\nPranic Breath - Learn to breathe in a profound way, to really feel and heal your chakras\nPranic Sound - Learn to cathartically release stuck energy in your chakras with your voice, and find their core sound vibrations\nShamanic Drum Journeys  - Trance Dance and dive deep into the energy of the chakras to reveal their hidden treasures\nGuided Visualisations - Powerful Meditations on each chakra to integrate, and find real clarity on your dance journeys\nActivate and Heal your 5 Bodies - Your Physical Body, Emotional Body, Mental Body. Pranic Body (Ka) and Spiritual Body\nYour life will never be the same after this, as you embrace your shadow, and return to the centre of who you really are, beneath it all.. to your beautiful, shiny, passionate, and inspired 'Unique Soul Vibration'.\nRemember you are here on this Earth, at this time, to really make a positive impact with your gifts.\nAre you ready for the next phase of your life? To live free from the old fears and negativity of the past, and into the unbounded pure joy, natural ecstasy and self love of the Present Moment.\nIf so, this course is for you...Enrol Now!",

      "description": "Grounding is the foundation of emotional resilience, physical health, and inner stability. In this course, you’ll embark on a unique healing journey that combines the ancient, feminine power of Arabian dance with the deep energetic wisdom of the East — all to awaken, activate, and balance your Root Chakra (Muladhara).\nThe Root Chakra governs our sense of safety, vitality, and connection to the physical world. When balanced, it brings groundedness, confidence, and strength. When blocked, it may manifest as anxiety, instability, fear, or lack of purpose. This course offers a gentle, embodied way to reconnect with your base — through meditative movement.\nYou will learn flowing, feminine, Earth-connected movements from traditional Middle Eastern dance, chosen specifically for their grounding and harmonizing effect on the body and energy system. These motions activate the feet, knees, hips, and pelvis — engaging the very parts of the body governed by Muladhara.\nThe movements are performed with mindfulness and grace — not requiring any dance experience or technical perfection. They are soft, circular, and soothing, designed to help you feel deeply rooted, stable, and present in your body.\nYou will also gain deeper insight into the symbolic and energetic meaning of the Root Chakra — its connection to the Earth element, its link to the adrenal glands and survival instinct, and its vital role in self-forgiveness, cleansing, and building strong foundations for your life.\nThis course is suitable for all women — regardless of age or physical ability. Whether you are new to energy work or dance, or have already explored spiritual practices like Dance, Love, Fly, Create, you’ll find this to be a gentle yet powerful experience of healing through movement.\nLet this be your invitation to land in your body, feel your inner strength, and reconnect with the nourishing power of the Earth — through the sacred, sensual art of Arabian dance.",

Hula hooping can be daunting and feel like an uphill battle, in the beginning, there are thousands of tutorials out there and so many questions to be answered. What’s the best hoop size for me? How do I even start? How do I get better at hooping? How can I go from beginner to intermediate? How can I go from intermediate to advanced?

This course is your one-stop shop for growing in your hula hoop journey!\nThis course is all about you! I remember being a beginner hooper and feeling overwhelmed by all of the tutorials out there, and the seemingly infinite amount of tricks, and I felt intimidated watching all of the super talented hoopers out there. Sometimes I even felt bad about my own flow in comparison and what felt like a slow progression. I knew I wanted to become a good hooper, I even wanted to perform someday because I was so passionate about it! But it was a long road teaching myself tricks and scouring the internet for all I could learn about hula hooping. This course is inspired by my 5 years of experience, practice, mistakes, and wins in hooping. It’s been a long, crazy, beautiful ride that’s brought me endless joy. It’s truly been my pleasure to share my love of hooping with flowmies all around the world!",

The choreography utilizes techniques introduced in the courses on Fundamental Technique of Classical Japanese Dance (coming soon), so taking all these courses together will give you a solid foundation.\nThe song depicts the fifty-three stations along the Tōkaidō highway between Edo and Kyoto. During the Edo period (1603-1868), the Nihonbashi bridge was the starting point of all the major roads radiating from Edo into various regions of Japan. People traveled on foot, and it took them over two weeks to go from Edo to Kyoto. Therefore, I like to think of this dance as the starting point of the long journey you are about to begin in learning Classical Japanese Dance.\nThis dance is versatile and suitable for anyone, regardless of age and gender. In this course, I demonstrate the dance in three different gender and age expressions: (1) neutral, (2) man/boy, and (3) young girl. If you are a beginner student, start with the neutral expression and gradually experiment with other variations. Furthermore, you can dance each style with a sensu (“fan” for dancing) or without. This dance may be performed as a solo, duet, trio, or group dance.",

      "description": "I have been dancing everything from hip hop to tap to ballet, and there isn't a dance that gives me as much pleasure as the Charleston! There is a reason why Charleston swept the nation during the 1920s and is once again sweeping the world with an incredible rebirth! This dance is ridiculously fun, easy to learn and some how provides the depth for a life long journey of discovery and improvement.\nIf you don't believe me, just Search \"I Charleston\" on youtube.\nIn this course you will start out with the basic's, but we are going to take it much further. I am going to give detailed breakdowns of the Advanced Charleston steps that only a handful of dancers in the world know, and took me over 12 years to figure out how to actually do properly.\nI think Charleston is most natural dance for the human body. It is based the body movement of walking combined with the head boppin' rhythm of authentic jazz and swing music. Now it has evolved to where you can dance it to your not only swing, but just about any for of pop music found today.\nThough simple at first glance, the Charleston expands into a variety of styles that are exciting and dynamic to dance once learned. They offer a great physical challenge for people looking to improve their dance skills and coordination since it is based on counter body movement and balancing the upper and lower body movements.\nA lot of the footwork and body movement found in Swing Dancing and Lindy Hop along with modern street dances like Shuffling, Hip Hop, Locking, House is based on the Charleston. Learning this dance is probably one of the best things you can do to strengthen your dance foundation and improve coordination and Rhythm.\nOnce you have mastered the steps in this course, an endless world of improvisation is at your finger tips using vernacular jazz movements and self expression. In addition, it will open the doors to the world of swing dancing, Lindy Hop, Authentic Jazz and an international community of friendly dancers.\nLastly, I can get through an hour of CrossFit or yoga but struggle to Charleston for more that 40 minutes. It is simply one of the most intense calorie munching workout's when done right. In this course, getting fit becomes the sweet side effect of having fun.",

These are the moves that you've seen performed by celebrities in music videos and on TV.\n\nThey are iconic dance moves that everyone recognizes.\nAs the name of this program suggests, these dance moves are perfect for... parties!\nThese moves are like inside jokes of the language of dance. If someone busts out one of these moves at a party, and you join in with them, you're considered to be someone who \"gets it\"!\n\nIt's an instant way to connect with people and make friends.\n\nI can't tell you how many new friends I've made in the club and at bars by knowing these dance moves.\n\nIt's gotta be one of the best social skills to have under your belt.\nThese dance moves go best to songs you hear at weddings, bachelor parties, Christmas parties OR 90's themed parties.\nIn the first part of the program, I teach you the 5 fundamental dance grooves that make up all the other dance moves\n\nIf you've struggled trying to learn how to dance before, it's because you've haven't learned these 5 fundamental dance grooves.\nAfter learning the fundamental movements, I will teach you a collection of oldschool dance moves. These are the moves done by artists from the 90's to the 2000's.\n\nFrom there, I will show you a collection of newschool dance moves -- these are the moves that you see on TV from the late 2010's until now.\nThis is Brian B, your living room dance teacher, see you inside the course",

This is why I have created this course for you based on my studio beginner tap course. You can practice wherever you are, in your own time and you don't have to worry about how you look or what you are wearing. Also you don't need to wear tap shoes to learn how to tap dance. I suggest wearing shoes with a smooth sole at first or even socks as when you start to learn, sometimes you put too much pressure onto the floor ruining your kitchen or living room floor. If you decide to wear tap shoes I suggest that you buy a piece of mdf or plywood.\nI have designed the course to run over a period of 4 weeks, of course you can complete it in one week or one year, it's really up to you.  Each week you should practice one of the warm ups and then start your lesson. At the end of the course you will be able to dance 2 short routines.\nWho this course is for:\nBeginners with no or little experience\nPeople looking for a physical activity to do at home\nPeople wanting to learn a new hobby\nFor those who want to build up their self confindence\nPeople who are interested in Musical Theater dance",

      "description": "Shuffle Dance was created during the 90s in Melbourne Australia. This style was danced to techno music. It consists of different basic steps from other styles like the charleston, hip hop, housedance, etc. You also can dance this style to other different kind of music.\nIn this course you learn the basic steps of Shuffle Dance. I break down the different basics into natural movement. So it is easier for you to get all these steps correctly. Then we move on and try this basics to slow music. If you want to try it to faster music, lets go! The great thing about this course is, that you can do every section over and over again. I recommend to start with the running man. The concept behind the running man is perfect to get the other steps faster. The same with the charleston step. This step is from the charleston dance style. Your footwork will get better if you do these two steps first.\nIn chapter two I give you some tips how to drill the basic steps. We start with the running man. I gonna add more drills for the other basic steps, too! You also learn how to combine two steps together. It is important, that you get a natural flow in your dance. So it is easier for you. The same with three steps. Create a natural flow to it. If you get those examples you can create your own combinations.\nIn conclusion you can say, that this course is a perfect start to learn Shuffle Dance or Melbourne Shuffle. If you have any questions you can contact me via mail or on social media. I am looking forward to work with you!",

      "description": "East Indian Classical dances are among the oldest artistic dance expressions in the world. While there are sometimes more categories accepted in the classical forms, eight is the most widely accepted number of basic classical forms of East Indian dance. This introductory dance course will cover the foundations of classical East Indian dance. Other courses in East Indian dance do not typically focus on detail, and form. They usually go directly into choreographed routines. This introductory course to East Indian dance focuses on key details in form and posture that are an essential foundation to all the main East Indian dance styles. These key details are sometimes omitted as part of the introduction to East Indian dance. This course aims to fill that gap by supplying these details in easy-to-follow and thoroughly-explained video lessons.\nAn examination of the styles of dance in the East Indian genre will assist students in identifying the basics of posture, form and movement. The student will find that this course is an excellent introduction to the discipline of East Indian dance regardless of the specific style of East Indian dance they wish to pursue next. This course will introduce the Bharatnatyam style of East Indian dance in practice but will focus on 'nritta' or the 'pure' dimension of the style alone. Focusing on the purer dimensions of style means that the student will gain the foundations that are common to most of the main classical forms.",

More often (but not always) legs together with their impact are hidden under the long skirts. That is why a female performer is supposed to catch the audience's attention with her expressive face, graceful arms, strong and flexible core, spinning technique and artistic courage.\nI guess you know the motif from Eastern mystic poetry about nightingale and beautiful rose. Female party is an embodiment of poetic beloved Rose.\nAzerbaijani dance gives to a woman a key to grow your Inner Woman to the purity of a Mystery Flower - symbol of love, passion, chastity and unearthly beauty.\nAll Caucasian feminine dances show the way to invoke Queen's energies spreading from body education to the whole being.

Great for perfecting and expanding your tray balancing skills, and for an elegant and sophisticated performance at a commercial venue, private event, or a peer-review dance showcase. Neon offers a detailed breakdown of every step, and practice with and without the candle tray. She also shares tips & ideas on logistics of performing with candles.\nBelly dance with a candle tray creates an amazing showcase of a dancer’s technique, grace and showmanship. Very often, however, professional performers treat this genre as a side show act, focusing on balancing tricks (balancing the tray on one’s knee, foot, belly, etc.) and losing the elements that make their performance a dance show: Rich belly dance vocabulary while balancing the tray; continuous movement (uninterrupted by balancing tricks with awkward transitions between static balancing positions); effortlessness of executing sophisticated dance steps while balancing, so that the dance itself is as beautiful and flawless with the tray as without.\nA long-time proponent of tray balancing as an enhancement for real dance as opposed to side-show-style performance, Neon has designed this choreography to look amazing with or without the candle tray. Adding the candle tray balancing will bring its level from intermediate to advanced, once your moves while balancing are as complete, effortless and graceful as they are without the tray.",

      "description": "Welcome! Social dancing can change your life in beautiful ways, so I congratulate you for having the courage to explore the possibility of becoming a dancer. This Salsa Dance series contains over five hours of instruction in 81 videos that will take you from a very beginner (no experience required) to an intermediate dancer in both salsa and bachata dancing. In the first two sections, we have included one video on basic bachata, one on basic merengue, and one on basic cha-cha. Additionally, two videos on how to find the beat and other aspects of musicality are included, as well as a video on dance etiquette and what to expect when going out dancing. I have been teaching salsa for 20 years and have tried to distill as much as possible into these easy-to-follow videos that can be practiced over and over. Two extra sections are included with your purchase. The first (Accelerated Salsa) is a good addition to the previous salsa sections and exposes material at a faster pace than the first two sections. Both salsa sections start with the basics, so the student could begin with either. The last section is Beginner Bachata. By the end of these 11 bachata lessons, you should feel comfortable at the beginner or intermediate levels of bachata dancing in any studio or dance scene. I hope you enjoy them and get out dancing soon!",

You will focus on what you feel yourself as opposed to creating experiences for your audience. Dance instruction in this program is for absolute beginners. However, if you are interested in learning how to use dance in ritual, or in creating a temple dance experience based on belly dance, it’s open level. Besides basics of bellydance technique, Neon teaches a lot of steps, poses, and gestures designed to convey archetypal, symbolic or spiritual meaning you can weave in your own personal ritual or performance.\nNeon teaches 3 choreographed ritual sequences, using the format of non-stop movement with music (72 min.)\n“Embrace Change” sequence is built as a template portraying three stages of a ritual - separation, transition, and integration.\n“Free Your Mind” is a meditative dance reflecting on the sense of lightness that arises when you are at peace with yourself.\n“Eternal Feminine” focuses on femininity as a way to be in communion with life around us without need to control it, and understanding that what we are seeking is alive within us.\n\n\nThe elements of ritual symbolism presented in Neon’s “Secret Gift” can be used in a ritual dance, spiritual practice, or movement meditation.",

It also incorporates elements from other dance styles, including:\nPopping, Hip hop, Flamenco, Kathak, Odissi, Bhangra, Bharata Natyam, and Polynesian.\n\n\n7 hours of videos to include warm-up drills, combinations, choreographies, arm technique, shimmies, travelling steps, isolation of body parts and more. You will have had a great workout and worked core muscles after this course and you will feel your body being fitter, more expansive and open.\n\n\nThe term Tribal derives from “tribe” (group in English) and fully expresses the philosophy of this dance made of aggregation, complicity, feeling, trust and communication through body movements. While the term “Fusion” refers instead to the fusion of the various styles from which this dance draws.",

      "description": "This tango course is designed for those who want to learn a unique, solo choreography to the powerful and emotional song Bust Your Windows by Jazmine Sullivan. Unlike traditional ballroom or Argentine tango, this course focuses on a solo dance style that blends various techniques to create a feminine, elegant, and captivating routine. Throughout the lessons, I break down every movement step by step, making it easy for beginners to follow. To ensure clarity, all demonstrations are shown from the back, giving you the perfect view to mirror the movements. Additionally, I have a mirror in front of me, so you’ll be able to see both the front and back angles simultaneously for a complete understanding of the choreography. We’ll focus on precise footwork, stylized arm movements, and how to combine these elements to bring out the grace and power of tango. Each section of the choreography is practiced with and without music, so you’ll feel confident dancing to the rhythm by the end of the course. This course is more than just learning steps — it’s about discovering your feminine energy and expressing it through dance. Join me to create a beautiful, empowering tango routine that’s as enjoyable to perform as it is to watch!",
