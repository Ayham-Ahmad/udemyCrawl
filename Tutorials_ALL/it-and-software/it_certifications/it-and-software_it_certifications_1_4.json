According to a recent report from Fortinet, almost 80% of breaches were due to skill gaps that exist in organizations around the globe.\n\n\nThe C)EH is recognized globally as the most advanced certified ethical hacking course in the market.\nThe course covers attack technologies, commonly used by hackers and teaches you exactly how to act in fighting back on these attacks.\nBy passing this exam and gaining this certification you prove you’re skilled in understanding how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems. It shows you’ve got the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but you can use them in a lawful and legitimate manner.\nThe C)EH exam is a 4-hour exam with 125 multiple-choice questions.\nThis knowledge-based exam will test your skills in Information Security Threats and Attack Vectors, Attack Detection, Attack Prevention, Procedures, Methodologies and more!\nC)EH is a great place to start your career in Cyber Security, but you are required to have some requisite knowledge before getting into C)EH. It’s recommended you have a minimum of 2 Years IT Security experience before attempting the C)EH.\nIn these video series we will review many practice tests and find the correct answer to increase our knowledge and pass the exam easily.\nEach video series contains 100 questions with multiple choices and we will review all answers to find the most accurate answer.",

You will also learn about specialized AWS services, including AWS Direct Connect and AWS Storage Gateway, that support hybrid architecture, and you will learn about best practices for building scalable, elastic, secure, and highly available applications on AWS.\nIn this course, you will learn how to:\nApply the AWS Well-Architected Framework\nManage multiple AWS accounts for your organization\nConnect an on-premises datacenter to the AWS Cloud\nDiscuss billing implications of connecting multi-region VPCs\nMove large data from an on-premises datacenter to AWS\nDesign large data stores for the AWS Cloud\nUnderstand different architectural designs for scaling a large website\nProtect your infrastructure from distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks\nSecure your data on AWS with encryption\nDesign protection of data at rest and data in transit\nEnhance the performance of your solutions\nSelect the most appropriate AWS deployment mechanism\n\"Strongly recommended. More effective than many courses ten times the price.\"\nHere's what some existing students had to say about my course-\nBinit Datta: \"This is a superb effort by Rohan! Attempting this at the heart of the AWS Cloud computing deserves kudos to the Instructor. If you want to really learn AWS deeply, this is your one stop shop.\"\nGustavo Tavares: \" Very Good course with with kind of details that explain some problems that experienced professional had in the past but do not became sure why. The instructor provide detailed explanations and a lot of good tips for the certification exam.\"\nJose Floresca Jr.: \"This course is short but very comprehensive at the same time. This is what most busy professionals can only ask for.\"\nAnthony Wieczorek: \"I was very happy with the material. I just missed my first AWS Associate test and this class is filing in all the blanks that I was unsure of. Super happy I found it.\"\nThis is simply the best, most comprehensive and comprehensible course that will help you build on concepts you gained from CSA Associate, and eventually prepare you to pass your AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional exam -- on your first try!",

      "description": "* Updated for the 2024 CISSP curriculum and 2023 exam registration process *\nWelcome, I am Thor Pedersen, and I am here to help you pass your CISSP certification.\nWith over 700,000 enrollments from 201 countries, my CISSP, CISM, and Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) courses are both the “Best Selling” and “Highest Rated” here on Udemy.\nIn this course I will cover how to approach practice tests, how to deconstruct practice questions, time management, how to make your own CISSP study plan, and finally you get 125 HARD CISSP questions in a full CISSP practice test.\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam questions does.\n\n\nGetting your CISSP certification now is a very smart career move.\n1. The CISSP certification is the gold standard for IT Security certifications.\n2. There are more than 82,000 job openings for CISSPs in the US.\n3. The average CISSP salary in the US is over USD147,000 a year.\n\n\nWhat our other students are saying about my CISSP courses:\nI passed the CISSP with the ISC Book and Thor's lectures and practice questions. Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of the test you will get an explanation for each question and explaining to why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does.\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions\nAsset Security – 13 questions\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions\n\nI recommend students to do 1,500-3,000 easy/mid CISSP practice questions and 1,000-1,500 HARD CISSP practice questions before the exam.\nI only know of 3 hard CISSP practice sets: my own hard questions, Boson questions, and SNT. Wentz Wu also has hard questions on his CISSP blog, but not as full practice tests.\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it. This is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right and answering from an IT Security manager's point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.\nOn hard questions, you will score lower. It is normal to score 80%+ on easy/mid questions and 50-60% on hard questions.\nThe point of all questions is to find the gaps in your knowledge, learn how to deconstruct questions, argue WHY the answer you chose is the RIGHT answer in this scenario, making you ready for exam day.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nYou'll Also Get:\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days no questions asked, money back guarantee.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

You will get 90 minutes to answer the questions. The passing score is 76%, the same as the actual Spring certification exam.\nExam Pattern\n- Number of Questions: 60\n- Passing score:  300\n- Duration: 130 Minutes\n- Questions Type: Multiple Choice, Multiple Selection, Drag and Drop, Matching\n-  Exam may contain both scored and unscored questions, only scored questions will be counted toward marks\n\n\nVMware exams are scaled on a range from 100-500, with the determined raw cut score scaled to a value of 300. Your exam may contain unscored questions in addition to the scored questions, this is a standard testing practice. You will not know which questions are unscored, your exam results will reflect your performance on the scored questions only.\n\n\nYou can use these practice tests to build the speed and accuracy required to pass this prestigious certification for Java developers. This certification is now awarded by VMware and is also called the VMware EDU-1202 exam.\nOnce you have gone through the test you can also check the detailed explanation with links to spring documentation to understand the topic in depth. You must have good knowledge of exam topics and explanations will help you with that.\nThe Spring Professional certification exam (VMware EDU-1202) or \"2V0-72.22\" is designed to test and validate your understanding of and familiarity with core aspects of Spring and Spring Boot such as:\nConfiguration, Component-scanning, AOP\nData Access and Transactions\nREST, Spring Security\nAuto-configuration, Actuator, Spring Boot Testing\nThese practice tests are prepared by experts who have already passed the spring certification exam and it is designed to mimic the real exam with questions and allow you to check your speed and accuracy. You can use these practice questions to crack the spring certification test on the first attempt.\nHere is the list of topics included in this exam:\nContainer (20%)\nAOP (8%)\nJDBC (4%)\nTransactions (8%)\nMVC (8%)\nSecurity (6%)\nREST (6%)\nJPA Spring Data (4%)\nTesting (4%)\nBoot Into (8%)\nBoot Autoconfig (8%)\nBoot Actuator (8%)\nBoot Testing (8%\nThere are many tangible and intangible benefits of passing Spring Professional certification and these practice questions will help you crack this prestigious exam in your first attempt. If you have any doubt, ask in the Q&A and we'll try to answer those questions.  All the best for your Spring Professional certification exam.\n\n\nQuality speaks for itself...\nHere are a couple of practice questions from the 1st test  in this course:\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\n\n\nWhich of the following are auto-configured when using @DataJpaTest?\nSpring Repositories\nSpring Security\nDataSource\nMessage source\n\n\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe @DataJpaTest annotation auto-configures the following:\n• Caching\n• Spring Data JPA repositories\n• Flyway database migration tool\n• A DataSource - The data source will, as default, use an embedded in-memory database (test database).\n• Data source transaction manager - A transaction manager for a single DataSource.\n• A JdbcTemplate\n• Liquibase database migration tool\n• JPA base configuration for Hibernate\n• Spring transaction\n• A test database\n• A JPA entity manager for tests\n\n\nHere, is another sample question for Spring Professional Certification\n\n\nWhich of the following are web environment options offered by @SpringBootTest?\nRANDOM_PORT\nWEB\nMINIMAL\nDEFINED_PORT\n\n\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour different types of web environments can be specified using the webEnvironment attribute of the @SpringBootTest annotation:\n• MOCK - Loads a web ApplicationContext and provides a mock web environment. Do not start a web server.\n• RANDOM_PORT - Loads a WebServerApplicationContext, provides a real web environment, and starts an embedded web server listening on a random port. The port allocated can be obtained using the @LocalServerPort annotation or @Value(\"${local.server.port}\"). Web server runs in a separate thread and server-side transactions will not be rolled back in transactional tests.\n• DEFINED_PORT - Loads a WebServerApplicationContext, provides a real web environment, and starts an embedded web server listening on the port configured in the application properties, or port 8080 if no such configuration exists. The web server runs in a separate thread and server-side transactions will not be rolled back in\ntransactional tests.\n• NONE - Loads an ApplicationContext without providing any web environment.",

Many developers with hands-on experience with Java, Spring Framework and Spring Boot fail to pass this exam, as the format of this exam is really concentrated on detail knowledge of how the framework works and it's separate components work. In my opinion the way to pass this exam is to have good solid foundation by watching educational courses, reading books, articles etc., and when you feel ready, test your knowledge with some mock exams.\nI decided to create this course, as I myself have been struggling to find challenging questions to test myself before the real exam, when I was preparing for it, not so long ago. Also I aim to provide clear and detailed explanations on the topics, since this in my opinion the greatest benefit from mock exams. Now that I've passed it, I decided to help others and ease their path to certification.\nThis course will contain 250 unique questions along with detailed explanations on each, along with reference to different resources in case you feel you need a bit more reading on certain topic. Questions in this course are aiming to be as close as real exam questions, in regards to difficulty, or even harder.\nReal exam information\n- Number of Questions: 50\n- Passing score: 76%\n- Duration: 90 Minutes\n- Questions Type: Multiple Choice, Multiple Selection\nTopics included:\nContainer (20%) - 10 questions\nAOP (8%) - 4 questions\nJDBC (4%) - 2 questions\nTransactions (8%) - 4 questions\nMVC (8%) - 4 questions\nSecurity (6%) - 3 questions\nREST (6%) -  3 questions\nJPA Spring Data (4%) - 2 questions\nTesting (4%) - 2 questions\nBoot Into (8%) - 4 questions\nBoot Autoconfig (8%) - 4 questions\nBoot Actuator (8%) - 4 questions\nBoot Testing (8%) - 4 questions\nEach of the mock exam will follow the same pattern and will have the exact number of questions for each topic as it would be in the real exam.\nPassing this certification exam won't be an easy job, but if you succeed this will be very good not only for your resume, but for you, as the knowledge you would've acquired during the process would be invaluable.\nWish you the best of luck on the mock exams and the real thing as well!\n\n\nP.S: Forgive me for some typos or lexical errors, English isn't my native language :)",

As a matter of fact, having a Bachelors's degree & the CCNA will make you a better candidate when job hunting.\nHowever, what it does mean, is that those that do not have such degrees can still compete for the same jobs in the IT world if certain other criteria are also met.\nThe new CCNA is more likely to level the playing field for those with degrees and those with certifications!\nHere you are getting \"the creme of the creme\" when it comes to preparing for your CCNA certification exam.\nAlways remember that in order to succeed you must have the DESIRE, the DEDICATION, the DETERMINATION, and the DISCIPLINE to lead you to VICTORY!\nLaz",

Keep this in mind to pace yourself.\nTwo-Pass Approach:\nFirst pass: Answer all questions you're confident about quickly.\nSecond pass: Return to harder questions with remaining time.\nUse the Mark for Review Feature: If unsure, mark the question for review and move on.\nWatch the Clock: Check your progress every 15 minutes to ensure you're on track.\nAllocate Time for Review: Save 5 minutes at the end to review marked questions.\nRead Questions Carefully:\nLook for keywords like \"not\", \"least\", \"most\", etc.\nIdentify the core of what's being asked.\nEliminate Wrong Answers: Even if you're unsure, eliminating incorrect options increases your chances.\nUnderstand Azure Fundamentals:\nKnow basic cloud concepts\nFamiliarize yourself with core Azure services\nUnderstand Azure pricing and support models\nUse Official Microsoft Learning Paths: Complete the AZ-900 learning path on Microsoft Learn.\nHands-on Experience: Use Azure's free tier to gain practical experience.\nReview Azure Documentation: Especially focus on service overviews and use cases.\nStay Calm: Remember, you only need about 70% to pass. Don't panic if you encounter difficult questions.\nLeverage Your Experience: Draw on any real-world cloud or IT experience you have.\nBe Familiar with the UI: Know how to navigate the exam interface to save time.\nRead All Options: Sometimes the correct answer is a combination of other options.\nFocus on Understanding, Not Memorization: The exam tests your understanding of concepts, not just facts.\nStay Updated: Azure services evolve; ensure you're studying the most current information.\nRest Well: Get a good night's sleep before the exam and stay hydrated.\n\n\nMicrosoft Azure is one of the fastest-growing large cloud platforms. The opportunities for jobs in cloud computing are still out there, and there are not many qualified people to fulfill the demand.\nIf you're looking to change your career, this would be a good entry point into cloud computing.\nRemember, the AZ-900 is about fundamental Azure knowledge. It's designed to test your basic understanding, not deep technical skills. Good luck with your exam preparation!",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Introduction to Salesforce course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSalesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps businesses connect with and get more information about their customer base. Salesforce itself is a cloud computing software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that has been in business since 1999. It started as a cloud-based CRM software company years before SaaS became ubiquitous throughout enterprises. Over 150,000 companies run Salesforce in some form.\nSalesforce's services allow businesses to use cloud technology to better connect with customers, partners and potential customers. The software has become the number one for customer success and helps businesses track customer activity, market to customers and many more services. Salesforce is one of the first global companies to successfully employ a cloud-based CRM software. Salesforce has been able to leverage cloud technology and build a variety of applications for businesses to better connect to their customers and help give them key insights into their services through analytics and apps.\nFrom Fortune 500 companies to startups, everyone seems to be hopping on the Salesforce train. While their applications are vast, according to Salesforce, their CRM primarily focuses on helping companies with customer retention, keeping their customers happy, seeking out and executive customer acquisition, giving companies insights into their customers and much more. Companies use Salesforce to understand their customers, connect with them on a variety of levels and help grow their customer base. The cloud-based software allows companies to track (in real time) analytics, customer success and support, customer complaints and a variety of other CRM functions with the ease of cloud storage and access wherever the users are.\nBecause of its diverse selection of clouds and applications, Salesforce is also used by companies to assist with marketing, tracking sales and spending and analyzing performance. A variety of different clouds allow users to analyze various data, maintain communication forums with customers, implement sales strategies and more. In essence, Salesforce is the one-stop-shop for businesses to manage, maintain, communicate with and grow their customer base and revenue streams.\nThe huge growth of the market-leading CRM platform, Salesforce, is resulting in a dramatic Salesforce CRM skills and credentials shortage, with a 4:1 job to qualified candidate ratio. As you learn how to use Salesforce, you’ll discover how to create, capture, and deliver value to key customer groups through a combination of CX strategy, design and technology.\nUplatz provides this introductory Salesforce training to get you started on Salesforce from scratch and help you understand its landscape before venturing into this area. Uplatz's complete Salesforce Certification Training course will help you pass the Salesforce Administrator Exam (ADM 201) and the Salesforce App Builder (DEV 401) Exam.

      "description": "Welcome to Serverless Data Analysis with Big Query on Google's Cloud This is the second course in a series of courses designed to help you attain the coveted Google Certified Data Engineer.\nAdditionally, the series of courses is going to show you the role of the data engineer on the Google Cloud Platform.\nAt this juncture the Google Certified Data Engineer is the only real world certification for data and machine learning engineers.\nNote: This is not a programmers course on BigQuery. The goal of this course and the entire series of courses is to provide students with the foundation of the services you'll need to know for the Google Certified Data Engineering Exam.\nBecause SQL is a prerequisite for the course this course is mostly lecture. Don't let that lull to sleep though, this service is heavily covered on the exam.\nBigQuery is Google's fully managed, petabyte scale, low cost enterprise data warehouse for analytics. BigQuery is serverless. There is no infrastructure to manage and you don't need a database administrator, so you can focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights using familiar SQL.\n\nWe are in a data revolution. Data used to be viewed as a simple necessity and lower on the totem pole. Now it is more widely recognized as the source of truth. As we move into more complex systems of data management, the role of the data engineer becomes extremely important as a bridge between the DBA, developer and the data consumer. Beyond the ubiquitous spreadsheet, graduating from RDBMS (which will always have a place in the data stack), we now work with NoSQL and Big Data technologies.\n\nMost cloud computing vendors are moving to a serverless architecture. What's serverless?  Serverless is about abstracting users away from servers, infrastructure, and having to deal with low-level configuration or the core operating system. Instead, developers make use of single purpose services to execute code.\nImagine for a second being able to upload data into a storage bucket and then run SQL like queries against it. Many data analysts call this the grail to data analysis. With BigQuery, that's exactly what you do. There's no spinning up or configuring anything. You upload data in the form of a csv or json file and an query against it. I don't mean a hundred thousand rows. I mean a billion.\n*Five Reasons to take this Course.*\n1) You Want to be a Data Engineer\nIt's the number one job in the world. (not just within the computer space) The growth potential career wise is second to none. You want the freedom to move anywhere you'd like. You want to be compensated for your efforts. You want to be able to work remotely. The list of benefits goes on.\n2) The Google Certified Data Engineer\nGoogle is always ahead of the game. If you were to look back at at timeline of their accomplishments in the data space you might believe they have a crystal ball. They've been a decade ahead of everyone.  Now, they are the first and the only cloud vendor to have a data engineering certification. With their track record I'll go with Google.\n3) The Growth of Data is Insane\nNinety percent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years. Business around the world generate approximately 450 billions transactions a day. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5 Exabytes a day. That number doubles every month.\n4) The Data Revolution is Here\nWe are in a data revolution. Data used to be viewed as a simple necessity and lower on the totem pole. Now it is more widely recognized as the source of truth. As we move into more complex systems of data management, the role of the data engineer becomes extremely important as a bridge between the DBA and the data consumer.\n\n5) You want to be ahead of the Curve\nThe data engineer role is fairly new.  While your learning, building your skills and becoming certified you are also the first to be part of this burgeoning field.  You know that the first to be certified means the first to be hired and first to receive the top compensation package.\nThank you for your interest in Serverless Data Analysis with Big Query on Google's Cloud and we will see you in the course!!",

Do you want to learn from an experienced trainer who makes complex concepts simple and easy to understand?\nI am a VMware Certified Instructor who has taught thousands of hours of live training directly for VMware. Most lectures in this course are 5 - 15 minutes long. A few deeper topics are slightly longer. This course gives you a complete understanding of NSX-T concepts. So, join me in becoming an NSX Guru today!\nVMware NSX is the most disruptive network technology in recent memory. Demand for employees who understand NSX will continue to grow as the product reaches maturity. This course is designed to help you understand all of the concepts behind NSX-T 2.4. We'll start at the very beginning and learn basic networking. If you are a vSphere Administrator with a limited networking background this will be very helpful.\nNSX-T 2.4 will be covered in a few different sections. First, we'll learn the basics about NSX-T 2.4 objects, and differentiate the Management, Control, and Data Planes. From there we'll dig deep into switching and routing functions within NSX-T 2.4. We'll also cover security, and how NSX can provide microsegmentation.\nThis course will also help you prepare for the VMware VCP-NV exam. The new VCP-NV 2020 Certification can be achieved by passing the NSX-T 2.4 exam that this course is based on. In order to take the VCP-NV exam you will need to complete some course requirements from VMware as well. Be sure to check those out as you prepare to get certified.",

You'll have 75 minutes for each of these exams which is 50 percent longer per question than the the 90 minutes for up to 90 questions that you'll have on your actual exam. Be sure to read each question completely and thoroughly to be sure you understand exactly what the question is asking. Just as with CompTIA's questions, sometimes questions may have extra information that is irrelevant to what is actually being asked, while other questions will be very straightforward.\nWhether you found this course through my YouTube channel or through my website or through some other method, I'd love to hear any feedback you might have about these questions.

Test 2 and 3 are more difficult than others. My scores were 36, 29, 24, 33 ( yes i failed in the third one) , but I felt it was a good experience. The scenario based questions are nice and are close to the real exam questions. Please don't expect questions to repeat as it in exam ( I think only 4-5 repeated), but then it mentally prepares you well for the exam. I found the real exam comfortable post doing this. Scored 82.5% (33/40). I felt practice test 2,3 had some tough questions, but it's good in a way. The exam format is now open-book, so scenario based questions are more, so practicing this really helped.

Those who hold the GCIH credential have proven expertise in managing cybersecurity threats, handling incidents, and deploying defensive strategies to protect organizational assets.\nStarting with a foundational overview of GCIH certification and the critical role of an incident handler, students gain insight into the responsibilities, skills, and competencies needed to identify and manage security incidents effectively. The course then explores each phase of the incident response process, including preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Each phase is addressed in detail to provide a thorough understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of incident handling.\nPreparation is emphasized as a core part of an effective incident response strategy, guiding students through the essentials of building an Incident Response Team (IRT), establishing policies, and identifying necessary tools and resources. In the identification phase, students learn how to recognize security incidents, utilize Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), classify incidents, and document identification efforts accurately.\nDuring the containment phase, strategies for immediate and sustained containment are explored, highlighting short-term and long-term approaches and data preservation considerations for forensic analysis. Following containment, the eradication phase focuses on eliminating root causes of incidents, including malware removal, vulnerability patching, and verification processes to ensure thorough eradication.\nThe recovery phase covers strategies for system restoration, validation, and post-incident monitoring, ensuring systems are back to full operation while monitoring for potential lingering threats. Finally, the course closes with a focus on the lessons learned, where students learn to create post-incident reports, conduct review meetings, and update policies to strengthen security postures and improve future incident responses.\nThe GCIH certification focuses on equipping candidates with knowledge of common attack techniques, detection methods, incident response phases, and strategies to defend against and respond to various cyber threats. Key areas covered include understanding and recognizing indicators of compromise (IoCs), performing forensic analysis, conducting containment and eradication procedures, and applying relevant tools and technologies in incident handling.\nGCIH is widely recognized in the industry and valued by employers who need skilled incident handlers capable of responding promptly and effectively to mitigate the impact of security incidents. It's particularly beneficial for roles like incident responders, security analysts, forensic analysts, and other IT security professionals who are responsible for managing and addressing security breaches and ensuring organizational cybersecurity.\nThis course equips students with a robust understanding of the incident handling process and prepares them for the GCIH certification, enhancing their capacity to handle and resolve cybersecurity incidents effectively.\nThank you",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the JavaScript course by Uplatz.\n\n\nJavaScript is a widely used high-level programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive websites. It is a versatile language that allows developers to add functionality to web pages, handle user interactions, and manipulate content on the client-side (in the user's web browser). Additionally, with the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used on the server-side for building scalable web applications.\nKey features of JavaScript include:\nClient-Side Scripting: JavaScript is mainly known for its ability to run in web browsers, enabling developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It can modify the HTML and CSS of a page on-the-fly, allowing for real-time updates and a more engaging user experience.\nEvent Handling: JavaScript enables developers to respond to various events such as button clicks, mouse movements, keyboard input, and form submissions. These event handlers make web pages more interactive and responsive.\nDOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation of the web page's structure, and JavaScript provides powerful methods to interact with it. Developers can access, modify, and create HTML elements and CSS styles dynamically using JavaScript.\nAsynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming using techniques like callbacks, Promises, and async/await, allowing developers to handle time-consuming tasks without blocking the main execution thread.\nCross-platform Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a platform-independent language. This means that JavaScript code written for a web page will run on various browsers across different operating systems.\nLibraries and Frameworks: There are numerous libraries and frameworks built on top of JavaScript, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which provide additional tools and abstractions for building complex web applications.\nServer-Side Development: With Node.js, JavaScript can be used on the server-side, allowing developers to build server applications using the same language and ecosystem as the client-side.\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JavaScript uses JSON for data interchange, making it easy to communicate and exchange data between the client and server.\nJavaScript is an essential component of web development, and its versatility, ease of use, and wide adoption make it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers. It continues to evolve with new features and specifications, making it a powerful language for building modern web applications.\n\n\nUplatz provides this comprehensive JavaScript course with end-to-end demonstration of concepts starting from the most fundamental to the most advanced features of JavaScript. This course also includes the a full session (with free downloadable booklet) on the most important JavaScript interview questions and answers. Additionally, this JavaScript training provides you a comprehensive session on logical reasoning problems & solutions in JavaScript, again with a freely downloadable booklet of the session.\nThis JavaScript training will empower you with the skills to design client-side, platform-independent solutions that greatly increase the value of your Web site by providing interactivity and interest. You will learn how to use JavaScript to communicate with users, modify the Document Object Model (DOM), control program flow, validate forms, animate images, create cookies, change HTML on the fly, and communicate with databases.\nBy the end of this JavaScript course, you will be able to understand the core concepts and programming constructs on JavaScript and be able to use JavaScript to build complex web applications.\n\n\nJavaScript Course Objectives\nSome of the main objectives of this course include helping you understand:\nWhat JavaScript is and where it is used\nBasic programming

In an organization, the primary purpose of a security procedure is to __________.\na) Guide in decision making with regards to security\nb) Train employees and ensure consistency in security related business processes\nc) Indicate expected user behaviour\nd) Provide recommendations on implementing security processes\n\n\n2. Which of the following is a possible oversight which can happen with job rotation?\na) Privilege creep\nb) Lack of separation of duties\nc) Collusion\nd) All of the above\n\n\n3. Which of the following BEST describes exposure?\na) A flaw or weakness of an asset or a safeguard\nb) Damage, loss or disclosure of an asset\nc) An illegal act\nd) A weakness or vulnerability that can cause a security breach\n\n\n4. A notice placed on the common room wall about the usage conditions of Wi-Fi is a ______ access control?\na) Preventive\nb) Corrective\nc) Compensating\nd) Driective\n\n\n5. Which of the following is true about private key cryptography?\na) It is scalable\nb) It is faster than public key cryptography\nc) It offers nonrepudiation\nd) Different keys are used for encryption and decryption\n\n\n6. Which of the following models employs sensitivity labels such as top secret and secret?\na) RBAC\nb) DAC\nc) MAC\nd) Rule Based Access Control\n\n\n7. A digital certificate endorsed by a CA contains the issuer name, public key of david.cooper@itpro.com as well as the serial number, period of validity and the signature algorithm used. Which of the following is NOT true about this certificate?\na) It is only valid as long as the validity period mentioned\nb) The subject’s public key can now be used by the general public to decrypt messages\nc) It certifies that David Cooper is the subject\nd) The signature algorithm mentioned must be used to decrypt the public key\n\n\n8. Which of the following is a MORE serious concern for biometric authentication systems?\na) False positives\nb) False negatives\nc) True positive\nd) True negative\n\n\n9. An organization wants to test a software but does not have access to its source code. Which of the following is NOT a valid type of testing?\na) DAST\nb) Blackbox\nc) Fuzzing\nd) SAST\n\n\n10. Demonstrating to someone that you know the password to a lock without sharing it with that person is an example of?\na) Split-knowledge\nb) Zero-knowledge proof\nc) Work function\nd) Secure proofing\n\n\nSolution:\n1. In an organization, the primary purpose of a security procedure is to __________.\na) Guide in decision making with regards to security\nb) Train employees and ensure consistency in security related business processes\nc) Indicate expected user behaviour\nd) Provide recommendations on implementing security processes\nExplanation: A security procedure trains employees and ensures consistency in security related business processes. It streamlines security related business processes to ensure minimal variations and also offers consistency in the implementation of security controls. Guidance in decision making is provided by policies, and standards are used to indicate expected user behaviour. Recommendations on implementing security processes is part of guidelines which are optional in nature.\n\n\n2. Which of the following is a possible oversight which can happen with job rotation?\na) Privilege creep\nb) Lack of separation of duties\nc) Collusion\nd) All of the above\nExplanation: Privilege creep occurs when an employee accumulates access and privileges across job rotations because their privileges are not periodically reviewed and updated. They accumulate privileges which they don’t even need but still possess. Lack of separation of duties may compromise security but is not related to job rotation. Similarly, collusion can occur regardless of job rotation.\n\n\n3. Which of the following BEST describes exposure?\na) A flaw or weakness of an asset or a safeguard\nb) Damage, loss or disclosure of an asset\nc) An illegal act\nd) A weakness or vulnerability that can cause a security breach\nExplanation: Exposure refers to a weakness or vulnerability that can cause a security breach i.e. the adverse event has not actually occurred, but it is an estimation of the adverse consequences of such an event. A flaw or weakness of the asset or the safeguard is called a vulnerability and if a threat has already been realized then it is called experienced exposure.\n\n\n4. A notice placed on the common room wall about the usage conditions of Wi-Fi is a ______ access control?\na) Preventive\nb) Corrective\nc) Compensating\nd) Driective\nExplanation: This is an example of a directive access control. Directive access control mechanisms aim at directing subjects to a certain behaviour or to limit their actions. Preventive access control refers to prevent the unwanted activity from happening in the first place. Corrective access controls aim to return the system state to normalcy or correct a damaged system after an incident. Compensating access control provide additional security to address weakness in an existing security control.\n\n\n5. Which of the following is true about private key cryptography?\na) It is scalable\nb) It is faster than public key cryptography\nc) It offers nonrepudiation\nd) Different keys are used for encryption and decryption\nExplanation: Private key (or symmetric key) cryptography is significantly fast compared to public key cryptography because of the nature of mathematics involved and because it uses the same algorithm for encryption and decryption. However, it is not scalable as different pairs of users need to generate keys for their communication, leading to a large number of keys. Moreover, it does not offer nonrepudiation since the same key is used by different users for encryption and decryption.\n\n\n6. Which of the following models employs sensitivity labels such as top secret and secret?\na) RBAC\nb) DAC\nc) MAC\nd) Rule Based Access Control\nExplanation: MAC (Mandatory Access Control) implements access controls based on the clearances of subjects and the labels assigned to objects. RBAC (Role-based Access Control) assigns permissions to subjects based on the role that has been assigned to them in the organization. DAC (Discretionary Access Control) is a more flexible model which allows subjects which have ownership over objects to share them with other subjects. Rule based Access Control assigns permissions based on a pre-defined list of rules.\n\n\n7. A digital certificate endorsed by a CA contains the issuer name, public key of david.cooper@itpro.com as well as the serial number, period of validity and the signature algorithm used. Which of the following is NOT true about this certificate?\na) It is only valid as long as the validity period mentioned\nb) The subject’s public key can now be used by the general public to decrypt messages\nc) It certifies that David Cooper is the subject\nd) The signature algorithm mentioned must be used to decrypt the public key\nExplanation: All of the above statements regarding this particular certificate are true except for the claim that it certifies the subject David Cooper. This is not true because the certificate just certifies the email address david.cooper@itpro.com and not the actual user David Cooper. Technically, this email could belong to John Doe since the certificate does not explicitly certify that fact.\n\n\n8. Which of the following is a MORE serious concern for biometric authentication systems?\na) False positives\nb) False negatives\nc) True positive\nd) True negative\nExplanation: False positives in biometric authentication system are a far greater concern than the rest. A false positive means that the system has (wrongly) authenticated an individual as being someone else and this can lead to a compromise of the system security. False negatives may cause some delay as an authentic individual is wrongly rejected by the system, but it is not as serious as a false positive. True positives and negatives are desired traits of a system.\n\n\n9. An organization wants to test a software but does not have access to its source code. Which of the following is NOT a valid type of testing?\na) DAST\nb) Blackbox\nc) Fuzzing\nd) SAST\nExplanation: All of the above can be used since they do not require the source code, except for SAST. SAST (Static Application Security Testing) involves testing the application without running it, by performing a static analysis of the source code to identify vulnerabilities. DAST identifies vulnerableness in an application by executing it and providing malicious input. Fuzzing is a testing technique in which different variations of the input are tried to identify weaknesses.\n\n\n10. Demonstrating to someone that you know the password to a lock without sharing it with that person is an example of?\na) Split-knowledge\nb) Zero-knowledge proof\nc) Work function\nd) Secure proofing\nExplanation: A Zero-knowledge proof involves proving to someone that you know a passcode without actually revealing it. Split knowledge is a concept in which a passcode is split among multiple people such that all of them need to work together to authenticate. Work function is a measure of the amount of work required to break a cipher. Secure proofing is not a valid concept.",

      "description": "This is an introductory course to @RISK (Palisade's Monte Carlo simulation software on top of Excel). You will learn how to set up, run a simulation and interpret results for any type of model.\nWe use an example of a simple business example: Joe runs a small contracting business repairing residential exteriors. We introduce the decisions he has to make. Step by step we explain how, by using @RISK, he is able to make sound and consistent decisions around his business.\nJoe runs a small contracting business repairing residential exteriors. He and his two cousins working for him mainly contract on painting jobs, roofs repairs and landscaping. On average, he is able to service 8 monthly contracts during non-winter months and 4 monthly contracts during winter months, December to January. If there is an increase in demand, he can contract additional manpower at a higher, yet variable, hourly rate.\nPreparing next year’s plan, he is considering the possibility of hiring a third fixed employee on payroll. This would allow him to increase his offer and eventually be able to service an average of 10 contracts during non-winter months. By doing this, he would be able to increase his total annual revenue by servicing more customers and decrease the expensive variable cost when he needs to subcontract additional manpower. However, during winter, he would be tolled by a higher fixed cost, probably making him run on losses during three consecutive months.\nOn the other hand, he is also considering downsizing his operations by excluding one of his cousins out of his payroll. With a downsized operation, he could only be able to handle an average of 7 service contracts per month on non-winter months. This would lighten up his fixed cost burden during the low activity winter months. He would be able to hire any required flexible manpower at a per hour basis. Evidently, this option could be less profitable but more secure and flexible.",

The only reason is that after a detailed study of the theoretical part, it is easier for the student to follow the practical part. Many people do not like this type of teaching, but as an instructor, I want to do everything to teach and prepare the person who trusts me and buys my course as well as possible for an exam or some other business opportunity. If you don't have patience and only want the practical part, then don't buy my course, or if you only want to watch the practical part, then skip the theory. Basically, all my courses contain a large number of practical exercises.\nWelcome to the new course in which we will get to know one of the most difficult course of Microsoft better known as AZ-104 or Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate.\nIn this course we will cover all the most important areas that will help you to learn and prepare for the exam as easily as possible, and not only that, it also contains a lot of practical videos where you can familiarize yourself with the practical part that will help you in your later progress.\nIn the course, we will get to know the details of most of the services you will encounter during your cloud career. In addition to the Entra ID service, we will learn in detail about virtual machines, networking, storage service, we will learn and become familiar with Azure resource manager, containers and its services, backup service and all other content that you need to prepare for the exam, and all that with lots of demos.\nAt the end of the course, you will be able to manage, operate and delete the Azure resources you create. A good part of the course is dedicated to resource security, and we will also talk about resource monitoring. As an Azure administrator, you often serve as part of a larger team dedicated to implementing an organization's cloud infrastructure. You also coordinate with other roles to deliver Azure networking, security, database, application development, and DevOps solutions.\nThis course also contains many training sections in which you will be able to get acquainted with the creation of the resources themselves, but with a detailed explanation of how they work. In addition, it would be a good idea to open a free account yourself and follow ie. you practice with us. As the course progresses, you will see for yourself that you can learn a lot through the theory and practical part, which will also prepare you for later  exams.\nI must mention that this course contains more than what is required when taking the administrative certificate, so the knowledge gained will help you prepare for later, real world challenges more easily.",

I started to understand little bit that this is base for all programming language. I have around 12 years of IT experience. Hope OS learning should be mandatory to all before starting their career in IT\" by Happy.\n\"Very good explanation of all the learning materials. He is unlike many other instructors who just throws things out to you expecting you to absorb the things that are being thrown at you. He is someone who explains things in a manner that is understandable and absorbable even to O/S beginners with only limited knowledge or background in O/S. Two thumbs up from me! Thank you so much!\" by Mike\n\"I really enjoyed this course. Instructor made it seems like he is standing there and wouldn't leave the screen until the concepts gets into your head.

In case you are confused, the course is theoretical as opposed to a walk through of how to use Windows, Mac, etc. Instead, he provides an overview of the algorithms used to move processes from RAM to the CPU. I look forward to Part 2\" by John Simons\n\"Great, very detailed course. Ideal for non IT-educated students like me\" by Michal Burdzy\n\"Great Teacher. Takes concepts slow and repeats definitions and meanings multiple times so there is no need to pause the video or rewind it to hear a definition.

Because the course is designed as a one stop shop for Database Management System Concepts. And this 54 hours dedication will change your way of thinking towards computer science.\nWhat textbook should I follow ?\nI have used the book by Navathe. It's a great textbook. You can follow it. But I have referred lot of other textbooks like Korth, Sudharshan, etc as well depending on the topic. So its upto you on which textbook you are comfortable with but follow a standard author book. If you complete this course, you will find it much easier to understand these textbooks. But anyway if you complete this course with good detailed notes, you don't need to read any textbook as I am reading them for you and giving the contents in an easy to understand manner.\n\nWhy should you take this course?\n\nMy Courses has consistently gained best seller since release on Udemy, you would be joining over 9000+ students who are already enrolled in my multiple courses (19000+ enrollments).\nThere are lot of 5 star reviews left by students.

      "description": "Apache Spark is the single most revolutionizing phenomenon in Big Data Technologies. Spark turns infrastructure into a service, making provisioning hardware fast, simple, and reliable. Knowing this, many companies are transporting their big data analysis, staging, and storing needs to the Spark Framework. In this course, I will be preparing you for the CCA 175 Spark Developer Certification. This is the most popular and a very potent certificate in the Big Data realm.\nIn order for you to be able to get into this new realm of intense Tech competition, you will need a course to guide your way in Spark. The problem is that most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover the end-to-end implementation of the major components of Spark. I will be giving you hands on experience and insight into how big data processing works and how it is applied in the real world. We will explore Spark RDDs, which are the most dynamic way of working with your data. They allow you to write powerful code in a matter of minutes and accomplish whatever tasks that might be required of you. They, like DataFrames, leverage the Spark Lazy Evaluation and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) to give you 100x better functionality than MapReduce while writing less than a tenth of the code. You can execute all the Joins, Aggregations,Transformations and even Machine Learning you want on top of Spark RDDs. We will explore these in depth in the course and I will equip you with all the tools necessary to do anything you want with your data.\nI have made sure that this journey becomes a fun and learning experience for you as the student. I have structured this course so that you can learn step by step how Spark works and you can do the activities that I do in the course yourself. As you do these activities, you will become a master of Spark and complete any exercise asked of you on the CCA 175 certification exam.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the IT world with the one of the most popular Big Data Processing Frameworks: Apache Spark.",

However, you need a certain level of competency and knowledge that builds upon skills attained at the CCNA level before you should attempt the CCNP certification. To achieve any of the Cisco professional-level certifications, you must pass two exams. You can earn a CCNP certification in one or more of the following specialties: enterprise (including routing, switching, and wireless networking), collaboration, security, data center, and service provider. Cisco also offers professional-level certifications in Cisco Certified DevNet Professional, which proves your skills in developing and maintaining applications built on Cisco networks, and Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional, which proves your skills in incident response, cloud security, and other active defense security roles.\n\n\nWhat are the other Cisco certifications and what do they cover?\nCisco has associate (CCNA), professional (CCNP), and expert (CCIE) certifications. These include the CCNA, Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate (entry security analyst skills), and Cisco Certified DevNet Associate (developing apps on Cisco platforms). CCNP certifications in the enterprise (routing, switching, and wireless), collaboration (Cisco apps and services), data center (Cisco infrastructure), security (Cisco security solutions), and service provider (implementing and operating Cisco solutions), along with Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional and Cisco Certified DevNet Professional; CCIE certifications in enterprise infrastructure (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), enterprise wireless (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), data center (building and operating Cisco data center solutions), security (implementing Cisco security solutions), service provider (implementing Cisco service provider solutions); and design expert to prepare you for designing large networks.\n\n\nWhat should I learn before Cisco CCNA?\nBefore the Cisco Certified Network Associate examination, you should know basic networking, security, automation, programming, and IP addressing. The CCNA examination intends to certify that you know to perform basic Network Associate tasks. These include managing, monitoring, and maintaining an organization's network infrastructure. A CCNA will not need to architect, design, or develop an advanced network, but they will need to understand it, modify it, and configure it. CCNAs generally have some entry-level, hands-on experience in information technology. Many CCNAs will have an Associate's or Bachelors in an IT-related field. Alternatively, those seeking Cisco certification can take Udemy courses to learn the basics of networking and information technology.\n\n\nHow do I know if CCNA is right for me?\nA CCNA is generally ideal for those who are pursuing a career in networking or security. Cisco certifications are particularly prized for their rigor and valued by employers across the globe. Entry-level IT professionals who want to expand their career and improve their marketability (or their paygrade) may want to get a Network Associate certification to show their dedication to the field. Alternatively, those who seek to learn more about networking or discover whether networking might be the best path for them may consider taking Cisco certification courses. While alternative certification paths (such as CompTIA's Network+) exist, Cisco generally represents the gold standard in networking and security. Further, Cisco's entry-level certifications lead down a more advanced certification path.\n\n\nWhy do you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: Quality of teaching.\nWhether you just want to take the exam to measure your network knowledge, specialize in networking, are a university student and want to improve yourself, or want to learn as a requirement of your profession.

      "description": "Many new React Developers find React easy to learn and that is true. But the problem is when they are coding complex structures, the code becomes unmaintainable and ends up having spaghetti code. Some developers as well do not know all the functionalities that React offers and they end up coding like they are using Vanilla JS instead of doing everything the React Way. A bad way of coding always produces bugs and worst, an unfixable one.\nIf all React Developers know how to code the React Way, it will be very easy to create a future-proof React application.\nSo in this course, we will learn everything that you need to know to master React. Everything will be created from scratch and we will not use any UI libraries so that you can create your own in the future. We will also use Typescript and rest assured that every code will have types.\nTo apply all the things that you will learn, we will create an E-commerce Shop with a lot of functionalities and components created from scratch. We will also apply the best practices in coding to make our code clean and create a future-proof application.\nAfter this course, you will know all everything that you need to know in React and be an expert in coding the React Way! You will be your stack overflow every time you encounter issues because you will have a total understanding of every functionality and how they work.\nLet's have some fun in this course!\n\n\nHere's a detailed look at what you'll get:\nThe core concepts and theory\nHow to use React, JavaScript, and native components\nUnderstand how to navigate React Native apps\nA closer look at styling and animating React Native apps\nInstructions on how to use third-party libraries in your React Native app\nDetailed examples on how to use maps or an image picker\nA full user authentication flow\nHow to connect to a backend server from your app\nDebugging instructions\nAnd so much more!\nWhat will you need to succeed in this course?\nNO Android, Java, Swift, or C knowledge is required!\nJavaScript and React (for the web) knowledge is required though - you don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set (though there are refresher sections in this course!)\nWhat does this course offer you?\nThis course consists of 3 practice tests.\nThe practice test consists of 20 questions, timed at 30 minutes\nThe questions are multiple-choice.\nEvery question is associated with a knowledge area\nThe answers are randomized every time you take a test\nOnce the test was taken, you will get an instant result report with categories of strength to weakness.\nYou can re-take the tests over and over again as and when it suits you.\n\n\nI'd be very happy to welcome you to the course!",

Each question is followed by four possible answer choices, with one correct option. As an entry-level certification, the exam does not feature overly complex or intricate questions. Instead, it tests your comprehension of the material through standard multiple-choice questions that require you to recall information from your studies.",

Designed for professionals working in anti-money laundering (AML), financial crime prevention, compliance, and related fields.\nAre you ready to become a key player in the global fight against financial crime? This comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering (AML) course is designed to equip professionals, compliance officers, auditors, analysts, and aspiring CAMS-certified individuals with a thorough understanding of money laundering, its threats, and how to combat it effectively through strong regulatory compliance and investigative techniques.\nIn today’s complex financial environment, money laundering poses significant risks to institutions and the global economy. This course provides a well-rounded exploration of AML concepts, starting with a foundational understanding of what money laundering is, why it matters, and the serious consequences it can have on the financial system. You'll gain insight into the responsibilities of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (CAMS) and the integral role they play in identifying and preventing illicit financial activity.\nWe will dive into the global and regional legal frameworks that govern AML, including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations, the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the USA PATRIOT Act, and the European Union AML Directives. You’ll explore how these regulations shape organizational compliance programs and guide institutions in their AML responsibilities.\nThrough practical examples and best practices, you’ll learn how to build and manage an effective AML compliance program. From customer due diligence (CDD) and enhanced due diligence (EDD) to the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, we’ll show you how to apply a risk-based approach that aligns with regulatory expectations and minimizes exposure to financial crime.\nThe course also focuses on red flag identification, suspicious activity monitoring, and the use of technology to enhance AML efforts. You’ll understand how to work with transaction monitoring systems and how to properly file and investigate Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). Advanced topics such as money laundering through cryptocurrency, trade-based laundering, terrorist financing, and offshore havens will prepare you for the evolving challenges in financial crime.\nFinally, we’ll cover how to foster a strong compliance culture within your organization, the importance of AML training programs, and the role of independent audits and reviews in maintaining a robust compliance framework.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll not only have a deep understanding of anti-money laundering principles but also be well-prepared to contribute to an organization’s compliance team or pursue AML certification such as CAMS.\nWhether you're new to AML or looking to expand your professional knowledge, this course provides the tools, insights, and strategies needed to make a real impact in the world of financial crime prevention.\nThank you",

      "description": "Get certified for Python!\nThis course includes 5 Practice tests for the PCAP-31-03 Python Certification Exam (200 questions).\n\n\nWhat make these practice tests superior to other practice tests on Udemy?\nThese practice tests have been designed to mimic the actual PCAP-31-03 exam:\n--> match the latest PCAP-31-03 exam syllabus\n--> same number of questions (40 per practice test)\n--> same repartition of questions as per the PCAP-31-03 exam syllabus (i.e. 12% from Modules and Packages, 14 % from Exceptions, etc...)\n--> same format (single choice and multiple-choice questions)\n--> same duration (65 minutes)\n--> same passing score (70%)\nHaving the practice tests matching the actual PCAP-31-03 exam test, ensure that you know exactly what to expect on the day of the exam and train you to manage your time. Time management is critical when taking a timed exam! Students often failed the PCAP exam because they did not practice under the same conditions as the actual exam. There is little value in taking practice tests that have 100+ questions or are not timed as the PCAP exam as these tests will not give you a clue as whether or not you are ready for the requirements of the PCAP exam (not only with the syllabus but with the time requirements).\nThese practice tests include a thorough explanation of all answers to help you understand and learn some concepts you may not be familiar with.\nAlong with a thorough explanation of all answers, these practice tests include some Python code for each question to help you get a deeper understanding of Python concepts and get better prepared for the PCAP exam.\nStudents can ask questions to the instructor and receive timely answers!\nThese practice tests have been highly reviewed by our students:\n--> “I passed the PCAP exam today. The mock test questions in this course is harder than the real PCAP certification question which is good & helps us prepare better for the certification.”\n--> “Great explanations for all of the questions”\n--> “Great set of exams!”\n--> “I took the PCAP exam yesterday, and passed it with 92%. In my case, most of the exam questions were harder (in a way that they were very tricky and somewhat illogical) than the ones on this course, but by doing these practice tests, I got more confident in my knowledge, got more attentive to detail, and learned a couple of new things. Questions are brilliantly made, with various difficulty, and require logical \"programmers\" thinking. Explanations are concise, straight forward with practical examples, and can be used as a studying material. I am very satisfied with this excellent course, and I highly recommended it.”\n--> “This course helped me pass the exam with 90%. I had failed my first attempt with 69% after being confident about my chances. My confidence and belief took a bit of a knock and I was struggling. I managed to find this course and after reviewing the structure of the practice exams and the information attached; I knew I had to bite the bullet and purchase it. The questions asked were thought provoking and helped to improve my understanding of Python concepts. The explanations provided were excellent as it was detailed with the crucial information you need to improve. From practice test 1 to 4, I scored 55%, 65%, 77% and 70%, mainly by reviewing each test and understanding why I got the answer right or wrong. I would highly recommend this course to people who didn't manage to pass at the first attempt.”\n--> “Luke's explanations for each question were the best teacher! It really helped me take my Python skills to the next level. These practice tests, that not only helped me pass the exam, but also taught me to think from the perspective of the 'machine'/the program instead of the 'user' writing the code. I'm also grateful that Luke took the time to respond to my questions and clarify things that I was struggling with.”\n--> “I just passed the PCAP exam, and these practice tests were a key reason I was able to get it right. One of the best out there. Highly recommended.”\n--> “Thank you so much for these mock exams. Had previously failed the PCAP with a score of 64. These tests helped me prepare for some of my weakest areas and just passed the actual PCAP exam with a humble 74.”\n--> “Very convenient for testing your knowledge. The built in timer function (with pause capability) helps to simulate an actual test while allowing for pausing.”\n--> “These practice tests more than prepare you for the exam. If you can pass these tests, and understand the answers, then the exam will be no problem.”\n\n\nAdditional details on the Practice tests:\nThe practice tests match exactly the PCAP Exam Syllabus and Exam requirements (as of 2025) so you know exactly what to expect on the day of the exam!\nJust like the PCAP exam, each Practice test has:\n- Number of questions: 40\n- Duration: 65 minutes\n- Passing score: 70 %\n- Format: Single-choice and multiple-choice questions\nIn addition, after you have taken the practice test, all questions have a review with an explanation for all answers as well as some Python code that you can run to improve your understanding of the questions & answers.\nThe level of difficulty of the practice tests is the same as the actual PCAP-31-03.\nAll the questions have been created specifically for this course.\nFour practice tests follow exactly the PCAP-31-03 exam syllabus:\nBlock #1: Modules and Packages (12%) (6 questions)\nBlock #2: Exceptions (14%) (5 questions)\nBlock #3: Strings (18%)  (8 questions)\nBlock #4: Object-Oriented Programming (34%) (12 questions)\nBlock #5: Miscellaneous (List Comprehensions, Lambdas, Closures, and I/O Operations) (22%) (9 questions)\nThe 5th practice test is a little bit different from the other four as it covers questions on topics not explicitly listed in the PCAP exam syllabus:  Basic Concepts, Data Types, Evaluations, and Basic I/O Operations, Control Flow, Data Collections and Functions. Those are foundational topics and the PCAP exam will very likely have questions based on those foundational topics. To be successful with the PCAP-31-03 exam, you need to master those foundational concepts and this practice test will help you review and master them.\nAt the end of each practice test, you will get an overall score, as well as a score for each knowledge area which will help you identify which Python topic you need to review.\n\n\nWhy get certified ?\nThere is a growing need for Python programmers, and it is now more important than ever to gain recognition for your programming expertise and be able to prove your skills. Certification opens doors to a better job and a better salary! It is a great motivator for self-improvement and self-development.

This means that if a change occurs on one domain controller, that change then replicates to all other domain controllers in the domain, and potentially to all domain controllers throughout the entire forest. This lesson provides an overview of how AD DS replicates information between standard domain controllers and also read-only domain controllers (RODCs).",

      "description": "In this PMP exam simulator, you'll practice solving with 1080 Project Management Professional practice exam questions in 6 real exams. These questions are real PMP Exam questions are based on the PMBOK 7 Guide, the last edition launched. The exam is provided by Project Management Institute (PMI).\n\nFor PMP Exam in 2025, you need to study multiple topics from PMBOK 7th Ed very thoroughly apart from Process Group Practice Guide (which has now replaced the PMBOK 6th Ed.) and the Agile Practice Guide.\nThe important sections of PMBOK 7th Ed are mentioned in my Process Group Practice Guide and PMBOK 7 Mapping Document which you will get access to once you register for this course.\nApart from this this mock simulator also captures all the important aspects from Process Group Practice Guide (previously PMBOK 6th Ed.) and Agile Practice Guide for your PMP Certification Exam in 2025.\nThis set of 1080 Qs is designed as per the updated format of the PMP Certification Exam 2025 by the Project management Institute (PMI).\nThis simulator includes questions from the newly published PMBOK 7th Edition by PMI as well. Situational and scenario-based questions are at the core of the PMP certification exam. About 70-80% of the total number of questions in the PMP exam will be situational questions. Hence it is very important that you develop your skill of solving these type of questions in the context of the updated syllabus of the PMP Exam by PMI.\nThis question bank of 1080-Q is very carefully designed by me to help you achieve that expertise in solving situational and scenario-based questions as per the new syllabus of the PMP exam. 70-80% of the questions in this simulator are situational type exactly the same as you would experience in your actual PMP exam. The rest 20-30% covers the other important areas of the new PMP exam such as: Servant Leadership, Personality Indicators, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Disciplined Agile, Measurement of Training Outcomes, Project Compliance etc.\nFollowing are the top features of this practice test:\nPMP New Format 2025 Full Length Practice Test : 230 mins | 180 Questions\nQuestions from PMBOK 7th Edition covered\nSpecial access to PG Practice Guide and PMBOK 7 Mapping Document to help your preparation check welcome email after registration\nPractice tricky situational scenario-based questions of varying difficulty levels as per the PMP New Syllabus 2025\nNew syllabus topics covered: Servant Leadership, Personality Indicators, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Disciplined Agile, Measurement of Training Outcomes, Project Compliance, etc.\nPeople (42%), Process (50%), Business Environment (8%) Questions as per new domain distribution.\n50% Questions on Agile Methodology and 50% Questions on Predictive/Hybrid Methodology just like the new pattern of the exam.\nDetailed explanations for ALL questions with linkages to new Examination Content Outline ECO.\nNumerical problems on CPM EVM Decision Trees TCPI Communication Channels etc. to develop your understanding\n70-80% of the questions are SITUATIONAL/SCENARIO based.\nTimed simulation to provide you the actual feel of the PMP exam in the new format\nEvaluation:\nThe intent of tests is to explore the most basic most important topics of project management in light of the PMP exam so that you are aware of your gaps early in your preparation stage\nYour Score: >85% - EXCELLENT Revisit the explanations of the Qs you have got wrong solidify the learnings proceed to Practice Test2\nYour Score: 60-85% AVERAGE You need to thoroughly analyze the Qs and explanations you got wrong solidify the learnings before Practice Test2\nYour Score <60% NEEDS IMPROVEMENT It is prescribed that you analyze ALL the Qs explanations in parallel complete a course on project management basics\nThe actual PMP Exam will feel much EASIER after you have written this mock. You may find this mock Practice Test 2 3 and 4 difficult than the actual exam and that is designed intentionally to prepare you in tough conditions so that the actual exam feels much EASIER I do not want you to practice on easy questions and be in a false sense of accomplishment I prepare you the hard way to see you SUCCESSFUL in the end.\nHow to make the best use of this simulator ANALYSIS is the KEY:\nWith the new PMP Exam Syllabus you may need to study quite a few new topics such as Servant Leadership Personality Indicators Minimum Viable Product MVP Agile/Hybrid/Predictive Measurement of Training Outcomes Project Compliance etc. Use the books recommended by PMI to build your capability on these topics Google the new terms as well for quick learning.\nThe passing score for this simulator is between 60-70%. But you need to know that you should not get demotivated if you score less! DO NOT take the score of this simulator as a representation of your actual PMP exam. Instead take it as an opportunity to understand your knowledge gap and work on your weak areas. I would suggest that after this 230 mins simulation you should spend at least 10 hours analyzing each every question. If you have got a question wrong check the following things:\n\n\nIn which domain I am making the most mistakes?\nDid I answer a question incorrectly because I did not know the concept or the application of the concept?\nAre there any repeat mistakes I am making?\nIf a question took 5 mins to solve was there a way to solve it faster?\nAm I making any careless mistakes?\nIs there a common trend of incorrect answers Eg Am I getting more situational-type questions wrong?\nMake notes for your reference as you keep on analyzing the questions?\nIf you prepare like this you will be ahead of your peer group for the new format of the PMP exam prep in no time?\n\n\nWhat Other Students Are Saying About Our PMP Exam-PMI New Format 2025 (1080Q) (PMBOK 7 Updated):\nVery effective tool for preparing to take the PMP exam! (Eva, 5 stars)\nThese exams give the student a very good idea about how difficult the real exam questions will be. I was prepared, and passed the PMP Exam this morning. Well worth the cost. (Peter, 5 stars)\n\n\nAll the best for your PMP exam in 2025 and I hope you find this simulation useful.\n\n\n\n\n** Mister Solutions is an Accredited Training Organization (ATO) for PMP certification.

Microsoft SQL Server is one of the three market-leading database technologies, along with Oracle Database and IBM's DB2.\n\n\nLike other RDBMS software, Microsoft SQL Server is built on top of SQL, a standardized programming language that database administrators (DBAs) and other IT professionals use to manage databases and query the data they contain. SQL Server is tied to Transact-SQL (T-SQL), an implementation of SQL from Microsoft that adds a set of proprietary programming extensions to the standard language.\n\nThis course provides students with the knowledge and skills to maintain a Microsoft SQL Server 2019 database. The training focuses on teaching individuals how to use SQL Server 2019 product features and tools related to maintaining the server environment and the databases it contains and is designed for customers who are interested in learning SQL Server 2016, SQL 2017, or SQL Server 2019. It covers the new features in SQL Server 2019, but also the important capabilities across the SQL Server data platform.\n\nTopics include Installation, Data Storage, Data Maintenance and Recovery, Monitoring, Security, and Server Maintenance. This course requires that you meet the following prerequisites: Basic knowledge of the Microsoft Windows operating system and its core functionality. Working knowledge of Transact-SQL. Working knowledge of relational databases. Some experience with database design is recommended.",

We respect the Trademarks of the mentioned company and institution.***\nIPv6 is the future!!!!\nWe know that IPv4 addressing has been very exhausted because the demand on having IP addresses to route to the internet has became very big. For this reason, to be able to serve more people, IPv6 has been created.\nI have designed this course to explain to you everything about IPv6 such as addressing, notation, types, registries and much more, and also how to apply IPv6 on MikroTik routers.\nAs the demand on IPv6 has been increased lately, so you as network engineers should have the knowledge of how to deploy IPv6 in your or customer's network.\nThis course helps you also to be ready for the MikroTik exam which is MTCIPv6E.\nThe course will have theoretical topics and a lot of LABS. I advise you to have 4 MikroTik routers, a PC and internet connection to follow my LABS. Alternatively, you can use GNS3 with MikroTik CHR images to emulate the LABs on 1 PC.\nFinally, if you want to be familiar with IPv6 and now how to apply it on MikroTik routers, then I advise you to register in my course so I can show you everything about IPv6.",

      "description": "The Cisco Data Centers | Multicast course aims to provide a resource for network engineers to understand and deploy IP multicast technology for today’s data centers and enterprise networks. And to help CCIE Data Center certification candidates prepare well for their exams.\nIt begins with an introduction to the basic concepts of multicast through the use of graphics and short explanations. It answers the question: What is multicast, and why is it needed?\nThis Multicast course then discusses Layer-2 (MAC) and Layer-3 (IP) Multicast addressing. It also shows how to map the IPv4 Multicast address to the Multicast MAC address.\nThe Cisco Data Centers | Multicast course takes a deep dive into the Multicast protocols, including the host-to-router signaling protocol i.e. IGMP, and the router-to-router control plane protocol i.e. PIM.\nAfter building the Multicast foundational knowledge, it covers more advanced topics such as dynamic RPs (Auto-RP & BSR), anycast RP (PIM anycast & MSDP), and bidirectional PIM (Bidir PIM).\nThis Multicast learning material has been designed with a broad audience in mind while specifically targeting Cisco certification candidates (CCIE Data Center / CCNP Data Center), network architects, engineers, and operators. You do not have to be a networking professional or data center administrator to benefit from this course.\n\n\nThis professional development and foundational learning multicast course contains the following:\nHigh-quality, technical, on-demand videos cover all essential multicast topics.\nLab demos for a better explanation of all the features learned in the course.\nQuizzes to confirm correct understanding.\nExternal resources to enrich your multicast knowledge.\nPacket captures and protocol message formats for detailed information.\nDownloadable PDF slides for easy referencing.\n\n\nThe lectures in this course were divided into 7 sections:\nMulticast Fundamentals: Covers Multicast basics and Multicast L2 and L3 addressing.\nIGMP Protocol (Host-to-Router Multicast): You will learn the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), which is used between the Multicast receiver and its Multicast router (Querier).\nIGMP Features: This section covers IGMP Querier, IGMP Snooping, and IGMP version 3.\nPIM Protocol (Router-to-Router Multicast): You will learn the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM), and you will understand how Multicast traffic is forwarded in layer-3 networks.\nDynamic RPs: In this section, you will learn two dynamic methods (Auto-RP and BSR) to assign RP addresses to PIM-enabled Nexus switches.\nAnycast RP: In this section, you will learn how to implement redundancy in PIM RP by using PIM Anycast RP and Anycast RP with MSDP.\nPIM-Bidir & Phantom RP: This section covers the Bidirectional PIM (Bidir PIM) in Nexus switches and will learn how to use phantom RP for redundancy.",

The only reason is that after a detailed study of the theoretical part, it is easier for the student to follow the practical part. Many people do not like this type of teaching, but as an instructor, I want to do everything to teach and prepare the person who trusts me and buys my course as well as possible for an exam or some other business opportunity. If you don't have patience and only want the practical part, then don't buy my course, or if you only want to watch the practical part, then skip the theory. Basically, all my courses contain a large number of practical exercises.\nJun 2025: AI and ML section are now include new demo video.\nWelcome to the new course in which we will get to know the fundamental course of Microsoft better known as AZ-900.\nIn this course we will cover all the most important areas that will help you to learn and prepare for the exam as easily as possible, and not only that, it also contains a lot of practical videos where you can familiarize yourself with the practical part that will help you in your later progress. This course also contains many training sections in which you will be able to get acquainted with the creation of the resources themselves, but with a detailed explanation of how they work. In addition, it would be a good idea to open a free account yourself and follow ie. you practice with us. As the course progresses, you will see for yourself that you can learn a lot through the theory and practical part. which will also prepare you for later exams. I must mention that this course contains more than what is required when taking the fundamental certificate, so the knowledge gained will help you prepare for later challenges more easily. What sets this course apart from others is that it is designed so that you can learn more easily, understand and acquire the necessary knowledge.",

If you wish to take the exam, and have it on your Microsoft Learn transcript, you need to do it by then. This certification will not expire.\n\n\nThis course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate MB-920 \"Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals (ERP)\" for Microsoft's Enterprise Resource Planning apps.\nWe'll start by signing up to a free 30 day trial for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management Premium, and explore the user interface.\nWe'll then concentrate on Dynamics 365 Finance. We'll look at its core capabilities, and the principles behind general ledgers, accounts payable, accounts receivables, expense management, fixed asset management and budgeting.\nNext up is Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. We'll look at its core capabilities, and the principles behind the manufacturing process, the sales and procurement processes , and inventory and warehousing.\nFinally, we’ll look at Dynamics 365 ERP more generally. We will look at the business value of Dynamics 365 Commerce, Human Resources and Project Operations, common features, and reporting and integration capabilities.\nNo prior knowledge is required. There are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of the customer engagement features and capabilities of Dynamics 365 ERP apps. And with some practice, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification MB-920 - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume? And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.\nSo, without any further ado, let's have a look at how you can use the Udemy interface, and then we'll have a look at the objectives for the exam and therefore the syllabus for this course.",

Such questions are marked with a star.\nOur practice tests cover all the domains of the CC course with the same relative weight as the official exam:\nChapter/Domain 1 - Security Principles (115 questions ~23%)\nChapter/Domain 2 - Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery Concepts, and Incident Response (50 questions ~10%)\nChapter/Domain 3 - Concepts of Access Control (100 questions ~25%)\nChapter/Domain 4 - Network Security (135 questions ~27%)\nChapter/Domain 5 - Security Operations (100 questions ~25%)\nFull Exam/All Domains - All Topics (100 questions)\n2. In-Depth Question Analysis.\nGo beyond just the correct answer, understand the 'why' behind it. The rationale for each choice—right or wrong—is thoroughly explained, often with illustrative examples that complement the ISC2 study materials and enhance your understanding of the topics.\n3. Exceptional Question Quality.\nEach question isn't just reviewed—it has been put to the test. Questions are written and reviewed by an experienced professor and then further reviewed by Cybersecurity specialists who have taken the CC exam themselves so as to further guarantee quality and relevance. In addition, the questions have been refined with feedback from our student community, thus ensuring unparalleled quality and relevance.\n4. Complete Examination Flexibility.\nStudy at a pace that works for you. Whether you want to pause, stop, or retake, our practice exams adapt to your study rhythm, putting you in control of your preparation.\n\n\nCheck out our Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) Full Practice Exams course on UDEMY (also available in Spanish and Chinese).\n\n\nTESTIMONIALS\nDon't take our word for it; hear some of the many inspiring testimonies from our successful students (from other courses):\n\"I passed my exam on 08/12 and obtained my CC cert. These practice exams help with all topics covered. I did all practice exams and repeated a few of them. These practice questions I feel were harder than the actual exam. I like that they break down each answer as to why its not the best answer this helped me look at topics differently rather than memorizing a definition as to what it is. These practice test will require applied knowledge of the topics.\"  — Jessica Brown (5 stars)\n\"Great questions and answers, it gets you thinking and understanding the concepts. Similar to the exam. I was able to pass the exam once I understood the concepts\"  — Tarik ElQadah (5 stars)\n\"First things first -- PASSED! I did the ISC2 free training and felt pretty good but wanted more practice for exam questions. This was great, I got a fantastic feel for how the questions would be worded. This did a good job of replicating how the exam can trick you.\" — Lexi Burroughs  (5 stars)\n“What I appreciated most about these practice exams was the variety of questions and scenarios presented. It really helped me to understand how to apply the knowledge I had learned in real-world situations. Overall, I highly recommend these practice exams to anyone preparing for the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity exam. Thanks to Paulo and Andrea's hard work and dedication, I was able to pass the exam with confidence.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Salesforce Schema course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSalesforce Schema is a pictorial representation of all objects, fields and their relationships in Salesforce. It provides a dynamic environment to view and modify all the objects and their relationships.\nSalesforce Schema Builder provides a dynamic surrounding to feature new custom objects, custom fields, and relationships to your schema. This eliminates the requirement to click from page to page to seek out the details of a master-detail relationship or to feature a brand new custom field to an object in your schema. For instance, if you’re using Schema Builder to look at the details of your schema, you’ll add a brand new custom object while not leaving Schema Builder in Salesforce. The drag-and-drop interface helps you to simply add a custom object or new field and saves the layout of your schema any time you move an object in Salesforce.\nThe various objects and their relationships of a Salesforce application can be easily viewed using the Schema builder. And just not viewing, but we can also design, modify and implement new data models using schema builder. Schema builder has a drag and drop interface which is used to perform all the activities. It shows all the relevant details like - field values, data types, relationship with directions etc.\nIn essence, Schema Builder is a tool that lets you visualize and edit your data model. It’s useful for designing and understanding complex data models. Schema Builder in Salesforce provides details like the field values, needed fields, and how objects are connected by displaying search and master-detail relationships. You’ll view the details for both standard and custom objects in Schema Builder.\nThe Object Manager is a streamlined tool that lets admins access object management settings for both standard and custom objects. Object management settings include customization like fields, page layouts, and compact layouts. The Object Manager is available only in Lightning Experience. The Object Manager is the place to go to manage your standard and custom object such as custom fields, page layouts, and validation rules. If an object is included in a managed package or is for Salesforce systems, you may not be able to access those. Standard objects such as Account or Contact come with all Salesforce organizations. A custom object is something you have created or added to manage additional items.\nUplatz provides this Salesforce Schema training to help you get familiar with Salesforce schema, understand the database relationships between sObjects, define objects, custom fields, custom objects and their relationships, creating schema from Object Manager and with Schema Builder.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nDescribe the advantages of using Schema Builder for data modeling.\nUse Schema Builder to create a schema for a given object model.\nUse Schema Builder to add a custom object to your schema.\nUse Schema Builder to add a custom field to your schema.\n\n\nSalesforce Schema - course curriculum\n\n\nSalesforce schema Intro\na) Different types of database relationships between sObjects\nb) Build an application\nSalesforce Schema explained - part 1\na) Define Objects\nb) Explain Standard, Custom Fields and Datatypes\nSalesforce Schema explained - part 2\na) Explain different types of relationships (Master detail relation, look up)\nb) Explain Search layouts\nCreating schema from Object Manager\na) Search layout demo\nb) Create Transport Object\nc) Create Student Request\nCreating schema with Schema Builder\na) Create Student activity Object\nb) Create Student activity Junction Object\nc) Schema Builder overview\n\n\nIn Salesforce Schema Builder we have different options like Auto layout, View Options, Elements and Objects.\nElements :- Elements tab displays all objects, fields, relationships on sidebar as drop down.\nAuto Layout :- Auto layout in Schema Builder Salesforce is used to sort the layout of the Objects.\nView option :- In view option we have three filters they are display element names, Hide relationships, Hide legend.\nSchema Builder displays all standard and custom objects in our organisation. We have many option to view object like All Objects, Selected Objects, Standard Objects, Custom Objects, System Objects. Depending upon our requirement we can select the objects that to be displayed. When we select custom objects it displays all object in pictorial representation as shown below.\nYou can view your existing schema and interactively add new custom objects, custom fields, and relationships, simply by dragging and dropping. Schema Builder automatically implements the changes and saves the layout of your schema any time you move an object. This eliminates the need to click from page to page to find the details of a relationship or to add a new custom field to an object in your schema.\nSchema Builder provides details like the field values, required fields, and how objects are related by displaying lookup and master-detail relationships. You can view the fields and relationships for both standard and custom objects.\nSchema Builder lets you add the following to your schema:\nCustom objects\nLookup relationships\nMaster-detail relationships\nAll custom fields except: Geolocation",

So that, you will learn exactly what you need to, saving you a ton of time and frustration.\n\n\nA Brief Intro about AWS (Amazon Web Services)\nBusinesses of all sizes are rapidly embracing cloud computing to enhance their operational efficiency and scalability. Among the leading providers in this domain, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has emerged as a dominant force, offering a vast array of cloud-based solutions. In this article, we will delve into the world of AWS, exploring its key features, benefits, and how it can revolutionize businesses. Let's embark on this journey of unlocking the potential of AWS.\n\n\nUnderstanding Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud computing platform that offers a broad range of services to help businesses build and deploy applications and manage their infrastructure effectively. It provides on-demand access to virtual servers, storage, databases, and various other resources, allowing organizations to scale up or down as required, paying only for what they use.\nKey Features and Services\nAWS offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to cater to different business needs. Here are some of the key features and services:\na) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): EC2 enables businesses to rent virtual servers, providing scalability and flexibility. It allows users to launch instances of different operating systems, configure security settings, and manage storage.\nb) Simple Storage Service (S3): S3 is a highly scalable object storage service that allows businesses to store and retrieve data from anywhere on the web. It offers industry-leading durability, availability, and performance, making it an ideal choice for storing and backing up critical data.\nc) Relational Database Service (RDS): RDS simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. It automates administrative tasks, such as software patching and backups, allowing businesses to focus on application development.\nd) Lambda: Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets businesses run their code without provisioning or managing servers. It enables the execution of code in response to events, making it ideal for building scalable and cost-effective applications.\ne) Elastic Beanstalk: Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. It automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, and application health monitoring, allowing developers to focus on writing code.\nBenefits of AWS for Businesses\na) Scalability: AWS offers unparalleled scalability, allowing businesses to expand their infrastructure rapidly in response to increased demand. Whether it's adding more servers or increasing storage capacity, AWS provides the flexibility to scale up or down seamlessly.\nb) Cost-effectiveness: AWS follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, enabling businesses to pay only for the resources they consume. This eliminates the need for upfront infrastructure investments, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses of all sizes.\nc) Reliability and Security: AWS boasts robust infrastructure and multiple data centers spread across the globe, ensuring high availability and reliability. It also provides advanced security measures, including encryption, access control, and monitoring, to safeguard data and applications.\nd) Global Presence: With data centers located in various regions worldwide, AWS enables businesses to deploy their applications closer to their target audience, reducing latency and improving performance. This global presence ensures a seamless experience for users across different geographies.\nBest Practices for AWS Implementation\nTo maximize the benefits of AWS, businesses should consider the following best practices:\na) Design for Scalability: When architecting applications on AWS, design them to scale horizontally by leveraging services like EC2 Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing. This ensures that your applications can handle increased traffic without performance degradation.\nb) Implement Robust Security: Follow AWS security best practices, including strong access control policies, encryption of data in transit and at rest, regular backups, and monitoring of your infrastructure\n\nAWS Guide\nAmazon Web Services Guide\nAWS Job Roles\nCloud Computing",

I’ve also written many best-selling IT books, including Cisco CCNA Simplified, Cisco CCNA in 60 Days, IP Subnetting – Zero to Guru, and the entire 101 Labs series for A+, Network+ and many more exams.\n\nI’ve worked my way up from the helpdesk to network support, network consulting, and beyond, so I know exactly what it’s like to start from the bottom, and I know how valuable certifications are to your career. You simply won’t get called for job interviews without being certified.\n\nUnlike many companies, HowToNetwork NEVER uses IT trainers for its courses. We ALWAYS hire IT experts who are working on-the-job and ask them to share their real-world experience with you so you can hit the ground running from your first day.\n\nThis is one exam certification course. To qualify, you need to be successful in the below exam:\n\n\nCompTIA Data+ (DA0-001)\n\n\n\nCompTIA presumes around 18-24 months experience in data analytics before you take this exam, but if you are just starting out, then don’t worry because we have you covered. This is actually three courses in one:\n\n\nCourse 1 – Microsoft Database Essentials\nLearn to create databases from scratch\nConfigure databases for storage\nAdminister a SQL database\nFollow along with hands-on labs\nConfigure database security\nCourse 2 – CompTIA Data+\nLearn data mining\nUnderstand data types and structures\nLearn statistical methods\nCommon data analytics tools used by experts\nLearn data governance and compliance\nCourse 3 – Learn Excel From Scratch\nCreate worksheets and workbooks\nFormat spreadsheets\nInsert data in cells and ranges\nSummarize data with functions\nCreate charts and views\nFollow along with three real-world case studies\n\nWHAT SOME OF OUR STUDENTS ARE SAYING:\n5 Stars “It was an excellent course for IPv6 beginners. A lot of clarity on IPv6 fundamentals and hope to improve the same further.” - Suresh Y.\n5 Stars “Fantastic and fully comprehensive. I needed to learn how to migrate my IPv4 network of routers to IPv6, and this course covered almost all the bases. The authors were also responsive to my questions. I highly recommend this course to my friends who wish to learn IPv6.” - Wilson C.\n5 Stars “Great content, and the labs are awesome! For someone with absolutely zero prior knowledge of TCP/IP, I feel I have learned a lot in last one week.”’ - Pankaj M.\n\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU TAKE THIS COURSE?\nThere is currently a huge shortfall of candidates with data analysis skills and a wide variation in available job titles and responsibilities. The shortfall is around 625,000 job postings to be filled. There is a lack of consistency in educational program offerings and credentials (until now) and a way to standardize around a set of skills.\nConsider this course if you are interested in learning how to confidently interpret data insights and communicate them in a way that drives the business forward. The job description would be any role that analyzes business-specific data. Individuals likely report data analytics to management on a regular basis on business functions, i.e., they analyze and monitor dashboards, results, and trends.\nSuppose you have or want to develop strong logical and critical thinking skills if you consider it important to think through things. If you find yourself often asking ‘why?’ then you should consider this course. It’s particularly suitable for tenacious problem solvers who want data-driven solutions to problems.\n\n\nWHAT DOES A DATA ANALYST DO?\nThe data analyst is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting on data that can drive business priorities and lead to intelligent decision-making. CompTIA Data+ validates certified professionals have the skills required to facilitate data-driven business decisions, including:\n\nMining data\nManipulating data\nApplying basic statistical methods\nAnalyzing complex datasets while adhering to governance and quality standards throughout the entire data life cycle\n\n\nTypical job roles include:\n\n\nData Analyst\nReporting Analyst\nMarketing Analyst\nBusiness Intelligence Analyst\n\n\n\nWHAT’S INCLUDED?\nThis course is fantastic value for money:\n23 hours of video\nPractice exams for lessons and modules\nFollow-along labs where you configure your own database\nCase studies for Excel you can use in the real world\nAccess to instructors\n30-day money-back guarantee\nLifetime access\nCertificate of completion\n\n\nEXAM INFO\nExam Code: DA0-001\nMax. 90 questions (multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, and performance-based)\nLength of exam: 90 minutes\nPassing score: 675 (on a scale of 100-900)\nRecommended experience: 18-24 months’ hands-on experience in a lab or in the field",

Here's what some of my other students have to say about them:\nI passed my exam as of yesterday. Thanks so much for all the information. The way the course taught me how this test was going to ask me questions was so accurate. Thanks so much! (Katie 5-stars)\nUsed this course to prepare for the exam and passed first time. So far the best instructor I have found on this platform.  (Annette 5-stars)\nThanks Thor, this was excellent-keep up the great work! I passed on my first attempt after going through the course , this also helped in studying and passing Comptia Security+ because some of the concept I already got from studying for Certified in Cybersecurity. (Rosanne 5-stars)\nI passed my exam yesterday, I must say this course helped me a lot! it was my second attempt. I bought this course after I failed on my first attempt. THOR is a great teacher, with lots of techniques and insights during the lessons. this course is very easy to understand. Don't think twice go for it. The secret in life is not to give up! (Patricia 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of the test, you will get an explanation for each question and explain why the correct answer is the right answer.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CC knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions, and questions marked for review.\n\n\nYou should be able to pass your Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam using my course IF you use it correctly.\nThis is the approach I use for all my studying, and it seems to work for the majority of my students.\nWatch the entire course, take notes, use the study guide, and answer the chapter questions.\nRewatch each video class at 1.5x – 2x speed, and take notes.\nDo the 2 full practice tests to find your weak areas, and restudy those.\nRewatch the videos as needed to fill knowledge gaps.\nYou need to understand ALL the concepts, be able to explain them and be able to logic your way through convoluted exam questions.\nYou need to learn to deconstruct questions; what are they really asking here?\nDo not worry if you spend 2-3 minutes on a question to begin with; just learn to deconstruct the question.\nDeconstruct questions and answers:\n• Read the question; spot the keywords (PKI, Integrity, HIPAA) and indicators (FIRST, MOST, BEST), then deconstruct the question: What are they really asking here?\n• Once you have deconstructed the question, read the answer options.\n• Deconstruct the answer options, too, if needed.\nIt is possible for questions to have 2 distractors and 2 possible correct answers.\nAfter each practice test, review the questions you got wrong and read the question explanation. Then, restudy your notes and study guides, and rewatch the video topics you answered incorrectly on the test.\nRestudy the topic until you understand WHY the right answer is the right answer and why you answered it wrong.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today; let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

It validates their ability to effectively apply Scrum in real-world situations and serve as effective Scrum Masters within their organizations.\nTo earn the PSM1 certification, individuals need to pass an online assessment that evaluates their understanding of various Scrum concepts, including roles, artifacts, events, and the underlying principles of Scrum. The assessment consists of multiple-choice questions and requires a thorough understanding of Scrum theory and its practical application.\n\n\nOur practice exams are designed to help candidates prepare for the actual certification exam. A mock exam consists of questions and answers that are similar in style, format, and difficulty level to those found in the real certification exam.\nThe PSM1 exam is taken online and you only have 60 minutes to attempt 80 questions. You must have at least 68 correct answers to pass the exam. You ideally get 45 sec per Question. It is essential to be as familiarized as possible with these concepts as time is limited and many candidates end up leaving some questions unanswered.\n\n\nHere are some tips that can help you prepare for and pass the certification exam:\nUnderstand the exam objectives: The exam objectives provide a detailed breakdown of the topics that will be covered on the exam. Make sure you understand each objective and are familiar with the tools and techniques used in each area.\nTake practice exams: Practice exams are an excellent way to assess your knowledge and identify areas where you need to improve. You can practice our practice tests as many as you want until pass all the test with 85%.\nStudy the exam materials: The official exam study guide is a valuable resource that can help you prepare for the exam. It covers all the exam objectives and provides examples and scenarios to help you understand how the concepts apply in real-world situations.\nFamiliarize yourself with the exam format: Understanding the format of the exam can help you manage your time effectively and reduce stress during the exam. Familiarize yourself with the types of questions and the amount of time you will have to complete each section.\nPractice good test-taking strategies: Make sure you read the questions carefully, eliminate obviously wrong answers, and manage your time effectively during the exam. Don't spend too much time on a single question and make sure you answer all questions before the time is up.",

      "description": "Description\nMy training consist in 10 lessons. The duration of each one is between 60 and 90 minutes.\nThis is the ULTIMATE RHCSA Preparation Course. 30% of all first time RHCSA fail to pass the test on their first try. Be part of the 70% who pass RHCSA on their first try.\nClassroom training cost anywhere from 3500 to 7500 for a week worth of training. Who has that type of money, or time, take advantage of the discount price of this exam.\nThis is an engaging self-paced video course that provides learners with real world examples and how they may be tested in the RHCSA course.\nALL THE VIDEOS ARE FROM MY PREVIOUS TRAINING COURSE, WHERE AT SOME POINTS OF THE VIDEOS YOU WILL SEE THAT I ASK FOR QUESTIONS.\nTHE VIDEOS HAS NOT ANY KIND OF EDITION\nTHE VIDEOS QUALITY IS GOOD\nI DO NOT EXPLAIN HOW TO CREATE THE SERVER NOR THE CLIENT VIRTUAL MACHINE TO PRACTICE ALL THE OBJECTIVES - BUT I WILL UPDATE THE COURSE WITH THIS EXPLANATION.\nNO PRACTICE EXAM PROVIDED... But I will update the course with one practice exam.\n\nI GUARANTEE YOU if you practice every objective as I show on the videos, you will absolutely ACE the real exam. I focus more in the practice and less on the theory. Because the key to pass the exam at first try is \"practice and more practice\".\n\nWhat is different about my training from the rest of the courses?\nThe course I give is based on the key points to pass the EX200 (RHCSA) exam on your first try. It is worth clarifying that I do not waste time into basic topics such as: moving through the file system, creating directories and files, as these points are practiced during of my training.\nI expose each goal by the easiest way in which you can memorize how to do it, it is worth clarifying that there are several ways to achieve the same result.\nDuring my training, I mention several tips that will help you during the exam.\nGuaranteed to pass the exam?\nNo one can give you the guarantee that after take the training, you will pass the exam. Since the key to everything is practice. Even official partner courses do not guarantee that you pass the exam.\nBooks or documentation to use\nOn the internet you can find much documentation of each topic related to the exam, it is only know how to search and put it into practice.\nExample: How to extend a logical volume. If this same question puts it on the internet, you will get many answers on how to achieve it. Now you need to know how to apply it to your system.\nWhat distribution should you use in training?\nYou can use any distribution, but I recommend using a Red Hat based distribution (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL) Preferably using RHEL, you can enroll in developers at redhat and get a free copy of the software, or you can go and register on redhat where you can have updates for 30 days.\nIn my course I use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3\nHow to use this subscription of 30 days, on the same page explain you how to do it.",

This is Course ONE which is available now on Udemy.\nDomain 1-4 is covered in this course....\nContent between two courses is over 20 hours.\nEarning the globally recognized CSSLP secure software development certification is a proven way to build your career and better incorporate security practices into each phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).\nCSSLP certification recognizes leading application security skills. It shows employers and peers you have the advanced technical skills and knowledge necessary for authentication, authorization and auditing throughout the SDLC using best practices, policies and procedures established by the cybersecurity experts at (ISC)².\nObtaining your certification will prove your skills, help advance your career, and even gain support from a community of cybersecurity leaders here to help you throughout your professional journey.\nThe Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) certification is a vendor neutral credential; launched in 2008 by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC)2. This exam is very challenging even to software developers with experience because of the depth of knowledge required to learn in order to pass.\nThis course has been developed by an industry professional with over twenty years of IT experience. Course contains numerous aids to help the learning process such as demos, discussions, whiteboard designs, test tips, practice reviews and practice questions.\nThe CSSLP certification validates that the certified professional has the expertise to include the best security practices, auditing, and authorization into each phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). SDLC phases include software design, implementation, testing, and deployment.\nAfter earning their CSSLP certification, a software professional will be able to develop a software security program in their organization, reduce production cost, mitigate source code vulnerabilities, and reduce losses because of software breaches.\nThe CSSLP meets the Level I and II IA System Architecture and Engineering requirements of the DoD mandate 8570.01M. Additionally, the CSSLP certification is accredited for the requirements of ANSI/IEC/ISO Standard-17024.\nThe CSSLP certification exam is a well written exam evaluating potential candidates across eight different domains. The exam contains 175 question, multiple-choice exam is administered over a 4-hour period at a Pearson Professional Center.\nThe CSSLP exam questions are developed from the skills and information contained within the CSSLP CBK with the following tested percentages.\nNote Course is broken into TWO Courses due to size of content.\nCourse One Contains content for these Domains (This Course).\nSecure Software Concepts – 13%\nSecure Software Requirements – 14%\nSecure Software Design – 16% Secure Software Implementation/Programming – 16%\nCourse Two Contains these Domain Objectives.\nSecure Software Testing – 14%\nSecure Lifecycle Management – 10%\nSoftware Development, Operations, and Maintenance – 9%\nSupply Chain and Software Acquisition – 8%\nWho would be the target audience?\nThe audience should be willing to study and review materials to pass the CSSLP Plus and meet the requirements set by ISC2\nIn order to become a fully certified CSSLP, (ISC)² requires the candidate to have a minimum of four years cumulative paid full-time SDLC experience in one or more of the eight domains of the CSSLP credential. A candidate can substitute one year of experience for a four-year college degree. If a candidate passes the certification exam but does not possess the required years of experience they will become an associate of (ISC)² and have five years to earn the experience. At which time they will become a fully certified CSSLP.\nRoles which would benefit from taking the exam.\nSoftware Developers Software Engineers DevOps Engineers Enterprise Architects Application Developers Security Professionals\nWhat you will learn\n• Protecting data and business assets and complying with applicable laws and regulations\n• Following secure coding standards and how documentation can help in the maintenance and operations of software\n• Identifying software vulnerabilities and how to perform testing of units of code\n• Managing each phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC)\n• Developing security to meet environmental risk and operational challenges\n• Supporting incident response, patch and vulnerability management, and continuity of operations\n• Supporting the software acquisitions process\n• Understanding security related frameworks and best practices\nTechCommanders is an online training platform for both aspiring and veteran IT professionals interested in next generation IT Skills.\nTechCommanders is led by Joseph Holbrook, a highly sought-after technology industry veteran.\nTechcommanders offers blended learning which allows the students to learn on demand but with live training.\nCourses offered are used to prepare students to take certification exams in Cloud, DevOps, IT Security and Blockchain.\nTechcommanders was established in Jacksonville, Florida in 2020 by Joseph Holbrook, both a US Navy Veteran and a technology industry veteran.

The goal is to bridge the gap of the basics and the complicated features of the framework.\nDuring the recent years, the IT industry has moved so fast that it's really hard to keep track of it, and I with all the more and more complicated products to be developed, it's critical to understand more advanced features of Hibernate and JPA to be able to support these asks from a development standpoint.\nSpring is one of the most frequent framework that is used within the IT industry. I amm going to take this learning experience even further by connecting the dots between Hibernate and Spring, focusing on specific and complex use-cases.\nIn the course the following topics will be covered:\nEntity-state transition pitfalls with merging\nThe performance aspect of lazy loading data\nDTO projections and the positive performance impact\nUsing covering indices with Hibernate\nFlushing fine-tuning\nConcurrency-control in depth\nStatement batching in detail with optimizations\nThis is a course tailored specifically for you in order to improve your skills and move your career forward as a professional engineer.\nNote that the course does not cover the basics of JPA and Hibernate but assumes that the foundation is already there.\nThe training also includes a number of practices after almost each section which you can use to polish your skills, and to make sure you understood the specific block.",

No questions asked.\nI have created the tests to mimic the official exam pattern. Therefore, I have taken roughly the same number of questions per test as it is on the official exam. I have also set the time to complete each test as per the official exam format.\n\n\n\nOur Tests are based on the following AZ-700 exam topics:\nDesign and implement core networking infrastructure (20–25%)\nDesign, implement, and manage connectivity services (20–25%)\nDesign and implement application delivery services (20–25%)\nDesign and implement private access to Azure services (5–10%)\nSecure network connectivity to Azure resources (15–20%)\n\n\nHow to pass the official AZ-700 exam in the first attempt?\nPassing the official exam is not at all difficult.

At the end of each test, you will get to see a detailed test report. The report will display questions that were answered correctly and the ones you got wrong.\nEvery answer option, whether correct or incorrect has a detailed explanation. It’s important to know the correct answer to a question, but, it is even more important to understand why other given options are incorrect in the context of the question. Therefore, it is required that you go through the explanations given for each answer option and not just read for the correct ones.\nThe idea is to retake each test several times until you are able to score atleast 90% here.

      "description": "The Data Mining - Unsupervised Learning course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of unsupervised learning techniques within the field of data mining. Unsupervised learning is a category of machine learning where algorithms are applied to unlabelled data to discover patterns, structures, and relationships without prior knowledge or guidance.\nThroughout the course, students will explore various unsupervised learning algorithms and their applications in uncovering hidden insights from large datasets. The emphasis will be on understanding the principles, methodologies, and practical implementation of these algorithms rather than focusing on mathematical derivations.\nThe course will begin with an introduction to unsupervised learning, covering the basic concepts and goals. Students will learn how unsupervised learning differs from supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, and the advantages and limitations of unsupervised techniques. The importance of pre-processing and data preparation will also be discussed to ensure quality results.\nThe first major topic of the course will be clustering techniques. Students will dive into different clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, density-based clustering (e.g., DBSCAN), and expectation-maximization (EM) clustering. They will learn how to apply these algorithms to group similar data points together and identify underlying patterns and structures. The challenges and considerations in selecting appropriate clustering methods for different scenarios will be explored.\nThe course will then move on to dimensionality reduction, which aims to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining relevant information. Students will explore techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). They will understand how these methods can be used to visualize high-dimensional data and extract meaningful representations that facilitate analysis and interpretation.\nAssociation rule mining will be another key topic covered in the course. Students will learn about the popular Apriori algorithm and FP-growth algorithm, which are used to discover interesting relationships and associations among items in transactional datasets. They will gain insights into evaluating and interpreting association rules, including support, confidence, and lift measures, and their practical applications in market basket analysis and recommendation systems.\nThe course will also address outlier detection, a critical task in unsupervised learning. Students will explore statistical approaches such as z-score and modified z-score, as well as distance-based approaches like the Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest. They will understand how to identify anomalies in data, which can provide valuable insights into potential fraud detection, network intrusion detection, or system failure prediction.\nEvaluation and validation of unsupervised learning models will be an essential aspect of the course. Students will learn about internal and external evaluation measures, including silhouette coefficient, purity, and Rand index. They will gain skills in assessing the quality of clustering results and measuring the performance of dimensionality reduction techniques.\nThroughout the course, students will be exposed to various real-world applications of unsupervised learning. They will discover how market segmentation can be achieved through clustering, enabling businesses to target specific customer segments effectively. They will also explore image and text clustering, which has applications in image recognition, document organization, and recommendation systems. The course will highlight anomaly detection, which plays a crucial role in identifying fraudulent transactions, network intrusions, or manufacturing defects. Lastly, students will learn how unsupervised learning powers recommender systems, providing personalized recommendations based on user behaviour and preferences.\nHands-on experience will be a significant component of the course. Students will work on practical exercises and projects, applying unsupervised learning algorithms to real-world datasets using popular data mining tools and programming libraries such as Python's scikit-learn or R's caret package. They will gain proficiency in pre-processing data, selecting appropriate algorithms, fine-tuning parameters, and interpreting and visualizing the results.\nBy the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of unsupervised learning techniques, their practical applications, and the ability to leverage these methods to discover valuable insights and patterns from unlabelled data.",

For most aspiring individuals, AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals is an ideal start to their Azure certification journey.\n\n\nWhy Azure?\nEven though there are many cloud computing platforms available, three or four of them are leading the cloud computing industry. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are the giants in the world of cloud computing, AWS being the largest but Azure experiencing the maximum growth. Microsoft Azure is fast becoming the number one choice for public cloud services. Increase in the growth of the cloud and investments poured into the development of Azure means that there will be a huge demand for Azure professionals who can use its tools and services to build, deploy, manage and store applications in the cloud.\n\n\nGetting started with Cloud Computing\nCloud computing refers to the technology that provides access to varied computing resources over the internet that include serverless computing, virtual machines, storage, security, machine learning, and more. All you need to do is use your computer or mobile device to connect to your cloud service provider through the internet. Cloud computing applications and platforms are rapidly growing across all industries, serving as the IT platform that drives emerging digital businesses. Cloud combines platforms and applications that are revolutionizing the ways in which businesses function, and have made processes easier. A majority of businesses today have at least some portion of their computing infrastructure in the cloud.\nThe cloud service providers have massive data centers that contain thousands of servers, storage systems and components that are crucial for the organizations. These data centers are in secure locations and store a large amount of data. The users connect to these data centers to retrieve data or use it when required. When you use cloud services, you actually pay only for the services you use, and there are no charges upfront. In essence, Cloud computing is a term referred to storing and accessing of data over the internet. It doesn't store any data on the hard drive of your personal or office computer. In cloud computing, you access data from a remote server.\nCloud computing can be used for various purposes: machine learning, data analysis, storage and backup, streaming media content and so much more. The cloud infrastructure can be beneficial for creating and testing applications, automating software delivery, publishing blogs, and the like.\n\n\nFeatures & Advantages of Microsoft Azure\nOn-demand scalability of your IT needs with no requirement to run a data center yourself with devoted IT staff\nAppropriate backups for your virtual machines and data\nFast data transfer and low dormancies\nGlobally spread Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)\nTop level Cloud security\nFlexibility in Infrastructure\nHigh availability Backup and Disaster Recovery\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nThis Azure course provides foundational level knowledge of cloud services and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure.\nLearn about cloud computing\nWhy is cloud computing important?\nWhat is Microsoft Azure?\nWhat are the various Azure services?\nWhat are the various uses of Azure?\nLearn about cloud services of Microsoft Azure, the types of cloud models, and the types of cloud services\nUnderstand about Azure core cloud architectural components, Azure services and products, Azure solutions, and Azure management tools\nGet familiar with Azure security, identity, governance, monitoring, reporting, and standards\nGet details on Azure subscriptions, planning and managing costs, support options, SLAs, and service lifecycles\nCloud Computing concepts and Cloud models\nLearn Azure services\nLearn Azure Compute\nGet knowledge of Azure VMs and Containers\nUnderstand Azure CDN\nUnderstand Azure Storage\nLearn about IoT and Machine Learning with Azure\nUnderstand Azure Policy\n\n\nMicrosoft Azure Portal\nThe Azure portal is a web-based application which can be used to create, manage and remove Azure resource and services. Azure is a cloud computing platform and an online portal that allows you to access and manage cloud services and resources provided by Microsoft. These services and resources include storing your data and transforming it, depending on your requirements. To get access to these resources and services, all you need to have is an active internet connection and the ability to connect to the Azure portal.\n\n\nMicrosoft Azure - Course Syllabus\nWhat is Microsoft Azure\nAzure Basics\nAzure Features\nAzure Glossary\nCloud Computing Basics\nCloud Computing Terminology\nAzure Domains\nLegacy Application Modernization\nAzure Portals\nWhat is the Best Model for an Enterprise\nAzure Management Portal\nAzure Subscription and Billing\nAzure Storage Account\nAzure Websites and Services\nAzure Network Service\nAzure Compute Service\nCreating a Virtual Machine\nCreating Availability Set\nScaling Azure Virtual Machine\nAzure App Service\nCreating a Web App and Deploying\nAzure Mobile App Service\nAzure Notification Hub and Mobile Engagement\nAzure Function Apps\nAzure API Apps and API Management\nAzure Functions\nCreate an API using Azure Portal",

We’ll create a computer vision resource in a free Azure subscription, and use it to analyze images. We’ll create captions and dense captions, looking at the results in text and in JSON format, before looking at other features.\nCreate, train, evaluate and consume a custom image analysis model. After that, we’ll create a custom image analysis model. We will train it to recognise three different types of products, and then test it so that it can identify them in new photos.\nProgramming in C#. Finally, we’ll find out how to analyse images in code. We’ll use Visual Studio and customise code to connect to both the computer vision and the custom image resources, and use them to analyse images and return the analysis.\nWe’ll go through several practical examples, so you can see how you can analyse your own images.\nBy the end of the course, you'll be much more confident about using building an Azure AI Vision solution and perhaps even take the official Microsoft assessment.

Each question includes not only the correct answer but also a detailed explanation, a glossary of key terms, and a real-world application scenario—ensuring comprehension, not just memorization.\nWhy Choose This Course?\n6 Realistic Exam-Style Tests\nPractice with six comprehensive tests that simulate the real MLA-C01 format and difficulty. Every domain and nuance of the exam is covered.\nFull Coverage of All Exam Domains\nYou’ll be evaluated across all MLA-C01 knowledge areas:\nData Ingestion and Feature Engineering\nExploratory Data Analysis\nModel Development and Training\nDeployment and Inference\nOperations, Monitoring, and Security\nDetailed Explanations for Every Answer\nEach question—whether correct or incorrect—comes with a clear explanation based on AWS best practices.\nGlossary of Technical Terms\nYou’ll find concise definitions of key concepts such as SageMaker Pipelines, MLOps, Feature Store, Model Registry, and more.\nReal-World Use Cases\nScenarios that demonstrate how each concept applies to real business and engineering challenges, helping you retain what matters.\nUnlimited Retakes + Mobile Access\nPractice as often as you like and study wherever you are with the Udemy app.\nInstructor Support + 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee\nAsk questions directly to a certified AWS instructor and get answers that clarify complex topics. If you're not satisfied, request a full refund within 30 days.\nWho Should Enroll\nMachine learning engineers and developers pursuing MLA-C01 certification\nProfessionals seeking practical, hands-on experience with AWS ML services\nAnyone aiming to build, deploy, and manage machine learning solutions at scale in the AWS Cloud\nSample Question\n===\nQuestion:\nYou are a machine learning engineer at a fintech company tasked with developing and deploying an end-to-end machine learning workflow for fraud detection. The workflow includes data extraction, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. The company requires the solution to be scalable, support complex dependencies between tasks, and provide robust monitoring and versioning capabilities. Additionally, the workflow must integrate seamlessly with existing AWS services.\nWhich deployment orchestrator is the MOST SUITABLE for managing and automating your ML workflow?\nOption 1: Use AWS Step Functions to build a serverless workflow that integrates with SageMaker for model training and deployment.\nExplanation: Incorrect. AWS Step Functions can orchestrate tasks, but lack built-in ML-specific features like lineage tracking, parameter tuning, versioning, and integration with SageMaker experiment tracking. It requires more manual code and operational overhead.\nOption 2: Use Amazon SageMaker Pipelines to orchestrate the entire ML workflow.\nExplanation: Correct. SageMaker Pipelines supports all key stages of an ML lifecycle natively—preprocessing, training, tuning, evaluation, deployment, versioning, and lineage. It provides scalability, reproducibility, and seamless AWS integration.\nOption 3: Use AWS Lambda functions to manually trigger each step of the ML workflow.\nExplanation: Incorrect. Manually chaining Lambda functions lacks dependency management, monitoring, and built-in versioning. It increases operational complexity and is not suitable for ML workflows.\nOption 4: Use Apache Airflow to define and manage the workflow with custom DAGs.\nExplanation: Incorrect. Apache Airflow is flexible for DAG orchestration but requires significant custom configuration to integrate deeply with SageMaker and handle model registry and versioning. It’s less efficient for AWS-native ML workflows.\nGlossary\nSageMaker Pipelines: AWS-native ML workflow orchestration service with built-in support for data processing, training, tuning, and deployment.\nModel Versioning: Tracking and managing multiple versions of models for rollback, reproducibility, and audits.\nHyperparameter Tuning: The process of finding the best set of hyperparameters to optimize model performance.\nStep Functions: Serverless orchestration of workflows and state machines, not optimized for ML lifecycle management.\nApache Airflow: Open-source orchestration tool often used with custom integrations for data pipelines.\nReal-World Application\nIn a real fintech use case, a team might use SageMaker Pipelines to orchestrate a fraud detection workflow. This includes:\nAutomatically ingesting transaction data\nPerforming feature engineering\nTraining multiple models with different hyperparameters\nDeploying the best model to a SageMaker endpoint\nUsing built-in version control and lineage tracking to ensure auditability and compliance\n===\nThis allows the team to retrain models frequently, track every change, and maintain high prediction accuracy—all without manual orchestration or infrastructure complexity. It also reduces time-to-deploy and supports CI/CD for ML.\nDon’t rely on memorization alone—develop practical skills, sharpen your confidence, and pass the MLA-C01 exam with ease.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the MongoDB course by Uplatz.\n\n\nMongoDB is a very popular NoSQL database that is fast and scalable. When scalability and speed are required, this database shines. It is a document database which imposes very little and has drivers for many programming languages. MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.\n\n\nUplatz provides practical training on MongoDB with focus on real-world scenarios and examples. This MongoDB training course will get you familiar with this unique database and arm you with the essential skills to start using mongo to power your software application. This course will teach you how to get mongo running, manipulate and query data, index for speed, and arm you with the essential skills required to start using Mongo.\nAs table-based databases struggle to cope with an ever-growing variety of data, this MongoDB training course will show you how its document-oriented nature will allow you to quickly build highly scalable applications. You will gain the skills to develop, administer, secure, and scale MongoDB-based applications, and acquire low-cost, data-driven applications with MongoDB as the back-end database.\nThis MongoDB course is designed to give delegates experience of installing and using the MongoDB database. It introduces delegates to the concept of a document-oriented database, then shows how to set up MongoDB for use. Delegates use the built-in shell and various APIs to build a database access application and manipulate data. We also investigate optimising queries using indexes and aggregating data with MongoDB functions.\nThe course ends with some popular interview questions that you will face in a MongoDB database developer/architect/DBA job role.\n\n\nMongoDB Course Curriculum\n\n\nIntroduction to NoSQL Architecture with MongoDB\nWhat Is MongoDB?\nDownloading the required Software\nInstallation and Configuration\nMongoDB Advantages\nMongoDB Data Modelling\nMongoDB Tools, Collection and Documents\nConfiguration Files\nTouring the File Structure\nSecuring the Installation\n\n\nCRUD and the MongoDB Shell\nIntroduction to CRUD\nIntroduction to the MongoDB API\nCreating a Database, Collection and Documents\n\n\nData Modelling and Schema Design\nMongoDB Database References\nModel Tree Structures\nMongoDB Analyzing Queries\nMongoDB Atomic Operations\nMongoDB Map Reduce\nMongoDB Text Search\nMongoDB Regular Expression\nMongoDB Capped Collections\nData Storage\nWorking with Datatypes\nCollections\nDocument Datatypes\nCreating _id Fields\n\n\nQuerying Data\nDatabases and Collections\nQuerying Collections\nWorking with Operators\nReferencing a Database\nQuerying Dates\n\n\nManipulating Data\nInserting Data into Collections\nUpdates\nDeletes\nAtomic Operations\nRemoving Data\nCapped Collections\n\n\nHigh Performance Options\nCreating Indexes\nManipulating Index Behaviour\nIndex Properties\nSpecialised Index Types\nReplication\nSharding\n\n\nAggregation Framework\nAggregating Results\nSingle Purpose Functions\nThe Aggregation Pipeline\nDate Aggregation Operators\n\n\nIndexing\nIndexing and Aggregation\nIndexing, query profiling and the query optimizer\nGeospatial Indexes\nIndex types, Index Properties\nMongoDB Advanced Indexing\nMongoDB Indexing Limitations\nAggregation Introduction\n\n\nReplication\nReplication Concept\nFailover & Recovery\n\n\nAdministration\nMongoDB Deployment and Cluster setup\nMongoDB GridFS\nTrident Spout\nWorking with Replica Sets\nMongoDB Sharding\nMongoDB Create Backup\n\n\nUsing an API\nIntroducing Drivers\nJava\nPHP\nRuby\nPython\n\n\nMongoDB Course Objectives\nDevelop highly scalable and cost-efficient applications with MongoDB\nBuild efficient MongoDB data models for enterprise-scale applications\nEnhance performance with indexing and sharding\nManage consistency with write concern and read preference\nProcess data and compute results with aggregation pipelines and MapReduce\nBy the end of the MongoDB training, the students will be able to:\nInstall and setup the MongoDB database\nUse the MongoDB shell to access the database\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete data\nUse aggregation queries\nAppreciate the APIs used to interface with MongoDB\nUnderstand the document based structure of the database\nUse an API to develop applications\nOptimise queries with indexes\nDocument based data modelling\nCreate document collections\nCRUD operations with the Mongo shell\nAggregation pipelines\nMongoDB transactions\nMongoDB access using programming languages\nCreate indexes",

If you're already in the field and need a refresher, this course will also serve as a valuable guide. Every time you return to this course, you will learn something new or improve your existing skills, getting you one step closer to passing the Java SE 21 certification exam.\n\n\nWhat is Java?\nJava is a programming language and platform initially developed by Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle. Java is inspired by C and C++ and uses an object-oriented programming model, which means that concepts or things are represented as “objects” that have data fields and methods. One of the biggest advantages of Java is that it runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), meaning that you can execute Java code on any platform that has a JVM, without re-compilation. This is different from C and C++, which require re-compilation for every hardware platform you execute the code on. Java has many other advantages, including automatic memory management. This eliminates hard-to-understand pointers used in languages like C, which can help Java developers write better code in a shorter period of time.\nWhat does it mean that Java is an object-oriented programming language?\nJava is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means concepts or things are represented as “objects” that have data fields and methods. In object-oriented programming, models called “objects” represent either a programming entity or an abstract concept. These objects are created and assembled independently of one another but can work with each other in logical ways. Objects are manifestations of classes and can inherit code allowing for code re-use, which can drastically reduce code duplication if used correctly. Additionally, encapsulation, another core OOP concept, allows you to create code with the implementation hidden. Although, in many cases, writing OOP code in Java (and other OOP languages) can take longer than using a procedural language, the benefits obtained with OOP, namely code reusability, encapsulation of data, and readability of code, often result in code that is easier to maintain in the long run.\nWhat is Java used for?\nJava is a very versatile language. Several fields use Java, including Android app development, desktop applications that work on many operating systems, server-side applications, and more. The virtual machine required to run Java programs has been ported to numerous operating systems allowing Java to run on virtually all hardware. According to the TIOBE index, Java has consistently been in the top 3 most-used and popular languages since its initial release in the 1990s. Many developers still consider Java the language of choice in areas such as enterprise and application servers, and even in embedded systems development. Many Fortune 500 companies rely on Java to run their core systems and employers often view Java experience on a résumé as favorable due to its popularity.\nWhat certification is best for Java?\nOracle, the owner of the Java programming language, has the Oracle Certified Developer: Java SE 21 Developer program, which is easily the best certification to obtain for Java developers. The main reason why it’s the best certification, is, unlike most other certifications for Java, the Oracle certification is both well known and universally accepted by employers all over the world. The exam is challenging. You also must bring an ID with you to the exam, so you cannot get anyone to take it for you. Certification is really valuable for both the certification holder and for future employers. There are few, if any, other certification programs so universally accepted as Oracle’s Java certification. Thus, getting Java certification is one of the surest ways to give yourself an advantage over other job seekers in the marketplace.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company OAK Academy gives education in the field of IT, Software, Design, development in Turkish, English, Portuguese, and a lot of different language on Udemy platform where it has over 2000 hours of video education lessons.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise\n\n\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our content is created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you the best learning experience\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nWe offer full support, answering any questions\n\n\nDive in now into the \"Java SE 21 Developer | Oracle Certified Professional 1Z0-830\" course.\nOracle 1Z0-830 | Java SE 21 Developer Certification Exam Prep Course with Lambda Expression & Java Collections Framework",

I'm Ahmed Elhefny, and I am the author and lead product creator at Cyvitrix learning, You'll notice that the course narration uses advanced voice cloning technology. I want to be clear: this isn't a fully automated process. It incorporates a \"human-in-the-loop\" (HITL) methodology, which means:\n\n\nSupervised Quality Control: Every segment of cloned voice narration is carefully reviewed and approved by a human expert (myself, or a qualified team member) to ensure accuracy, appropriate tone, and alignment with the learning objectives.\nAuthenticity Maintained: While my voice is synthetically generated, the content, pedagogical insights, and overall message are authentically mine and reflect my direct guidance. The human oversight guarantees that the voice expresses the nuances and emphasis I intend for effective learning.\nFocus on Content, Not Production: This technology lets us spend more time refining and updating the educational content rather than on time-consuming re-recording. This means you get a more frequently updated and richer learning experience.\nFutureproofing: Embracing this technology allows us to scale our efforts and potentially offer more courses and resources efficiently, without compromising on quality or my unique instructional style.\nWe believe this transparent approach, combining technological innovation with rigorous human oversight, delivers a superior and consistent learning environment. Your understanding and engagement are paramount, and we're committed to providing clear, high-quality instruction.\nNow, let's dive into through this learning journey.",

Therefore, you should consider us for the following reasons:\nUp-to-Date Content: Our courses are always current, with updates made within weeks of any official exam change, ensuring that you're studying the most relevant material on any given day of the year.\nDetailed Explanations: We provide not just correct answers, but also comprehensive explanations for each answer option. It is important to understand why an answer is correct, but it is also equally important to learn why other given options are incorrect. This approach ensures that you fully understand the question and the reasoning behind the correct and incorrect answers, rather than just memorizing responses.\nSupporting References: We supplement our answers with supporting links and screenshots from official documentation and the Azure portal, providing you with a rich and a contextual learning experience.\nDetailed Test Reports: After completing a test in exam mode, you receive a detailed report that provides an overview of your performance.

We took a lot of time preparing, testing, writing, practicing, and reviewing them. We more than welcome any and every feedback and comment.\nAll questions and answers are designed and tested using the latest Jira Software Cloud Standard and Premium versions.\nAlmost all questions have explanations for correct and incorrect answers.\nAll questions have references to the official Atlassian Documentation and/or Community.\nAll questions were designed by Atlassian Certified Experts, among which some are also Atlassian Community Champions.\nAll our instructors got more than 90% in this ACP-620 certification on their first attempt.\nAll questions will be regularly updated since Atlassian continuously updates the exam topics.\n\n\nAccording to Atlassian, “In a 2019 survey, 91% of Atlassian Certified professionals reported that earning their credential increased their confidence using or administering Atlassian products”.\n\n\n➤ ACP-620 / ACP-MJCP Exam details:\nNumber of questions: According to Atlassian, up to 70 questions.\nPassing score: 63%.\nExam time: 180 minutes (3 hours).\nPrice: $100 + tax.\nWhere to schedule your exam: Online by going to the Atlassian University Website\nAtlassian Products covered: Jira Software Cloud (including Automation). Pay attention: You will be tested on company-managed projects and team-managed projects.\nExam Location: Online or at Testing centers.\nPermitted test aids:\nA hard copy of English or English Translation Dictionary (allowed both online or at testing centers)\nPencil/Pen and Paper (allowed at testing centers only, and must be supplied by the testing center)\nWater in a clear container\nValidity: Your Certification will be valid for 24 months. To keep your Certification active, simply earn a related Atlassian Pro Skills Badge before the suspension date. Adding a Pro Skills Badge will extend your Certification for 24 months from the activity completion date. Go to the Atlassian University Website to learn more about this.\n\n\n➤ ACP-620 / ACP-MJCP - Exam Topics :\nProject Creation (10% to 15% of the exam)\nBoard Configuration (25% to 35% of the exam)\nManaging projects (25% to 35% of the exam)\nAutomation (15% to 20% of the exam)\nReporting (15% to 20% of the exam)\n\n\n➤ ACP-620 / ACP-MJCP ★★★ Exam Tips ★★★:\nTime is not a challenge. But it would be best if you manage your time wisely to have enough time to review your answers.\nSome of you may be comfortable reading the answers and then read the question. Try it out. If it does work for you, you can use this trick.\nCreate a standard or premium Jira Software Cloud testing instance for free and practice all questions, especially answers you feel uncomfortable with. Note that these types of instances expire and are downgraded to the free plan after some days/weeks, but you can recreate new ones if you are still preparing.\nThird-party applications (or plugins) are out of scope, so do not install them.\nAutomation (also known as Automation for Jira) is now fully integrated within Jira and is tested in this exam.\nJira Service Management and Jira Work Management are out of scope, but you need to know at least what they are used for.\nYou need to master the differences between team-managed and company-managed projects. Team-managed projects are relatively new, and some users are uncomfortable with this concept.\nUse the English version to prepare for the exam (If you typically use a localized product), so you'll be familiar with the names of menu options and other product features.\nEnsure you are aware of other roles in maintaining Jira and how this larger team works together.\n\n\n➤ This course also comes with the following:\nLifetime access to all future updates\nA responsive assistant team in the Q&A Section\nA 30-Day “No Questions Asked” Money-Back Guarantee!\nAccess on Mobile and TV with the Udemy app\n\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ Join us in this course if you want to pass the ACP-620 Managing Jira Projects for Cloud Certification on the first attempt.",

The requirements for each domain completely changed on that date.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft or GitHub.\n\n\nThis course is the foundation for the GitHub Certificate GH-900 \"GitHub Foundations\", using an Microsoft exam, and focuses on GitHub repositories, and collaboration, contributing and working with GitHub and Git.\nWe'll start off by working with GitHub. We'll create a GitHub account, explore the user interface, create a repository, and look at settings and permissions.\nWe'll then work with files in a repository. We'll add, edit and delete files, use GitHub Desktop, and fork and create and manage Pull Requests.\nWe'll then use GitHub for project management. We'll create and manage issues, labels and milestones, implement DevOps practices, use GitHub for code review, and create and manage GitHub Projects.\nWe'll then look at other features in GitHub. We'll look at repository security, administer GitHub organizations, teams and discussions, and see how we can engage with the GitHub community.\nFinally, we'll look at Git commands. On your computer, we'll initialize a Git repository, add and commit changes, push and pull changes, understand branching and merging, and clone a repository.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we will download all programs and sign up for GitHub for free.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of Git and GitHub and how to collaborate using GitHub. And with some practice, you could even go for the official GitHub certification GH-900 - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume?\nSo, without any further ado, let's have a look at how you can use the Udemy interface, and then we'll have a look at the objectives for the exam and therefore the syllabus for this course.",

Browse IT careers for professionals, navigate certifications and discover jobs in areas that interest you, and open doors to opportunity and success.\nWhat is the CompTIA A+ certification?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification can be considered an entry-level certificate for IT professionals. Getting a CompTIA A+ certificate can lead to a successful IT career. CompTIA created this certificate for people seeking employment as a help desk, support, service center, or networking technician. The CompTIA A+ certification exam covers PC and laptop hardware, software installation, the configuration of computer and mobile operating systems, basic networking, troubleshooting, and security skills. Many enterprises require a CompTIA A+ certificate for their entry-level information technology jobs. Passing the CompTIA A+ certification exam can also serve as a springboard toward other technology certificates and career advancements.\nDo I need CompTIA A+ for Network+?\nGetting the CompTIA A+ certification is not a requirement to get a Network+ certification. Each certification covers a separate area of computer technology. The A+ certification will test your knowledge of PC hardware, mobile device hardware, operating systems, security, cloud computing, and troubleshooting hardware and network connectivity. It consists of two tests. You can acquire the Network+ plus certification by passing one test. This test validates a student's knowledge of wired and wireless networks and their understanding of topics like unified communications and virtualization. While having both the CompTIA A+ certification and the Network+ certification will give an IT technician more opportunities when looking for a job, neither certification is a prerequisite for the other.\nWhy Should I Get CompTIA A+ Certified?\nCompTIA A+ will either help you get your start in IT or help you get promoted in your current job. It is the industry standard for establishing a career in IT and is the preferred qualifying credential for technical support and IT operational roles.\nIT pros with CompTIA A+ have jobs like IT support specialist, IT field service technician, desktop support analyst, and help desk tier 2 support. And, companies like Intel, Dell, Ricoh, Nissan, Blue Cross, and Blue Shield, and HP all look for CompTIA A+ certification when hiring.\nHow hard is the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe difficulty of the test will depend in large part on your interest and experience in the subject. If you are taking the CompTIA A+ exam because you have already been building and fixing computers for a while and have a working knowledge of operating systems, especially Windows, you should have no problem passing the test. The exam consists of two tests. Each has 90 questions, which consist of multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. For each test, you get an hour and a half.\nHow many questions are on the CompTIA A+ exam and what is a passing score?\nThe CompTIA A+ exam consists of two tests of 90 questions each. The problems include multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. The first exam covers hardware, networking technology, mobile devices, cloud computing, virtualization, and networking troubleshooting. The second exam tests the knowledge of software troubleshooting, installing operating systems, configuring operating systems, and security. The passing score for the first exam, 220-1001, is 675 out of a scale of 100-900. For the second exam, 220-1002, a passing score is 700 out of a scale of 100-900. This means that to pass the first test, you need to answer at least 69 out of 90 questions correctly. Whereas for the second test, you need to have 70 correct out of 90.\nIs CompTIA A+ worth it?\nMany entry-level IT jobs require A+ certification. It proves to the business you are applying to that you have basic IT knowledge. They want to know that you can do the work and don't need basic training. If you have no experience in the industry, having a CompTIA A+ certificate can get you an entry-level job. After that, you can specialize, add other certifications, and advance in your career. The CompTIA A+ certificate has been the first step in a successful career for many IT professionals.\nWhat's next after the CompTIA A+?\nFor many IT professionals, the CompTIA A+ is the first of many certifications earned over the course of their careers. Since the A+ certification is fairly general, you may choose to move into an IT specialization, like networking, cybersecurity, or cloud computing. CompTIA offers more advanced certifications in these fields, as do many other reputable organizations. Take a look at this IT certification roadmap to inspire your next career goal.\nWhat are the objectives of the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe test objectives are to ensure that an aspiring IT professional has the basic knowledge for an entry-level information technology job. CompTIA A+ applicants should be able to assemble components based on customer requirements. The exam tests applicants on their ability to install, configure and maintain PCs, mobile devices, and software. They should know the basics of networking and security forensics. CompTIA A+ applicants should have basic troubleshooting skills to diagnose, resolve, and document common hardware and software issues. They should know how to provide essential customer support. They should also understand the basics of scripting, virtualization, desktop imaging, and deployment.\nWhat jobs can I get with CompTIA A+?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification is the industry standard for a career in IT and is the preferred credential for technical support and IT operational roles. One job a person with an A+ certificate may choose is IT support specialist. An IT support specialist is responsible for installing and configuring computer hardware and software, monitoring and maintaining computer networks, and providing technical support across a company. Another role someone with A+ certification may choose is help desk technician. A help desk technician diagnoses and supports hardware and software issues across a company. Other job titles that require A+ certification include service desk analyst, technical support specialist, field service technician, network engineer, data support technician, desktop support administrator, help desk technician, and system support specialist.\nWhich should you choose CompTIA A+ or CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)?\nCompTIA offers two separate entry-level certifications, the CompTIA A+, and the CompTIA IT Fundamentals, or ITF+. They’re slightly different. The CompTIA A+ is billed as a certification that will test you on the knowledge needed to land an entry-level IT job. The ITF+, on the other hand, is designed for students and professionals who want to see if IT is a right career fit for them. The ITF+ exam is also used by non-IT professionals who want a broad introduction to the field. If you’re still on the fence about whether you’d like a job in IT, getting the ITF+ can be a good way to test the waters. If you know you want to commit to IT work and are ready to gain job-ready skills, the A+ certification is probably a better path.\nHow long will it take to get CompTIA A+ certified?\nThe length of time it takes to get a CompTIA A+ certification depends on your current experience level and whether you take any courses to prepare for the exam. If you already know most of what the study material covers, it’s possible to earn the certification in just a couple of months. However, for a beginner, it typically takes about a year to become familiar enough with the exam topics to pass. To receive certification, you must demonstrate knowledge in nine key areas. CompTIA A+ provides study materials that help prepare you for the exam, and you can work through these at your own pace. However long it takes you to get certified, it’s worth the time. As one of the most highly valued qualifying credentials for anyone seeking a role in IT operations, CompTIA A+ certification can take your career to new heights. A course on Udemy can help get you there.\n\n\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now “ CompTIA A+ Certification Lab | CompTIA A+ 220-1101, 220-1102 ” course\nComptia A+ Certification, CompTIA A+ 220-1101, CompTIA A+220-1102 exam topics, Linux, Comptia IT Fundemantal for IT jobs\n\n\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",
