As you progress in your journey, you will encounter more advanced topics including functional data processing, before investigating how you can build fast, scalable APIs for the connected web. In the final section, you will build an API to analyze the sentiment of sentences provided by the user, along with various statistics about your API.\nThe second course, Java 9 New Features Deep Dive, covers new modular programming concept in Java 9 and know how it will affect you and your clients ahead of time.We will start up with the setting up of Java 9 and learn the modularization concepts and then proceed to deployment. This should be hands on look at Java 9, but no one will be using it to make real-world applications yet. This is an assessment video for the millions of Java developers out there looking to put it to the test.\nThe third course, Writing High Performance Java Application in Java 9, covers how to monitor applications and write code in high concurrent with the proper tools. First, we’ll create efficient lock-free programs that leverage the multi-core architecture of the CPU using the newest Java 9 features. Then you’ll see how Java Memory Model affects the performance of your programs. You’ll discover why it’s even more important to be aware of the software-hardware co-operation of your programs in Java 9. Moving on, you’ll find out how to leverage constructs from JAVA 9 java.util.concurrent to create efficient multi-threaded programs. We’ll explore the different kinds of locking available in JAVA 9 and get to know when you should use which kind of locks. Finally, you’ll see what tools are shipped with the JDK 9 and know how to use them properly.\nThe fourth course, Hands-On Enterprise Application Development with Java 9, covers modern and scalable enterprise applications using Java 9 and Java EE 8 and become a professional Java developer.

We all start by using a filter, then a map, flatMap, reduce... at first, it seems easy!\nThen we try to learn concepts like monad, functor, monoid, applicative... we read a tutorial here, a blog post there... and after all, we think \"I'm never going to understand this.\"\nAnd I have to tell you—it’s not that hard, you're just using the wrong approach: to understand what a monad is, you have to create your own monad. Then a second one, a third... and voilà, you understand what you're doing, even if no one has actually explained it to you.\nIn this course, you’re going to do exactly that: understand the concepts of functional programming in a 100% practical way, with exercises in Kotlin. That way, you’ll immerse yourself in it, internalize it, and by the end of the day, you’ll know what a monad is (and a functor, a monoid, an applicative...) even if you’re not quite sure how you ended up learning it.\nThis course is focused is the most obscure part of the functional programming: the functional abstractions, or as we call them: functional patterns.\nMonoid\nSemi-group\nMonad\nApplicative\nDon’t hesitate—functional programming is one of the few disciplines that will truly change the way you think, and that will make you a much more valuable programmer than someone who only knows the latest trendy framework.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: this course is the advanced part of the course \"Functional Programming in Kotlin: to monads and beyond!\"",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Python GUI Development with Tkinter course by Uplatz.\n\n\nPython programming suite provides a large number of GUI frameworks (or toolkits), from Tkinter (traditionally bundled with Python, using Tk) to a number of other cross-platform solutions, as well as bindings to platform-specific (native) technologies.\nPython supports various options for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Most important are listed below.\nTkinter − Tkinter is the Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python.\nwxPython − This is an open-source Python interface for wxWindows.\nJPython − JPython is a Python port for Java which gives Python scripts seamless access to Java class libraries on the local machine.\nIn summary, Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework which is built into the Python standard library. Tkinter has several strengths. It’s cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Visual elements are rendered using native operating system elements, so applications built with Tkinter look like they belong on the platform where they’re run.\nTkinter is lightweight and relatively painless to use compared to other frameworks. This makes it a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, especially for applications where a modern sheen is unnecessary, and the top priority is to build something that’s functional and cross-platform quickly.\n\n\nUplatz provides this comprehensive training on GUI Programming in Python with Tkinter. The Python GUI Programming course covers the basics of Tkinter, programming with Tkinter, concept of GUI programming, using Tkinter for GUI programming, creating and managing Tkinter widgets, creating useful apps using Tkinter, and more.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nGet started with Tkinter with a basic application\nWork with widgets, such as buttons and text boxes\nControl your application layout with geometry managers\nMake your applications interactive by associating button clicks to Python functions\n\n\nTkinter Programming\nTkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\nCreating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. The following steps need to be followed:\nImport the Tkinter module.\nCreate the GUI application main window.\nAdd one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.\nEnter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.\n\n\nTkinter Widgets\nTkinter provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes used in a GUI application. These controls are commonly called widgets.\nThere are currently 15 types of widgets in Tkinter.\n\n\nPython GUI Development with Tkinter - Course Curriculum\n1. TKINTER BASICS\n2.

It was built in such a way that it had inherent support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. Erlang was originally developed to be used in several large telecommunication systems. But it has now slowly made its foray into diverse sectors like E-commerce, computer telephony and banking sectors as well.\nThis course has been prepared for professionals aspiring to make a career in the field of telecom, banking, instant messaging, e-commerce and computer telephony as well. This course will give you enough understanding on this programming language and also help you in building scalable soft real time systems that will have requirements on higher availability.\nBefore proceeding with this course, you must have some basic knowledge on programming in the following languages such as C or C++, Java, Python, Ruby. Furthermore, it might also be helpful, to have some working knowledge on functional programming languages like Clojure, Haskell, Scala or OCaml for advanced programming on Erlang.\nWhy Erlang?\nErlang should be used to develop your application, if you have the following requirements −\nThe application needs to handle a large number of concurrent activities.\nIt should be easily distributable over a network of computers.\nThere should be a facility to make the application fault-tolerant to both software and hardware errors.\nThe application should be scalable. This means that it should have the ability to span across multiple servers with little or no change.\nIt should be easily upgradable and reconfigurable without having to stop and restart the application itself.\nThe application should be responsive to users within certain strict timeframes.",

We all start by using a filter, then a map, flatMap, reduce... at first, it seems easy!\nThen we try to learn concepts like monad, functor, monoid, applicative... we read a tutorial here, a blog post there... and after all, we think \"I'm never going to understand this.\"\nAnd I have to tell you—it’s not that hard, you're just using the wrong approach: to understand what a monad is, you have to create your own monad. Then a second one, a third... and voilà, you understand what you're doing, even if no one has actually explained it to you.\nIn this course, you’re going to do exactly that: understand the concepts of functional programming in a 100% practical way, with exercises in Kotlin. That way, you’ll immerse yourself in it, internalize it, and by the end of the day, you’ll know what a monad is (and a functor, a monoid, an applicative...) even if you’re not quite sure how you ended up learning it.\nBesides these \"advanced\" concepts, we’ll also cover ideas you probably already know, but that are fundamental in functional programming: recursion (did you know that any iterative algorithm with a loop can be rewritten in a recursive way?), functions (you’ll see they can do much more than how you usually use them), and of course, the typical functional transformation functions: filter, map, reduce (fold) and others.\nDon’t hesitate—functional programming is one of the few disciplines that will truly change the way you think, and that will make you a much more valuable programmer than someone who only knows the latest trendy framework.",

      "description": "This course is about Haskell. Haskell is a strong, statically typed language with a very expressive type system. It also has non- strict evaluation, and it has a very unique approach to problem-solving. This course is going to emphasize using Haskell for practical problem-solving.\nThis course consists of several topics, in three sections. In the first topic, we'll talk about problems that FP and Haskell can address. Then we'll talk about the functional programming-specific ways of approaching these problems.\nThen we'll talk about how Haskell specifically addresses these types of problems. Then we'll take a look at our first Haskell programs and start to begin an intuition for what they look like. And we'll dig deeper into some issues related to whitespace and layout.\nThen we'll use the Glasgow Haskell Compiler's read-evaluate-print loop, known as GHCi, to explore our Haskell programs' values and types and expressions.\nThen we'll learn to debug with GHCi. Moving on, we'll dig deeper, and we'll start to look at Haskell values and expressions, and specifically functions as values. We'll build an intuition for some of the core concepts.\nThen we'll look at types, polymorphism constraints, and how we can add type signatures to our values. And we're looking to sum up product types in Haskell's record syntax. At that point, we'll know enough to tackle type classes, and we'll learn how to make our own instances of existing type classes and how to build our own type classes. Finally, to cap it all off, we'll learn how to extract values from our algebraic data types. At the end of this course, you will have a practical working knowledge of Haskell, enough to start writing your own program.\nYou'll also know how Haskell can help us solve problems in its particular approach to software engineering. And then, you'll also have knowledge of values, expressions and types in Haskell.",

      "description": "If you've learned the basics of Python but still feel lost when it comes to writing real-world applications, the missing piece is likely Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This course is the complete roadmap to mastering OOP in Python — the skill that turns a beginner into a confident developer.\nWhether you're switching careers, preparing for job interviews, or building personal projects, this course will help you go from writing random code to structuring professional, scalable Python applications with confidence.\nWe begin from the absolute ground zero — even if you’ve never written a class in your life, don’t worry. Each concept is broken down into simple, real-world explanations. By the end of this course, you’ll no longer be confused about terms like class, object, method, inheritance, or encapsulation — you’ll be using them like second nature.\nBut here’s the real power: you won’t just be learning theory. You’ll build, break, debug, and master every OOP concept using real Python projects and hands-on examples. And the course is structured so that even non-tech learners can follow along easily.\nWhat makes this course truly complete is the integration of ChatGPT as your coding partner. You'll learn how to use AI to:\nWrite OOP code faster\nFix bugs instantly\nGenerate examples\nRefactor your projects\nAnd even learn faster with AI-powered explanations.\nImagine having a Python mentor available 24/7 — that’s exactly what you’ll experience here.\nWhat Makes This Course Stand Out?\nMost OOP tutorials either dump jargon on you or skip practical implementation. This course does the opposite: it starts with clarity, walks you through code step-by-step, and shows you how to use OOP in real Python scenarios, even if you're a complete beginner.\nWe’ll cover:\nThe core OOP pillars: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism\nHow to create your own classes and objects\nHow to organize your Python code for real-world projects\nDebugging and improving your code structure with best practices\nYou’ll also learn how to combine OOP with Python-specific tools like __str__(), self, custom methods, and how to import and reuse your code anywhere.\nBy the end of this course, you'll have a deep and practical understanding of Python OOP, and you'll be able to confidently structure any project like a professional developer.\nWhy You Shouldn’t Delay Learning OOP\nIf you keep skipping OOP and continue writing only procedural scripts, you’ll struggle to grow as a Python developer. You’ll hit a wall in interviews, job opportunities, and large projects.\nBut if you learn OOP today, you’ll gain a superpower. It’s the bridge from beginner code to scalable, maintainable, and professional applications — the kind of code companies actually hire for.",

      "description": "Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. The language is rapidly gaining popularity, not only because it’s relatively easy to learn, but also because you can do almost everything with it. Python is used for scientific and economic simulations, desktop apps, web apps, data mining, machine learning, games, 3D modelling, even making music, and many, many more. Python is used in almost every domain you can think of: mathematics, physics, atronomy, chemistry, biology, geography, arts, music, economy, robotics. Actually you could find an application for it everywhere.\nAs you can see, Python is a valuable skill to have, maybe it even will become your profession and passion. Well, this course will let you start this adventure. If you are a beginner, this course is right for you.\nDiscover The Fascinating World of Python Programming:\n·         Input and output\n·         Variables\n·         Statements\n·         Conditional code\n·         Loops\n·         Numeric types\n·         Operators\n·         Strings\n·         Lists , tuples, ranges\n·         Dictionaries\n·         Sets\n·         Booleans\n·         Data type conversions\n·         Flow control\n·         List comprehensions\n·         Functions\n·         Scope\n·         Lambda Expressions\n·         Object Oriented Programming\n·         Modules\n·         Files\n·         Exceptions\n·         ... and much more\nDon’t Wait Any Longer. Don’t Be Afraid Any Longer. Go For It. Fall in Love with Python.\nPython seems to be everywhere. And if it’s not somewhere yet, it soon will. Python is taught in schools, Python is used by world-wide known companies, Python is used to make websites, many of which most of us use on a regular basis. Python can help us solve complex everyday problems in less time and with less code than many other languages. Python is interpreted, so you can see your results right away. And Python code is very orderly and readable.\nContents and Overview\nThis course is targeted at beginner students who have never learned to program or have some background in other programming languages. Each lecture is brief and concise, focused on one topic. Most lectures consist of two parts. The first part is a brief introductory video with some examples. The second part is a project for you to do. It’s based on the material covered in the video and is supposed to solve a simple practical problem. There are 80 lectures and 70 projects. It’s quite a lot. I can tell you, don’t skip any. Take your time to do all the projects and this will really skyrocket your practical skills.\nIf you have difficulty doing the project, you can find lots of guidelines and hints and also the full code. Don’t get discouraged if something doesn’t work straight away. It’s normal when you learn programming. A single unmatched parenthesis or too small an indent may cause the program to not run. But this is part of programming. With practice you’ll write code more and more smoothly.\nThis course is divided into 11 sections, each of them covering a broader topic subdivided into lectures. The pace is up to you, you can go through the easier parts faster and then take more time to study the more complicated ones.\nAfter you finish each section, there’s a quiz for you that covers the material discussed in that section.\nAfter you finish this course you will be able to move around the fascinating world of Python and apply your knowledge to practical everyday problems. You will be able to use quite a lot of tools and techniques. This will make a good starting point for more advanced study.",

      "description": "TypeScript is an open-source programming language that was developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript that provides optional static typing, which allows developers to catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime. TypeScript also provides a range of other benefits, including improved tooling support, optional chaining, and advanced features such as decorators and generics.\nIn this course, \"TypeScript Basics: Beginner's Guide - 2023 Edition\", I will guide you through the process of learning TypeScript from scratch. We will start by discussing the benefits of using TypeScript over other programming languages, including its strong typing system, which allows for more reliable and maintainable code. We will also explore how TypeScript's tooling support can improve developer productivity and make it easier to build more complex applications.\nThroughout the course, we will cover essential TypeScript concepts such as variable creation, types (including string, number, enum, union, interfaces, and types), and control flow statements (if-else, switch cases, and loops). We will also dive into more advanced features such as classes, which provide a way to create reusable code and reduce code duplication.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of TypeScript and how it can be used to develop cleaner, more robust, and more scalable web applications. Whether you are an experienced JavaScript developer looking to expand your skills or a newcomer to TypeScript, this course will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to succeed.

      "description": "Which programming language is often considered a badge of honor among software developers? C++\nWhich programming language can you learn that, when added to your resume, will often get you a job interview? C++\nWhich programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity and has been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years? C++\nWhy you should learn C++\nMuch, if not most, of the software written today is still written in C++, and this has been the case for many years.\nNot only is C++ popular, but it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub, you will see a huge number of active C++ repositories, and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.\nMany leading software titles are written entirely or partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!\nMany Adobe products, such as Photoshop and Illustrator, MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many more, are written in C++.\nLeading tech companies use C++ for many products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.\nCan you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?\nIf more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there will be more of a demand for C++ programmers.\nHowever, the main reason programmers should learn C++ is because it is so powerful!\nWhat do I mean by powerful?\nC++ is super fast and a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming, making it very flexible.\nIt can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.\nC++ can do many things that other languages just can't.\nThat's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.\nSince C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++, you'll likely see elements from C++ in the new languages you learn.\nHow can a beginner learn C++?\n\nFinding a good course taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to teach you the language.\nI have a lot of experience in making games and control systems using C++.\nAs a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way and in the shortest possible timeframe.confidently\nWhich version of C++ should I learn?\nC++ has had many version releases and updates over the years. Sadly, most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.\nI will teach you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17).\nLearning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!\nIs C++ difficult to learn?\nWith all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.\nThere is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages.\nBut with the right instructor and training, you can get up to speed with C++ quickly, and that's what this course is all about.\nWhat will I learn in this course?\nThe course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will have the skills to create your programs in C++.\nKey topics covered include.\n* Looping with while, do/while for range-based for statements and recursion\n* Performing calculations and displaying results\n* Functions\n* Pointers\n* Using existing classes and creating objects\n* Creating your classes\n* Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector\n* Constructors and Destructors\n*  Move semantics\n* How to overload operators\n* Using inheritance and class hierarchies\n* Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding\n* Using stream I/O\n* An introduction to the C++ STL\n* An introduction to Exception Handling\n* How to work with date and time in C++\n* How to measure function execution time with a standard clock in C++\n* How to use std::any to store any value in C++\n* how to select branches at compile time with constexpr if\n* What is lvalue and rvalue\n* How to Use std::optional to store optional values in C++\n* what is variadic function templates\n* How to use fold expressions to simplify variadic function templates\n* how to perform compile-time assertion checks with static_assert\n* how to Conditionally compile classes and functions with enable_if\n* what is variadic function templates?\n* and many more\n\nHow is this C++ course different from other courses?\n\nYou will learn Modern C++, for one. Many other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++. If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you know the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.\nThe course format includes theory and concepts, which are then reinforced with live code examples.\nYou won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as I have.\nWhat do I get out of learning C++?\nMore career options for one! C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in game development. It's also heavily used in embedded applications. Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, more opportunities, and more fun!\nAre you ready to get started?\nIf you are ready to get that first paid programming job or move up to a more senior programming position, this course is for you!\nYour new job or consulting opportunity awaits!\nCould you get started today?\nClick the Signup button to sign up for the course!",

      "description": "This course will take you on a journey of fundamentals of Java all the way through the bytecodes to the more advanced topics of programming.\nUnderstanding and mastering Java programming will immediately put you in a good position for learning other languages such as C++ and Python.\nThe syntax of Java was designed to be similar to that of the C++ programs, hence if you are coming from the C++ world, then you are already halfway through mastering the Java language! Similarly, Python operates based on the assumption that every type is represented by an Object, hence closely resembles the philosophy that Java language follows.\nThis course is structured in a way to be very congruent with the official Oracle website for learning Java called dev dot java website. I will walk you through all the items discussed on dev dot java website and give very detailed examples of explanations.\nOne strong feature of this course is the frequent look under the hood in the bytecode of classes. Bytecodes are the compiled code that the java compiler \"javac\" provides, which sometimes reveal the hidden extra codes that javac adds to accomplish a task. For example, in the most recent version of JDK (java development kit), String concatenation always translates into creating a StringBuilder object behind the scene and calling its \"append\" method. Understanding such behind the scene concepts will enable you to truly master the Java language and write efficient codes.\nThe topics discussed in this course are:\nSection 1: Getting Started with Java\nIn this section, I introduce the dev dot java website and discuss concepts such as \"JAVA_HOME\" and \"CLASSPATH\" environment variables. The concept of CLASSPATH will be discussed in more detail later in section 9 when I discuss the concept of java \"packages\".\nSection 2: Primitives and Literals\nThis section is the absolute beginner's introduction to Java language features. Java language supports raw primitives and also provides wrapper classes (also called Boxed primitives). I discuss all of the supported primitives such as byte, short, int, long, float, double.\nSection 3: Arrays\nThis section is dedicated to the built-in array construct in java. Java language allows primitive arrays and object arrays. An array can be directly initialized when it is declared. User-defined classes cannot extend built-in arrays.\nSection 4: Local Variable Type Inference\nThis section is a brief introduction to the \"var\" identifier that was introduced in the recent versions of java. \"var\" allows the compiler to infer the type of local variables without the need for the developer to intervene.\nSection 5: Operators in Java\nThis section introduces the core concept of operators that the java programming language supports. Math operators such as \"addition +\", \"subtraction -\", and \"modulus %\" are discussed in detail. The important concept of \"operator overloading\" is also discussed.\nSection 6: Expressions and Statements\nThis section briefly presents a discussion on what constitutes an expression and a statement in java. Expressions are formed from operators and operands. Statements consist of one or more expressions and are always terminated by the semicolon \";\".\nSection 7: Control flow statements\nThis is an important section that discusses the control flow statements such as \"if\", \"if else\", \"while\" loop, \"for\" loop, \"switch expression\" and \"switch statement\". The behind the scene bytecode is also reviewed for each control flow construct.\nSection 8: Intro to Object-Oriented Programming\nThis section is the introduction to the main concepts of object-oriented programming. Java language was developed with these concepts in mind and relies on the \"inheritance\", \"abstraction\", and \"interfaces\". Every \"class\" definition in java implicitly inherits from the \"Object\" class that exists inside the \"java.lang\" package. The idea of organizing the java project into packages and fully-qualified-name of the types is discussed in great detail.\nSection 9: Classes and Objects\nThis section puts the general concepts of object-oriented programming in the context of Java programming (syntax) and the unique features that Java provides. We discuss how java handles inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and the difference between the static and non-static states of objects.\nSection 10: Advanced Topics on Classes and Objects\nThis section dives deeper into the features of classes and objects that Java programming provides.\nSection 11: Introduction to Java Native Interface\nThis section is an introduction to the foreign function interface (FFI) that the java development kit provides. JNI is considered by some as a difficult topic and is rarely discussed in lectures and courses. This chapter assumes the student has some knowledge of C++ programming and how to compile \".cpp\" and \".h\" files.\nSection 12: Introduction to Effective Java\nThis section introduces the most important book titled \"Effective Java\" that every java developer must have. Each lecture corresponds to an item of best practices of java programming that is discussed in the book.\nSection 13: Miscellaneous Topics\nThis section provides additional insights about the java programming language or the tools that are directly or indirectly related to java programming. Tools such as GraalVM's native image and Jupyter notebooks are discussed.",

      "description": "In this course the students will finally see the fruits of the hard work that they have undergone through the previous courses. The knowledge of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, the four basic database operations (CRUD), the developed analytical and algorithmic thinking from solving preceding tasks will help them in the current challenge – creating a multi-tier application containing different layers.\nThe course will be focused on the following flexible structure – Business, Data, Service and Presentation layer. There will be different approaches to the Data layer so that the students will be able to appreciate the advantages of the multi layered paradigm (for example, changing one facet of the application won’t require rewriting the whole code). After finishing the synchronous implementation of the Data layer the asynchronous approach will be explained and integrated.\nEntity Framework (Core) will be introduced as the ORM technology for the C# applications. Code First and Database First approaches will be taught. Data annotations and Fluent API will be used to configure the databases further. Optimization for the querying of data will be shown.\nDifferent presentation layers will be created – Console application, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and (web-based) MVC. Students will realize how easily they can build upon the structure of the first three layers any kind of graphical user interface. Although some of the technologies are becoming outdated, the principles and concepts wherein are crucial for the development of the thinking of the student. Even if the students will start creating web applications only with JavaScript, Java or game applications with C++ the knowledge and experience in components, delegates and events are necessary. The ability to follow SOLID principles, OOP principles, good programming practices and algorithmic thinking are vital for the growth of the software developer. Even if the user migrates to a different type of database model, it will be easier to implement it in its application because of the same principles that n-tier applications are made of.\nBefore we continue making complex multi-tier applications (adding authorization, authentication, email confirmation, payment methods and filtering of data; adding new layers to simplify the growing of the functionalities in the service layer) a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and experience with solving simple tasks are necessary. This course is the sixth stepping stone towards achieving that goal.\nI hope that my students will be benevolent toward each other in the Q&A section of the courses and be successful in their future career as a software developer (and engineer).",

Lua has its value across multiple platforms ranging from large server systems to small mobile applications. This course covers various topics ranging from the basics of Lua to its scope in various applications. This course is designed for all those readers who are looking for a starting point to learn Lua. It has topics suitable for both beginners as well as advanced users. It is a self-contained course and you should be able to grasp the concepts easily even if you are a total beginner. However it would help if you have a basic understanding of working with a simple text editor and command line.\nLua is an extensible, lightweight programming language written in C. It started as an in-house project in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes.\nCommon Use Cases\nGame Development\nEmbedded Systems\nScripting Inside Applications\nConfiguration Files\nIoT and Robotics\nIt was designed from the beginning to be a software that can be integrated with the code written in C and other conventional languages. This integration brings many benefits. It does not try to do what C can already do but aims at offering what C is not good at: a good distance from the hardware, dynamic structures, no redundancies, ease of testing and debugging. For this, Lua has a safe environment, automatic memory management, and good facilities for handling strings and other kinds of data with dynamic size.",

This is achieved by building something found in the real world, a self-checkout machine, and by introducing more advanced concepts into the design. For example, real-world applications often use dependency injection (DI) for objects’ dependencies. We instead use a simpler method that achieves a similar purpose but also clarifies the usefulness of DI. We also dip our toes into component lifecycles and how subtle bugs can arise when components may be created and destroyed at any time. Therefore we crucially manage these lifecycles.\n\n\nIn part one of the course, we look at a basic JavaFX application and the fundamental tools at our disposal for building JavaFX UIs.\n\n\nIn part two, we dive into writing the self-checkout application, starting with an overview of the various classes and then building out the first two screens as well as creating a systematic way to navigate between them.\n\n\nIn part three, we create a virtual barcode scanner and hook it up to the main application using events. When a barcode is scanned, we look up the product and store this data in an appropriate place (the model). We make use of JavaFX properties, which are like supercharged variables. Properties enable us to bind the UI to the data so that the UI updates in real time. We also create custom UI components which are necessary to display scanned products to the customer in a clean and professional way.\n\n\nIn part four, we use CSS and stylesheets give the application a clean and consistent styling.\n\n\nIn part five, we move on to enabling payment. We create the payment screen along with the coin machine device. We calculate and display various figures such as the payment and the customer’s change using properties and bindings. We change the way money is represented to give us more control over its implementation. We introduce a lifecycle event to inform us of the destruction of our controllers to enable crucial clean-up. We create a mechanism for accepting or rejecting coins and giving the correct amount of change based on the coins available.\n\n\nIn part six, we create the receipt screen and receipt printer device. We pull the data from the model and format it into a suitable receipt and show it on the screen.",

We regularly update our question bank to reflect the latest trends, changes, and advancements in Java programming. This ensures that you are always learning the most current and relevant material.\nExamples of the Types of Questions You'll Encounter:\nFundamentals and Syntax:\nQuestions on basic constructs, variables, and data types.\nObject-Oriented Concepts:\nScenario-based questions testing your understanding of OOP principles.\nData Structures and Algorithms:\nQuestions challenging your problem-solving skills using Java collections and standard algorithms.\nException Handling and File I/O:\nPractical questions on handling exceptions and performing file operations.\nMultithreading and Concurrency:\nQuestions addressing thread management and concurrent programming challenges.\nAdvanced Java Features:\nQuestions on Java 8+ features, JDBC, JavaFX, and networking.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs):\nWhat is polymorphism in Java?\nAnswer: Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take many forms. It allows methods to perform different operations based on the object that invokes them.\nHow does a 'for-each' loop differ from a standard 'for' loop?\nAnswer: A 'for-each' loop is used for iterating through collections and arrays. It's simpler than a standard 'for' loop as it eliminates the need for a counter and reduces the risk of programming errors.\nCan you explain the concept of a Singleton class?\nAnswer: A Singleton class is a design pattern that allows only one instance of the class to be created. It's often used for managing shared resources.\nWhat is the use of the 'final' keyword in Java?\nAnswer: The 'final' keyword can be used to mark a variable as constant, to prevent method overriding, or to prevent inheritance of a class.\nHow do you handle exceptions in Java?\nAnswer: Exceptions in Java are handled using a combination of try, catch, and finally blocks. This structure allows for catching and managing errors without crashing the program.\nWhat is the difference between an ArrayList and a LinkedList?\nAnswer: ArrayList and LinkedList are both implementations of the List interface. ArrayList is backed by a dynamic array, offering better performance for indexed access. LinkedList, on the other hand, provides efficient insertion and deletion operations.\nWhat is a Lambda Expression in Java?\nAnswer: A Lambda Expression is a feature introduced in Java 8, allowing the implementation of methods using a concise and functional approach.\nHow does multithreading improve application performance?\nAnswer: Multithreading allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program, leveraging multiple processors and improving application performance, especially in CPU-intensive operations.\nWhat is JDBC and why is it important?\nAnswer: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API used to connect and execute queries with databases. It's vital for Java applications that interact with data stored in databases.\nCan you explain method overloading and overriding?\nAnswer: Method overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. Overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.\nEnroll Now: Join thousands of students who have benefitted from our course.

Although based on pre-dot NET Visual Basic, which is no longer supported or updated by Microsoft, the VBA implementation in Office continues to be updated to support new Office features. VBA is used for professional and end-user development due to its perceived ease of use, Office's vast installed user base, and extensive legacy in business.\nVisual Basic for Applications enables building user-defined functions (UDFs), automating processes, and accessing Windows API and other low-level functionality through dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). It supersedes and expands on the abilities of earlier application-specific macro programming languages such as Word's WordBASIC. It can be used to control many aspects of the host application, including manipulating user interface features, such as menus and toolbars, and working with custom user forms or dialog boxes.\nAs its name suggests, VBA is closely related to Visual Basic and uses the Visual Basic Runtime Library. However, VBA code normally can only run within a host application, rather than as a standalone program. VBA can, however, control one application from another using OLE Automation. For example, VBA can automatically create a Microsoft Word report from Microsoft Excel data that Excel collects automatically from polled sensors. VBA can use, but not create, ActiveX/COM DLLs, and later versions add support for class modules.\nVBA is built into most Microsoft Office applications, including Office for Mac OS X (except version 2008), and other Microsoft applications, including Microsoft MapPoint and Microsoft Visio. VBA is also implemented, at least partially, in applications published by companies other than Microsoft, including ArcGIS, AutoCAD, CorelDraw, LibreOffice, Reflection, SolidWorks, WordPerfect, and UNICOM System Architect (which supports VBA 7.1).",

      "description": "Welcome to Building Weather App with Python and Open Weather API course. This is basically an extensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build a weather app from scratch using Python programming language alongside with Tkinter which is one of Python libraries commonly used for building simple graphical user interface. In addition to that, we are going to get real time and constantly updated weather data from an open weather API which can be accessed for completely free. Therefore, the weather application which will be built in this course will be fully integrated with the API. The weather app would have several features, displaying current temperature, max temperature, min temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and the user of the app gets to choose the location. From the front end side, we will create an easy to use and user friendly interface where hopefully it can enhance the user's experience.\nFor those of you who are not really confident with your programming skills, there is nothing you should worry about since this course also comes with a basic Python training session where you will learn fundamentals of Python and be provided with all you need to succeed in this project. Besides that, at the end of the course, we are also going to be having discussion about multiple different paths to monetise weather app assuming you are serious about developing and eventually launching the app to the app store. Hence, you will also be exposed to the business perspective of launching and making money off the app, whether it’s through subscription or displaying advertisements on the app.\nBelow are things you will learn in the course:\nBasic Python training session:\nLearning different data types in Python (string, integer, float, and boolean)\nLearning how to build functions and pass down parameters to the function\nLearning JSON (Javascript Object Notation)\nLearning how to operate Tkinter and create graphical user interface\nWeather app project:\nBuilding easy to use and user friendly interface\nFull integration with Open Weather API\nRequest and display real time weather data from the API\nLearn the business perspective of monetising an app\nLearn how to utilise different properties of Tkinter\nLearn how to enable users to check temperature of different locations\nAs what most people said, the best way to learn is to actually learn by doing since you get to apply all of your skills and knowledge, by doing so automatically you will speed up your learning process and that is what exactly what you will get from this course as you get to implement your Python programming skills and knowledge into a real project with real use cases. Last but not least, you will also be exposed to the business perspective of launching the app, particularly multiple different monetisation paths you can consider to earn income from your application.",

      "description": "ABOUT ME\nI am a programmer/developer of more than 30 years experience, began as a raw electronics designer, and soon started assembly, and then C++, Win32 API (still my favorites), Java, Android apps, C# Desktop applications on security, C# ASP.NET classic, C# ASP.NET MVC , and now I am busy with ASP.NET Core.\nWhat's New:\n08-Dec-2022 - Add Chapter - Project on Audio Extractor with FFMPEG\n26-Nov-2022 - Added Chapter - Project on Classroom Voting\n11-Nov-2022 - Added Chapter - Project on CSV Processing\n\n\nC# is no doubt a long way from its initial introduction 20 years ago.\n\n\nThe syntax at that time was simple - anybody knowing C, Java, C++ could easily get started with C# because the syntax of loops, conditions, inheritance, etc., were so similar.\nBut you must have already noticed that these days a professionally written C# code invariably contains many puzzling punctuators spread here and there - like an exclamation after default -  default!  or exclamation followed by a dot ?.  or => or ?? etc.,. There are many queer looking concepts like statement lambdas, patterns, records, and many-many more like them.\nYou have probably joined me because you want to settle this once for all!\n\nI have put a lot of effort in constructing this course to see you through in a small amount of time.\n\nPLEASE WRITE TO ME IF YOU FACE ANY PROBLEMS. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP!\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ MAIN METHOD AND TOP LEVEL STATEMENTS\nMain method is the equivalent of the main method as we know in C language. It's the entry point of your program which means that it is the first function that executes when your program starts its execution. In this tutorial we learn the syntax of this function; we also learn about top-level statements that provide a shortcut to the main function.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ CLASS, RECORD AND STRUCT\nWe expect you have a very general understanding of object oriented programming blocks like classes and structs. In this tutorial we have a quick look at a class in C#. Then we have a discussion of the structs, and then a detailed look on the record keyword. The tutorial closes with \"When to use a record\".\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ STATEMENTS AND EXPRESSIONS\nThe concept of statements and expressions in C# is exactly the same as in other programming languages. So, this tutorial is a review for the sake of completeness. We have discussed Declaration Statements, Expression Statements, Empty Statement, Nested Statement Blocks, Selection Statements, Iteration Statements, Jumping Statements, Exception Statements, await Statements, fixed Statements and lock Statements.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ PRACTICE EXERCISE IN C# - 1\nWrite a C# class called CData to hold a float type of quantity. This class also contains an enumeration of two members - Meter and Centimeter - to specify the unit of the quantity stored. Add a constructor and a public function called Convert. The Convert function converts the data to meter if the data held is in centimeters, and to centimeters if the data held is in meters. The Convert function displays the result correct to 2 decimal places. Test the function by creating an object in the main function.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ REFERENCE AND VALUETYPES\nValue Types and Reference types are two types in C#. If you are familiar with C and C++, then you can think of reference types as that hold address of objects created on a heap memory. In contrast the value types hold an object. These concepts are far too complex for a beginner's tutorial. So I will try to explain them from a practical standpoint.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ ANONYMOUS TYPES AND VAR KEYWORD\nAn anonymous type is described by a comma separated properties clubbed into curly braces. The properties are readonly. The corresponding data-type is generated by the compiler. The name of the data-type remains unknown. It is not accessible in source code. Such types are called anonymous types. They are used to quickly store data without the need of defining a data-type. They are also used in query expressions.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ STRINGS AND STRING MANIPULATION\nIn this tutorial we take common topics on strings, such as creating strings, on concatenation of strings, extraction of a substring, and truncation, null testing, searching a string within another, and comparison of two strings.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ NULL CONDITIONAL (?. AND ?[]) OPERATORS\nAn object reference might be null when your code calls a function or accesses a property. Programmers use an if-condition as a safety net and make a null-test on an object that has a possibility of being null at that point. The null conditional operators make it easier to write the code without the if-condition.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ PRACTICE EXERCISE ON ANONYMOUS TYPES\nWe have to store four properties of a record - student id of string type and marks in three subjects of Int32 type. Inside main create an array of 10 items. Use a for-loop to fill the array. Each item can be filled with random data. Then, use a select query on the array to project two fields only - Student ID and marks in the first subject. Print the queried data with a suitable loop. Use var keyword as far as possible.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ PRACTICE EXERCISE ON STRING MANIPULATION\nSuppose there is a string s = \"aubcd123paqeaw\". Write three programs (1) Write a program to count the number of 'a' in this string. (2) Write a program to extract the numeric part into a string variable and display it. (3) Replace all vowels by underscore.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ METHODS AND REF, IN, PARAMS AND NAMED ARGS\nFunctions in C# are usually called Methods. They can exist inside a class, struct, record - but not globally outside. So every function, including the Main function must be declared inside a class or a struct. In this tutorial we examine default arguments, named arguments, passing parameters by value and reference, the use of in keyword and finally passing unspecified number of arguments with the params keyword.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ DELEGATES, LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS, ACTION AND FUNC DELEGATES\nIn this tutorial we learn about delegates that are a data-type for a function signature. In this context a function signature includes the return type and the arguments of a function, but doesn't include the name. We also learn about lambda expressions and built-in delegates called Action and Func delegates.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ PROPERTIES AUTO-IMPLEMENTED, INIT, READONLY, REQUIRED\nThe concept of a property is the most widely used in dotnet programming. Properties provide setter and getter functions for validation of data before it enters or leaves your object. A property has a specific syntax that needs to be mastered.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ EXPRESSION-BODIED MEMBERS\nIf a function consists of only one statement or expression, then the braces and the return keyword could be redundant. Thus, we can simplify such functions by removing the braces and the return keyword. The result is that the overall look of the function becomes simplified, and it becomes easier to read. Functions, properties, operators, and indexers that use this syntax are called expression-bodied members.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ PRACTICE EXERCISE IN C# - DELEGATES\nCreate a class MyClock that contains only one public function \"void Tick(Object?)\". This signature matches the signature of the TimerCallback delegate defined in the System.Threading.Timer class of dotnet. The \"void Tick\" function prints the current system time on the console (use DateTimeNow). Inside Main create a System.Threading.Timer by using a suitable constructor that calls \"void Tick\" once every second. Run the program to verify that you have a clock that prints the current system time. You will have to study the documentation of System.Threading.Timer class.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ PRACTICE EXERCISE ON PROPERTY CHANGED EVENT AND LAMBDAS\nCreate a class called MyNumber with a property called Number of Int32 type. This class should contain an event delegate that takes one argument of Int32 type. The class MyNumber should raise this event when the Number property changes. The changed value should be sent as an argument to all delegates that register to this event. Inside Main create an object of MyNumber and attach an event handler that prints the changed value. The event handler should be an anonymous expression lambda that receives an Int32 argument and prints the number to console. Test the project by changing the Number property. If you did the things correctly, then you should see the event handler called. This might be a difficult one. So please go through the solution if you find the question itself difficult to understand.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ INHERITANCE AND PROTECTED AND SEALED KEYWORDS\nInheritance in C# is similar to what we have in other object oriented languages. In this tutorial we take a short example to get introduced to the syntax. We also learn about the protected and sealed keywords.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ POLYMORPHISM IN C#\nThis tutorial is for explaining a few programs that exhibit the idea of polymorphism. I won't be able to go into the philosophy of polymorphism. The whole point of this tutorial is to introduce you to the syntax, and about how the usual things are done in a C# syntax.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ HOW AND WHY OF STATIC CLASSES\nA static class is a container for self-contained static functions that just operate on the input operators. The concept of a static class and static members is essentially the same as in other object oriented languages like C++ and Java. static classes provide simplicity but they are not a part of pure object oriented design. The general guidelines are to use static classes only SPARINGLY in your projects. In this tutorial we learn about the features of a static class in C#.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ STATIC AND CONST MEMBERS\nOnly one copy of a static data member exists in the entire program. A const member behaves like a static, but it's value is marked as fixed and constant. The compiler knows its value. Therefore it can make substitutions and avoid memory allocation for a const member. Let's see the finer details.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ PRACTICE EXERCISE IN C# - STATIC AND CONST\nThis exercise is an exercise just for the sake of practice in static and consts in a class. Create a class called CBankAccount that contains a static member to hold the name of the bank, a constant member to store the minimum balance (100) that a customer has to maintain, another constant member for rate of interest (5) and a yet another constant member for periodicity (4 months) of applying interest. Also add an instance member to hold the balance of a customer in dollars. Add a static constructor to initialize the name of the bank by obtaining input from the user. Add a static function called RenameBank that can be used to give a new name to the bank. Add two functions called Withdraw(int amount) and Deposit(int amount) that update the balance after a successful transaction and print it. Also add a function AddInterest() that calculates simple interest for four months and updates the balance. Test the class in Main.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ GENERICS\nIn this tutorial we take a hypothetical problem to build towards the concept of generics. First we explore a few bad solutions. Then we explain a perfect solution by generics. That leads us to list the benefits of using generics. We conclude with the constraints on generic parameters.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ ARRAYS - JAGGED AND MULTI-DIMENSIONAL\nArray can be used to store many variables of the same type. An array can be of one dimension, can be of multiple dimensions and can even be a jagged array, which is commonly called an array of arrays. The size of an array is decided at the time of creation, and cannot be altered later.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ COLLECTIONS\nA collection class holds objects. We have seen that arrays also hold objects. The size of an array is fixed at the time of creation, but collections can grow and shrink as per need. Some collections can assign keys  to the objects they hold. The elements can be accessed with a key like we have a dictionary.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ LINQ - IENUMERABLE, YIELD AND ENUMERATOR\nThis tutorial introduces you to the IEnumerable interface and its practical significance. After that we discuss the internal workings of this interface. We demonstrate how the yield keyword can be used to return an IEnumerable from a function. The tutorial concludes with a C# program to efficiently print a fibonacci series by using the yield keyword and statement.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ LINQ - SELECT, WHERE, ORDERBY AND ORDERBYDESCENDING\nIn this tutorial we learn the use of Select, Where, OrderBy and OrderByDescending functions provided by C# LINQ. A program has been used to explain these functions. This will help you get started but experience is the best teacher. So all I can help you is get started.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ LINQ - FIRSTORDEFAULT, SINGLE, FIRST, SINGLEORDEFAULT\nIn this tutorial we learn about FirstOrDefault, Single, First and SingleOrDefault extension methods available on an IEnumerable. Use FirstOrDefault for finding the first element that matches a condition. It returns the default value if no matching records exist. \"First\" does the same thing but throws an exception instead. SingleOrDefault returns the default value if exactly one record cannot be found. There is one more called Find which should be used if the search has to be by a primary key value.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ LINQ - GROUPBY\nC# Linq provides a GroupBy extension method for grouping records on a common key. This tutorial starts with a brief introduction to the concept of grouping. Then we use the GroupBy extension to group various records on a property called last name so that customers of the same last name are grouped together. The result is then displayed on console.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ LINQ - JOIN\nTwo lists can be joined on common key or keys by using the Join extension method. The concept of a join in linq is exactly the same as in SQL of databases. A detailed concept of joins is far too complex to be described in a single tutorial. So this tutorial has been kept simple to help you get started and walk you to a point where a further study is easier.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ PRACTICE EXERCISE ON GROUPJOIN\nCreate a list of Category records with ID and Name as properties. Add 3 items to this list - (ID:1, Name:\"For Men\"), (2, \"For Women\") and (3, \"For Kids\"). Then create a list of SubCategory records with ID, Name and CategoryFK as properties. The property CategoryFK is a foreign key for the ID property of a Category. Add these items - (ID:1, CategoryFK:1, Name:\"Shirts\"), (2, 1, \"T Shirts\"), (3, 1, \"Trousers\"), (4, 2, \"Skirts\"), (5, 2, \"Shoes\"). Use the GroupJoin extension to present dresses of men under a heading \"For Men\", dresses of women under \"For Women\" and likewise for kids.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ EF CORE - CREATING A DATABASE\nDatabase connectivity is required in almost every project. It is best done with the help of EF Core libraries. The good thing is that the steps for database connectivity are fairly standardized now. The same steps are used for C# console applications, the same are for a C# winforms, C# WPF and even C# web applications. This tutorial walks you through the steps required for creating a database. In the next tutorials we shall explain the create, read, update and delete operations.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ EF CORE - COMPLETE CRUD EXAMPLE CONSOLE APPLICATION\nThis tutorial continues from the previous tutorial where we created a database and a table in it. We shall now add a blog record to the table and save it. Then we shall extract it back and make a change to the Heading property, and save it again. Then we shall extract it back and delete it from the table. Finally, we shall display the count of records in the table, and verify that it is shown zero.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ FUNCTIONAL TECHNIQUES - DISCARDS\nDiscards are denoted by an underscore. They can be thought of identifiers that receive an assignment, but the assignment is discarded and not available for use. A discard is most commonly used to indicate that the return type of a function has been ignored intentionally. But there are other less known use-cases of a discard. This tutorial demonstrates them by using various program examples - using a discard to (1) ignore a function return, (2) ignore the return of a tuple, (3) ignore an out parameter of a function, (4) default case of a switch expression and (5) as a forced assignment.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ FUNCTIONAL TECHNIQUES - PATTERN MATCHING\nPattern matching is used to test an expression. In this tutorial we take various snippets to learn expression matching. One of the uses is to test if a variable matches a data type. Pattern matching is also used in switch expressions to match  the arms against constants, strings or logical conditions. Pattern matching is also used for comparison of multiple inputs passed as expressions of tuple types. Lists can also be matched if you are using C# 11 or later.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ REFLECTION\nReflection is used to obtain information about the functions, properties, events, fields of a given Type of dotnet. For example, we can use reflection to query the constructors and methods of the System.String class. We can even use Reflection to execute the methods queried through Reflection. We can use Reflection to obtain a description about the assembly that contains a given Type. Please do, however, take note that this is not something that is done very commonly - it's available when you need it.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ ASYNCHRONOUS TASK PROGRAMMING\nAn application is often required to make database access, perform file read and write or contact internet for communication. All these tasks involve time consuming operations that make the main thread too busy. This causes the application to hang and freeze while the main thread waits for a large file to download. The solution to this problem lies in asynchronous task programming. A potentially long and time consuming operation can be run in parallel in such a way that the UI (user interface) remains responsive and, possibly, provides a progress feedback to the user. Let's explore it in this tutorial!\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ EXCEPTIONS AND ERRORS\nA function throws an exception on failure. The functions that are expected to fail are written inside try blocks with one or more catch blocks. Each catch block handles a specific reason of failure. A catch block receives an exception object which is often used to obtain a detailed information of the cause of failure.\n\n\nCHAPTER➤ PROJECT EXERCISE ON CSV PROCESSING\nA text file contains an unknown number of records. Each record is of the format ABCD,N where ABCD is the code of a supplier and N is a sequence of digits for the amount billed. For example CHD1,34678 is a record with a supplier code of CHD1 and billed amount of 34678. Your program has to read all the records and output a report in a file where all the records are arranged in the increasing order of the amount. The last line shows the sum total. If there is an error in any record the program should exit by printing \"Error at record--- \".",

We'll delve deeper into its capabilities by exploring various events and properties that enable robust data management within your Delphi applications.\nMastering Events and Properties\nWe'll examine the intricacies of:\nEvent Handling: Learn how to effectively respond to crucial events like Before/AfterApplyUpdates, Before/AfterGetRecords, Before/AfterRowRequest, Before/AfterRefresh, and more. You'll discover how to leverage these opportunities to enhance your application's functionality.\nProperties Galore: Uncover the potential hidden within properties such as CommandText, Parameters, Blobs, and others. These elements form the backbone of data storage, retrieval, and manipulation in TClientDataSet.\nMethod Mastery: Learn powerful methods like Execute, ApplyUpdates, RefreshRecord, and more. Mastering these will enable you to manage your data efficiently, whether fetching new records or applying updates to the dataset.\nUnlocking Master/Detail Relationships and Blob Fields\nWe'll guide you through configuring Master/Detail relationships within TClientDataSet, allowing for seamless integration of hierarchical data structures. You'll also learn how to easily handle Blob (Binary Large OBject) fields, a crucial aspect in many real-world applications.\nFrom Local Data Management to Real-World Database Connectivity\nNow that we've explored the capabilities of TClientDataSet in-depth, it's time to connect your application to a real database. We'll introduce you to TDataSetProvider , a powerful tool that bridges the gap between local data management and external database connectivity.\nWith Interbase via Database Express (DBX4) as our chosen database engine, we'll explore how to fetch data from a database, manipulate it in memory, and then apply those changes back into the database. This comprehensive coverage will ensure you're fully equipped with the knowledge to tackle real-world projects that require seamless data integration.\nThis course promises to be an exciting conclusion to your journey through TClientDataSet. It provides a solid foundation for tackling more complex data management tasks within Delphi applications.\n\n\nAbout TClientDataSet\nThe TClientDataSet is a powerful and flexible data access component in Borland's (now Embarcadero's) Delphi development environment. It was introduced as part of Delphi 2, released in late 1995. The TClientDataSet allows your application to store and manipulate data locally on the client machine without needing to connect to a database server.\nHere are some key features and uses of the TClientDataSet:\nKey Features\nLocal Data Storage: It can store data locally, allowing your applications to work offline or with limited network connectivity.\nData Editing: It supports editing data in place within the dataset, making it suitable for applications where users need to update their own records directly.\nData Encryption and Password Protection: It supports encryption and password protection for added security when storing sensitive data locally.\nMulti-Tenant Support: Allows for multiple datasets (or \"tables\") to be stored in one file, which can be useful for applications that handle different users' data separately.\nSQL-Driven Operations: Supports SQL queries for fetching and manipulating data.\nUses\nOffline Capable Applications: Useful for creating desktop applications that don't require a constant internet connection but still want the ability to access, edit, or view local data.\nDatabase Prototyping: Because of its ease of use and flexibility, TClientDataSet is often used in prototyping phases where developers can quickly create mock databases to test their application's logic.\nData Migration Tools: It has been used as part of migration tools from older database systems to newer ones by providing a way to store data temporarily on the client for manipulation before being uploaded.\nArchitecture\nThe TClientDataSet works with other Delphi components, like DBGrid, DBNavigator, and DBEdit, to provide a user interface for managing its data. It also interacts with SQL-based services for fetching or modifying data, though it doesn't directly require database connectivity in the traditional sense.\nIn summary, the TClientDataSet offers an efficient way to manage local data within Delphi applications without needing server-side databases, making it useful for offline-capable apps and prototyping phases.",

This process not only offers the opportunity to win prizes from giveaways, but also provides you with valuable skills in the fields of automation and programming.\nThrough this Instagram bot, you will learn how to perform actions such as liking, commenting, and following using Python. By the end of this course, you will be able to create your very own Instagram bot, equipped with the knowledge and skills gained from the lessons.\nThe course is designed in such a way that even someone without programming experience can follow along, as I will explain each step in detail. However, if you have previous experience in programming, automation, or other related fields, you may find it easier to grasp the concepts and work with the Instagram bot more effectively.\nAt the beginning of the video series, I will walk you through the process of downloading the necessary applications to create this Instagram bot. Specifically, we will download two key applications: Python and PyCharm. Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, widely used for various applications. PyCharm, on the other hand, is a dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a comprehensive suite of essential tools for Python developers, tightly integrated to create a streamlined and productive environment for development.",
