      "description": "Welcome to our comprehensive course on Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE), also known as fixed assets or depreciable assets. In this course, we will dive deep into the world of PPE and provide you with a thorough understanding of how to effectively manage and account for these critical assets in your financial statements.\nWe will begin by exploring the fundamental concepts of PPE, including what it represents and why it is essential for businesses. You will learn how to accurately record PPE transactions, ensuring that they are properly recognized and reflected in your accounting records.\nOne of the key aspects of managing PPE is depreciation, which reflects the gradual wear and tear or obsolescence of these assets over time. We will cover multiple depreciation methods to help you determine the most appropriate approach for your organization. The straight-line depreciation method, widely used for its simplicity, will be thoroughly explained along with its calculation techniques. Additionally, we will delve into the double declining balance method, an accelerated depreciation approach that allocates higher depreciation in the earlier years of an asset's life. Furthermore, we will explore the units of production method, which bases depreciation on the actual usage or production output of the asset.\nUnderstanding the difference between capital expenditures and revenue expenditures is crucial in properly classifying PPE-related costs. We will guide you through the intricacies of distinguishing between these expenditure types and how to accurately record them in your financial statements.\nDisposing of PPE is another critical aspect we will address. Whether through sale, retirement, or other means, you will learn the proper accounting treatment and journal entries for PPE disposals. We will also cover the scenarios where PPE may or may not be fully depreciated and discuss how to account for any cash or non-cash transactions involved in the disposal process.\nThroughout the course, we will provide a comprehensive overview of key terms and definitions related to property, plant, and equipment, ensuring that you are familiar with the necessary vocabulary and terminology used in this domain.\nTo enhance your learning experience, the course includes valuable resources such as downloadable PDF files, preformatted Excel practice files, multiple-choice practice questions, short calculation questions, and engaging discussion prompts. These resources will support your understanding, reinforce concepts, and provide opportunities for hands-on practice and active participation in the learning process.\nYour instructor, a highly experienced professional with extensive knowledge in accounting concepts and practical expertise in software like QuickBooks, will guide you through the course. With certifications such as being a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA), and possessing a Master of Science in Taxation, the instructor brings a wealth of real-world insights and teaching experience to help you master the intricacies of PPE accounting.\nBy the end of this course, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of property, plant, and equipment, enabling you to effectively manage, account for, and make informed decisions regarding these valuable assets in your organization's financial statements.\nJoin us now and embark on your journey to becoming a proficient PPE accountant!",

We do recommend spending time learning the full accounting process, and we do have courses that do just that.\nHowever, many small businesses want to get right down to data input as fast as possible, and others already have a good understanding of the system and want to focus specifically on bank feeds.\nWe will focus on bank feeds in this course.\nFor example, some small businesses may be perfectly happy using a cash basis system and will, therefore, not need some of the functions used in a full accounting cycle. Businesses that use a cash basis model can structure their data input to be much more heavily dependent on the bank and bank feed data.\nWe will discuss types of businesses that fit well into a cash basis model as we work through the practice problems. We will also discuss some problem areas many businesses have and how to set up a system that works for them.\nThis course will work through a practice problem and will provide test data that learners can use in their system to follow along if they choose.",

Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash flow and how they are different from each other.\nRead these financial reports and interpret what the numbers really mean.\nThrow questions on your financial reports that your accountant has never been asked before!\n\nJust follow the simple steps and tips that we reveal.\n\nThe course will continue to grow and grow with new materials, new examples and new case studies being added every week!\n______________________________________________________________________\nAbout this course:\nStep-by-Step approach to reading financial statements\nDownloadable case studies and material\nFull lifetime access to this course and course material\n\n\nSo, why are you waiting? Join me in learning how financial statements are made and what they mean!\nRemember, for every minute that you are waiting, somebody else is getting ahead of you!",

Similar Excel worksheets to the ones we will construct can be useful for analyzing many areas of accounting, and the Excel skills learned in creating them are also very applicable both inside accounting and outside of it.\nWe will discuss the reasons for creating an adjusting and tax entries Excel worksheet. Some benefits of the Excel worksheet include the ability to enter adjusting entries in an efficient way and build an adjusted trial balance, the ability to enter tax entries efficiently and build a trial balance on a tax basis, and the ability to reconcile book net income and tax net income.\nAn Excel worksheet can be used to show the difference between net income on the unadjusted trial balance, the adjusted trial balance, and tax trial balance in an easy visual way. A worksheet can be used as a reference to communicate to supervisors, clients, and as a reference for us to look back at in the future.\nThe course will build an Excel worksheet from scratch providing tools to help with the construction for each step along the way. We will provide an updated Excel worksheet for most steps, allowing us to jump forward or to rework any part of the course without starting over. The Excel worksheets will generally have at least two tabs, one with the completed step, showing the end product, and one that has been completed up to the current step in the process, allowing us to fill it in with the help of the instructional video and the Excel tab showing the completed work.\nWe will then practice entering some adjusting entries and tax entries into the worksheet. As we add adjusting and tax entries to the Excel worksheet, we will better understand how the worksheet is formatted and how best to use it. We will see how net income is calculated on a book basis, on a tax basis, and how the worksheet will show the reconciliation of the two.\nThis course is not designed to give tax advice but to show how to construct an Excel worksheet to track adjustments.\nThe course will also discuss some alternative formats for building an adjusting entry and tax entry worksheet that can be found in practice. We will discuss the pros and cons of the different formats.\nWe will also discuss how to format an adjusting and tax entry worksheet made in the prior year so that we can enter the current year trial balance and data into it.\nIn addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\nâ¢Â Â Â  QuickBooks Pro Desktop 2019 Backup files\nâ¢Â Â Â  Excel practice files",

      "description": "The present GST return system had a manual process of fetching the sales invoice data for the purpose of matching with the ITC reported by taxpayers. Whereas the New GST return system automates the process to greater extent giving visibility of the process to both the parties -suppliers and the recipients.\n\n\nAt present, GST returns requires details of sales and exports to be reported in GSTR-1 return, as well as the summary ITC and tax to be declared in GSTR-3B for regular taxpayers.\nThe ITC amount is claimed on a provisional basis and involves reconciliation with GSTR-2A. The reconciliation results in either excess credit claims or short of claims. The taxpayer can adjust this difference in subsequent returns earlier of two dates for a given financial year. 1) Due date of filing GSTR-3B for September of the next year or 2) Due date of Annual returns for that financial year.\n\n\nNew GST return is aimed to simplify the current return filing process which has multiple returns. The new system and format of the GST returns was initially introduced in the 28th GST Council meeting meeting held on 21 July, 2018.The return prototype gave a concrete picture of how the returns look like in actual and the detailed process of filing too.\n\n\nBelow are some of the benefits of simplified returns which makes its introduction a necessary move:\n\n\nSimplified returns are profile based returns. A lot of supplies come under the ambit of GST. However, most of the dealers deal with only a few supplies. Thus, a profiling questionnaire will enable the GST return format to display only those information fields that are relevant to the taxpayerâs profile.\nInvoices can be uploaded by the supplier on a continuous and real-time basis, which will be available for action to be taken by the recipient.\nThe simplification in forms and filing procedure will lead to lower compliance costs.\nTaxpayers will be able to amend their returns once filed, and file up to two amendment returns for a tax period.",

The course will also provide backup files that can be used to jump forward in the course or to rework problems while using the same data set.\nWe will enter two months of data into our QuickBooks files using simulated bank statements we will provide in the course as PDF files. After we enter the data into QuickBooks, we will generate reports and compare the data in the personal and business files.\nThe next step will be to enter similar data into one QuickBooks file, a QuickBooks file that will be used to track both personal and business accounting data. To achieve this goal, we will start a new QuickBooks file and enter financial data from a simulated bank statement the course will provide in PDF format.\nAs we enter data into the joint QuickBooks file, we will assign a class to each transaction that will help to separate the data during financial reporting. After we have entered the data, we will generate reports including a profit and loss by class. The profit and loss by class report well separate business and personal expenses. We will also discuss other options for filtering reports by class.\nWe will then compare the two methods, the use of two separate QuickBooks files to the use of one QuickBooks file for both business and personal data, separating the content with the use of class tracking.\nNext, we will discuss personal balance sheet items and how we can add them to our financial data including financial investments, our home, our mortgage, and our auto.\nWe will also discuss alternative methods for tracking credit cards, recording loan payments, and entering employee W-2 income.\nIn addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\nâ¢Â Â Â  QuickBooks Pro Desktop 2019 Backup files\nâ¢Â Â Â  Excel practice files\nâ¢Â Â Â  Downloadable PDF Files\nThe QuickBooks Desktop 2019 backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose.\nExcel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.",

Accounting errors are usually unintentional mistakes made when recording journal entries.\nSmall accounting errors may not affect the final numbers in financial statements. Or they might cause major distortions in the overall figures. These types of errors require lots of time and resources to find and correct them\nThe integrity of the information inÂ  accounting system is only as good as the dataÂ  entered. This means including an item in the appropriate account, applying the correct description or code for the item, and entering the correct amount. Accounting errors can result from simple mistakes or misunderstanding accounting rules.\nFraud detection is a set of activities undertaken to prevent money or property from being obtained through false pretenses. Fraud detection is applied to many industries such as banking or insurance\nFraud in audits is when an entity is found to have illegally altered financial statements to manipulate its financial health or to hide profit or losses.

Odoo is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software with dozens of interconnected applications. Applications such as inventory, manufacturing, website, expenses, and sales have a direct impact on your accounting books.\n\n\nThere are three primary goals of this course.\n\n\nTeach you all of the basic accounting functions you need to perform on daily basis to run your business.\nWe will cover every basic accounting function including Inventory Accounting, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Reconciliation, Sales Tax, Expense Accounting, Revenue Accounting, and Asset Management. You will be exposed to all of the main accounting reports such as the Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Statement, and Cash Flow statements. At the end of the course, you will be comfortable making manual journal entries, navigating the General Ledger, and troubleshooting any accounting errors.\n\n\nTeach you how every application interacts with the accounting application.\nIf you have used any ERP software you know that every business decision and record you create in the system may affect your accounting books. It is essential that you understand the impact of each of your decisions. In this course, we will cover exactly how each application interacts with accounting. This includes manual and automated inventory valuation, expense management, re-invoicing expenses, collecting customer payments, dealing with multiple currencies and exchange rates, applying landed costs, and dealing with cash.\n\n\nTeach you how to transition from a legacy system to Odoo Accounting.\nOnce you are comfortable with the software we will go over exactly how to transition your accounting books to Odoo. This process involves importing your trial balance, using clearing accounts, importing your open bills and invoices, and making sure you have all of your location-specific accounts set up such as your scrap, inventory adjustment, and Work in Progress (WIP).\n\nThis course is designed for Implementation Consultants or Business Systems Analyst, Bookkeepers, Accountants, and anyone evaluating Odoo as an ERP solution.Â  It will be incredibly helpful for anyone who wants to understand the accounting impact on every decision they make throughout the Odoo ecosystem.\n\nDuring the creation of each video, I attempt to think of all the most common edge cases and bring them to your attention. I take pride in each video being as comprehensive and complete as possible. Every business has slightly different accounting needs. Nonetheless, in this course, you will touch on every accounting function in Odoo. Even if we do not directly cover an exact use case you will have the knowledge to build out your own complete solution.\n\nThe only prerequisites for this course are basic accounting knowledge and basic Odoo knowledge. This course will not teach you the fundamentals of accounting.\n\n\nThousands of people have benefited from my free videos on YouTube.Â  Here are some of the comments:\n\"Excellent video! This exactly what I was looking for as a pragmatic solution.\"\n\"Great tutorial! Very detailed. Keep up the great work.\"\n\"Kevin, As your Pick - Pack - Ship video, this is also a great tutorial. Very detailed.\"\n\"Another great tutorial! Thank you very much for posting all these outstanding and detailed tutorials.\"\n\"Thanks brother.

      "description": "This course will just provide the Excel practice questions component of our resources so that learners can practice problems without the distraction of other resources.\nBookkeeping problems in Excel.\nWe will discuss receivables, focusing on accounts receivable and notes receivable, reviewing the accounts receivable cycle, the journal entries for recording accounts receivable, and related subsidiary ledgers.\nWe will discuss bad debt and valuing ofÂ accounts receivable using two methods, the allowance method and the direct write off method. The accounts receivable account represents money owed to the company but there will be times when the companyÂ cannot collect on the account receivables.\nUnder the direct write off method, we write off the accounts receivable as we determine they are not collectible. The direct write off method does not do a good job of representing the accounts receivable account'sÂ true value and does not do a good job of conformingÂ to the matching principle, matching up expenses with the related revenue it was used to generate.\nThe allowance method does a better job of valuingÂ accounts receivableÂ and conforming to the matchingÂ principle and is the method preferred. The allowance method is more complex, however, and requires the use of estimates.\nWe will also discuss notes receivable, the journal entry for recording notes receivable, and for receivingÂ paymentÂ on a note receivable. We will cover detailed methods for calculating simple interest.\nWho will we be learning from?\nYou will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\nYou will be learning from somebody who is a:\nâ¢Â Â Â  CPA â Certified Public Accountant\nâ¢Â Â Â  CGMA â Chartered Global Management Accountant\nâ¢Â Â Â  Master of Science in Taxation\nâ¢Â Â Â  CPS â Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\nâ¢Â Â Â  Curriculum Development Export\nAs a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\nAs a CPS and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\nThe instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives. Experience designing technical courses has also benefit in being able to design a course in a logical fashion and deal with problems related to technical topics and the use of software like QuickBooks Pro.\nContent Includes:\nAccount receivable and note receivable characteristics\nAccounts receivable cycle\nAccounts receivable subsidiary ledger\nAccounts receivable valuation\nAllowance for doubtful accounts method of accounts receivable\nDirect write off method of accounts receivable\nHow to estimate bad debt expense under the allowance method\nComponents of a note receivable\nHow to calculate simple interest\nHow to record a note receivable",

The credit limit for a customer depends on the payment method and customer payment history. The payment for the goods is based on payment conditions based on the business transaction.\nCredit management is the process of deciding which customers to extend credit to and evaluating those customers' creditworthiness over time. It involves setting credit limits for customers, monitoring customer payments and collections, and assessing the risks associated with extending credit to customers.\n\n\nSAP Credit Management (FIN-FSCM-CR) supports your company in determining the risk of losses on receivables from your business partners early and in making credit decisions efficiently and in some cases automated.\nSAP FICO (Finance and Controlling) is derived from FI (Financial Accounting) and CO (Controlling/Management Accounting). It is the Finance and Cost controlling module in SAP ERP where FI stands for Financial Accounting and CO stands for Controlling. Credit check is triggered by changes made in the document to values in any of the credit-sensitive fields. According to your Customizing settings, the system runs a check credit between changes or differences in the sales order data against the default values in the customer master record.",

I feel Cindy does a great job of cutting to the meat of the matter and doesn't waste a lot of time on the extra bells and whistles that very few people will find useful.\"\n- DEANNE RYAN\n\"Great explanation and easy to follow. Great instruction from Cindy\"\n- MELISSA SUPERNOR\n\"So far, I am enjoying this course. It has reached and exceeded my expectations, the speaker has a wonderful, clear voice that does not make me drowsy, and explains things fully. I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn ALL about Quickbooks. 10/10\"\n- YELTZIN ARISTID GOMEZ VENEGAS\n\"This is a great intro for a new QB user. I could have used less info in some places (how to edit a field and other things that are intuitive if you are comfortable on a PC) and more info in others (more general process, how-tos, and a few basic accounting principles for a better understanding of what QB can and should do.) Also, if you skip the modules on topics you think aren't relevant, you may miss some useful information about the software features. The instructor is easy to understand and pleasant to listen to. \"\n- MARGARET W. SEICSHNAYDRE\n\" I have had to restart my QuickBooks company file twice now, and finally just decided that it was time for some lessons. I am only a couple of videos in and have learned many tricks that I was unaware of before. I look forward to the video lectures to come and the useful information within.\"\n- KATRINA BIGGS\n\"I am so glad that it is for beginners like me because I want to fully understand the concept from the very start of Quickbooks. Thank You\"\n- JUDITH DELUCA\n\n\nThis bundle includes:\n25+ hours of video tutorials\n290+ individual video lectures\nCertificate of completion\n\n\nCourse Compatibility\nThis course was recorded using QuickBooks Pro Desktop 2020, and 2021 editions, and QuickBooks Online (in 2020 and 2021). Much of what is shown is also available in older versions of QuickBooks as well as the other desktop editions (Premier, Enterprise).\nThis course was designed for people new to QuickBooks but may also be useful for students with some QuickBooks experience who are looking to improve their knowledge of accounting software.",

We will look at the best way to capture accounting information from the acquisition of the property from both the bookkeeping as well as tax perspective to its disposal (sale).\nWe will look into the accounting end and documentation as well as tax planning opportunities to help students develop a deeper understanding of both accounting and tax for real estate in an effort to assist real estate professionals/investors to make better-informed decisions about the portfolios.\nSome of the most important topics we will cover include:\n1. Pre-acquisition accounting\n2. Acquisition accounting (emphasis on the cost-segregation study)\n3. Real estate operations accounting (emphasis on depreciation and NOL)\n4. Sale of real estate accounting\n5. Tax planning opportunities (start-up deductions, exit strategies)\nTo make the content of the course easier to digest we will use a fictitious company, launched by Niva. Niva is interested in the real estate business. As a prudent investor, she recruits a world-class team of advisors to help her purchase and manage her first rental property. She brings on board a great broker, residential real estate attorney, accountant, property management company, and an inspector. As a brilliant real estate investor, she knows that many people have made catastrophic mistakes. She intends to reduce the likelihood of making those herself. After the acquisition, the property management oversees daily operations, while she focuses on overall asset management.\nTo ensure the learning in the course, we will make a number of assumptions in an effort to cover all the major parts of the real estate transactions, their respective accounting, and potential tax consequences.",

      "description": "This comprehensive course introduces students to the specialized accounting practices for e-commerce businesses, primarily focusing on the utilization of QuickBooks Online. In the digital marketplace, e-commerce businessesâentities that engage in online sales of goods or servicesâoften rely on third-party platforms such as Shopify, Amazon, or eBay. This course is designed to address common challenges that arise in managing accounting data in this unique business model.\nStudents will learn about data selection from third-party platforms and payment processors for their accounting systems, methodologies to organize the data efficiently, and strategies for effective inventory management. A key objective is to determine what level of sales data detail should be transferred into QuickBooks to ensure a balance between comprehensive financial reporting and system performance. The course emphasizes the importance of data summarization to streamline the accounting process and avoid software slow-downs due to data overaccumulation.\nWe will delve into the principal methods of importing sales data from third-party e-commerce platforms into QuickBooks: utilizing bank feeds, manual journal entry, or employing integration software. The course will provide a detailed analysis of each method, discussing their benefits and drawbacks, and offering guidance on the appropriate circumstances for each use. QuickBooks Online's built-in integration capabilities with e-commerce platforms such as Shopify, Amazon, and eBay will also be explored.\nThe course additionally addresses the complexities of inventory tracking in an e-commerce environment. We will cover diverse inventory management strategies, evaluating the advantages and potential downsides of each, along with recommendations on the suitability of each method under varying scenarios.\nBy the conclusion of this course, students will possess a robust understanding of e-commerce accounting principles, equipped with practical tools to effectively manage accounting tasks in an e-commerce setting using QuickBooks Online.",

I cover many advanced topics that many people have trouble with, based on my teaching experience. I cover such topics as how and when to create journal entries, creating custom reports in Quickbooks and then exporting the data to Excel to create a pivot table report, how to create a custom invoice template, how to use bank feeds to import your transactions into Quickbooks. I also go over tricky transactions such as how to handle bounced checks, customer prepayments, zero checks and how to record outside payroll.\nThe emphasis is on explaining the concepts behind the procedures. I believe that if you understand the concepts, you can figure out the procedure yourself. The concepts will apply no matter what software program you use.\nThis course is geared toward the regular user of Quickbooks; I assume that you have a basic knowledge of Accounting and Quickbooks. Specifically, I assume that you know about debits and credits, P&L and Balance Sheet reports and that you know your way around Quickbooks. I assume you know how to create items and basic forms such as invoices and bills.",

The course starts with videos describing the SuiteFoundation exam and giving tips on how to take it. The subsequent main curriculum section takes NetSuite topic by topic and lays out the exact things you must know to pass the exam. Unlike Oracle's Learning Cloud Support courses that drag you through dozens of hours of unnecessary explanation of NetSuite features that \"could be\" on the exam, this course hones in on what you WILL be asked about.\nI've also included an entire Video Resources section at the end of the course that includes almost 10 hours of additional video content from my other courses. These videos all relate to the topics covered in the SuiteFoundation exam and I provide them here for free so if you want to gain a deeper practical knowledge of how to use these tools/features, you can.\nIf you follow the instructions I give in this course and watch all videos necessary to understand each topic, I am confident that you will be able to pass your SuiteFoundation Certification exam. I will be coming out with more advanced certification coursesÂ  soon.",

You will start from the beginning so you don't need any prior knowledge about bookkeeping (however if you do, that makes it easier). We begin the course with the more simple booking and increase the difficulty and complexity as we advance through the course.\nIn this course you'll learn everything you need to know to start doing you own bookkeeping from A to Z and we build a solid foundation that you can use in the future to perform bookkeeping tasks for your own company.\nYou will learn about the fundamentals of bookkeeping and much more. We discuss things such as the journal post, t-accounts, debit and credit.Â You'll learn how to decide what type of account you need to use for your entry, such as, is the account an asset, a liability, a cost or a revenue.Â And what does this account need to do, increase or decrease.Â These are the basics to understand bookkeeping.\nWe cover a lot of theory which is important to understand bookkeeping. And combined with the theory, we follow along with a fictional flowershop bussines to put that theory into practice.\nYou'll learn what invoices are and how an invoice should be setup in terms of applying discounts, vat, returnable packaging, and additional charges such as delivery. And of course how to book outgoing invoices but also incoming invoices and what to do when you need to book credit notes. You'll learn how to purchase assets (investments), how to book these and how depreciations are applied and booked. We'll cover value added tax, what is it and how does it work in the books.\nWe discuss accounts payable (suppliers) and accounts receivable (customers).Â And what should you do if a customer does not pay the invoice? We'll talk about that to.\nAnd what to do with business loans or money you invest in your company? How should you book sales in your store and how are these different from invoices? What happens if we deposit money in our bank account that we received cash in the shop? Ever heard of internal transfers? Current and non-current debts? We will discuss all of that in this course.\nLast but not least you'll learn how to perform end of year bookings such as the trial balance, accrued accounts and more. To finish the course we'll set up a closing balance sheet, a profit- and loss statement and process taxes, reserves and more.\nSo if you want to learn how to perform bookkeeping for your business this is the course for you!",

We will be tackling every challenging topic but presenting it in a very digestible and understandable way. Accounting doesn't need to be hard :)\n\nThis course is based on practical real-life scenarios. We will fully walkthrough examples together end to end. We even go as far as taking a look at the email notifications we will be receiving from the system and logging in as different users to see various user permissions. We will also be learning how to use the data import and integration functionality as you likely wouldn't be entering transactions manually one by one in your business. Less theory and more practicality!\nAs a bonus, we will also be connecting to our Shopify store so that we can bring over product information and auto-generate invoices based on orders received in our store.\n\nThe end goal is to have you feeling confident and comfortable with using QuickBooks Online so that you can fully utilize this in your business or implement it for other businesses.

      "description": "Accounting often referred to as the âlanguage of business.â Whether you are going into management or actually going to be an accountant, you need to be familiar with the basics of accounting. This includes understanding the concepts of debits and credits, assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, dividends and equity. From an investorâs perspective, the business results are communicated through the financial statements, including the income statement, statement of ownerâs equity, balance sheet and statement of cash flow. These are all discussed in this course!\nThis course is for those students who have not had much (or any) experience in accounting and are looking to enhance their understanding of it, to either help pass a course or to enhance your business career. It is for anyone who may have felt lost in prior accounting courses and wants real life examples and a down to earth explanation, rather than something read word for word out of a textbook. Is this you? Then you are in the right place!\nThis course is taught by an instructor with over eleven years of training experience, including corporate training, face to face instruction, and online course development. In addition to the lectures and study material common to many other courses, this course also has a downloadable textbook/study note file, along with downloadable Excel templates paired with a lecture walking through the solution once you are done. To test your knowledge of the basic concepts we also have quizzes after each section to make sure you feel comfortable with the topic before moving on to the next one.\nAt the end of this course, you will have a better understanding of the mechanics of accounting, the concepts, and the goals of accounting in general. You will be able to pass that class!! Letâs get started!",

      "description": "Accounting often referred to as the âlanguage of business.â Whether you are going into management or actually going to be an accountant, you need to be familiar with the basics of accounting. This includes understanding the concepts of debits and credits, assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, dividends and equity. From an investorâs perspective, the business results are communicated through the financial statements, including the income statement, statement of ownerâs equity, balance sheet and statement of cash flow. These are all discussed in this course!\nThis course is for those students who have not had much (or any) experience in accounting and are looking to enhance their understanding of it, to either help pass a course or to enhance your business career. It is for anyone who may have felt lost in prior accounting courses and wants real life examples and a down to earth explanation, rather than something read word for word out of a textbook. Is this you? Then you are in the right place!\nThis course is taught by an instructor with over eleven years of training experience, including corporate training, face to face instruction, and online course development. In addition to the lectures and study material common to many other courses, this course also has a downloadable textbook/study note file, along with downloadable Excel templates paired with a lecture walking through the solution once you are done. To test your knowledge of the basic concepts we also have quizzes after each section to make sure you feel comfortable with the topic before moving on to the next one.\nAt the end of this course, you will have a better understanding of the mechanics of accounting, the concepts, and the goals of accounting in general. You will be able to pass that class!! Letâs get started!",

      "description": "This comprehensive course is designed to provide learners with a deep understanding of the time value of money and its application in capital budgeting decisions. Whether you are an aspiring finance professional, an entrepreneur, or an individual looking to make informed long-term financial choices, this course equips you with the essential tools and knowledge needed to excel.\nIn this course, we will delve into the core concepts and objectives of managerial accounting, shifting our mindset from financial accounting to managerial decision-making. By exploring the time value of money, we will cover key topics such as present value, future value, and their practical calculations using formulas, tables, and Excel functions.\nOne of the main focuses of this course is to emphasize the significance of time value of money in both business and personal decision-making processes. Capital budgeting decisions, which involve substantial dollar amounts and impact multiple periods, serve as ideal scenarios for understanding and applying the concepts related to the time value of money.\nWe will start by thoroughly explaining present value analysis, enabling you to calculate and apply the present value of a single amount and present value of an annuity using various methods, including formulas, tables, and Excel functions. Through numerous examples and practice exercises, you will gain hands-on experience in manipulating data and calculating present values effectively.\nThe course will also cover future value analysis, providing you with a solid understanding of calculating and interpreting the future value of a single amount and future value of an annuity. We will explore different approaches to these calculations, including formulas, tables, and Excel functions, empowering you to make informed decisions about future financial outcomes.\nAdditionally, we will examine the practical application of time value of money and other decision-making tools in capital budgeting. By running multiple scenarios and case studies, we will explore how capital budgeting decisions, which involve long-term implications and the consideration of the time value of money, can be analyzed and evaluated effectively.\nYou will learn how to calculate and interpret the payback period, a useful tool for assessing when the initial investment will be recovered. We will also discuss the accounting rate of return and its relevance in evaluating profitability within capital budgeting decisions.\nA significant part of this course will focus on net present value (NPV) analysis, the primary tool for considering the time value of money in capital budgeting decision-making. Through numerous examples and practical exercises, you will gain expertise in using NPV calculations to evaluate investment opportunities and make informed long-term decisions.\nFurthermore, we will explore the internal rate of return (IRR) and its relationship to NPV. By comparing and contrasting these metrics, you will develop a comprehensive understanding of their implications in assessing project profitability.\nLastly, we will analyze internal break-even time (BET) calculations, providing you with the ability to determine the time required to break even on a capital investment, while taking into account the time value of money.\nThroughout the course, you will engage in practical exercises, real-world case studies, and hands-on applications using spreadsheet software, enabling you to develop the skills and confidence needed to make sound financial decisions.\nJoin us on this exciting journey to master the art of long-term decision-making. Enroll today and unlock the key concepts and tools that will propel your financial decision-making abilities to new heights.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) course by Uplatz.\n\n\nIndian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) are the accounting standards followed by business entities in India. These standards are supervised by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) since the year 1977. ASB is a committee that comes under ICAI. It is represented by the government department, academicians, namely ICAI, CII, FICCI, ASSOCHAM, and other professional bodies.\nAccounting is a comprehensive process of recording transactions. It portrays financial data that help readers draw conclusions and make business decisions. Accounting procedures are incorporated with standardized guidelines for disciplined execution. These guidelines are usually known as accounting policies. Standardized accounting policies allow companies to make alterations according to their substantial needs. However, the freedom to alter makes it impossible to compare in any means. Thus, the government sets specific standards to create an ideal system in place, and this concept is known as the accounting standard. Accounting Standards are written policy documents issued by expert accounting body or by the government or other regulatory body covering the aspects of recognition, measurement, treatment, presentation, and disclosure of accounting transactions in financial statements.\nThe accounting standards in India are formulated by ICAI â Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Thus Indian Accounting Standards mean the standard of accounting recommended by the ICAI and prescribed by the Central Government in consultation with the National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards (NACAs) constituted under section 210(1) of Companies Act, 1956.\n\n\nUplatz provides this comprehensive course on Indian Accounting Standards.

In this course, you will learn how the 3 most important financial statements work (meaning the Income Statement, the Balance Sheet and the Cash Flow Statement). You will also learn about financial ratios and how accounting works in thew real world!\nA free book of the ENTIRE course and much more is included!\nThis course is taught by an award winning MBA professor with significant real world experience working at Goldman Sachs as well as in the venture capital, hedge fund and consulting industries (he has founded several companies and sits on several boards). Many business concepts are simply common sense. This course will focus on business concepts that you need to know that might not be common sense. This course makes the general business, accounting and finance process very easy to understand! The professor of this course is also the author of \"101 Crucial Lessons They Don't Teach You in Business School,\" which Forbes magazine recently called \"1 of 6 books that all entrepreneurs need to read right now.\"\n\nThe contents of this course are all based on my work experience at several firms, including Goldman Sachs, the consulting industry at Accenture, a few companies I have started, the hedge fund industry where I worked at Citadel and most recently based on my experience at a prominent San Francisco based venture capital firm. I included helpful practical accounting concepts I learned while I did an MBA at Columbia University and a Bachelor of Commerce degree at McGill University. Think of this course as a great introduction to accounting based on my undergraduate business degree, work experience in consulting, equities, hedge funds, venture capital and starting my own companies.\nI have minimized âboring complicated conceptsâ in this course in order to keep it as close to reality and as simple as possible. The concepts of this course have been taught by me in many classes at several universities, where the student feedback has been universally and incredibly positive (please see my LinkedIn profile for student reviews / feedback on my teaching style/effectiveness - thank you. Also please see reviews of my books in Amazon and here in Udemy on my teaching - particularly in my Udemy course on \"101 Crucial Lessons They Don't Teach You in Business School,\").",

Whether it is social media, sport teams, non-profits, or local mom and pop shops- all of these are individuals, like me and you, creating a business and delivering it to the masses. Regardless of your background, you are immersed in a world of business. A foundation in accounting can help you navigate the complexities and develop a new perspective on the world we live in. Accounting is the language of business and in its simplest form, accounting is a platform that allows businesses to record transactions.\nBusiness and accounting come hand in hand. You cannot have one without the other. This course seeks to teach you basic accounting principles through a business lense. By the end of this course, you will understand key accounting concepts that are universally applicable to all businesses. In turn, you will be able to apply these concepts to:\nStreamline your Small Business\nImprove Investing/Analytical Skills\nManage Personal Finances\nDevelop Bookkeeping Principles\nUnderstand Business Operations\nAbout the Course\nThis beginner course is a 15 chapter series of video lectures and textbook with an emphasis on financial accounting. It is imperative that you utilize both to get the most of the course.\nIt is designed to make accounting as simple and relevant as possible. Many other courses will have lessons on regulatory agencies or governmental accounting, however, this course purposely leaves those out. Frankly, unless you want to become a CPA, that information is too specialized and you simply will never use it. This course focuses only on concepts that can be applicable to your every day life.\nThe course starts with an overview of accounting and business concepts and then dives into technical theory. After going over technical concepts, it then takes a step back and shows how the technical theory relates to business operations. Lastly, it concludes with a chapter on utilizing technical theory to analyze companies.",

      "description": "If we are a business owner or accounting professional who would like to get a better understanding of what our accounting software is doing\nOr\nAn accounting student or student in general that would like to get a better understanding of what our accounting textbook is doing\nThis course is a course for us.\nBusiness owners, accounting professionals, and accounting students often have the same problem with accounting. . .\nthat we are focused on one small component of the accounting process and not able to make all the necessary connections to other components of the accounting process to fully benefit from an understanding of how the business runs.\nBusiness owners focus on cash flow and revenue, accounting professionals focus on their component of the accounting department and enter data into the accounting software, and accounting students focus on the topic they are currently working on.\n\nAccounting professional often focus on one component of the accounting cycle like accounts receivable, accounts payable, or payroll often not having much time to consider the relationship with other areas of the accounting cycle.\nAccounting software helps simplify the data entry process, but the simplification also restricts us from seeing how the data is being processed into the end product, into financial statements and reports.\nStudents are focused on one component of the accounting cycle at a time following an accounting textbook that is putting the pieces of the accounting puzzle together one step at a time.\nAs students zoom their focus into the current topic, they often lose sight of it fits into the larger objective and this loss of sight causes students to question the relevance of what they are losing. Studentâs questioning the relevance of what they are learning causes students to lose interest. A loss of student interest causes students grades to fall.\nPart of the reason accounting textbooks have a difficult time incorporating the current topic into the big picture is that a textbook is restricted by what can fit on a page and the problems a textbook provides are restricted by what a student can accomplish with paper and pencil.\n\nThe use of instructional video providing a step by step process along with Excel that allows students to sum up large columns of numbers in a short time provides the tools to create a comprehensive problem that will demonstrate current topics in the context of the entire accounting process.\nWhy Take This Course?\nWe will learn the accounting cycle in a comprehensive way and learn the fundamental of Excel.\nLearning the accounting process without Excel or Excel without accounting is a waste of time and not an efficient way to learn either topic.\nLike assets being equivalent to liabilities and equity, accounting is equivalent to Excel in many ways and therefore learning Excel will accelerate our learning of accounting and make what we learn more applicable.\nAccounting is also the perfect tool to learn Excel. This course will not provide a broad overview of everything Excel can do because that is not a way to learn. Courses attempting to demonstrate all the functions Excel fail to create value for learners because learners will not retain what they learn without a foundation of core concepts and a reason for learning each new function.\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of Excel, those components used 99% of the time, and the components needed as a foundation for learning more about Excel.\nThe core components of Excel we will learn include adding, subtracting, and summing up columns of numbers.\nWe will learn the core concept of Excel through demonstration, repetition, and application to practical problems.\nWhat Will Be Included in This Course?\nWe will complete a comprehensive problem using both instructional video and application.\nAlthough the course offers much more than just instructional video, it does include over 20 hours of instructional video.\nWe also include an Excel worksheet with just about every presentation allowing us to both see the completed answer and work through the problems step by step along with the video.\nEach Excel workbook includes at least two tabs. One tab will have the answer so that we can see how the completed worksheet is constructed and the second tab will provide us the opportunity to enter the data along with the instructional video.\nWho Will We Be Learning From?\nWe will be learning from somebody who has practical accounting experience as a practicing CPA, teaching experience, curriculum design experience.\nCredentials include:\nWe are learning from someone who has both instruction and curriculum development experience needed to construct comprehensive courses of a technical nature in a way that meets studentsâ needs and expectations.\nWhat Will We Learn?\nWe will learn how to complete the components of the accounting cycle and the fundamental of Excel including addition, subtraction, and the sum function.\nBelow is a short list of what is included in the accounting cycle and what we will cover in the course:\nJournalizing journal entries\nPosting to the general ledger\nCreate a trial balance\nAdjusting entries\nBank reconciliations\nFinancial statement generation\nClosing entries\nReversing entries\nHow Will We Be Taught?\nWe will learn through viewing and then doing.\nWe will demonstrate each component of the problem in small digestible parts using both a completed Excel worksheet and instructional video.\nWe will provide an Excel worksheet that can be filled in along with the instructional video or after watching the instructional video.\nPlease join us in learning Accounting, Excel, debits, and credits.\nIt will be Great\nCourse Content Includes:\nStart a New Business Section of Accounting & Excel Course\n05 Set up New Company Worksheet\n10 Set Up Inventory Items\n15 Set Up Customer Balances\n20 Set Up Vendors Beginning Balances\n25 Enter Opening Account Balances\nAccounting Concepts Section of Accounting & Excel Course\n135 Cash Method vs Accrual Method\n132 Balance Sheet & Income Statement Relationship\n155 Financial Transaction Rules\n160 Financial Transaction Thought Process\nEnter Data for First Month Section of Accounting & Excel Course\n05 Owner Deposit & Loan Deposit\n10 Purchase Furniture & Record Investment\n20 Part 1 Invoice Transaction\n20 Part Two Create on Invoice Transaction\n25 Receive Payment Part 1\n25 Receive Payment Part 2\n25 Receive Payment Part 3\n30 Cash Sales Transaction Part 1\n30 Cash Sales Part 2\n35 Deposit Part 1\n35 Deposit Part 2\n40 Part 1 Inventory Payment\n40 Part 2 Inventory Payment\n45 Invoice for Preordered Item Part 1.\n45 Invoice for Pre-ordered Item Part 2\n50 Receive Payment & Make Deposit\n55 Part 1 Write Check\n55 Part 2 Write Check Part 2\n60 Pay Bills\n65 Customer Jobs\n70 Payroll\n75 Job Sales Receipt\n80 Financial Statements & Reports\n90 Closing Process January\n92 Worksheet Month Two\nEnter Data for Second Month Section of Accounting & Excel Course\n05 Make Loan Payments\n10 Short Term Investment\n20 Receive Inventory With Bill\n20 Receive Inventory With Bill Part 2\n25 Sales Receipt & Deposit\n25 Part 2 Sales Receipt & Deposit\n30 Advanced Payment From Customer\n35 Apply Credit to Invoice\n40 Record Sales on Account\n45 Advance Customer Payment\n50 Bills Track & Pay\n55 Customer Payment on Account\n60 Pay Sales Tax\n65 Pay Payroll Tax\n70 Enter Bills & Pay Bills\n75 Service Item & Invoices\n77 Purchase Equipment with Debt\n80 Payroll\n90 Rental Income\n95 Financial Statements\nBank Reconciliations Section of Accounting & Excel Course\n10 Bank Reconciliation January\n12 Bank Reconciliation Adjusting Entries January\n15 Bank Reconciliation February\n20 Bank Reconciliation Feb.

      "description": "Challenges are multifarious. Overwhelming nos. of transactions, loss of conventional (paper) audit trail, system based controls, ever increasing and complex compliance requirements are amongst the prime reasons why traditional methods of collecting and evaluating evidence (like vouching and verification) are no longer adequate. The auditor can no longer treat Information Systems as a âBlack Boxâ and audit around it. His methods and techniques have to change. This change is what the world calls today, âAssurance Analyticsâ i.e. data analysis from an âaudit perspectiveâ.\n\n\nUsing advance features of MS Excel, the auditor can access clientâs data from their databases and analyse it to discharge the onerous duty cast on him. Since over 15 years, CA Nikunj Shah has been perfecting these techniques of âassurance analyticsâ. These include digital analysis techniques like Benfordâs Law, Relative Size Factor Theory (RSF) and Paretoâs 80-20 rule that have enabled auditors and forensic investigators to identify control failures and over rides, detect non-compliance with laws, zero down on questionable transactions and identify red flags lost in millions of transactions. It is like quickly finding the needle in a hay stack!! In this unique course, your favourite instructor shall share the best of his research, auditing and training experience. The participants shall learn, step-by-step, the nuts-and-bolts details of using advance features of MicrosoftÂ® Excel coupled with the instructorâs insights to apply them in real-world audit situations. Each section shall equip participants with assurance analytic techniques using real-world examples and learn-by-doing exercises.",

Perhaps you own a small business or are an entrepreneur starting a businessâ¦ or you need a better job and are thinking about going to business schoolâ¦ or you provide legal and consulting services to businesses. Youâll be more credible, make better decisions, and enjoy more success if you speak the language of business.\nThe Importance of Financial Statements in Todayâs World\nThe language of business is encapsulated in financial statements. Financial statements provide a scorecard for how a business is doing. Over a series of years, it provides a map of the businessâs performance. Managers judge the success of their business with financial statements. Investors make intelligent investing decisions with financial statements. In addition, people in the business world are being held more accountable for their financial statement practices since Enron and WorldCom. They need to know what goes into financial statements.\nLearn to Read Financial Statements, Not Prepare Them.\nJust as you donât need to understand how to make a car in order to drive one, you donât have to understand bookkeeping to read financial statements. I've prepared a course that eliminates the bookkeeping drudgery and concentrates on the end product of accounting, how to read financial statements, not how to prepare them.\nLike climbing a spiral staircase, I will teach you how to read three real companyâs financial statements (Whole Foods, Sherwin Williams, and Facebook), starting with the simple and progressing to the complex, interspersing the statements with key accounting terms and concepts to help you build expertise.\nSounds good? Here is exactly what we will cover:\nRead Financial Statements. What is a balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows and how each is different\nQuick Look: Read Financial Statements of Whole Foods. What are the major line items on Whole Foodsâ balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows\nWhere the numbers come from: Accrual Accounting Basics. What are some basic accounting concepts, why we canât measure profits with cash, and why we need a separate statement for income and cash flow\nDeep Dive: Read Financial Statements of Sherwin Williams. What each line item means on Sherwin Williamsâ balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows\nTest What you have learned: Facebook Case Study. A 28-question quiz about Facebookâs balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows with feedback\nWhat the Financial Statements Tell You Through Ratios. How to interpret a companyâs performance with four ratios: return on equity, profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. How to compute these ratios for Sherwin Williams and dig into their annual report for insight. How to compare financial statements among four different industries (distribution, manufacturing, service, and financial service)\nThe course contains 20 three-to-eight-minute-videos each followed by a multiple-choice quiz. A case is provided for Facebook.\nThe course will take 100 minutes to view the videos and another 45 minutes to take the quizzes and do the Facebook case.\nAre you ready? Let's do this.",

      "description": "Group reporting consists of topics such as consolidation process and analytical reports and supports the computation, creation, and disclosure of consolidated reports that provide information on the performance of a corporate group.\n\n\nSAP Group Reporting Data Collection\nSAP Group Reporting Data Collection helps you gather financial data for your business units. The app is hosted on the SAP Business Technology Platform and relies on data such as master data and allowed breakdowns from group reporting within SAP S/4HANA.\nWith SAP Group Reporting Data Collection, you can map data, create forms, design your own reports, and use these or the predefined reports to collect data as part of your data preparation for consolidation.\n\n\nSAP Analytics Cloud\n(SAC) provides deep insights into your business using reporting and data visualization, which will help you make better decisions.\nWith live data connections, the integration between SAP S/4HANA Finance for group reporting and SAC enables business analysis at group or corporate level without data replication.\nIn this release, the following detail and overview reports are available out of the box:\nConsolidated report book for actual data\nPeriodic overview report book\nActual and budget comparison report book\nActual, budget, and forecast comparison report book\nPredictive consolidated P&L analysis\nGroup financial KPIs overview\nConsolidation\n\n\nA complete consolidation process typically starts with preparatory steps, such as setting global parameters, checking the master data of your organizational units and financial statement (FS) items, and specifying effective exchange rates.\nAfter that, you can proceed with collecting data reported by consolidation units, and standardizing the data with features available in the Data Monitor. When the data is ready for consolidation, go to the Consolidation Monitor to perform the consolidation tasks, such as various interunit eliminations and data validation. For a list of the tasks and their descriptions, see Data Monitor and Consolidation Monitor.\nThroughout the process, you can cross check your processed data using reconciliation reports and currency translation analysis reports, or generate various group reports in real time.\n\n\nIn your SAP Fiori front-end server, you can copy a delivered business role to create your own role, adapt its contained business catalogs, and assign the created role to relevant users.\nIn addition, you need to set the necessary permissions by authorization object in the back-end systems, for example, restrict the filed values a role can access by using the transaction code PFCG. After that, you can assign the adapted roles to your business users using user administrator tool, such as transaction SU01. For more information, see User and Role Administration of ABAP Platform.\nYou have created consolidation units and set the Data Transfer Method to Read from Universal Journal or Flexible Upload, depending on whether they are integrated with company codes in financial accounting (FI). This can be done in the Consolidation Units - Create and Change app.\nYou have maintained the FS items for your consolidation charts of accounts and map them to the relevant general ledger accounts. For more information, see Financial Statement Items.\nTo use SAP S/4HANA Finance for group reporting, SAP recommends that you install the SAP Best Practices configuration content for the solution. You will gain a configuration starting point, which you can adapt to your needs in Customizing. Examples in this documentation are based on the SAP Best Practices content.",

And too often Accountants, CFOs and Financial Controllers lose the contest of ideas to colleagues who are not smarter, just more persuasive.\nThe intelligence problem\nFinancial executivesâ quick mental processes and advanced numerical skills are essential for their job.

Youâll master creating first impressions, improving your voice, looking like a leader and interactive conversational techniques.\nâAnalyticalâ describes a career skill, not your ideal personality.

This section is meant for people who have little working knowledge of accounts. This Section will help bring you up to speed with Basic Accounting Vocabulary. After all, if you were to learn any Language you would start with the ABC's right?\nIn the Second Section - We go through what is called the Accounting Cycle (which in plain English simply means the process Accountants follow). If you've ever wondered what Accountants really do- you'll get a sneak peek in this section. Plus, I give you a cool little trick to understand journal entries- the building blocks of accounting functionality. If Debits and Credits have ever confused you in school- you'll never be confused again. Many people also get confused by the term Bookkeeping and don't fully understand the functioning of Bookkeepers in the Business process and we also go over that together in this section. Once you know more about the Accounting Cycle you'll uncover the mystery behind the numbers of your Business.\nSection Three takes us away from the world of the theoretical into the world of the practical as we take the knowledge we have learned from Sections 1 & 2 and put it into practice by taking a deep dive and learning a Free Accounting Software called Wave.\nIn Section Four- we will look at and understand the 3 Main Financial Statements - The Balance Sheet, The Income Statement and the Cash Flow Statement. If you have not understood Financial Statements in the past and why they are so important - You've been missing out!Â  Understanding Financial Statements is a MUST for anybody who wants to make a dent in the world of Business. If you own a Business or ever plan to own one - Understanding how to read Financial Statements can take you from being a good business owner to a great one. They can take you from an Average investor to a Savvy one.\nSection Five teaches you Ratio Analysis. Ratio Analysis allows you to thoroughly analyze a company's performance using the companies Financial Statements. Learning how to calculate Financial Ratios can help give you quick and insightful information about companies.\nLast, but not least we have all the commonly asked questions as part of an ongoing library assembled and put together in Section Six.\n\n\nThis course is made in an easy to follow, topic by topic format with plenty of quizzes to test your learning along the way. You will also be seeing a bit of my zany humor in bits and pieces so please find it in your heart to forgive me. After all, most accounting courses have put me to sleep and if that's the kind of course your looking for then this course is not for you. This Course is also NOT designed to save your Marriage or get you a date with Katy Perry (Or Brad Pitt if you prefer). See, I warned you about my zany humor, didn't I?\n\n\nApart from any of the humor - more importantly - This Course WILL give you a Good rundown into the world of Accounts - something which I believe will help you and your business in many ways throughout your lifetime.\n\n\nWith Best Regards,\nUday Gehani",

      "description": "Accounting often referred to as the âlanguage of business.â Whether you are going into management or actually going to be an accountant, you need to be familiar with the basics of accounting. This includes understanding the concepts of debits and credits, assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, dividends and equity. From an investorâs perspective, the business results are communicated through the financial statements, including the income statement, statement of ownerâs equity, balance sheet and statement of cash flow. These are all discussed in this course!\nThis course is for those students who have not had much (or any) experience in accounting and are looking to enhance their understanding of it, to either help pass a course or to enhance your business career. It is for anyone who may have felt lost in prior accounting courses and wants real life examples and a down to earth explanation, rather than something read word for word out of a textbook. Is this you? Then you are in the right place!\nThis course is taught by an instructor with over 20 years of training experience, including corporate training, face to face instruction, and online course development.

This course is intended for small business owners that do not have a background in accounting. This is a step-by-step guide that starts from scratch by choosing a QBO plan and covers connecting bank feeds to import transactions, categorizing transactions, and running reports that can be used to review the performance of your business, make informed decisions, and aid in filing tax returns.\nThis course dives in to using QuickBooks Online just as you will do for your business. I will walk you through connecting the bank feeds for the business checking & credit cards and actually recording transactions. In this course, I go over dozens of common transactions where I explain what they are for and show you how to categorize the transactions, including creating bank rules to automate recording transactions.\nThis course offers an optional section where I provide info on the basics of accounting to give you a foundation you can build upon that helps explain how we will be recording transactions in this course and the results you will end up with.\nThis course provides general information that is intended to be widely applicable to small business owners. Not all of this information will be applicable to your unique situation. This course is not a replacement for an accountant or an attorney. I highly recommend you consult with an experienced accountant and attorney before forming your business and throughout the life of your business.",

Then we will enter the transactions into QuickBooks, the software automating some of the steps required.\nWe will learn how to turn multicurrency on, and which accounts will be affected most by multicurrency transactions including cash account types, accounts receivable account types, and accounts payable account types.\nLearners will work example problems related to the sales cycles and the purchases cycle, the sales cycle including foreign currency receivables, the purchases cycle including foreign currency payables.\nWe will also demonstrate transactions related to forward contracts, both for speculative purposes and to mitigate risk on foreign currency transactions.\nThe multiple currency feature is useful when the company is holding onto cash in a foreign currency, the software helping us to record the home currency equivalent for financial statement presentation.\nMultiple currency functionality is also helpful when we make sales on account, sending an invoice, hoping to get paid in the future, tracking accounting receivable, but expecting to be paid in a foreign currency. The accounts receivable account will need to be valued in the home currency even though we will be paid in a foreign one.\nWe have a similar situation when we make purchases on account, promising to pay in a foreign currency at some point in the future. The accounts payable account will need to be valued in the home currency equivalence even though we will be paying in a foreign currency.",

The course focuses on the concepts of Right of Use Assets, Lease liability - the lease and the service contract.\nIFRS 16 is a relatively new standard which has replaced the old standard IAS 17 - Leases\nOne of the main reasons of introducing IFRS 16 was to avoid \"Off Balance Sheet Financing\" which IAS 17 was unable to block. After the introduction of IFRS 16 businesses are now obliged to bring back all the assets on to their statement of financial position which previously were shown as operating leases and thus did not appear as assets or liabilities on the SOFP\nIt is a complete guide kit for those who want to learn the treatment of Revenue under IFRS 16. The course includes complete lecture video on standard as well as several questions, solutions and case studies.\nABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR\nI am a qualified accounting and finance professional with over twenty years of professional experience. I have been teaching accounting and finance courses for over fifteen years and have taught more than twenty thousand delegates including students, young accountants, chief accountant and finance managers.",

It will teach you about the accounting process (based on the accounting equation) that is necessary to transform the transactional data into useful information that tells the story of a business.\nYou will learn about the three main steps in the accounting process, which is just like any typical process:\nINPUTS, such as journals and special journals;\nPROCESSING, such as posting to ledger accounts, and different types of accounts and special ledgers; and\nOUTPUTS, such as the trial balance and how and when to adjust it.\nMost importantly, you will learn all about how the financial information in the Trial Balance is packaged into the REPORTSÂ that form the Financial Statements based on rules that are much like language rules, namely:\nIncome Statement;\nStatements if Changes in Equity;\nBalance Sheet; and\nCash Flow Statements.\nThis will enable you to complete the full accounting process by:\nidentifying accounting source documents containing transactions;\nrecording these transactions in various journals;\nposting the journals to various ledgers accounts;\nassemble a trial balance;\nmake adjusting entries to finalise the trial balance;\nassemble the financial statement reports: i.e an income statement, statement if changes in equity, balance sheet from the trial balance.\nYou will test your newly acquired skills by completing an integrated exercise covering the entire accounting process, as described above.\nThis will prepare you to advance to the next levels of Accounting Acumen.\nCome explore with me and learn a new skill!",

      "description": "Welcome to the Norm Nemrow AC 5 - Accounting Course 5 of 5\n\n\nThis is where the rubber hits the road. In the 4 main courses you learned the nuts and bolts of accounting and here in this 5th course we teach you how those fundamental principles apply to the REAL WORLD. In the 4 courses we learn knowledge, but here we learn wisdom with real-life examples. As you can see below, we present 8 new lessons that will help you see how an accounting education relates to the world around you. This is an eye-opening experience.\n\nFor example, In Course #1, Lesson 10, you learned how to analyze the Financial Statements. Then in Course #5, Lesson #5 below, we help you see how to take your knowledge of the financial statements and use that understanding to invest in the stock market. Although, not intended to be a full investment course, these lessons show you how to APPLY what you have learned.\n\nIn some respects, these 8 Lessons are the most powerful presentations we offer. These lessons are taught by world experts in their respective fields of study, and you will see how accounting applies to world around you like never before. While its impossible to cover all the applications that an accounting education can influence, we cover many of them here which will give you an excellent foundation as you continue with your education.\n\nThese lectures are so powerful for our on-campus students that every semester we DOUBLE the amount of students who are interested in majoring in our world-renowned accounting program. No other university program on the planet has that level of recruitment and we tie that interest to these specific lessons in course #5. Why is that? Because when students see HOW accounting principles can be applied to the real world, their minds open up and they see the VALUE and WISDOM of an accounting education.\n\nThis is what makes our course so powerful, the ability to focus on the core ideas and then learn how we can take those principles and create real change in our lives and companies. Awesome things happen when we take theory and apply it!\n\nCourses Offered (All FIVE courses build on each other in order - Although Course 5 can be generally viewed after Course 1 & 2. We do make specific recommendations in the \"Watch After\" section):\n\nCourse 1: Introduction to Financial Accounting\nCourse 2: Introduction to Managerial Accounting\nCourse 3: Advanced Financial Accounting\nCourse 4: Advanced Managerial Accounting\nCourse 5: Accounting CapstoneÂ  (THISÂ COURSE)\n\n\nCourse 5 Lesson Descriptions and Minimum Pre-Requisite Lessons\n(While it's not absolutely crucial you watch the noted pre-requisite lessons, you are likely to comprehend these lessons better once you have studied the pre-requisite material.)\n\nLesson 1: The Importance of Financial Accounting in the U.S. and Global Economies\nDescription: In this lesson we discuss the most powerful number in the world - EARNINGSÂ PERÂ SHARE (EPS). No other number moves the world like this one. Understanding EPS and how to calculate it can dramatically change your life as you venture into the stock market. We also discuss some ideas relative to buying a business, the lessons from the .COM boom and bust, and why capitalism is so beneficial in today's global economy.\nWatch After: Course 1: Lesson 1\n\n\nLesson 2: The Impact of Information Technology on Accounting and Business\nDescription: In this Lesson we discuss information technology and how we use computers to make decisions in our businesses, which is a crucial aspect of management accounting. We also discuss database technology and Moore's law as well as many other applications within Information Technology.\nWatch After: Course 2:Â  Lesson 1\n\n\nLesson 3:\nBusiness Fraud, Ethics, and the Accounting Profession\nDescription: In this lesson, we learn about fraud, which may not sound super interesting at first glance, but what we have to shareÂ  could save your business. Fraud is unfortunately a huge part of our world and is more around you than you might think. It's important to learn the the biggest risk factors of fraud, the different kinds of fraud and most importantly, how to prevent it.\nWatch After: Course 1: Lesson 7\n\n\n\nLesson 4: Introduction to Tax Planning and Career Options in Taxation\nDescription: Dreaded TAXES! They are never fun to pay, but it is fun to learn how to pay the least legal amount. Here we help you see how to plan effectively for taxes, tax loopholes, and even careers in tax. You'll either be manhandled by taxes or learn how manage them with wisdom... we opt for the latter.\nWatch After: Course 1: Lesson 7 & Course 3: Lesson 6\n\n\nLesson 5:\nDescription: Accounting, Finance, and Stock Marketing Investing\nThis is often the most exciting lesson for students! You learned a lot of theory and principles inÂ Course #1 relative to financial statements and stocks, but here we teach you how to take what you have learned and venture into the stock market itself. We love the reaction of our students when they \"get it\" and see how everything they have learned relates to the real-world of Wall Street.\nWatch After: Course 1: Lesson 10 & Course 3: Lesson 11\n\n\nLesson 6:\nMoney, Family, and Career Choices\nDescription: This is Norm at his BEST! In this lesson Norm presents his wisdom from decades of experience as an educator and successful businessman. Norm found his passion in life and gives you the secrets on how to find yours. This may be the most powerful set of concepts we present in all our courses. Norm also discusses the truth and secrets behind \"Financial Independence\" and what it means to be a steward and owner and meaning of money. You won't find this kind of wisdom anywhere else... we strongly recommend you take notes.\nWatch After: Course 1: Lesson 1-5 & Financial Practice Set (This lesson is so good, please don't delay too long :) )\n\n\nLesson 7:\nManagerial Accounting: Current Trends in Practice and Career Opportunities\nDescription: This is a must for anyone thinking of pursing management accounting as a career. Here we discuss the managerial trends by analyzing Toyota and Dupont and other examples. We also discuss JIT (Just in Time) production, which is a powerful concept. We also focus on future trends in the industry.\nWatch After: Course 2: Lesson 1 & Course 4: Lesson 1\n\n\nLesson 8:\nKey Elements in Successful Personal Financial Planning\nDescription: In this Lesson Norm gives his advice in how to run your financial life within a family and how to plan for the future. Learn how soft drinks can cost you over a $100,000? ... don't believe him... watch the lesson. Although Budgets aren't super fun to think about, Norm makes a compelling case how it can change your life and give you more freedom to pursue your life mission. Listen to Norm when he says, \"Live modestly\" and it will change your life for the better.\nWatch After: Course 1: Lesson 1-5 & Financial Practice Set",

And to do that, you need to know accounting!\nThere are many questions like:\nIs the company profitable?\nDoes the company have any assets?\nIs the company actually making any money at all?\nAnd even if a company is profitable, is the money coming into the companyâs bank account?\nObviously you would like to know these answer but when you try to read the companyâs financial statements, you get lost!\nWhere to start?\nWhat does each number mean?\nHow long is this going to take me!\nIn this course, I will teach practical accounting knowledge for investors. Starting with the profit and loss statements, we will move onto the balance sheet, and eventually to cash flow.\nAlong the way, I will discuss accounting concepts like:\nWhy do we want to depreciate expenses over many years?\nNet profit comparison with cash flow.\nHow does profit and assets interlink?\nWhat do you truly own as a shareholder?\nHow exactly to interpret the cash flow statement?\nUnlike other courses out there where you just see a wall of boring text presentations, this course will include animated diagrams, charts and diagrams to simplify concepts and guarantee your understanding.\nI promise I will not be teaching generic unactionable ideas like you must buy low and sell high. Also, this is also not a motivation class where I preach to you that you must work hard to succeed, or you must have discipline to profit from the market.\nIn this course, I will teach you exact accounting concepts and frame works.\nIn addition, Udemy and I promise a 30 day money back guarantee so you have absolutely no risk.

It recognizes the impact of external factors on strategic management issues and covers the risks these factors present and how they can be measured and managed. From appreciating the strategic context of performance management and the impact of wider factors, the syllabus examines the issues relating to performance management information systems and their design. It also addresses the impact which developments in technology will have on the performance management and measurement systems used by organizations.\nThe syllabus then moves from performance management systems to the scope and application of high-level performance measurement techniques in a variety of contexts, including not-for-profit organizations and multi-national businesses.

You start getting all of this confusing terminology thrown at you and then youâre expected to analyze transactions without knowing what the terminology means.Â  As a college lecturer of accounting, I've witnessed firsthand that this approach is often a recipe for failure.Â I'm also a CPA and a CFEÂ with over fifteen years of accounting industry experience where IÂ have prepared some of the most complex financial statements in the world, structured some of the most complex accounting transactions, and performed some of the most complex accounting work that there is.\nIn this course, we will take a different approach as we start from the ground up and learn the basics before we dive into the more complex topics like analyzing transactions and preparing financial statements.Â  Like IÂ do in the collegiate accounting classes that IÂ teach, I will explain the concepts in plain and easy to understand language and we'll approach learning accounting like putting together the pieces of a puzzle (while IÂ give you important tips and clues that can help you identify what you need to know).\nIn this class, I have included numerous handouts, quizzes, projects and assignments to help you learn accounting so that at the completion of this class, you will be able to identify and examine assets, liabilities, and equities, and you will know what debits and credits are and how they impact the different types of accounts.Â  You will also be able to prepare journal entries, record those entries into the various accounts, prepare a trial balance, prepare adjusting entries, prepare an adjusted trial balance, and then prepare and analyze financial statements.Â  Over the past seven years, I have helped hundreds of students learn financial accounting and go on to achieve greater success, and IÂ can help you do exactly that too.",

      "description": "In this course we will build an accounting system starting with a blank Excel worksheet, creating a general journal, a general ledger, a trial balance, subledgers, and financial statements.\nFor each new step in the process, you will have access to a downloadable Excel Workbook, containing at least two tabs, one with the answer, the new steps having been completed, the other starting out where the prior presentation left off.\nOnce we have created our accounting system worksheet, we will use it to record common transactions, entering the journal entries into the general journal, posting to the general ledger, creating the trial balance, adjusting the subsidiary ledgers, and constructing the financial statements.\nAs we enter each transaction, we will consider the data input often used in accounting software like QuickBooks. Accounting software will use data input forms like bills, invoices, credit memos, checks, sales receipts, and more, to simplify the data input process, allowing users with little accounting experience to learn data input.\nAccountants are generally more valuable when they understand both the accounting theory, the impact on financial statements of each transaction, as well as how an accounting database program like QuickBooks works, including the data input forms used to enter normal financial transactions.\nBecause spreadsheets are so transparent, they are the perfect tool to gain and understanding of both, accounting theory and accounting software.\nConversely, building an accounting system in Excel is a great way, one of the best ways, to improve your Excel skills.",

I was sought out because of my expertise with the companyâs accounting software package â Sage 300. It soon became apparent that as I worked with company staff and the audit team that other auditors and interested persons could benefit from the knowledge shared.\nThis course is prepared with the general and specific audit objectives for the general ledger, accounts payable and receivables in view and could also aide in the discovery of fraud.\nThis knowledge put extra cash in my pocket as I worked after hours assisting the auditors and accounting staff of a company.\nAfter completing this, course auditors will have greater confidence when auditing a client who uses Sage 300 and also know what to expect from a first-rate accounting software package. Workers in the office will be able to provide the auditors with the information they need, thus completing the audit faster thus getting the auditors out of their offices.\nLets dive right in and have a great time while doing so.

It is to provide full knowledge on how to estimate the cost of goods or services, by accurately capturing all expenses of relevant inputs.\nIt also covers how inventories are ordered, procured, received, stored and then transferred to units or departments in need of them for their activities. The course treats the accounting for labour, i.e. how to determine and calculate remuneration and motivation packages. It will also discuss labour ratios to analyse their output in relation to a target.\nIndirect expenditures related to products manufactured will also be lectured on. Here we discuss the allocation of all expenses incurred and how they will be allocated over departments responsible for its build-up and then allocated over a unit of product manufactured in those departments. When there are multiple products produced, it will teach how the absorption should be implemented.\nWe also move to discuss how all the costs of inventory, labour and overheads come together against the price to lead to profit.\nWe will be considering two concepts in calculating this, both of which have different impacts on the cost of the product and profit.",

The second type is a problem solving shared screen that will help you with the calculations and analysis, as well as your thinking process.\nDepending on your commitment, this course can take you somewhere from a week to few weeks to complete. The curriculum is designed as such, so that you will retain the information you will receive.\nWhether you are a business owner, manager, or a student, you will need this course.

Then reports are generated and adjusted, and forms and transactions are adjusted, printed, and sent.\n\n\nI use the same handy files throughout the course so you can put them all into practice to ensure you have a thorough understanding and hands-on application of creating and editing lists and transactions.\nThis course is a project-based course that uses the free trial version of QuickBooks Enterprise and practices the class tracking functions for balance sheet and income statement, a class tracking function applied to liability accounting.\n\n\nWe'll learn how to download a free trial of QuickBooks Enterprise and prepare a new company file for use.\n\n\nThis course will show you how to enable the class tracking feature and explain the differences between class tracking for the QuickBooks Pro software version and the QuickBooks Enterprise version.\n\n\nWe'll track expenses by department using the class tracking feature and learn how to allocate indirect costs.\n\n\nThis course then shows you how to allocate service center costs to revenue.\n\n\nWe'll also look at balance sheet adjustments as we prepare balance reports by class.",

Whether you are an aspiring manager, entrepreneur, or individual seeking to make informed financial choices, this course will equip you with the tools needed to enhance your decision-making capabilities.\nThroughout the course, we will explore various scenarios and real-world examples to illustrate the application of relevant cost methods in a range of managerial accounting contexts. By understanding how to identify and analyze relevant costs, you will be able to make strategic decisions that have a positive impact on your organization's financial health and long-term success.\nIn the first section of the course, we delve into the significance of relevant costs and their role in decision-making processes. You will gain a deep understanding of how to differentiate between relevant costs and irrelevant costs. By avoiding common decision-making pitfalls, such as the sunk cost effect and overlooking opportunity costs, you will be able to make more accurate and informed choices.\nNext, we explore the evaluation of equipment investment decisions. We will examine the factors involved in deciding whether to purchase new equipment or retain older equipment. By understanding the sunk fallacy effect, you will learn to make decisions based on future benefits rather than past investments. Through cost-benefit analysis techniques, you will gain the skills necessary to evaluate equipment investments effectively.\nThe course also addresses the managerial accounting implications of accepting special offers. We will investigate scenarios where businesses may seemingly incur losses by accepting special offers but can ultimately benefit from them. By applying relevant cost analysis, you will gain insights into how to make strategic decisions when evaluating special offers, taking into account factors such as long-term customer relationships and potential future profits.\nMake or buy decisions play a crucial role in managerial accounting. In this course, we will delve into the factors involved in deciding whether to produce a component internally or outsource it to an external vendor. Through relevant cost evaluation, you will develop the skills to assess factors such as cost savings, quality control, and supply chain efficiency to make optimal make or buy decisions.\nFurthermore, we will analyze the decision to process a product further or sell it at its current stage of production. You will learn to evaluate relevant costs and determine whether processing a product further will result in a higher selling price and increased profitability. Additionally, we will explore decision-making related to defective inventory, weighing the costs of scrapping inventory versus reworking it for potential salvage.\nThe course also addresses the question of sales mix optimization. You will gain insights into deciding which products to produce and in what quantities to maximize profitability. By applying relevant cost methods, you will develop strategies to allocate resources effectively and achieve the most advantageous sales mix.\nFinally, we will discuss the decision of eliminating a segment or department of a company. Through the application of relevant costs, you will learn how to assess the financial viability of a department and make informed decisions regarding its continuation or elimination.\nThroughout the course, you will also discover how to use cost data to set sales prices using cost methods and variable cost methods, ensuring that your pricing strategy aligns with profitability goals.\nJoin us on this exciting journey to become a strategic decision-maker equipped with the power of relevant cost methods. Enroll today and unlock the key strategies that will drive success in your managerial decision-making endeavors.",

As accounting is shifting rapidly into the digital, including tax submissions directly to your tax office, QuickBooks Online is one of the leading software with over 5 million users worldwide, offering a reliable accounting package for all requirements.\n\n\nQuickBooks Online has a similar structure across all countries, in my view, once you learn the basics, it is easy to navigate through any other version. I publish weekly videos on my YouTube channel @LearnbookeepingUK and give some helpful tips.\n\n\nWhy study online?\nStudying online at your own pace, whenever you are based, helps you to achieve your goals without extra stress or pressure. No matter if your goal is to find a new job as a bookkeeper, or start your own small (or big) bookkeeping business.\nThe course covers all essentials, based on my years of experience with QuickBooks online software, and in my view, this is an ideal starting point for any bookkeeper at the beginning or advanced level to refresh the latest updates.\n\n\nAbout the course:\nCourse based on the QuickBooks onlineÂ  UK demo company. I explain how to register for a trial version and how to download the Case study with exercises (Section 1 Case study). Registering for the trial version helps to learn by doing exercises along the videos on your own as well.\nIf you would like to become a successful freelance bookkeeper I recommend to go through each module and then refer when needed. ( You have indefinite access to this course!).\nIf you are a sole trader or a business owner and decided to do your bookkeeping: go through the main chapters on how to set up your business, how to raise sale and credit notes, how to input the purchase invoice or purchase credit, how to connect bank, how to run main reports. For everything else, you can always refer back if needed.\n\n\nChapters covered:\nHow to register for a test-free version of QuickBooks software;\nThe navigation panel features a simple way of finding essential and advanced settings;\nOrganization settings, including changes in business, financial settings for year-end, and locking period;\nChart of accounts and learning about the nominal codes, how to import or edit the codes, and add balances on QuickBooks;\nThe contact list and how to add clients or suppliers, featuring the project tab;\nInventory and how to manage stock on QuickBooks; raise a purchase order for inventory;\nThe sales process in detail ranges from raising a quote to raising sales invoices, sending statements, chasing debts, and featuring repetitive invoices. Explaining the difference between delayed charge and credit;\nFixed assets and learning about types of depreciation, how to add fixed assets on QuickBooks, and run a depreciation journal;\nPurchases process in detail: from raising a purchase order, converting PO to invoices on QuickBooks, or simply entering the invoice directly from the supplier, features cheque and bank payments;\nHow to upload receipts by using an app or quick link on QuickBooks and process receipts step-by-step guide;\nThorough explanation of banking: from how to add various bank accounts (PayPal, everyday, credit cards, etc), how to set up online payments for clients to pay for the invoice, how to manually import statements to a full bank reconciliation process guide with bank rules, short cuts and learning about what to do when errors occur;\nFinally - reporting, featuring bank reconciliation reporting, age payable, profit and loss, and balance sheet;\nVAT/GST/Sales tax video and resources to help with returns on QuickBooks Online and a general understanding of indirect taxation;\nProjects on QuickBooks from start to finish, allocating the sales and re-charging the expenses, understanding the margin and financial summary.\nReviews:\n\"Very easy to follow\" by Lara\n\"Easy to understand.\" by Carmie\n\"I like this course, all the concepts were explained in detail.\" Minakshi\n\"Nice step by step; clear\" by Stacey\n\"Yes, the experience is good.

However, we are also verifying all the transactions that have involved cash, both increases, and decreases.\nBecause cash is the lifeblood of the business and because every transaction will impact at least two accounts, due to the double entry accounting system, verifying cash transactions also provides a huge internal control over the rest of the accounting system, including the revenue cycle, the expenses cycle, and the employee cycle.\nMost textbook problems will teach the bank reconciliation process without providing a bank statement, which can be confusing. We will give an example bank statement we will use to perform our bank reconciliation process.\nAs we construct our bank reconciliation, we will discuss how accounting software, like QuickBooks, lays out the bank reconciliation process.\nWe will also discuss some of the problems often faced when entering the first bank reconciliation.",

The master budget is typically presented in either a monthly or quarterly format, and usually covers a company's entire fiscal year. An explanatory text may be included with the master budget, which explains the company's strategic direction, how the master budget will assist in accomplishing specific goals, and the management actions needed to achieve the budget. There may also be a discussion of the headcount changes that are required to achieve the budget.\nA master budget is the central planning tool that a management team uses to direct the activities of a corporation, as well as to judge the performance of its various responsibility centers. It is customary for the senior management team to review a number of iterations of the master budget and incorporate modifications until it arrives at a budget that allocates funds to achieve the desired results. Hopefully, a company uses participative budgeting to arrive at this final budget, but it may also be imposed on the organization by senior management, with little input from other employees.\nSome past student comments:\n\"Great Class, systematic, and very organized Thanks , it's a great reviewing for my managerial accounting 15 years ago.\" TungÂ KU\n\"Awesome :) n very beneficial Thank u DrÂ :)\"Rabia Taher\n\"Very Good course with the explanations, Illustrations and quizzes.

We post and analyze the impact of each financial transaction on the general journal, the general ledger, subsidiary ledgers, trial balance, and financial statements.\nNew businesses often need to generate capital, cash, they can then use to invest in property plant and equipment, inventory, and start up costs. The first few transactions we will enter will be related to the owner putting personal funding into the business and the business taking out a loan from a financial institution.\nWe will then consider financial transactions related to the purchase of inventory and the purchase of short-term investments like stocks and bonds.\nLearners will know how to enter transactions related to selling inventory items, tracking inventory using a perpetual inventory method, adjusting the inventory subledger with each sale and purchase of inventory.\nThe course will discuss the financial transactions related to receiving payments from a customer, decreasing the accounts receivable, and tracking the accounts receivable subledger, recording accounts receivable by customer.\nWe will also discuss the use of undeposited funds as a tool to group our deposits in the same way we expect them to show on the bank statement, making the bank reconciliation process, a very important internal control, easy.\nThe course will demonstrate entering transactions related to writing checks for expenses like utilities and the telephone, and prepaid expenses like insurance.\nLearners will also enter transactions related to payroll, requiring us to withhold employee payroll taxes, and enter employer payroll taxes.\nAfter entering a monthsâ worth of data input will create and adjust our financial statements, the balance sheet and the income statement.",

They help us recognize revenue and expenses based on accrual concepts and timing differences.\nIn this course, we will learn to enter adjusting entries as of the end of the accounting period.

Once the adjusting entries are complete, we will use the adjusted trial balance to generate financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity.\nTo enhance your learning experience, this course provides valuable resources, including downloadable PDF files, Excel practice files, multiple-choice practice questions, short calculation practice questions, and discussion questions. These resources will supplement your understanding and allow for practical application.\nYour instructor for this course is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) with extensive technical accounting experience. He has a Master's degree in Taxation and is a certified post-secondary instructor (CPS) with expertise in curriculum development. You will benefit from his practical insights and instructional expertise.\nTopics covered in this course include the adjusting process, posting adjusting entries to a worksheet, financial statement creation, and reversing entries. We will explore the components of the worksheet and understand how adjusting entries impact accrual accounting.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to effectively navigate the accounting cycle, identify the different categories of adjusting entries, create financial statements from an adjusted trial balance, and understand the relationship between the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity.\nJoin us on this learning journey as we delve into Financial Accounting, Adjusting Entries & Financial Statements.

You will learn how to calculate predetermined overhead rates and utilize them to estimate overhead allocated to different departments accurately.\nRecording journal entries related to costs within the process cost system is a critical aspect, and we guide you through each step. You will gain hands-on experience in entering journal entries for the transfer of raw materials, direct and indirect wages, overhead costs, allocation of overhead to work-in-process, department transfers, finished goods, sales transactions, and cost of goods sold.\nWe delve into the calculation of the cost per equivalent unit and the assignment of costs to ending work-in-process and transferred-out amounts. We explore both the First In First Out (FIFO) and Weighted Average methods, ensuring you have a comprehensive understanding of cost allocation techniques.\nThroughout the course, we provide clarity on key terms and definitions related to job cost systems, enhancing your practical knowledge and application of cost accounting concepts.\nIn addition to the instructional videos, the course includes a range of valuable resources, including downloadable PDF files for offline reference, preformatted Excel practice files to facilitate hands-on learning and reinforce Excel skills, multiple-choice practice questions to improve test-taking abilities, short calculation practice questions for concise problem-solving, and discussion questions for engaging in meaningful conversations with fellow students.\nYour instructor, a seasoned professional with expertise in accounting concepts and software, is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA), and a curriculum development expert.

      "description": "This course is on Accountancy, the language of business. It covers the basics and some aspects of intermediate level. It is neither too short nor to long, tuned for the youngsters keeping their attention span in mind.Â  There are more than 2.5 hours of lecture videos in 32 lectures, of which two are bonus lectures. More lectures could be added in future. This is for the beginners and all curious minds, who want to have some working knowledge of accountancy. Accountancy is not as difficult as mathematics, it is easier than arithmetic, as it has only two aspects, plus and minus, debit and credit. If one understands the basics of accountancy, the rest is a cake walk.Â  Â I have divided this course into four parts. They are not necessarily equal in size. First, I shall discuss very briefly how accounting evolved historically. Then in the second module, I shall deal with some of the basic concepts of accounting. In the third module, we shall be practicing accounting with the help of accounting equations without passing any entry in the books of accounts. This will be done using plus and minus signs. The words \"Debit\" or \"Credit\" will not be uttered even. This will help us to understand the all-pervading basic accounting equation, which is \" Capital + Liabilities =Â  Assets\". This will also remove fear from the mind, about accountancy, as a subject, which some students have.Â  The last module will be devoted to core of accounting, starting from creation of Journal to generation of Income Statement and Balance Sheet of an imaginary business. Even some elements of income tax calculation based on book profit will be discussed. Thereafter, we shall analyze the Income Statement and Balance Sheet to understand the financial situation of our imaginary business, and thus we shall end up using accounting ratios. High quality presentations are used to explain all the concepts. Resources are provided in the form of downloadable pdf, JPG and Excel files. Assignments and MCQsÂ  as appropriate, are given.Â  The course has been designed with lot of care. Lectures must be followedÂ  sequentially, to derive the highest benefit. I am always available through the Udemy system to answer queries that a student may have. Let us say \"Happy accounting!\"",

      "description": "Mastering the Basics: A Fundamental Course in Managerial Accounting and Cost Accounting 101\nIntroduction: In the dynamic landscape of business, understanding and managing financial information is crucial for effective decision-making. One key aspect of this is managerial accounting, which provides valuable insights into an organization's internal operations and helps in optimizing performance. In this 101 course, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of Managerial Accounting and its integral component, Cost Accounting 101.\nManagerial Accounting: Managerial accounting, also known as management accounting, is the process of identifying, measuring, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating financial information to aid internal decision-making within an organization. Unlike financial accounting, which is focused on external reporting to stakeholders, managerial accounting is primarily concerned with providing information for internal use by managers.\nKey Concepts in Managerial Accounting:\n1. Cost Behavior: Understanding how costs behave is fundamental in managerial accounting. Costs can be classified as fixed, variable, or mixed. Fixed costs remain constant regardless of production levels, while variable costs fluctuate with production. Mixed costs have elements of both fixed and variable costs.\n2. Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis: CVP analysis helps managers understand the relationship between costs, sales volume, and profit. It is a vital tool for decision-making, pricing strategies, and assessing the impact of various business scenarios on profitability.\n3. Budgeting: Budgets are essential in planning and controlling an organization's activities. Managers use budgets to set goals, allocate resources, and monitor performance. Variance analysis, comparing actual results to budgeted figures, helps identify areas that need attention.\n4. Decision-Making Techniques: Managerial accountants employ various decision-making techniques, such as incremental analysis and relevant costing, to aid in choosing the most profitable and feasible options among alternatives.\nCost Accounting 101: Cost accounting is a subset of managerial accounting that specifically focuses on tracking, recording, and analyzing costs associated with the production of goods and services. It provides detailed information about costs to help management make informed decisions.\nKey Concepts in Cost Accounting:\n1. Job Order Costing: This method assigns costs to specific products or jobs. It is suitable for industries that produce customized, unique products or services, such as construction and printing.\n2. Process Costing: Process costing is used in industries with continuous production processes, such as chemical manufacturing or food processing. Costs are averaged over the total units produced during a specific period.\n3. Activity-Based Costing (ABC): ABC assigns costs based on the activities that drive them, providing a more accurate picture of the resources consumed by different processes or products.\n4. Standard Costing: Standard costing involves setting predetermined costs for direct materials, direct labor, and overhead. Deviations from these standards are analyzed to identify areas for improvement.\nA solid grasp of managerial accounting and cost accounting is indispensable for anyone navigating the complex world of business. The fundamental principles discussed in this course provide a strong foundation for making informed decisions, optimizing resources, and ultimately contributing to the overall success of an organization. As you embark on this journey of understanding managerial and cost accounting, remember that these tools are not just about numbers; they are about empowering managers to lead their organizations with insight and foresight.\nI am going to teach 9 major topics !\n1. Understand the Basics of Managerial Accounting:\n2. Cost Concepts and Terminology:\n3. Job Order Costing:\n4. Process Costing:\n5. Activity-Based Costing (ABC):\n6. Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis:\n7. Budgeting and Variance Analysis:\n8. Performance Measurement and Balanced Scorecard:\n9. Capital Budgeting and Decision Making:\nEnroll now and learn today !",
