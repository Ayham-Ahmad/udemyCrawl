      "description": "This is an entry-level course on ChatGPT prompts, which requires no threshold or basic knowledge.\n\n\nIf you are a professional in the workplace and just want to use ChatGPT as a tool to improve work efficiency, make decisions, or provide convenience and advice in your daily life, you don't need to spend several hours or even dozens of hours learning how to use it. Because you are just a user, not a researcher.\n\n\nSo, this course is tailor-made for you. There will be no unnecessary words, no difficult theories, only efficient summaries and examples. It will teach you questioning techniques and methods in just one hour. Starting from scratch, I will guide you step by step on how to transform a simple sentence into a qualified prompt. With just one hour of your time, you will gain multiple times the ability to use ChatGPT.\n\n\nThis course consists of four parts:\n● The first part\nA simple explanation of the principles behind ChatGPT and prompts. Why do we need to understand the principles? Because understanding the simple principles will help you comprehend the following content. Once you become proficient in using it, you can create even better prompts based on these principles. Don't worry, it won't be a complex technical explanation. Just spend a few minutes to understand it.\n\n\n● The second part:\nI will introduce some common techniques for writing prompts, including using separators, checking specific vocabulary, and specifying output requirements. Mastering these techniques will be the beginning of differentiating yourself from ordinary ChatGPT users.\n\n\n● The third part:\nI will introduce some effective methods for writing prompts. In this chapter, you will learn six questioning methods, including Role-playing method, Audience-Targeted Method, Scenario-Based Method, and Question decomposition method. At this point, ChatGPT will no longer be your \"toy,\" but a satisfying \"weapon\" that can help you with almost anything.\n\n\n● Lastly\nI will share some of my thoughts on how to design a complete prompt from an idea, combining the techniques and methods you have learned. We will use an example of TikTok operations: making ChatGPT create a \"strategy to gain 100,000 followers from 0.\" In this case, you will witness the process of transforming a simple prompt into a complete one. Once you master this prompt design process, you can apply it to other cases and solve almost any problem. Join us in learning together, I am really looking forward to it. Thank you!",

Now it is time that you do the same.\n\nBut a word of warning. This is not your run-of-the-mill basic course, where you will be spoon-fed at every turn on how to use each and every feature of Scrivener. There are some excellent beginner courses out there and indeed Scrivener’s own tutorials may suffice to get you up and running and familiar with the basics of the software.\nLearn how to use the industry-leading book writing software correctly\n\nInstead, this course is an over-the-shoulder look at how Scrivener has become an integral part of MY OWN writing process. Within the course, I will show you how you can use Scrivener:\nIn the RESEARCHING of your book\nIn the OUTLINING of your book\nIn the WRITING of your book\nIn the REWRITING and EDITING of your book\nIn the PROMOTING of your book (through the setting up of your book’s Front and Back Matter)\nIn the COMPILING of your book into different eBook formats\n\nDon't make the same mistake I made\nI am happy to say that I was an early adopter of Scrivener. Unfortunately, despite making a financial investment in buying the software, I did not then follow this up with making a time investment to learn how to use it properly.\nFor far too long I merely used Scrivener like a fancy word processor, which was such a waste. Please don't make the same mistake I made. Enrol in this course today.\nBy the end of the course, you will become a more productive writer by unlocking the power of the incredible writing software that is Scrivener.",

      "description": "In this training series you will learn how to configure Salesforce to fulfill business needs, in preparation for well paying employment. This third course in the series will give you the skills you need to customize the Salesforce platform to work with any company's business process. Though the Salesforce system does a lot for companies \"out of the box,\" it is customization that allows the tool to work effectively for any given company.\nAspiratech is a registered Salesforce consulting and ISV partner, and as such we design and implement the system for companies large and small, including non-profits. We are leading experts in the field, which you can see by simply Googling \"Salesforce Training.\"\nAs part of every Salesforce implementation, we train both users and at least one internal System Administrator (Sys Admin).\nThis training series has effectively trained hundreds of new Sys Admins to take on real world duties upon which their companies depend, and has helped many attain certification by providing a strong foundation upon which they could build.\nUsing step by step instruction, clearly demonstrated and explained, including the “gotchas\" that send the unsuspecting in circles, this course will teach you how to customize Salesforce to meet the job requirements of a System Administrator.\nPractical hands-on exercises are included to make sure you know how to apply what you see to real world examples.\nThis course provides the training you need for the only type of true job security there is, the security of genuinely being the best at what you do.\nYou should plan on working on this series an hour a day for 3-4 weeks to effectively cover all the material. Going through the series a second time, simply watching the videos on the second pass, is also advised. Frequent exposure is key during the training period.\nThis training series will help prepare you for the System Administrator certification track, unlike other Salesforce courses that purport to be \"complete,\" but which in fact focus on the Developer track and leave out a large portion of what is needed for a Sys Admin. Developer is a track that will not lead to either Sys Admin positions or highly paid consulting positions, and is only appropriate for those who intend to go on to become apex coders. This course is intended for people who never want to have to configure an API or deal with writing code syntax.\nThat said, there is no substitute for getting the most recent Salesforce supplied study guide (webpage linked to within the course) to actually study for the exam itself, just as when you were in school you had to supplement in class learning with extra study for end of semester exams.\nHere is an email we received from a student about using this training to get her Sys Admin certification:\n\"I wanted to let you know that I successfully passed my admin 201 certification. I am looking forward to write my 401 exam as well... I know that certification will help me in securing a job. I highly recommended your course to my friends. Only because of your course and watching it several times and practice it several times, I was able to grasp knowledge. Thank you very much. Best, Padma\"\nStarting salaries for employed consultants in the industry are typically $40-60/hr, depending on your region, and independent consultants who sign their own clients often make several times those amounts. If you have had an interest in expanding your career options by adding a practical technology proficiency to your skill set, Salesforce System Administration is where many non-technical people find their opportunity. For those who have no interest in embarking upon a technology specialist career path, the SFDC Sys Admin skill set is also greatly in demand and in short supply in many non-technical positions and will make you an indispensable part of any work team.\nNote: It is expected that you will have access to an instance of SFDC you can experiment and practice in within this course. Salesforce provides a free Developer org at:\nDeveloper dot salesforce dot com/signup\n(Udemy no longer allows us to make this a live link, so unfortunately you're going to have to do some manual work to get to the right page on the Salesforce site to get this from them... is also posted within the second lecture in this course)\n-- Note that you should use a personal email address as your username when signing up for a developer edition account, so that your work email address will remain available for your company instance username.\nIf your company does not have Salesforce yet, but is considering implementing it, get a free 30-day Trial org on the Salesforce website. You will then have the added benefit that work you do toward genuine goals during this course can be preserved for use by your company (unlike work saved in a developer org), possibly encouraging your employer to allow you to work on the course during your regular work day or even purchase the training series for you.",

The use of backup files is not a requirement of the course, however.\nIf you have an older version of the software and cannot use backup files, you can still work the practice problems from start to finish. We will be creating new files for each practice problem so learners can follow along from start to finish without the need for a backup file.\nThe course will start out reviewing a job costing system, gaining an understanding of the objectives of a job costing system. Then we will discuss the tools provided by QuickBooks to achieve our objectives in the QuickBooks software.\nWe will start by reviewing the end products of the four job costing system practice problems we will be creating in later in the course. This review process will allow us to visualize where we are headed in the course.

We will start out using a limited number of accounts and items and walk through each step in detail.\nThe second QuickBooks problem will run a job cost system in QuickBooks, focusing on the Cost of Goods Sold account. We will use a small number of accounts and items. We will discuss adjusting entries that can be used to adjust the financial statements to the appropriate accounting method required.\nThe third QuickBooks problem will run a job cost system in QuickBooks with the use of more accounts and items, resulting in a system that provides more detailed reports.\nThe fourth QuickBooks problem will run a job cost system in QuickBooks with the use of the classes feature. We will discuss the pros and cons of using this option.",

      "description": "Are you a Virtual Assistant interested in becoming an Operational Consultant so you charge higher rates on a project basis?\nIf you’re a VA with six to nine months of experience there is no reason why you shouldn’t be charging higher rates by positioning yourself as an Operations Consultant using Standard Operating Procedures. If you learn all about SOPs, an essential building block towards transitioning into an Operations Consultant, you can then develop SOPs for your own Virtual Assistant business, and transition into working as an Operations Consultant for online businesses, this is even if you have one major client and you’ve never had any experience building a business.\nAs a business owner, SOPs can be THE solution to onboard your new hires and ensure that turn productive in record time, and you can hire a VA to put this is in place for you.\nHere’s why SOPs are worth the investment:\nBoost efficiency: SOPs streamline daily tasks, so everything runs smoother.\nImprove quality: They make it easier to spot where things can improve.\nTrain your team: SOPs make onboarding a breeze for new hires.\nEnsure long-term stability: A solid set of procedures keeps the business on track as it grows.\nSOPs are the unsexy, but essential backbone behind the winning online businesses/passive income empires that you see on the internet?\nAre these business owners whipping out those award-winning ideas, marketing angles and processes out of thin air, day after day? Or do they have clealry defined processes, the meat and potatoes behind the business, that they fall back on time and again that allows them the foundation from which they churn out products and services and back them up with strong fulfilment and customer service teams?\nWhether you are a Virtual Assistant starting a VA consulting business, or an online coach/course owner/agency owner, or even a brick and mortar business owner – SOPs can be the backbone of your business.\nWhat is included in the course\nLearn how to create simple and complex SOPs\nWatch real examples of SOPs in action\nGet 6 bonus templates for everything from handling customer complaints to onboarding clients\nSome businesses spend time and energy and staff hours developing SOPs, but don’t manage the use and uptake of SOPs. This is sometimes because the new staff intended to be the users of the SOPs may not understand the underlying concepts to effectively apply the SOPs. This is why this course includes an SOP management system.\nHere’s a secret: If you’re a trained VA, do you know the quickest surefire way to land a paid VA gig? Offer to work for free for a week and offer to develop two detailed SOPs for the business owner. Business owners are wary of having to handhold and train a VA themselves – so if you can do this for them, you have a surefire way of getting your feet in the door.\nFor Virtual Assistants:\n1. Developing complex Standard Operating Procedures can be an entire Project in itself. We show you how you can manage such a complex exercise on Airtable. As a Virtual Assistant, you can even charge premium for managing an SOP development Project.\n2. Once you have a portfolio of SOPs, what’s next: cold emails, value propositions, and personalized outreach and objection handling.\nNew : You’ll also learn how to manage SOPs on Airtable, a free tool that's perfect for hosting, tracking, and updating your SOPs all in one place.\nFAQs\nWhat is one way for VAs to develop a standout profile of SOPs that can get them hired instantly: if you want to eliminate guesswork, the unnecessary gimmicks for outreach etc, you need a standout profile with portfolio assets. This is all about positioning…\nIt is about how you demonstrate a deep compelling understanding of the challenges of the business, and your ability to learn and demonstrate new skills in context.\nPeople only care if you can add value to their bottomline. Your previous work experience is immaterial entirely. That is the beauty of the online business world. How do you do this?\nSo, how do you get enough insight into a business to develop SOPs for it? Here is how: You start your own business with NO capital down. You can develop SOPs for your own VA business – be it a course business on Udemy, a template business on Etsy, or a service business on Fiverr.\nIs this course exclusively for VAs? As can be seen from the reviews, some business owners believe that this course is more helpful for Virtual Assistants. That being said, online business owners and even brick-and-mortar businesses can still stand to gain from this course, but it does have a VA focus.\nPrice Guarantee:\nDid you know all Udemy courses come with a 30-day return guarantee? So if you are dissatisfied with a course you can claim a full, no-questions-asked refund.\n\n\nReady to master SOPs and become an even more valuable asset to your clients? Let’s get started!",

Enroll now in this ChatGPT Crash Course and embark on a journey to transform your understanding of AI, enhance your skills, and stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving world of technology. Don't miss your chance to become a ChatGPT expert and leverage its power for unlimited potential!\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot that can generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions and prompts. It is a language model that uses deep learning to generate text that is similar to human writing. You can use ChatGPT for various purposes such as automated customer service, virtual assistants, and more.\nWhat are the benefits or advantages of using ChatGPT?\nThe advantages of using ChatGPT are that it can save time and money by automating tasks that would otherwise require human intervention. It can also provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, which can improve customer satisfaction. Additionally, ChatGPT can be used to generate content such as articles, summaries, and more.\nHow is ChatGPT different from Google?\nChatGPT and Google serve different purposes and function in distinct ways, even though they both utilize artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Here are some key differences between the two:\n\n\n1. Purpose:\n- ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI, designed to generate human-like text, answer questions, and engage in conversations. It is primarily focused on understanding and generating text-based content.\n- Google is a search engine that indexes and retrieves information from the internet. It helps users find websites, images, videos, and other content relevant to their search queries.\n\n\n2. Functionality:\n- ChatGPT processes and generates text based on the input it receives, attempting to provide relevant and coherent responses. It can be used for tasks such as content creation, programming assistance, customer support, and more.\n- Google, on the other hand, uses complex algorithms to analyze and rank webpages based on their relevance to a user's search query. It does not generate content but rather directs users to existing sources of information.\n\n\n3. User Interaction:\n- With ChatGPT, users engage in a more interactive, conversation-like experience. The AI model attempts to provide context-sensitive and coherent responses to user inputs.\n- Google provides a list of search results based on the user's query, and users must click on individual links to access the information they seek.\n\n\n4. Data Source:\n- ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of text from various sources, and its knowledge is limited to the information available in its training data.\n- Google constantly crawls and indexes new information on the internet, making its search results more up-to-date and expansive compared to ChatGPT's knowledge base.\n\n\nIn summary, ChatGPT is an AI language model designed for text generation and conversation, while Google is a search engine that helps users find information on the internet. They serve different purposes and offer unique functionalities, with ChatGPT focusing on content generation and Google on information retrieval.\n\n\n__________\nPledge to All Students (both current & future students)\n\n\nStudents First.

You won't be using the old hunt and pecking method, instead, you will be able to type using all ten fingers and no longer have to constantly look down at the keyboard when typing.\nIf you're serious about wanting to improve your typing speed, you've come to the right place.\nWith the 30-day money-back guarantee.

This course teaches you about different free tools available to increase your productivity, manage products and effectively communicate with your team.\nWhat is covered in this course?\nMastering remote work is all about finding the right tools to stay productive and connected. This course will have you and your team synchronized and working in harmony, wherever you happen to be.\nLet me give you a brief overview of the course\nSection 1 - Google Drive\nGoogle Drive is a cloud storage platform to keep all your files in one secure and centralized location. The remote workers can store and share documents, spreadsheets, and slide presentations. It can be used for reporting on weekly metrics. Additionally, Google Drive files can be synced across devices, so the individuals can view and update them from anywhere.\n\n\nSection 2 - Google Docs\nGoogle Docs is a word processor included as part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by Google within its Google Drive service.\n\n\nSection 3 - Google Slides\nGoogle Slides is a presentation program included as part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by Google within its Google Drive service.\n\n\nSection 4 - Google Sheets\nGoogle Sheets is a spreadsheet program included as part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by Google within its Google Drive service. It is a modern version of MS Excel.\n\n\nSection 5 - Trello\nTrello is about as simple as it gets when it comes to project management, but that simplicity belies incredible organizational and task management power. Trello is built around the notion of bulletin boards. Each board can represent a project, for example. Within each board, teams create lists, which they then populate with cards. The cards can be assigned to specific team members, labeled, stamped with a deadline, and crammed with comments or attachments. The hierarchical nature of the system makes it flexible while still preserving a baseline simplicity.\n\n\nSection 6 - Zoom\nIf you have big team meetings that include lots of remote workers, Zoom is a video chat application that supports dozens of participants. Large meetings with up to 500 participants are supported as an add-on feature.\nHow will this course help you?\nIf you are a working professional who wants to learn about tools that help you work remotely with efficiency and high productivity, this course will introduce you to the most popular free online tools which will enable you to collaborate and work effectively even at your home.\nA Verifiable Certificate of Completion is presented to all students who undertake this \"Tools for Working from Home\" course.\nOur Promise\nTeaching our students is our job and we are committed to it. If you have any questions about the course content or anything related to any topic, you can always post a question in the course or send us a direct message.\n\n\nI am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge and skills to immediately see practical benefits while working remotely.\nGo ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1\nCheers\nStart-Tech Academy",

      "description": "Touch typing is the ability to use muscle memory to find keys fast, without using the sense of sight, and with all the available fingers, just like piano players do. It significantly improves typing speed and eliminates errors. Touch typing simply makes you more productive and it is a skill worth learning. However, many people engage in the bad habit of ‘hunt-and-peck’ typing, even those seasoned professionals with years and decades of computer experience. It is easy to understand, though, as touch typing requires dedicated practice to learn it well.\nThis course consists of 60 lessons with several exercises in each one.\nTotal duration of video lessons - 7 hours. 95% of this time you'll be typing.\nYou'll learn:\n- Type letters from A to Z\n- Type punctuation marks\n- Shift and Caps lock\n- Type numbers\n\n\nGet ready to work hard and at the end your fingers fly across the keyboard!",

Suddenly, your \"Right-click → New Folder\" fingers are screaming for mercy.\nYou block out hours (or even days) to do these kinds of tasks, fuel up with Red Bull, and pray you don’t lose your mind in the soul-crushing monotony.\nAnd worst of all…\nYou want to work smarter, but you're not a techie.

You just want to get through your day with less frustration.\n\n\nIf that’s you, then this course is right up your alley!\n\n\nIn this course, we’re not just learning how to code like a developer.\nWe’re learning how to think like a problem solver.\nUsing simple tools, basic logic, and a few lines of code, you'll learn how to:\nAutomate file and folder creation\nExtract data from Excel, Word, and PDF files\nTraverse your computer programmatically\nWrite small, powerful scripts that save you hours of manual work\nApply clean, universal coding principles to your workflow\nYou’ll be amazed at how far you can go with basic English and math skills—and just a pinch of curiosity.\nBy the end of this course:\nYou’ll have a ready-to-use development setup on your own PC or laptop.\nIn just under 8 hours of content, you’ll go from \"total beginner\" to \"I just saved my entire team 6 hours of mindless labor.”\nYou’ll build confidence using tools that real developers use, but without the overwhelming tech-speak or steep learning curve.\nFor your final project:\nyou’ll build a script that takes 48 Excel workbooks (each with 20+ sheets), extracts over 7 million rows of data, and condenses it all into a single, clean workbook—in under 5 minutes.\nYes, you read that right.\nFrom nightmare to \"done and dusted\" while you sip your coffee.\nLet’s get started—and reclaim your time, your sanity, and maybe even your weekends.

We cover many of the most useful settings like how to change your FPS to 60, how to set hotkeys, and using chroma key in order to filter out the background. You will find what you need to set up a webcam talking head for doing livestreams, recording games, or creating a presentation.

You can look for my other course on that just by searching DaVinci Resolve :)",

They do everything with the keyboard. They use shortcuts and some tricks to type less and generate more in less time. And that is what this course is all about. Other text editors mostly focus on code development while Emacs gives you the ability to be efficient over all tasks you do in the computer (except maybe for music & Video editing).\n\n\nIn this course I share with you lots of shortcuts and tricks in Emacs that help you create and modify text files for code, create presentations ,publish journals & even make your own books.\nIf you like Vim shortcuts, Spacemacs will give you the option of using them. While Vim is the only other option, doing similar things to Emacs, the main reason to use Emacs over Vim is ORG Mode. Because Vims implementation of ORG is imperfect.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to setup emacs for any task\nUsing editing shortcuts\nMake Emacs better (easier) with Spacemacs\nDo every work; code,presentations etc using ORG mode\n\n\nFull Money-back Guarantee\n\nThis course comes with a 30-day full money-back guarantee. No questions asked. If you don't learn anything from this course, ask for a refund within 30 days. All your money back.",

We will provide practice bank statements to use with the project as well as step by step instructional videos.\nAs we enter data directly into the check register from the bank statement, we will compare and contrast the cash basis system we are using to a full accounting cycle system. We will also review the financial statements periodically to see how QuickBooks is using the data to make reports.\nAfter entering data into the QuickBooks check register from the bank statement, we will perform bank reconciliations. As we perform bank reconciliations, we will discuss what a bank reconciliation is and the benefits a bank reconciliation provides.\nThe course will then discuss options for entering specific accounting data into QuickBooks including payroll, equipment, loan payments, insurance, credit card payments, and invoices. We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs.\nAs we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered.\nThis course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation.\nWe will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks.\nFinally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so.\nIn addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\n•    Excel practice files\n•    Downloadable PDF Files\nExcel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.\nWho will we be learning from?",

      "description": "I believe that everyone has the ability to type 90+ WPM, if they are trained using the correct method of Typing. When I first started, it took me around 1 month of periodical training to reach 60 W.P.M. Back then I had no knowledge of \"Key Rollovers\" but just to understand the correct finger placement and apply it, it took that long. I expect to gradually receive positive feedback on this course after people have had time to apply the training knowledge that I teach them. This course is just a couple of weeks old right now, and not many people have had time to properly test the methods that I am teaching.\nMost Typing Instructors Neglect \"Key Rollovers\" and don't even mention them to their students. You are probably thinking at this point, Am I qualified to teach you? I have first learned the Standard method of Touch Typing from Lessons that I purchased for $30, then I transformed my Standard Touch Typing Skills with my onscreen keyboard that I developed using, the \"Key Rollover\" Method to help me soar above the 60 W.P.M. (Words per Minute) expectations that I was originally told was for successful Typing Students.\nMy Onscreen Keyboard comes with a wordlist broken down in motions, which encourages Key Rollover Training for around 1,000 Common English Words, 0/9 Numerical Keys, and Syllable Training, which contain Common Syllables that are found in over 5,000 common English words. Why do we need to know Syllables in Typing? If you are familiar with the Syllable inside of a Word that is not in your Vocabulary then you can type the Syllables that make up the word instead, this will speed up your typing speed dramatically vs. writing each individual Keystroke as you see them, because it increases the speed at which you can process the word. The Real Question that you're wondering is, How Fast am I in comparison to your current WPM Speed? There's one way to find out.\nGo test yourself at 10fastfingers, take a Typing test, can you defeat my score of 118/123 W.P.M.? Only 1 out of every 100+ Typists will be able to surpass my speed.\nDo you want to be within the top 1% of Typists in the world also? Being able to Type at a speed of 120 W.P.M. for an entire minute is something only 1% of all Typists can do. In order to do this, you must train the correct way. What is the secrets to typing fast? A few that can be named is Accuracy, using Multiple Fingers, and Key Rollovers = pressing multiple keys down together just milliseconds apart but at the same time. Reading Ahead of what you're typing. I will share my techniques, and secrets which will help you to improve your speed drastically.\nDo you have a busy schedule? You will also get my Onscreen Keyboard App for Windows Xp, 7, vista, 8, and 10 both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions and multiple Keyboard Skins. That I have developed to help people increase their speed at their own pace.\nThis Onscreen Keyboard is compatible with nearly every windows program, browsers, that can be run in windowed mode along side of it. You can practice good Touch Typing form while writing your e-mails, web browsing, playing games, or writing stories. It will monitor your Keystroke Speed, and it Displays the WPM result back to you in real-time every 5 seconds so you can keep an eye on your raw \"5 Second Speed Burst\" as you press them. In addition, my Keyboard also has start/reset/stop/replay short-cut keys which can also tell you your T.W.P.M. (Total Words Per Minute Average) for any amount of Seconds that you've been typing. (Seconds or minutes.) Using a Math Formula the Program will do the calculations, and determine an estimation of your Raw Average WPM (Raw means the WPM will also include any Typos you make during the Second Duration.) When you start/stop the Internal Secs (Seconds) Counter. Replaying keystrokes to the Keyboard is optional, if you ever want to cancel the replay, it's as simple as pressing \"Ctrl+DownArrow\" during the replay.\nAt the same time that you are typing words, you will see the appropriate fingertip light up when a key is pressed. I also have \"Color Coded\" Skins which helps you to always know which fingers should press the keystroke you are wanting to press, even before you press the keystroke.\nNote: Since the Keyboard App monitors your Keystrokes in order to replay them back to you in real-time, Certain Virus Scanners might see it as a false positive and mistake the file for a dangerous file. So you may have to allow it through your virus scanner in order to use it.\nIf you do not want to install the Keyboard App, you do not have to, you can always re-watch the video in slow motion, and type the words as I do. The Keyboard App has been created to help make everything easier for you while developing your typing skills and letting you type at your own pace.",

      "description": "Welcome to the comprehensive course on the Job Cost System and Managerial Accounting. Designed to enable learners to grapple with the complexities of cost accounting in a simplified and structured manner, this course is perfect for anyone seeking to augment their understanding of managerial accounting processes, particularly those revolving around job cost systems.\nStarting with an introduction to managerial accounting topics, we delve into the nuanced realm of job cost systems and process cost systems. Recognizing that these two systems form the backbone of manufacturing cost accounting, we undertake a thorough comparative analysis to help you understand when and why a company would employ either of these systems.\nWe place significant emphasis on the classification of costs, dissecting its importance, and demonstrating various methodologies to classify costs effectively. This understanding is fundamental, as it forms the basis of cost flow in the accounting process within manufacturing companies.\nDigging deeper into the job cost system, we traverse the intricate pathways of inventory cost flows. You'll gain insights into the movement of costs associated with raw materials, through work in process and factory overhead, before they culminate in finished goods and are eventually expensed as cost of goods sold.\nIn addition to theoretical aspects, we explore practical elements of a job cost system by discussing key documents integral to recording cost flows. We tackle overhead costs, a vital yet often misunderstood aspect of job cost systems. By clarifying the concept of actual overhead and estimated overhead applied to jobs, you'll learn to calculate the predetermined overhead rate, a crucial tool for estimating overhead allocations.\nA significant portion of the course is dedicated to the practical application of knowledge acquired. We walk you through the recording of journal entries pertaining to costs at various stages of the job cost system. From transferring raw materials to work in process and factory overhead, to managing direct and indirect wages, to closing out finished jobs and recording the sale and costs of finished jobs - you'll be given hands-on exposure to real-world accounting scenarios.\nWith an emphasis on student interaction, this course also introduces discussion questions aimed at facilitating productive conversations between peers. These discussions offer the opportunity to approach the subject matter from multiple perspectives, enriching your overall learning experience.\nOur course comes bundled with valuable resources to reinforce your understanding. We provide downloadable PDF Files for offline reference and preformatted Excel Practice Files to bolster your Excel proficiency. We also include multiple choice and short calculation practice questions to enhance your grasp of the material.\nUnder the guidance of an experienced instructor, a certified CPA and CGMA, Master of Science in Taxation, Certified Post-Secondary Instructor, and a seasoned Curriculum Development Expert, you are guaranteed a high-quality learning experience. With a wealth of experience in teaching, technical accounting, and software like QuickBooks Pro, your instructor provides an enriching learning environment that combines theory, practicality, and professional wisdom.",

You don’t have to buy anything.\nThis course provides a hands-on introduction to create a high-quality document, to build up the beautiful presentation, and to write professional publications in LaTeX. I have designed this course from a starting level and then gone through all the necessary features step-by-step. I have given a lot of examples so that student can understand everything clearly, and added assignments for home practice. I have also added three giant projects for getting practical experience of complete LaTeX documents. My student will do all these three projects together with me as a special part of the course. In this way, you will also get three ready-made LaTeX templates for dissertation, publication, and presentation.  I will also show how to prepare bulletin, poster, desk-calendar, resume etc. , and will provide templates for all of these documents.

This practical course will teach you how to create professional productivity tools designed to track and monitor the progress of a project. Not only that, you will create something visually impressive and you will be the go-to in the team for making the project's spreadsheets and monitoring tools.\nRecent statistics from a research organisation suggest that only 22% of project managers use project management software. That means that most project managers are likely to use spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel.\nOne of the main reasons that project managers do not use project management software is the lack of support from an organisation. Learning how to use spreadsheets to create effective management tools means that you will not have this problem. There will be no need to use expensive software that nobody knows how to use!\nProjects require ongoing monitoring and tracking. You will already understand this but have you got the skills to work with spreadsheets and create something effective? By the end of this course, the answer will be ‘yes’.\nOne of the essential tools you, and your project team, are going to need is the project tracker. The project tracker is a critical tool to monitor and manage various aspects of a project. You will use this tool to monitor progress, tasks, schedules, and resources. There are various software solutions out there but being able to create a tracker enables you to build something specific to your project.\nA project tracker is an invaluable tool that will help you and your team stay organised. The tracker is also an effective communication tool. You can communicate to your team how progress is going and highlight any issues with tasks.\nYou will learn how to plan the layout, add formatting, and include conditional formatting to your project tracker. This will provide you with an excellent visual presentation of your tasks, schedules, resources, and progress. Your team will easily be able to view the progress of the project and have no difficulties in understanding the information.\nThe course also provides additional tools that will complement the project tracker. The first tool is the plan. You will need to create a project plan before building the tracker. This will enable you to plan the tasks, deliverables, milestones, and outcomes of the project. From the plan, the project tracker can be developed.\nAnother essential tool is the project budget. You will learn how to create one. The project budget should be used to complement the project tracker. The project tracker focuses on the general management of schedules and resources. The budget focuses on cost analysis and budget control, the financial management of the project.\nThe course includes tutorials that will teach you how to create a project status report. You will learn what the status report is and why it is essential for communication. Think of the project status report as a snapshot of the project tracker.\nEnrolling on this course will allow you to progress through easy-to-follow tutorials broken down into short video lengths. You will easily be able to learn at your own pace. This course will take you through each step of creating a professional project tracking tool. You will also be provided with spreadsheet templates that you can review and play around with. However, it is recommended that you learn how to build a project tracker from scratch to improve your spreadsheet development skills.\nThe tutorials feature LibreOffice Calc as the spreadsheet software of choice. However, Microsoft Excel has the same functionality and you will be able to create the tools shown in the tutorials. The navigation may be a little different but you will be expected to have spreadsheet experience before enrolling on this course.\nThe course is not going to teach you all about project management. There will be several tutorials included that will teach you about the jargon associated with project tracking such as deadlines, deliverables, milestones, and risk management. But you should already have a good understanding of project management in practice either through experience or studies.\nThis course is all about you developing spreadsheet skills that most modern organisations will be looking for. Enrol now and add those essential IT skills to your resume. You will be an asset to your organisation or future employers!",

This LibreOffice Graphics course provides information not generally included in other courses or tutorials.\nLibreOffice Writer, like most word processing applications tries to make it easy for beginners to start using graphics in their documents. But these easy to use methods of inserting, moving, and resizing images are seldom the best methods to use.\nWithout knowing more about how graphics are anchored and positioned, users often encounter problems. They may then spend hours trying to resolve these problems. This LibreOffice Graphics course can help users avoid such problems.\nThe course includes approximately one and one-half hours of video lessons explaining various aspects of using graphics in LibreOffice Writer documents. Topics include:\nVarious methods of inserting graphics and why using one method may prove better than another.\nA discussion on why file size matters and how various image handling techniques can greatly reduce the final size of your documents.\nWhy sizing, cropping, and otherwise adjusting images should be done before inserting them into your documents.\nVarious anchor choices, what each choice means, and why one choice may prove better than another.\nHow image positioning is related to how and where an image is anchored and why this matters.\nVarious ways to wrap and space text around images.\nHow using image styles can make sizing and positioning multiple images easier and more uniform.\nHow providing descriptive names to your images will make dealing with multiple images easier.\nHow LibreOffice Writer can be used to automatically apply captions to your images.\nWhy using various methods of manually applying captions may be the better way to go.\nHow LibreOffice Writer can help automate the process of including a table of figures to your document and how to customize this process.\nThe difference between various image types and settings and why one type may be better than another for an individual image.\nThe importance of understanding how different colors interact with one another, especially if the document may eventually be printed in grayscale.\nHow writing and editing the text of your document before inserting images can save you a lot of time and frustration.",

      "description": "Two years ago I took a sales position with a small shoe company, at the same time we started using Pipedrive. As someone who was just starting out I found Pipedrive to be incredibly helpful as I learned the ins and outs of selling shoes. I was able to remember names and details about our customers that helped me close more sales and grow our current shoe accounts. In the first year, sales grew by 73% in the first year we started using Pipedrive. And the average salesman who uses this as a productivity tool sees a 28% increase in sales.\nI made this class so that you can have a full understanding of Pipedrive. In this masterclass I will cover:\n\n\nSync contacts and email\nImport leads and accounts\nMass import activities for your sales team (Exclusive)\nHow to move a deal through the pipeline\nHow to take powerful notes\nSet follow up activities\nEstimate how much sales you will close\nTrack sales performance\nSave time, automatically email your customers.\n\n\nI’m so excited to help you on your journey to sales greatness, and I’m confident that you’ll come away from this course with a more full understanding of this program.\nMusic provided by bensound",

The course also includes exercises so you can immediately practice what you’ve learned.\n\n\nWe prepared this course using Google Chrome on a Windows OS. Monday is a browser-based platform, however, so it should look no different regardless of what browser you choose to work with. If you are looking at learning and using Monday, this is the course to get you started!\n\n\nThis course covers:\nSetting up an account and logging in for the first time\nAn overview of the Monday user interface\nHow to create and delete boards\nEssential columns and board templates\nAdding data to boards and connecting boards\nSearching, sorting, and filtering board data\nHow to add additional board views\nUsing calendar, workload, form, Kanban, and Gantt board views\nWorking with notifications, inbox, and my work\nHow to share a full board on a public URL\nCreating dashboards and adding basic widgets\nPrinting and presenting dashboards\nHow to add automation and integrations to a board\n\n\nThis course includes:\n2+ hours of video tutorials\n36 individual video lectures\nCertificate of completion\nCourse files to help you follow along\n\n\nHere's what our students are saying...\n\n\n★★★★★ \"This course is exactly as advertised. It is a beginner-level course. If you have spent time with Monday, you will likely find it too introductory. However, if you haven't done more than enter a few things into a basic board, this course will help you take the next steps to dive deeper into its functionality. I particularly liked the thorough presentation of the material as well as the exercises at the end of each section that help to reinforce the lessons learned. I think that is what puts it above traditional Udemy trainings. It is a well-planned course.\" -Brandi Day\n★★★★★ \"I came to this course after dealing with a number of so-called consultants on a freelance website who I hoped could help me build my Monday boards and explain how the thing works. That wasted time and money. This course, which I have completed in two days has set me up with the basics that I need to build the processes in my business and to save my small team considerable amounts of time and effort. It's a well-paced course delivered in an easy to understand manner at just the right pace. I pretty well managed to complete all of the exercises, though one or two proved a little more challenging due to my own issues in understanding!\" -David Carter",

QuickBooks is a typical example of accounting software.\nFor most new steps in our accounting practice problem, you will have access to a downloadable Excel Workbook containing at least two tabs, one with the answer, the new tasks completed, the other starting where the prior presentation left off.\nAs we enter the second month of data input, we will analyze the current month's data and the year-to-date data. We will use Excel to understand how accounting software like QuickBooks generates reports for different periods, including reports for one month, multiple months, and comparative reports.\nThe course will demonstrate transactions for each accounting cycle, the revenue cycle, the purchases cycle, and the payroll cycle.\nWe will enter transactions into the general journal, the general ledger, subsidiary ledgers, the trial balance, and the financial statements.\nLearners will create financial statements for the current month and the year-to-date data.",

      "description": "\"Extremely easy to understand and straight to the point. The examples are realistic and easy to compare to most jobs\"\nChloe - 5 stars\n\n\nImagine an organisation in which the collective knowledge, learning, and experience of all its people is available at everyone's fingertips at any moment. Welcome to Confluence.\n\n\nIn the Confluence Crash Course you will learn how to harness Confluence to boost your productivity, resulting in more effective collaboration, less time-wasting admin and an end to information loss. In as little as 2 hours you will get up to scratch with Confluence, and start to understand the ways it can help you in your day to day work.\n\n\nIn this course we will use a fictional case study company to explore the functionality and applications of Confluence in different business functions, including Operations, HR, Projects and IT. By switching between each of these functions you will see how Confluence works collaboratively between team members, and get an understanding of the different functionality available for different user levels (e.g. guests, users, admins etc). All the examples used in this course are inspired by real world use cases.\n\n\n\"Amazing, very compact and well explained :) Thank you!\"\nRawan - 5 stars\n\n\nWith 5 distinct sections, and 3 different starting points depending on your experience level you will rapidly get up to speed with:\n\n\n1) An introduction to Confluence\nIncluding: what is Confluence, how to use this course, and an introduction to the case study\n\n\n2) Confluence Fundamentals - for complete beginners\nIncluding: creating your site, spaces and pages, the interface, page operations, formatting basics, using templates, and permissions.\nBy the end of this section you will be able to use Confluence to create, edit and manage pages.\n\n\n3) Intermediate Confluence - for existing users\nIncluding: collaborative editing, macros, importing pages from Word documents, embedding content, tasks, actions, labels, decisions, comments, notifications, exporting pages, and Confluence for mobile.\nBy the end of this section you will have mastered how to use Confluence collaboratively with your team, will be able to make well-structured, content rich pages using macros (dynamic page elements).\n\n\n4) Advanced Confluence - for administrators (Space Admins, Product Admins, Org Admins)\nIncluding: types of users, page history, embedding live editable documents, editing templates, creating new templates, managing labels, space settings, global settings, managing apps, the Atlassian administration dashboard, and user access management.\nBy the end of this section you will have an in-depth understanding of the permissions structure within Confluence, and will be able to manage spaces, products and organisations. This will be particularly useful if you are looking to set up a new Confluence site or are being asked to become an admin for your existing company's site. It will also be valuable if you are looking to use Confluence for personal projects or simply want to have an understanding of the processes for administrators so you can best work with your own admins.\n5) Draw. io - an app that adds powerful diagrams to Confluence\nIncluding: what Draw .io is, installing the app, speedy diagrams, sketch, using templates, and importing and exporting diagrams.\nBy the end of this section you'll be able to create powerful diagrams in order to visualise ideas with ease. Sometimes a picture really does say a thousand words!\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have mastered all of the core functionality and use cases of Confluence and will be confident using the application within your day to day. You will likely become the go-to person for Confluence within your organisation!\n\n\n\"Great and exactly what I have been looking for\"\nChristian - 5 stars\n\"Great course. Provides all the information needed to ace the tool\"\nAshish - 4.5 stars\n\"Easy and insightful\"\nAngela - 5 stars",

Using tax software to experiment with different scenarios is a very effective way to learn about how tax credits actually operate.\nFor example, running tax scenarios using tax software is the only way most people will be able to see clearly the difference between the child tax credit (CTC) and the additional child tax credit (ACTC). Running tax scenarios can also help us understand how the child tax credit (CTC), additional child tax credit (ACTC), and earned income tax credit (EIC) will work as income levels and the number of children is adjusted.\nWe will provide PDF files that can be downloaded and used as references without an internet connection.\nThe course will also provide PDF documents of relevant publications and forms.",

      "description": "How many times have you found yourself knee-deep in generic ChatGPT results, spending more time reworking than it would have taken to just work from scratch? Whatever happened to the promise of AI tools bringing us productivity without sacrificing quality?\n\n\nThe fact is this: Getting great writing results with ChatGPT isn’t just possible…it’s actually pretty easy. But only with the right approaches, the right prompts, and a deep understanding of how to truly become a curator with a vision in the era of AI.\n\n\nThat’s the focus of this course. Broadly, you will learn to become a prompt engineer and create your own prompt library filled with multi-step prompts that give you great results for whatever you may need to write. No more generic results!\n\n\nOn this journey, you'll discover the three powerful writing approaches that deliver on every front: quality, accuracy, consistency, versatility, and more. We’ll go over the specific multi-step prompts to build an intuition for when to use a given approach, and how to combine them as needed, whether you're crafting professional emails, persuasive cover letters, insightful articles, blogs, meticulous performance reviews, succinct meeting notes, compelling business proposals, empathetic customer service responses, razor-sharp presentation outlines, engaging scripts…literally whatever!\n\n\nNote: For most of the course, we will be working in GPT-4 from OpenAI, but most of what we cover can be applied to GPT-3.5 and Bard (with varying results). This is not a technical course, meaning that no coding skills are required.\n\n\nThis course is NOT a theoretical lecture series—it’s jam-packed with real-world examples from beginning to end. This way of learning will be critical in mastering the approaches and building your own prompt library. You'll get your hands dirty with a treasure trove of innovative prompts, learning to utilize them effectively and shape them to your unique needs.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\n\nCraft and iterate prompts to get consistently solid results\nFine-tune instructions to match your unique writing style (or any other style)\nBuild multi-step writing workflows for specific use cases\nLearn to use prompts that can generate repeatable results at scale (for doing tasks in bulk)\nSpecify style and tone according to your purpose and the context\nUse iteration productively, rather than trying to iterate garbage\nCreate a custom well-organized prompt library for any task\nUse ChatGPT as an elite proofreader/copyeditor capable of high-level feedback\nImplement evaluation guidelines within ChatGPT to get more accurate and consistent results\nOrganize unstructured writing according to a standard or template (like ‘The Elements of Style’)\nSummarize and synthesize large sets of information and repurpose it according to your needs (with or without a template)\nBrainstorm and develop ideas using ChatGPT as a thoughtful (or critical) interlocutor\nRepurpose content across formats, including videos to articles\nAutomate writing tasks (hello, Zapier) using the ChatGPT API\n\n\nSo, what are you really getting from this course? Essentially, it’s a blueprint for becoming a prompt engineer for all writing use cases. By the end of the course, you will have everything you need to get great results.\n\n\nThis is how you transform ChatGPT into your personal, turbo-charged writing assistant.\n\n\nAre you ready to unleash the power of ChatGPT? Ready to enter the AI era fully equipped to create whatever your mind can dream up? If so, sign up now.\n\nSee you in the course!\n\n\n-Luke",

This course, Knowledge Management with Generative AI, shows you how to harness the power of AI tools like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and ServiceNow NowAssist to transform the way knowledge is captured, shared, and used.\nYou’ll start by building a strong foundation: understanding what knowledge management (KM) is, why it matters, and how Generative AI is reshaping the landscape. From there, we’ll dive into practical strategies and hands-on demos that bring KM concepts to life. You’ll see how AI can auto-tag and summarize knowledge articles, capture tacit insights through conversational interviews, and combine multiple sources into structured playbooks.\nBeyond the theory, this course is packed with practical tools and resources. You’ll get downloadable templates, assignments, quizzes, and reflection exercises that help you immediately apply what you’ve learned in your own workplace. You’ll also learn how to measure the ROI of AI-enhanced KM, build governance frameworks, and prepare for the future with emerging technologies like VR, IoT, and autonomous agents.\nWhether you’re a knowledge manager, IT leader, or business professional, this course will equip you with the skills, tools, and confidence to lead the AI-powered knowledge revolution.\nEnroll today and start turning scattered information into a strategic advantage.",

      "description": "How big is Kaizen?\nDo you know that almost all FORTUNE 500 companies are using or had used Kaizen during their business growth curve? Be it FORD motor company which survived and recovered the rough times during Great recession of late 2000s, Herman Miller which enjoyed more than 500% increase in productivity and quality in its product and services with Kaizen or even aerospace technology company like Lockheed Martin during development of Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) system, Kaizen has always been in lead role. We also may have heard the stories how Canon and Toyota used Kaizen for improving productivity and quality. It is for this reason that Government sectors of many nations have also been largely interested in implementing this technique to improve public sectors.\nWhat is Kaizen ?\n· Kaizen is a japanese term (改善) which means to change and put back together in a better way. Kaizen is an all employee involvement strategy of eliminating the wastes from all the process and bring a culture of continuous improvement using lesser resources.\n· In English definition, it means ‘Continuous Improvement’.\nWhat not is Kaizen?\n· Kaizen is not an organizational’s 'Get rich quick without effort' scheme. Although Kaizen Blitz helps in quick problem locating and solving, it really needs dedication, knowledge and effort to bring a great change to your personal and organizational growth.\n· It’s not a Manager’s only job. Kaizen works best in overall participation.\n· It’s not a one-time improvement policy. It’s a continuous improvement approach.\nWhat is in this course for me?\nThis course is a step by step Kaizen Training platform for beginners and also for future professional Kaizen Practitioner aspirants. You get knowledge, skills and certification as a Kaizen Practitioner. The best part of the course is, it is an step by step approach starting from beginners to an expert level. It also lectures you with the use of  MINITAB and EXCEL  where necessary even if you have never used these software before. The first ‘Beginner’s level’ deals with introduction of Kaizen, it’s principles and ground rules, Kaizen procedure and benefits. In the intermediate level of difficulty you study about pillars of Kaizen involving lean tools like 5S, MUDA, MURA and MURI and about 8 kinds of wastes. Finally, you study in depth how to perform Kaizen with an organized lean PDCA pathway.\nPDCA stands for Plan, Do, Check and Act.\nIn Plan phase of Kaizen, we select a Kaizen project with knowledge of who, when and where to implement Kaizen and also learn to perform the GEMBA walk. We select Key performance indicators and set SMART GOALS for our Kaizen project. Finally, we make an ACTION PLAN for our Kaizen project.\nIn Do Phase we collect and sample data and analyze the data with Checksheets, Histograms and Scatterplots, Control Charts etc with analysis tools such as Cause and Effect Diagram and Pareto Analysis etc. We will learn performing these analytical tasks using MINITAB and EXCEL.\nIn Check phase, we develop solutions using Benchmarking and Brainstorming, find the root cause of the problem with RCA (Root Cause Analysis), test the solutions and ensure if the goals are satisfied.\nFinally, in the Act Phase, we implement and monitor the countermeasures with a notion of continuous improvement.\nHow do I really know that I have learned enough?\nThere are 3 ways to do so inside the course-\n· By learning through Case Studies and Simulated Case Studies\n· By checking your knowledge through other Quizzes\n· By participating in FINAL PRACTICE TEST.\n\n\nWhat is so different in this course?\n· This course comes with many case studies and simulated case studies in order to explain the practical use of kaizen and its philosophy in real life business environment.\n· You also get tutored in using MINITAB and Excel where necessary and it doesn’t need your prior knowledge of using these software tools.\n· You can test your knowledge with a lot of quizzes and a final practice test.\n· This course is a step by step learning opportunity for complete beginners. It is also helpful for certification as ‘Kaizen Practitioner’.\n· You can get your questions answered directly from the instructor of the course on any relevant Kaizen topic.\nWhat’s the safety?\nWith 30 days money back guarantee you can sit back and relax as you learn. Give it a try because this course will change your organizational improvement knowledge and that’s a person promise from the instructor.\nLet’s make it a learning celebration and a skill for lifetime.

      "description": "Last Updated: Aug 2025\n\n\nHave you ever searched for hours for images that properly capture your message or vision, still without finding a perfect match?\nOr have you spent, or don't want to spend, a ton of money on professional design services to create custom visuals?\nOr are you looking for a copilot that enhances your creative work process and is safe for commercial use?\n\n\nGuess what? With the current state of AI and AI art generation technologies like Firefly, creating visuals tailored to your specific needs is no longer a barrier and now costs just a fraction of what it used to!\n\n\nWhat is Firefly?\n\n\nAdobe Firefly is a standalone web application that offers new ways for ideating, creating, and enhancing visuals and design elements using generative AI.\nIn addition to the Firefly web app, Firefly-powered features are also available in other Adobe products such as Express, Photoshop, and more.\nAdobe created Firefly to be safe for commercial use, using content without copyright restrictions for training their models. This sets it apart from many other generative AI models, which could cause copyright issues for businesses and organizations.\nApart from commercial viability, Firefly’s explosive popularity, with 3 billion images generated by users since its launch in March 2023, has great potential for businesses and individuals looking to explore generative AI solutions.\n\n\nWhy is it time to learn Generative AI?\n\n\nGenerative AI is a set of technologies that can create original content, generate insights from large amounts of data, translate languages with near-human accuracy, and potentially even make complex decisions.\nChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, Firefly, and GitHub’s Copilot are some well-known examples.\nThe rapid advancement of generative AI technologies is now reshaping industries and businesses through new operating models, new products, and services.\nLearning about these technologies now prepares individuals for the jobs of tomorrow, ensuring they remain relevant and competitive in an evolving job market.\n\n\nCourse Highlights:\n\n\n5+ hours of HD video content, step-by-step tutorials, and activities.\nCourse handbook with 200+ examples of how Firefly's style effects and your prompt description could influence the final output.\nAdvanced techniques on crafting effective Firefly prompts with such tools as ChatGPT, MS Copilot, and Adobe Stock.\nLectures on generative AI fundamentals, including an overview of the AI landscape and how AI generates art.\nLearners community to connect with your course instructor and other learners, ask questions, and receive support.\nCertificate of completion from the FutureVersity School upon completion of the course (available upon request for those who completed at least 80% of the course).\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Firefly and Midjourney?\n\n\nThere are things that set Firefly apart from other competitive products, including Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and others:\nEverything created in Firefly is designed to be commercially safe for individuals and enterprise creative teams.\nFirefly comes with a very intuitive, user-friendly, and easy-to-understand interface, so that means you don't have to become a prompt engineer and design instructions densely packed with technical terms and abbreviations like for other similar products.\nWhile most generative AI tools focus on a single functionality, Firefly, initially focused on image generation, will eventually provide a variety of tools. Firefly users will be able to remove distractions from photos, change the mood of a video, add new elements to illustrations, test out design options, add texture to 3D objects, and even create digital experiences.",

      "description": "NOTE: New material continues to be added to the course as the Salesforce platform continues to evolve.\n________________________________________________\nIn this course you will learn how to configure Salesforce(SFDC) to fulfill business needs, in preparation for well paying employment.\nAspiratech is a registered Salesforce consulting partner, and as such we design and implement the system for companies large and small, including non-profits. We are leading experts in the field, which you can see by simply Googling \"Salesforce Training.\"\nAs part of every Salesforce implementation, we train both users and at least one internal System Administrator (Sys Admin). This training course has effectively trained hundreds of new Sys Admins to take on real world duties upon which their companies depend, and has helped many attain certification by providing a strong foundation upon which they could build.\nUsing step by step instruction, clearly demonstrated and explained, including the “gotchas\" that send the unsuspecting in circles, this course will teach you how to customize Salesforce to meet the job requirements of a System Administrator.\nPractical hands-on exercises are included to make sure you know how to apply what you see to real world examples.\nThis course provides the training you need for the only type of true job security there is, the security of genuinely being the best at what you do.\nYou should plan on working on this course an hour a day for 3-4 weeks to effectively cover all the material. Going through the course a second time, simply watching the videos on the second pass, is also advised. Frequent exposure is key during the training period.\nThis course will help prepare you for the System Administrator certification track, unlike other Salesforce courses that purport to be \"complete,\" but which in fact focus on the Developer track and leave out a large portion of what is needed for a Sys Admin. Developer is a track that will not lead to either Sys Admin positions or highly paid consulting positions, and is only appropriate for those who intend to go on to become apex coders. This course is intended for people who never want to have to configure an API or deal with writing code syntax.\nThat said, there is no substitute for getting the most recent Salesforce supplied study guide (webpage linked to within the course) to actually study for the exam itself, just as when you were in school you had to supplement in class learning with extra study for end of semester exams.\nHere is an email we received from a student about using this course to get her Sys Admin certification:\n\"I wanted to let you know that I successfully passed my admin 201 certification. I am looking forward to write my 401 exam as well... I know that certification will help me in securing a job. I highly recommended your course to my friends. Only because of your course and watching it several times and practice it several times, I was able to grasp knowledge. Thank you very much. Best, Padma\"\nStarting salaries for employed consultants in the industry are typically $40-60/hr, depending on your region, and independent consultants who sign their own clients often make several times those amounts. If you have had an interest in expanding your career options by adding a practical technology proficiency to your skill set, Salesforce System Administration is where many non-technical people find their opportunity. For those who have no interest in embarking upon a technology specialist career path, the SFDC Sys Admin skill set is also greatly in demand and in short supply in many non-technical positions and will make you an indispensable part of any work team.\nNote: It is expected that you will have access to an instance of SFDC you can experiment and practice in within this course. Salesforce provides a free Developer org at:\nDeveloper dot salesforce dot com/signup\n(Udemy no longer allows us to make this a live link, so unfortunately you're going to have to do some manual work to get to the right page on the Salesforce site to get this from them... is also posted within the second lecture in this course)\n-- Note that you should use a personal email address as your username when signing up for a developer edition account, so that your work email address will remain available for your company instance username.\nIf your company does not have Salesforce yet, but is considering implementing it, get a free 30-day Trial org on the Salesforce website. You will then have the added benefit that work you do toward genuine goals during this course can be preserved for use by your company (unlike work saved in a developer org), possibly encouraging your employer to allow you to work on the course during your regular work day or even purchase the course for you.",

      "description": "Chatgpt is an amazing technology, but it is only step one.  While Chatgpt can give great answers to questions, it is not able to plan or evaluate its answers.  For that reason Chatgpt is not enough, Autogpt is what we need now.  Unlike Chatgpt, Autogpt is self prompting and able to plan prompts for itself and evaluate the quality of the responses.  This gives it significantly more abilities than Chatgpt.  Even if Autogpt is to intensive for your computer skills you can still get in on the self prompting/ self planing part of Chatgpt by using Agentgpt.\nWhile Autogpt is not a complete technology yet, it is an important next step in Ai and using Chatgpt.  Autogpt is not a technology that you can afford to be left behind on just as Chatgpt is an advancement that you cannot afford to get left behind on.\nYou will learn how to use Chatgpt beyond just being given a list of prompts.  You will learn how to write quality prompts for yourself.  Long lists of prompts are not what you need to learn.  Many of the prompts will not be relevant to you, and then you will not know how to produce high quality prompts for yourself.\n\n\nWhy you should take this course:\n1. Responsive teaching.  As a professional secondary teacher, I know that one of the keys to learning is timely feedback especially in difficult material like Chatgpt and other Ai tools.  That is why I am committed to responding to questions as soon as possible on all questions about Chatgpt, Autogpt, and all course content.  I am waiting to answer questions to further your learning beyond just the course material, which is important because Chatgpt is an evolving technology that will continue to change and improve.\n2. Expanding Content.  The number of AI tools is constantly expanding as ChatGPT and other tools are being used in new and exciting ways.  Everyday new tools using Chatgpt are being made and improved.  For this reason a good course on Chatgpt and AI tools must continue to add new content and improve old content.  I am committed to adding more material on Chatgpt and updating material as new advances in technology are made.  I am also committed to adding Chatgpt and other Ai tools material based on your feedback.\n3. Increase Productivity.  Using Chatgpt, Autogpt and other Ai Tools you will be able to save time in your work flow and be able to focus on the important aspects of your job or interests.  We spend so much time doing repetitive task that now can be performed by Ai tools such as Chatgpt.  Take this class to learn how to save time with Chatgpt and spend more time on the important things.\n\n\nWhat you will learn: This class will take you from knowing nothing about AI tools and ChatGPT, to being able to use AI tools to increase your work flow.\nYou will:\n1. Create an app without programing using a Chatgpt enabled website that is able to produce Langchain apps like without programming\n2. Create and Improve ChatGPT prompts\n3. Create a Digital Assistant to perform tasks for you that uses Chatgpt to answer, evaluate and improve responses\n4. Create a website that answers questions using ChatGPT\n5. Compose Emails with one click that will use context of previous emails and chatgpt to produce high quality responses\n6. Create a design with a short description or example picture using Canva which is like Chatgpt for design\n7. Create a digital assistant to perform research which using Chatgpt just as a base and then plans, evaluates and improves chatgpt responses.\n\n\nWelcome to THE class on ChatGPT and AI tools!

Agile is for development teams. Agile is for faith-based organizations. Agile is for healthcare systems. Agile is worldwide. Agile is for everyone…who wants to create a greater impact faster at a sustainable pace.\nThe reality is that there is not one perfect framework or tool to help teams to be agile; rather, there is a variety of these to help teams do great things. What is important for teams to understand first are the Agile values they will use to create an impact before they choose a framework and tool(s).\nLet us introduce you to Agile, specifically, the values and principles that serve as an umbrella for several specific frameworks and tools that your team may use.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Agile and Scrum?\nAgile is a set of values and principles that help teams accomplish and/or create great things. Scrum is an Agile framework, and therefore helps teams embody Agile values and principles. It is a lightweight decision-making framework that helps teams continuously improve their work product AND the way that they work together.",

The Enneagram is more than just a psychometric tool; it's a gateway to deeper self-understanding and improved interpersonal relationships. Throughout this course, we will explore in detail the nine distinct Enneagram types. Each type is a unique constellation of core motivations, behavioral patterns, communication styles, and adaptive responses to stress and wellness.\nAs we delve into each Enneagram type, participants will gain a nuanced understanding of how these types manifest in real-life contexts. We will look at the specific ways in which different types interact, communicate, and navigate the complexities of emotional distress and health. This exploration is not just theoretical; it's deeply practical, offering insights that can be applied to personal growth, workplace dynamics, and social interactions.\nOur journey through the Enneagram is designed to be an enlightening experience, fostering greater self-awareness and social acuity. Whether you're looking to improve your personal relationships, enhance your professional interactions, or embark on a path of self-discovery, this course offers the tools and insights necessary to achieve these goals.

This is because it does not do justice to the complexities of stress, bullying, conflict, discrimination and other such obstacles to an authentic culture of wellness. A positive approach to health and well-being is very much to be welcomed, but without also considering the negatives that stand in the way of making employee wellness a reality, success is likely to prove elusive.\nIn this introductory course, human relations expert Dr Neil Thompson provides helpful guidance on how a more sophisticated approach rooted in effective leadership can be much more successful. For more than a quarter of a century, Neil has been providing training and consultancy around effective management and leadership and how to get the best out of people. He draws on that experience and expertise in providing a sound foundation of understanding of how to promote employee wellness.\nThe course is structured around ten key principles to help you succeed in promoting healthier, happier and more productive workplaces, each of which offers important insights that can help bring about progress. Accompanying the video materials is a downloadable workbook with exercises to encourage reflection and space for notes.",

But only if you take full advantage of the fewer distractions and calm work environment.\nACHIEVE WORK-LIFE BALANCE\nBecause you are home, you can do light exercise, light cleaning, and have more family time - all during breaks. If you combine that with no commute and flexibility in being able to do everything on your own time, you open up hours in your day to do whatever you want when you want to do it.\nHELPFUL DURING COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC AND BEYOND\nAll of us now have to be more responsible and go out less. That means working from home indefinitely. This is the perfect course to take during the Coronavirus epidemic to get ahead while everyone else is falling behind.\nBOOST PRODUCTIVITY\nYou will learn to minimize distractions and achieve your best focus, which will result in your best work yet! You'll also learn time management skills to help you organize your work, and make your home the most productive place you have.\nRESPONSIVE AND CARING INSTRUCTOR: WORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT\nIf you have questions, know that I am here to help! I answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours.

Learn the tools to use, how to use them, and the choices you will make along the way. Included are the following handouts:\nA critical checklist for data migrations; and\nImportant keys to working with more complex migrations involving special objects like Products and Campaigns.\nOnce you complete this course you should feel confident working with large amounts of data with a data competency. You may even decide that you would like to specialize in this area. It is a unique skill set that even many seasoned System Administrators lack.

It is suggested that you:\nRead the task\nWatch the video\nHave a go at it yourself on your own system\nRewatch the video (if necessary) - to reinforce the learning\nYou’ll learn how to set up the Kashflow system from scratch, how to enter opening balances, post customer invoices and credit notes, post supplier bills and credit notes, pay suppliers, petty cash, prepare a VAT return, reconcile the bank, post journals, run reports amongst over things.\nThis is a useful course if:\nYou are thinking of working with the software,\nYou are going for jobs which have a requirement for you to be able to use this software\nYou want to put this skill on your CV, or\nYou are a bookkeeper or accountant and will be using this for clients or even\nYou run your own business and want to know how to use Kashflow for yourself.\nYou will be given access to Kashflow (free for 14 days).\nThe course materials includes the handout of the assignment task.\nSuccessful completion of the course is the equivalent to being at the level of having a level 2 certificate in computerised accounts.\nThe course will take about 3-4 hours to complete.\nKashflow (if you are a user) does some very odd things. It has been known for the Trial Balance not to balance which \"should\" actually be an impossibility for any decent accounts software. Likewise, you may find that things go 'missing' from the bank reconciliation statement (yet remain within the system). As a accounting software trainer for over a decade, having used more than 20 different bookkeeping software out there - it wouldn't be a system I'd recommend, and I'd strongly suggest you get help if you are using this software because you won't be able to figure it out and sometimes it could be \"technical\" fault (i.e. an error on their end) and absolutely nothing to do with you, or what you've entered. So don't bang your head on the computer. You may just want to switch software instead...",

      "description": "In this training series you will learn how to configure Salesforce to fulfill business needs, in preparation for well paying employment. This second course in the series will provide you with a strong foundation in how security works in the system. You will be able to design a security system that meets the needs of a given company, then implement that design and test it for proper functioning. You will make sure that users can only do what they should be able to do in the Salesforce system.\nAspiratech is a registered Salesforce consulting and ISV partner, and as such we design and implement the system for companies large and small, including non-profits. We are leading experts in the field, which you can see by simply Googling \"Salesforce Training.\"\nAs part of every Salesforce implementation, we train both users and at least one internal System Administrator (Sys Admin).\nThis training series has effectively trained hundreds of new Sys Admins to take on real world duties upon which their companies depend, and has helped many attain certification by providing a strong foundation upon which they could build.\nUsing step by step instruction, clearly demonstrated and explained, including the “gotchas\" that send the unsuspecting in circles, this course will teach you how to customize Salesforce to meet the job requirements of a System Administrator.\nPractical hands-on exercises are included to make sure you know how to apply what you see to real world examples.\nThis course provides the training you need for the only type of true job security there is, the security of genuinely being the best at what you do.\nYou should plan on working on this series an hour a day for 3-4 weeks to effectively cover all the material. Going through the series a second time, simply watching the videos on the second pass, is also advised. Frequent exposure is key during the training period.\nThis training series will help prepare you for the System Administrator certification track, unlike other Salesforce courses that purport to be \"complete,\" but which in fact focus on the Developer track and leave out a large portion of what is needed for a Sys Admin. Developer is a track that will not lead to either Sys Admin positions or highly paid consulting positions, and is only appropriate for those who intend to go on to become apex coders. This course is intended for people who never want to have to configure an API or deal with writing code syntax.\nThat said, there is no substitute for getting the most recent Salesforce supplied study guide (webpage linked to within the course) to actually study for the exam itself, just as when you were in school you had to supplement in class learning with extra study for end of semester exams.\nHere is an email we received from a student about using this training to get her Sys Admin certification:\n\"I wanted to let you know that I successfully passed my admin 201 certification. I am looking forward to write my 401 exam as well... I know that certification will help me in securing a job. I highly recommended your course to my friends. Only because of your course and watching it several times and practice it several times, I was able to grasp knowledge. Thank you very much. Best, Padma\"\nStarting salaries for employed consultants in the industry are typically $40-60/hr, depending on your region, and independent consultants who sign their own clients often make several times those amounts. If you have had an interest in expanding your career options by adding a practical technology proficiency to your skill set, Salesforce System Administration is where many non-technical people find their opportunity. For those who have no interest in embarking upon a technology specialist career path, the SFDC Sys Admin skill set is also greatly in demand and in short supply in many non-technical positions and will make you an indispensable part of any work team.\nNote: It is expected that you will have access to an instance of SFDC you can experiment and practice in within this course. Salesforce provides a free Developer org at:\nDeveloper dot salesforce dot com/signup\n(Udemy no longer allows us to make this a live link, so unfortunately you're going to have to do some manual work to get to the right page on the Salesforce site to get this from them... is also posted within the second lecture in this course)\n-- Note that you should use a personal email address as your username when signing up for a developer edition account, so that your work email address will remain available for your company instance username.\nIf your company does not have Salesforce yet, but is considering implementing it, get a free 30-day Trial org on the Salesforce website. You will then have the added benefit that work you do toward genuine goals during this course can be preserved for use by your company (unlike work saved in a developer org), possibly encouraging your employer to allow you to work on the course during your regular work day or even purchase the training series for you.",

Doing these activities for prolonged periods of time creates pain, stiffness, and can damage bones and ligaments.  These conditions can also affect our mental health and may cause insomnia, depression, stress, and anxiety.\nThrough a series of video lessons, New Qi (pronounced “new chi”) introduces Shaolin Master Shi Yanxu’s extensive knowledge of authentic kung fu, Qigong health, and Zen meditation to the Western world. To nourish one’s life, one must nurture one’s Qi or energy. Cultivating Qi helps promote vitality, wellness, and longevity.\nThrough precise Qigong movements and breathing techniques, Master Shi Yanxu will show you how to activate your Qi to develop positive energy and a sense of calm and well-being.\nThis course is the first of four courses taught online by Master Shi Yanxu and provides the fundamental basis movements and mastery of seated Qigongmovements.

You can then move on and add to your knowledge when you are ready. A good example of this might be adding words such as acronyms or unusual names to your vocabulary that are specific to the way that you write.\nThe average typing speed is 30-40 words a minute - follow this course and you will be working three times faster!\nI'm excited to be able to say that the course has been accepted by Student Finance England and can be recommended for university students in the UK!",

      "description": "Minutes can be referred to as the notes or written records of a meeting. Minutes contain the names of the attendees, issues discussed in the meeting, views expressed by the participants, and decisions made. Minutes are normally recorded by a secretary or typist using shorthand notations. After recording all the details and structuring the notes, it is distributed to the participants. The person who writes the minutes is also called as “minute taker”. Almost 60% of all the managers’ time is spent on meetings. It can even go up to 90% in the near future. Some meetings are energizing, inspiring, and fun while some meetings are dull, ineffective, and unproductive.\nThe team members of a particular team meet frequently to discuss various issues. When this becomes a routine, the members lose interest. Normally, a team leader conducts team meetings that are more active, interesting, and successful. Team briefing is very important because it helps the employees to understand what they are doing in an organization and why they are doing it. Various issues related to their team and work are discussed. The team leader’s brief is the “core” brief supplied by the senior management.\nPreparation is essential when you meet a client. During your meeting with a client, if you are not able to provide your client with what he exactly wants, the meeting might fail. Part of your job is to analyze and find out what the client exactly wants. Negotiation is done by every manager in a firm. For achieving certain objectives, negotiation plays an important role. A negotiation is considered successful if all the participants in a meeting are satisfied. When the meeting creates genuine agreement, the negotiator is very happy.\nMost of the participants hate long meetings. A meeting should be long enough to allow the business to be discussed completely. After preparing the agenda, the minute taker has to calculate the time required for each item. If the meeting lasts for more than a couple of hours, the concentration slips. The room chosen for the meeting should be comfortable. Only if it is comfortable, it will be easier for the person to chair and minute, and it will also be productive. The room where the meeting is going to be held should be airy and bright with less disturbance.",

With the expander docked to your editing screen, specialized terminology and commonly used phrases can be typed very quickly using abbreviations or shortcuts that the user assigns to the program. This significantly reduces the number of keystrokes needing to by typed, which in turn increases your speed immensely.  The text expander also prevents critical spelling errors and cuts down on the amount of wear and tear on your wrists, joints, and hands.\n\nThis course is geared toward the transcriptionist who has peaked in their level of productivity at the keyboard and would like to increase their line rate. This course will also benefit the transcription student who is looking for an in-depth course on the text expander so they are more prepared prior to entering the workforce. With the specialized terminology already provided within the text expander glossaries, students and seasoned transcriptionists alike will feel more equipped and efficient in their work as a transcriptionist.\nStay ahead of the curve and learn how to use the text expander program that all your colleagues are talking about!",

      "description": "Work-Life Balance: Strategies for Busy Professionals\nWork-life balance practical tips for being happier at home and work\n\n\nGetting your work-life balance right might just be the most important thing you do. Why? Because without it, life becomes a long list of meetings, emails, and stress… and before you know it, the things that actually make you happy—family, hobbies, sleep!—get pushed to the side.\n\n\nWork will always expand to fill the time you give it. Like weeds in your garden, it sneaks in and takes over unless you actively keep it in check. And that’s what this course is all about: taking back control.\n\n\nIn this course, I’ll walk you through a whole load of practical strategies to help you get the most out of your job and your personal life—without burning out in the process. We’ll cover how to set boundaries, how to stop work from leaking into your evenings, and how to enjoy both sides of your life more fully.\n\n\nYou might be wondering:\nIs it worth changing jobs at this stage in your career?\nShould you really be working so hard?\nIs your boss helping—or secretly sabotaging—your balance?\nWe’ll talk about all that, and more.\n\n\nI’ve spent 25 years teaching people how to manage time, reduce stress, and feel happier—and I’ve worked in enough roles myself (engineer, manager, lecturer, self-employed) to know what it’s like out there. So everything I share is based on real experience, not theory.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a toolkit of simple, proven tactics that help you spend less time at work, feel less stressed, and get more enjoyment from both work and home.\n\n\nIt’s not about quitting your job or moving to a log cabin in the woods. It’s about small, smart changes that make a big difference.\nSo, if you’re ready to make life a bit less frantic and a lot more enjoyable, I’ll see you inside the course.",

      "description": "In this first section of the full Salesforce Step-by-Step System Administrator Training course, you will learn how to configure Salesforce to fulfill business needs, in preparation for well paying employment. This first section from the full course will provide you with a strong foundation in how the system works and how to use it as a System Administrator, plus give you a low cost introduction to the field before you have to invest any significant amount in training. This is a great way to start your exploration of Salesforce System Administration.\nAspiratech is a registered Salesforce consulting and ISV partner, and as such we design and implement the system for companies large and small, including non-profits. We are leading experts in the field, which you can see by simply Googling \"Salesforce Training.\"\nAs part of every Salesforce implementation, we train both users and at least one internal System Administrator (Sys Admin).\nThe full Salesforce Step-by-Step System Administrator Training has effectively trained hundreds of new Sys Admins to take on real world duties upon which their companies depend, and has helped many attain certification by providing a strong foundation upon which they could build.\nUsing step by step instruction, clearly demonstrated and explained, including the “gotchas\" that send the unsuspecting in circles, this course will teach you how to customize Salesforce to meet the job requirements of a System Administrator.\nPractical hands-on exercises are included to make sure you know how to apply what you see to real world examples.\nThis course provides the training you need for the only type of true job security there is, the security of genuinely being the best at what you do.\nStarting salaries for employed consultants in the industry are typically $40-60/hr, depending on your region, and independent consultants who sign their own clients often make several times those amounts. If you have had an interest in expanding your career options by adding a practical technology proficiency to your skill set, Salesforce System Administration is where many non-technical people find their opportunity. For those who have no interest in embarking upon a technology specialist career path, the SFDC Sys Admin skill set is also greatly in demand and in short supply in many non-technical positions and will make you an indispensable part of any work team.\nNote: It is expected that you will have access to an instance of SFDC you can experiment and practice in within this course. Salesforce provides a free Developer org at:\nDeveloper dot salesforce dot com/signup\n(Udemy no longer allows us to make this a live link, so unfortunately you're going to have to do some manual work to get to the right page on the Salesforce site to get this from them... is also posted within the second lecture in this course)\n-- Note that you should use a personal email address as your username when signing up for a developer edition account, so that your work email address will remain available for your company instance username.\nIf your company does not have Salesforce yet, but is considering implementing it, get a free 30-day Trial org on the Salesforce website. You will then have the added benefit that work you do toward genuine goals during this course can be preserved for use by your company (unlike work saved in a developer org), possibly encouraging your employer to allow you to work on the course during your regular work day or even purchase the training series for you.\n\nGet started now but enrolling in this fundamentals level introduction to the field.",

      "description": "Are you satisfied with your working environment?\n\n\nHave you ever thought:” Why can’t I be more productive and pain-free while working here?”\n\n\nBut what if I told you there’s ONE thing, just ONE thing that can help you to change your current situation?\n\n\nDuring 25 years of my architectural career, I have noticed that a large number of people work in improvised spaces inside their apartments. Spaces that are not at all adapted to long-term work.\n\n\nAnd that is quite natural.\n\n\nBut, justifying that you will tackle designing your workspace when you have more money and time is just another excuse.\n\n\nInstead of waiting for the perfect moment and ideal constellation of the stars, ask yourself:\n\n\n“Is ergonomic home office expensive or my health is cheap?”\n\n\nYour ignorance threatens your heath and the quality of your work. Every single minute. You can not turn back time, but you can prevent the negative consequences on your health.\n\n\nThat’s why I developed my method, which is based on designing an ergonomic home office so that it COMPREHENSIVELY protects your health and increases your efficiency at work.\n\n\nBecause an ergonomic chair alone is not enough.\n\n\nI like to call this method “5-Steps To 5-Star Ergonomic Workspace”!\n\n\nAnd that is the ONE thing that will make an incredible shift in your work, when you join this course!\n\n\nYou will create a home office that will make you instantly feel better since there will be less days when you say these sentences: ”My back hurts. My eyes are burning. My neck and arm are stiff.”\n\n\nYou will learn how to:\n1.   Build a comprehensive system for achieving well-being while working\n2.  Design a workspace that will not harm your health\n3.  Make a peaceful environment and take advantages of fresh air, natural lighting and comfortable temperature to work at ease\n4.  Make a functional arrangement of furniture and electronic equipment\n5.  Create work environment that reflects your personality instead of temporary trends in design\n6.  Eliminate confusion and uncertainty when choosing new ergonomic chair, desk, storage and artificial lighting\n7.   Avoid mistakes most people make when using electronic devices and accessories, so you can eliminate a pain\n8.  Overcome excuses that you don't have time and money to invest in your health\n9.  Embrace new healthy habits that don't mean you only have to sit for 8 hours like a rigid sculpture\n10. And most importantly, how to put all the theory into practice\n.\nWhy is this course different from the standard approach to ergonomics?\n* The course is based on a comprehensive approach - the focus is not only on one piece of ergonomic furniture or correct posture, but on creating a sustainable way of working\n* It includes floor plan drawings of the minimum required workspace and drawings of 5 different rooms with the exact dimensions needed for your workspace\n* The course has a unique architectural guide with inspiring links to more than 100 pieces of furniture\n* It encourages you to make changes, because each lesson is followed by an exercise, so you will easily apply the new knowledge in practice immediately\n* The course is adapted for people who are not experts in the field of ergonomics, interior design and medicine\n.\nHow many days a year are you unable to work because your back hurts?\n\n\nThere is a different way to achieve well-being while working and create 5-STAR ERGONOMIC HOME OFFICE that you simply desire.\n\n\nEnroll now and learn how to make DIY unique working space that supports healthy success!\n\n\nIt's for you who want to take care of health today, instead of thinking about illness tomorrow!\n\n\nLet your business prosper, but on honest, sustainable and healthy foundations!\n\n\nCreate a world where your workspace supports you energetically and emotionally!",

It's time to be organized and improve your strategic planning with the best tool out there. Welcome to Monday. We're gonna make your Monday so much better. Whether you are a real estate agent or a PM at a software outfit, Monday will help you. It can even be applied to help organize school timetables.\nYou will get a quick grasp on Monday. It is one of the best project management tools out there, with the ability to design and develop dashboards that give you great visibility into your entire ecosystem.\nEverything is well documented and separated, so you can find what you need. Assignments and Quizzes will make sure you stay on track and test your knowledge. The course will have a combination of theory and practical examples.\nBuild the first Dashboard\nWe will first sign up and create a basic board, start from scratch and get a company's HR schedule sorted. They have one really incompetent employee, so you need to pick up the slack. This board can't be created using a template so you will do everything yourself. Add members, columns and send out notifications.Try different views.\nWorking with multiple users\nOnce you've done that we will move on to more interesting features. Like exporting and importing from excel. Learnt the concept of guests and shareable boards. This will let you have people who can access boards with the right amount of rights and privileges.\nIntegrations\nI'm sure you already have many apps in your ecosystem. Slack for communication or GitHub/Gitlab for version control. Send notifications to these systems, or make Monday sensitive to what is going on in them.\nGet the ingredients\nLearn all the expert tips and tricks. Switch to the timeline view, and then use the search everything functionality. Understand what it means to be a subscriber, and perform actions on sets of data, rather than individual rows. Use the activity log to find the culprit who ruined your board :P. Combine boards by using a column from one board in another and then tying it to a key, kind if like a SQL join.

      "description": "Future-Proofing Your Career in a Digital-First World | AI, Automation, Web3, and Future Skills\nThe world of work is undergoing the most dramatic transformation in modern history. Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, sustainability-driven industries, and Web3 are redefining what it means to build and sustain a career. The traditional “stable job” is now a myth, and professionals who fail to adapt risk falling behind.\nThis course, Future-Proofing Your Career in a Digital-First World, is designed to help you understand, anticipate, and thrive in this new landscape. Instead of being reactive to disruption, you’ll learn to build a future-ready skill stack, mindset, and toolkit that empowers you to stay ahead of change.\nUnlike generic career development courses, this program is built on deep research and aligned with World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs 2025 Report, Google Future Skills Framework, Coursera Job Market Studies, and McKinsey’s Future of Work insights. It integrates theory with practical application, ensuring that you not only understand what’s happening — but also know exactly what to do about it.\nWhy This Course Matters\n85 million jobs displaced by 2025: According to the World Economic Forum, AI and automation will continue to replace millions of jobs globally. This is not a far-off prediction; it’s already happening.\nEvery industry is at risk: Healthcare, law, finance, logistics, education, and even creative fields are experiencing digital disruption.\nThe skill half-life is shrinking: A skill that once lasted a lifetime is now outdated within 2–5 years. Without continuous learning, professionals become obsolete.\nGlobal competition is intensifying: Remote and hybrid work have expanded the talent pool worldwide, making careers more competitive than ever.\nDigital identity matters more than a resume: Today, your career visibility and credibility depend on platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, Behance, and even portfolio sites.\nThis course doesn’t just prepare you for the future — it helps you design a career system that grows stronger through disruption.\nWhat You’ll Learn in This Course\nThe course is structured as a strategic system, not just a series of lessons. Each module is designed to build a layer of resilience, adaptability, and visibility into your career.\nYou will explore:\nThe Urgency of Future-Proofing\nWhy careers across industries are under pressure.\nHow automation, AI, and new platforms are reshaping roles.\nWhy waiting for change is not an option — you must take ownership.\nWhat Future-Proofing Really Means\nUnderstanding future-proofing as a mindset, not just a skillset.\nDesigning for adaptability and mobility instead of stability.\nBuilding resilience through mindset, modular skills, and digital tools.\nThe New World of Work\nDigital-first economy and its impact on traditional industries.\nHow AI, automation, and Web3 redefine collaboration and ownership.\nFrom career ladders to career portfolios — why one job title is no longer enough.\nThe rise of green jobs and sustainability careers — where global policy and business intersect.\nMindset for Career Resilience\nShifting from fixed to growth mindset.\nBuilding resilience and cognitive flexibility to thrive in uncertainty.\nSelf-leadership and career agility — becoming your own career manager.\nMoving from fragile → robust → antifragile — using disruption as a growth advantage.\nThe Future Skill Stack\nCore skills vs. power skills vs. digital skills.\nWhy creativity, storytelling, critical thinking, and empathy are irreplaceable.\nHow to integrate AI fluency, automation tools, and digital collaboration into your daily work.\nPractical guides on building transferable, modular skills across industries.\nStrategic Career Design\nHow to map your career radar and anticipate future shifts.\nScenario planning: design three possible career futures instead of betting on one.\nBuilding financial resilience and multiple income streams.\nDesigning a portfolio that proves your skills and adaptability.\nVisibility and Digital Identity\nWhy being good is not enough — you must be discoverable.\nBuilding a professional brand on LinkedIn, GitHub, Behance, or Notion.\nCrafting a digital presence that communicates trust, expertise, and relevance.\nLeveraging AI-driven platforms to audit and optimize your visibility.\nLearning as a Lifestyle\nHow to design a personal learning ecosystem.\nWhy micro-credentials, short bootcamps, and peer-learning communities matter more than degrees.\nBuilding sustainable, continuous learning loops.\nLeveraging AI tutors, peer groups, and knowledge management systems.\nEvolving Work Models\nFrom gig economy to hybrid-first work.\nThe rise of digital nomads, solopreneurs, and creator economies.\nWhy portfolios outperform resumes in proving credibility.\nMapping out future opportunities across ecosystems, not just companies.\nCapstone Project\nConduct a career audit.\nMap out three possible career futures.\nBuild a personalized, future-proof career strategy.\nCreate a living career plan you can return to at every pivot point.\nWhy This Course is Different\nMost career courses are either too theoretical (filled with vague motivation) or too tactical (resume tips and interview tricks).\nThis course is designed as a career strategy engine that you can revisit over and over again. You’ll gain:\nPractical frameworks you can immediately apply.\nWorkbooks, checklists, and templates for skill mapping, career auditing, and visibility planning.\nAction-oriented missions at the end of each section to apply learning to your real-world career.\nA modular system that allows you to jump into the section most relevant to your current challenge.\nIt’s not just about surviving disruption.
