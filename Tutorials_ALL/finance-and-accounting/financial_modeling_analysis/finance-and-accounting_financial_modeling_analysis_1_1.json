      "description": "This course offers an in-depth exploration of the rapidly evolving field of financial modeling, particularly focusing on the integration of generative AI to enhance traditional models and decision-making processes. Students will begin with an introduction to financial modeling and the transformative role generative AI can play within this framework. The curriculum is meticulously designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of financial modeling and AI fundamentals while exploring the broader applications, limitations, and ethical considerations that accompany such advanced technologies. While the course is heavily rooted in theory, this theoretical foundation serves as a springboard for developing a sophisticated understanding of the complexities and nuances of AI-driven financial innovation.\nAs students progress, they will delve into the structure and requirements for implementing a generative AI framework. A significant emphasis is placed on understanding the importance of data within this context, exploring data quality, compatibility, and the automation processes essential for effective AI integration. Through a thorough examination of data pipelines and the critical need for high-quality input, students will develop a nuanced understanding of how data quality directly impacts AI’s effectiveness in financial modeling. By the end of this section, students will be able to assess and implement data pipelines that are structured and optimized for AI compatibility, setting a solid foundation for advanced AI applications in finance.\nThe curriculum also addresses how generative AI contributes to forecasting and predictive modeling within financial contexts. This section explores predictive modeling techniques, including time series forecasting and scenario planning. Through a study of scenario generation and accuracy evaluation, students will gain insights into how predictive models can be optimized with AI, thereby offering enhanced foresight in financial predictions. This predictive modeling section provides a deep dive into statistical and probabilistic techniques combined with AI, allowing students to understand and evaluate the robustness of their forecasts. These insights, grounded in theory, encourage students to think critically about the application of AI in different forecasting scenarios and understand the conditions under which such models deliver maximum accuracy.\nOne of the most impactful sections of the course is devoted to risk assessment, where students examine the role of generative AI in identifying and evaluating various financial risks. They will learn to assess risk scenarios using AI and explore different risk assessment frameworks. Theoretical underpinnings guide this exploration, covering aspects such as risk scoring, scenario simulations, and risk-adjusted returns. These topics encourage students to reflect on the traditional principles of financial risk assessment and consider how AI can enhance, support, and sometimes challenge these longstanding models. Students will gain the theoretical skills needed to not only implement these risk assessments but to evaluate the reliability and ethical implications of AI-driven risk analyses.\nA key component of this course is understanding how AI can support advanced predictive analytics in finance. Students will explore machine learning and generative AI techniques, their differences, and how each contributes to predictive analytics. The course also covers hyperparameter tuning, a process critical to refining predictive models, and various techniques for improving accuracy in financial predictions. This section is theory-heavy, preparing students to deeply understand the technical complexities of these models, which can then be applied to real-world predictive scenarios, demonstrating how AI-driven forecasts can become more precise and resilient in a fluctuating financial landscape.\nIn addition, this course examines regulatory and ethical considerations inherent to using AI in finance. As AI increasingly influences decision-making processes and strategic directions in finance, regulatory frameworks and ethical implications must be carefully considered. This section provides students with a solid theoretical grounding in understanding the landscape of financial regulations, privacy concerns, and ethical challenges specific to AI. Students will discuss compliance, risk mitigation, and security issues that arise when deploying AI in financial contexts. The goal is to equip students with a robust understanding of how to navigate and manage ethical and regulatory risks, fostering a mindset that balances innovation with accountability and integrity.\nThe final sections of the course bring together many of the concepts covered earlier, including real-time data integration, automation, and AI-driven decision-making processes. Students will learn how to integrate AI recommendations into financial decisions, understand board-level AI decision models, and explore future trends in financial AI, including sustainable finance and emerging technologies. These concluding topics synthesize students’ accumulated knowledge, enabling them to comprehend the multifaceted role AI will play in the future of financial modeling. The course ultimately aims to build a comprehensive theoretical foundation, preparing students for both current and anticipated challenges and opportunities AI presents in financial modeling.",

There are numerous quizzes and practice exercises for learners to master these techniques.\n\n\nThe course is fully hands-on and practical, it covers financial analysis of real companies. It is suited for students and professionals intending to learn and master financial analysis.\n\n\nThis course is self-sufficient and can be undertaken independent of part-1 of FSA series – as it covers all concepts in details.\n\n\nDownloadable excel files are available as part of practice exercises (don't miss them).

The course covers essential topics including modeling mining operations, debt sizing and funding, and investment returns analysis, and will provide you with a robust financial modeling skillset for analysis of mining projects in the most sophisticated environments.\n\nIn an online environment, you will go from a blank Excel workbook to a financial model suitable for investment analysis, debt structuring, and operational scenario evaluation. This course will provide step-by-step instructions on how to build a financial model suitable for analyzing mining projects.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to build complex, real-life project finance models for mining projects.\n\n\nWhat This Course is About?\nProject finance models for mining are used to assess the risk-reward of lending to and investing in mining projects. The project's debt capacity, investment returns, and financial feasibility depend on expected future cash flows generated by the mining project itself and a financial model is built to analyze this.\n\nIn the Financial Modeling for Mining course, we will model complex mining project finance transactions from scratch in excel.\n\n\nYou will learn about:\nHow to build a project finance model from scratch in excel for mining projects;\nLearn how mining projects get developed and financed;\nHow to create best practice macro’s and Excel VBA codes to break circularities;\nLearn how to size debt based on multiple covenants for mining projects;\nHow to model Debt Service Reserve, Maintenance Reserve, Working Capital, and Asset Retirement Obligation Reserve Accounts;\nHow to model mini-perm debt structure with a refinancing facility;\nHow to account for financing fees during construction and operation;\nHow to incorporate tax and accounting of mining operations into the financial model (asset retirement obligation, the unit of production depreciation method, NOL carry forward expiration etc.);\nAdvanced project finance modeling concepts and accounting (flexible timing, mini-perm debt, refinancing, cash sweep, equity bridge loan);\nThis is the same comprehensive financial training used to prepare analysts and managers at top financial institutions and infrastructure funds.\n\n\nHow Does It Work?\nThe course length is over 14 hours.\n\nFirst, we will review the basics of mining project development, so we understand all essential components of mining operations and project finance transactions in the context of the mining industry.\n\nThen, in the second part, we will review financial modeling methods and excel functions that we will use often in this course, to improve our productivity in Excel.\n\nWe will begin financial modeling in the third part, where we will build a financial model for an open-pit gold project.\n\n\n\nIs This Course For You?\nYes, if you need to build, review or analyze project finance models for mining projects.\n\nTypical students include analysts, managers, senior managers, associate directors, financial advisors, financiers, and CFOs from project companies, investment banks, private equity, and infrastructure funds.\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites\nYou will need previous exposure to Excel in a financial modeling context and basic knowledge of investment concepts such as NPV and IRR.",

      "description": "Variance analysis is an important part of any profession related to finance. Companies constantly measure their actual results against plans, forecasts, past periods, competitors, etc. Such comparisons inevitably lead to differences and deviations that need to be explained. These deviations are most often related to the elements of the Profit & Loss report (P&L) and Cashflow compared with Plan and Previous year.\nAt first glance this is a purely technical exercise, however actually variance analysis has a significant impact on the management of the organization and the quality of decisions made. A high-quality variance analysis allows to answer such questions as:\n- WHAT happened?\n- WHY did that happen?\n- HOW does this affect the future?\nThe last question obviously leads to the need to develop tactical solutions or refine the strategy\nHaving mastered the skills of variance analysis, a financial specialist will be able to go beyond the technical role of a \"calculator\", become a business partner in his/her area of responsibility and make a significant contribution to business decision-making\nDuring this course, you will learn how to conduct a variance analysis of:\n- absolute values (revenue/cost/gross profit/net profit, etc.)\n- relative measures (average price per 1 kg; cost per 1m, etc.)\n- measures expressed as a % (% of gross/net profit)\n- mix of various kinds (geography, products, customers, SKUs, ingredients of the recipe, etc.)\n- total P&L from Revenue to Net earnings, as well as visualize the result using the Waterfall chart\n\n\nThe course is of particular value for employees of companies with a wide range of raw materials, semi-finished products and finished products (manufacturing and retail)",

A lack of technical knowledge and basic abilities may hinder your chances of getting your ideal career and breaking into the industry, and it all starts with the interview.\nWe can relate to your anguish since we have experienced it firsthand. Motivated by a desire to see young professionals succeed, we developed this curriculum to help them navigate this challenge. The focus of this course is more specifically towards financial modeling in Excel for project finance.\nThis is not your typical course; instead, it is the result of thousands of hours of research, teaching, and practice in the classroom, workplace, and interview rooms. We have extensive experience in the project financing industry, gained while working for a variety of companies, and would be pleased to share it with you.\nAll the insider knowledge you'd normally have to pay thousands of dollars for in a company training session is included in this course.\nThe project finance sector is cumbersome & complicated from a distance; however, this course will draw you closer to understanding how you can make the sector a haven for you.",

Per unit cost is calculated by dividing total production cost by number of units produced. This method is known as ‘single costing’ as industries adopting this method manufacture, in most cases, a single variety of product. This method is also known as ‘unit costing’, as not only the cost of the total output, but also the cost per unit of output is ascertained under this method. Under this method cost units are identical. This method is also called ‘output costing’, as cost is ascertained for the total output of a product. Unit Cost Accounting is such a method of cost ascertainment which is based on production unit. It is applicable where the production work is done continuously and the units are of same types or manufactured identical. Output costing is a method of costing under which there is the costing of a single product which is produced by a continuous manufacturing activity. Though under this method of costing a single variety of product is manufactured, it may vary in respect of size, grade and colour. The example of industries which make use of this method of costing are – brick, sugar, cloth, coal, cement, fisheries, food canning, quarries, plantation industries, etc. In this course, the students will learn:\nConcept of output Costing\nConstruction of Cost Sheet\nCalculation of Prime Cost\nFactory Cost\nCost of Production\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nCost of Sales\nComparative Cost Sheet\nTender Based Problems\nTypical Problems & Case Studies",

Along with the Indonesian government goals to create cashless society, mobile payments are widely used and create inclusive finance. However, the index of financial inclusion in Indonesia are still far-off to achieve 90% as targeted by Indonesian President, Mr. Joko Widodo. Therefore, it is interesting to understand how mobile payment may impact on the financial inclusion. We focused on the characteristics of mobile payment, along with financial literacy, as the determinants of financial inclusion.\nIn this course, the student will have broader practical knowledge on how mobile payment could create inclusive finance, especially on the millennials’ point of view because it is prepared based on research survey. To have a better understanding, the course is divided into two main parts, which are theory (fundamental knowledge of variables used) and research practice (conducted financial inclusion research).\nThe students could accomplish this course in ±45 minutes and required to answer the quiz as the assessment of this course. Once the students complete this course, they will be able to understand how important the function of financial technology and financial literacy in promoting financial inclusion. Knowledge about conducting research will also be acquired by the students.",

This course will help those who are interested to learn the framework of managerial financial statements. The balance sheet, Income and Cash flow statements are explained here from the management and owners' point view. This knowledge would be especially useful  not so much for academic purposes but mainly for business practices.\nBefore we begin, It would make sense to clarify the difference between managerial and external financial statements.\nManagerial Financial Statements\nThe main purpose of Managerial financial statements is to provide owners and managers with timely, reliable information about business performance for decision making in the most convenient and useful format.\nExternal Financial Statements\nExternal financial statements are those distributed outside of the company's management. The usual recipients of this information are government agencies, banks and other external institutions. These statements are quite strictly regulated by national legislation and international accounting standards which is not always best suitable and convenient for management purposes.\nWe focus on Managerial Finance in this course.\nAt first, I am going to challenge your understanding  of Net Profit. Please check your confidence, knowledge and intuition at the start of this course. You can rely on your common management sense, but not only on accounting rules. Sometimes it works even better.",

However how does that increased volume impact capacity, working capital and cash flow? Is the decision you are making financially viable across the flow of the interlinking business operations?\nThis non-academic course provides easy, common sense answers and simple formulas to equip you to make more enlightened decisions for increasing the wealth of your shareholders and to be more informed for snappy decisions in those planning meetings. It delivers both breadth and depth of business understanding within four hours!\nThe last module provides guidelines for budgeting and monitoring variances against budgets.\nAll in all a practical, non-academic finance course for practical managers.\nThe strength of the course is in the approach, content and delivery method divided into ten modules amounting to about four hours of absorbing, self-paced learning, including the exercises at the end of each module.\nFor fast tracking your business knowledge and deepening your understanding of business operations \"How much must we sell?\" delivers the goods.",

They seemed too big, too cumbersome, and it just seemed like there should be a better way. Chris definitely knows what he is doing and couldn't be a better instructor. Finally I feel empowered to build a solid financial model, in less time, and with much better quality.\n\n\nAbout The Course - What You and I Learn Together\nAs an entrepreneur, you will have many uses for a budget/financial model. If you are looking for investors, one of the first things someone will ask for is your projections. As well for your own peace of mind, don't you want to be able to forecast forward and see how the business will perform given a set of assumptions? All of this can be accomplished with a solid financial model. Learn how to use Microsoft Excel to build your very own forecast / budget!\n\nLet me teach you how to wow investors or impress your boss with a financial model / budget that stand out above everyone else.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have a financial model that is detailed, complete, rock solid and follows ALL of the best business practices for financial modeling!\n\n\nI have also included a copy of my ebook \"Fund Your Startup by Chris Benjamin\" which you will find as a download in the last lecture.  Learn your options for funding, where to find investors, how to wow them, and lastly the must do steps to successful funding!\n\nWhat Specifically You and I Will Do In This Course:\nThis course will be taught primarily by following along in Excel as we build a financial model for a fictional company.  We will start with a completely blank Excel workbook, and by the end of the course have a fully functioning financial model.\nStudents are encouraged to take the course twice.  The first time, just follow along, understand not only the formulas, but also the \"why\" of what we are doing.  See the financial model grow and become \"alive\" as we work through the various tabs.  The second time, follow along and work on your own personal financial model.\nThe time of the course in video content is 5.5 hours, although expect to spend 10 - 20 hours taking this course.  In that time we will build a basic financial model which is fully functioning.  The additional time is so you can work on your own financial model in between the lectures.\nThe course is structured in a very step by step methodology.  As we work through each section, we'll progress towards the final financial model.\nI encourage all entrepreneurs and financially minded people alike to take the course.\n\n\nI will help you!\nAt any point during the course if you are confused or need clarification, send me a message! I'm here to help YOU the student, and I love interacting with you.  I've been in accounting & finance over 25 years and can most likely answer your question.\n\n\n*** CLICK \"BUY NOW\" AND LET ME TEACH YOU HOW TO BUILD A POWERFUL FINANCIAL BUDGET MODEL WITH EASE! ***\n\n\nAbout The Instructor\nChris Benjamin, MBA & CFO is a seasoned professional with over 25 years experience in accounting and finance.  Having spent the first 10 years of my career in corporate settings with both large and small companies, I learned a lot about the accounting process, managing accounting departments, financial reporting, external reporting to board of directors and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and working with external auditors.\n\nThe following 10+ years I decided to go into CFO Consulting, working with growing companies and bringing CFO level experience to companies.  I help implement proper best business practices in accounting and finance, consult on implementation of accounting systems, implementing accounting procedures, while also still fulfilling the CFO roll for many of my clients which includes financial reporting, auditing, working with investors, financial analysis and much more.\nThank you for signing up for this course on Udemy.

Eğitim bitişinde ''a, o da öyle miymiş?'' ''demek bu böyle yapılıyormuş..'' gibi cümleler kurmanızı sağlayacağım Tradingview inceliklerini ve kısayollarını bu eğitimde anlattım. Detaylı bir eğitim hazırladım sizler için. Piyasada çok görüyorum hiçbir grafiğe göz bile gezdirmeden pazardan armut seçer gibi ismine göre hisse seçenler, veya hasbelkader destek direnci öğrenmiş olsa da yanlış grafik türünde yanlıs araçlarla yanlış analiz yapanları... Eğer iyi bir trader veya yatırımcı olmak istiyorsanız en az bir veri sağlayıcısı üzerinde uzmanlaşmanız ve onu en verimli şekilde kullanmanız gerekmekte. Matriks ve Ideal gibi veri sağlayıcıları varken neden Tradingview deyince ise, hem ücretsiz olması dolayısıyla herkesin kolayca erişim sağlayabilmesi, hem de ücretli ve ücretsiz versiyonlarının oldukça yeterli olması, kullanıcı dostu olması, arayüzünün kolay olması gibi birçok sebep sayabilirim. Matriks ve diğer veri sağlayıcılar başka bir eğitimin konusu.\nTradingview anasayfasından, yan menülerinden, taramalar sekmesin ve grafik içi ''pine editor'' sekmesine kadar; sizlere bilmeniz gereken her şeyi anlatmaya çalıştım. Özellikle grafik ayarları kısmında grafiği tamamen kendi stilinize göre nasıl kişiselleştirebileceğinizi gösterdim. Böylece gözlerimiz ve zihnimiz yorulmadan işlemler yapabileceğiz.\n\n\nTeknik analiz tamamen görsel bir iştir. Ayarları, kısayolları ve kestirme yolları öğrendikçe analizlerimizde daha başarılı olacağımıza inanıyorum.\n\nUmarım bu eğitimden keyif alırsınız ve bilmediklerinizi öğrenirsiniz.\n\nİbrahim Demirci\nBaybars Eğitim Danışmanlık",

      "description": "This course will teach you how to use two years of historical income statement data and two years of historical balance sheet data to build a fully integrated financial statement model. It is designed for those new to financial models.\nSection 1 will introduce the accounting equation and the three primary financial statements in the context of building a financial model. The content starts with the accounting equation, which is the single most important concept in accounting. The remaining three videos introduce the financial statements one at a time with a focus on the relationships that are important as you build financial models.\nAll of the material is provided via video-driven instruction with notes in pdf format to help follow along.\nSection 2 will walk through integrating the three primary financial statements and creating a five-year projection. The first video provides a quick overview of the process. It is an easier process to grasp if thought of as a series of steps. It will also make it easier to measure progress as you work through the longer video. The video in Lecture 2 will walk you through the process of building the model cell by cell.\nBecause you are walking through the entire process of building a model, the video in Lecture 2 runs long: 35 minutes total. My advice would be to download the excel template attached to this lecture and build the model as the video progresses. Building the model yourself is the best way to fully understand the process.\nIn my opinion, if you want to build a strong financial modeling skill set, a thorough understanding of how an integrated financial statement model works is one of the most important things you can learn.\nThe last video in this section will explain circular references and how to fix broken models. It can be incredibly frustrating to finish a model and realize that it does not \"balance.\" This video will help avoid that frustration.\nI hope the content is useful to you! Please feel free to email me (peter@ASimpleModel.com) with any feedback.\nNote: The longer video has some white noise in the background that I am having edited out. I hope to have a cleaner audio file up soon. Thanks for your patience!",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nDuring many consulting projects, you will have to analyze financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flows) and draw conclusions about a specific company. This is especially true during due diligence, strategic projects, and turn-arounds. Financial analyses require a relatively good understanding of finance and accounting. Business Analysts and Management Consultants who did not study Finance or Business tend to have some problems with navigating this area. This course will help you overcome this problem. Those of you who have finished Business School or Economics will find here a great refresher with a lot of practical tips on how to do certain analyses during a consulting project.\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in finance and accounting. It is designed for people who are or want to become management consultants and businesses. In the course you will learn 5 main things:\nHow to read financial statements such as a balance sheet, an income (profit & loss) statement, cash flows\nHow to draw conclusions from financial statements\nMain principles of accounting\nHow to analyze financial indicators\nHow to estimate the value of the firm / do valuation\nI will NOT teach you everything about finance & accounting because it is simply not efficient (and frankly you don’t need it). This course is organized around the 80/20 rule and I want to teach you the most useful (from a business analyst/consultant perspective) things that will enable you to understand the financial data and analyze them.\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nAnalyzing the financial situation of the firm is a fundamental skill in consulting. It helps you understand the current situation of the firm, identify problems, and estimate potential savings. Many Management Consultants and Business Analysts did not finish Business School and sometimes struggled with some financial analyses. This sometimes puts them at a disadvantage and makes it difficult for them to get promoted. On top of that, many consultants and analysts who studied finance & accounting at university/college have forgotten some things.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students understand or refresh the essential elements of finance and accounting. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know how to understand financial statements, analyze them, and draw conclusions from them. You will also master the basics of valuation.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of finance and accounting. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those who did not finish business school or Economics.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve your knowledge of finance and accounting. There is little theory – mainly examples, and case studies with a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nHow to read financial statements such as a balance sheet, an income (profit & loss) statement, cash flows\nHow to draw conclusions from financial statements\nMain principles of accounting\nHow to analyze financial indicators\nHow to estimate the value of the firm / do valuation\nYou can also ask me questions through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course. I will show you here what you can expect from this course and how it is organized\nProfit & Loss statement. In the second section, I will concentrate on the first financial statement the income statement often called the profit & loss statement (P&L). I will show you step by step all the elements of the profit and loss statement. We will also look at examples of P&Ls for firms like Amazon, Disney, P&G, and LPP. We will devote a lot of time to depreciation and amortization\nModeling of Profit & Loss Statement for FMCG Firm. In this section, I will show you an example of how to model the profit & loss statement in Excel for the FMCG business model.\nBalance Sheet. In the 4th section, I will concentrate on the second financial statement – the balance sheet. As always we will go through every element of the Balance Sheet. We will also discuss the difference between the USA and European balance sheets. We will also look at examples of balance sheets for firms like Amazon, Disney, P&G, and LPP.\nCash flow statement/statement of cash flows. In this section, I will concentrate on the last financial statement – the cash flow. I will show you step by step all elements of cash flow. We will also look at examples of cash flows for firms like Amazon, Disney, P&G, and LPP.\nFinancial analysis of indicators. In this section, we will have a look at different sets of financial indicators that you can use to analyze a firm. We will have a look at Profitability ratios, ROE Decomposition (DuPont Model), Liquidity ratios, Activity ratios, and Debt ratios. We will also calculate them for Amazon so you can see how to use those ratios in practice.\nValuation. In the last section, we will discuss different methods of evaluating the firm (estimating its valuation). We will have a look at the DCF methods as well as the Multiplier methods. We will use a case study to see how these methods work in practice.\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nAnalyze the financial statements of a firm, especially income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows\nCreate a model of profit and loss statement (income statement) in Excel\nAnalyze in Excel financial indicators and draw conclusions from that\nEstimate the value of a firm using DCF and multiplier method\nYou will understand the main difference between financial statements in the USA and Europe\nYou will master the main bookkeeping/accounting principles\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness Analysts\nStartups founders\nManagers\nStudents who did not finish business school\nStudents who want to refresh their knowledge about Finance & Accounting",

      "description": "An independent review is a type of assurance engagement that offers a different level of assurance compared to a traditional audit. While an auditor provides reasonable assurance on the accuracy of annual financial statements, in an independent review, the assurance provided is limited. This means that while a review involves a thorough examination of financial statements, including inquiries and analytical procedures, the depth of scrutiny is not as extensive as in an audit. Independent reviews are often chosen by entities seeking a less costly alternative to an audit or where regulatory requirements permit a lower level of assurance.\n\n\nTopics Discussed:\nRegulatory framework – Companies Act (Act 71 of 2008)\nReview engagements- basics\nKey differences between Independent reviews and Audit engagements.\nNature of review engagements\nAccepting review engagements\nPlanning the review engagement\nSetting materiality\nReview procedures\nDocumentation and evaluation of results\nReportable irregularity\nConclusion and reporting\n\nThe Presenter:\nDaniel van Tonder\nI completed my B- Compt degree in Financial Accounting while I was still busy with my articles at Diemont, Zimmerman & Bolink Auditors in Polokwane.\n\nAfter my articles, I entered the private sector to gain valuable experience as a Group Finance manager and Group Internal Tax Practitioner.\n\nI'm currently busy with my post graduate diploma in taxation through Unisa.\nI am a registered tax practitioner and a proud member of the South African Institute of Taxation.",

      "description": "This course combines the right mix of programming concepts with Python, Mathematical Modelling, Quantitative Finance and Machine Learning. This course is divided into four parts.\nPart one covers the essentials of python programming. This includes basic printing, data types, branching and iteration. This part also covers key topics like tuples, mutability, functions, recursion, classes and concepts of  object oriented programming. This part culminates with a capstone project, wherein we would build a financial model to calculate mortgage payments.\nPart two covers python and mathematics for finance. This part entails two capstone projects which would cover detailed modelling of options using the Black-Scholes Model and detailed modelling of valuation of bond instruments. This part clearly explain all the basic math concepts required for finance in a theoretical (white board fashion) and each concept session is followed by a hands-on lab session in python. The topics covered are exponential functions, logarithmic functions, Log-normal functions. There is also a special bonus session on modelling of options Greeks\nPart three covers stochastic modelling for finance. This part is key for quantitative finance and we give a solid foundational understanding of the key concepts of stochastic finance. There is an exclusive and exhaustive coverage of Monte Carlo simulation techniques for Finance and its application by means of estimation of stock price and options price. Other topics covered are Random Walk Modelling, Geometric Brownian process simulation, Calculation of Pi using Monte Carlo Simulation.\nPart four covers machine learning for finance . In this part , students would learn technical analysis of stocks with candlestick and  OHLC charts, prediction of stock prices using advanced machine learning algorithms and real time market research.\nThis course covers mathematics of finance in detail. The USP of the course is that each concept is explained in a theoretical fashion (using a digital white board) and is immediately followed by a hands-on lab session. This powerful combination would ensure that the students learn the concepts very well.\nImportant concepts of python programming , mathematics and finance are explained in a way with which the student would have absolute clarity. Hard core coding in Python is involved,  wherein the mathematical models are designed using user defined custom functions and not consumed from standard libraries. The student gets to learn the nuts and bolts of model creation in python.",

It allows one to code expert advisors with even lesser lines of code, through object-oriented programming. Less time coding, more time for learning and trading.\nBy the end of this course, students would be able to code expert advisors from a higher level of abstraction than what procedural programming can possibly offer. Through the use of class files, one would be able to create a new expert advisor with just several lines of code. One will no longer have to build everything from scratch--build complex expert advisors with less code.\nThis is programming course is aimed at making the life of the trader easier by enabling one to develop his or her own MQL5 programs, and augment his or her trading skills through automation. It also allows the trader to execute trading rules and tasks that can be cumbersome or time-consuming when executed manually.",

      "description": "PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Practice Test Course\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nYou are developing a Power BI dashboard for your company's retail stores, using a dataset with a \"Store\" table containing location information. You plan to create a map visual that will show store locations and provide the ability to drill down from Country to State/Province to City. What should you do to ensure that the locations are mapped properly?\nA. Change the data type of City, State/Province, and Country.\nB. Set Summarization for City, State/Province, and Country to Don't summarize.\nC. Set the data category of City, State/Province, and Country.\nD. Create a calculated column that concatenates the values in City, State/Province, and Country.\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is C. Setting the data category of City, State/Province, and Country is crucial for Power BI to correctly interpret these fields as geographical locations.  Data categorization tells Power BI the *type* of data within a column (e.g., city, state, country). This is distinct from the *data type* (e.g., text, number, date).  While the data type of these fields might be text, the data *category* needs to be set to the appropriate geographic type (City, State/Province, Country) so Power BI's mapping visuals can understand and use the data.  Options A and B are incorrect because changing the data type or setting summarization doesn't provide the necessary geographic context. Option D is incorrect because concatenating the fields is not required and would make it more difficult for Power BI to parse the individual location components.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nYour company's HR department needs a Power BI report to visualize employee hierarchy levels. You have a Power BI model that contains an Employee table with manager relationships defined in the ParentEmployeeID column, leading up to the CEO. You need to create a calculated column that returns the count of levels from each employee to the CEO. Which DAX expression should you use?\nA. PATHLENGTH(PATH(Employee[EmployeeID],Employee[ParentEmployeeID]))\nB. PATHITEM(PATH(Employee[EmployeeID],Employee[ParentEmployeeID]),1,INTEGER)\nC. PATHCONTAINS(PATH(Employee[EmployeeID],Employee[ParentEmployeeID]),1)\nD. PATH(Employee[EmployeeID],Employee[ParentEmployeeID])\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nThe correct DAX expression is `PATHLENGTH(PATH(Employee[EmployeeID],Employee[ParentEmployeeID]))`. The `PATH` function constructs a string representing the hierarchical path from each employee to the CEO. The `PATHLENGTH` function then counts the number of levels in that path, giving the desired count of levels from each employee to the CEO.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nYou're building a three-page report in Power BI Desktop and want to create a custom tooltip page. What are the three key steps to set up this tooltip page for use?\nA. For the tooltip page, set Allow use as tooltip to On.\nB. For the target page, set Allow use as tooltip to On.\nC. Configure filters on the target visual.\nD. For the tooltip page, configure filters.\nE. Add and configure visuals on the tooltip page.\nCorrect Answer: ADE\nExplanation:\nTo create and prepare a custom tooltip page, you must first designate the page as a tooltip page (A), design the visuals that will appear in the tooltip (E), and configure any necessary filters to ensure the tooltip displays the correct contextually relevant data (D).  The \"Allow use as tooltip\" setting is applied to the tooltip page itself, not the target page where the tooltip will appear.  Filters are configured on the tooltip page to control what data it displays, not on the target visual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you ready to ace the PL-300 Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst certification?

      "description": "Thank you so much for your interest in Financial Modeling for Corporates\nI've been working closely with investment professionals, students, and financiers to unlock their deals... so that financial modeling is finally the \"solution\" they hoped for, and no longer a confusing, lengthy and stressful exercise.\nHere are a few of the things you’ll end up with\n- The .xlsx template that model building professionals use and jealously guard\n- A step by step breakdown of EXACTLY what to do at each step to build a best practice financial model\n- A company valuation and a beautifully constructed summary page\n- Literally hundreds of hours saved in figuring out how to do it yourself\nHere’s how it’ll work\nIn over 6 hours of video’s I’ll walk you through\n- Overview behind financial modeling and understanding different types of models, sources of complexity so that you can apply these skills to any model in the future\n- A shoe business case study to build up a financial model basically from scratch (minus some preformatting and labels to save you time)\n- EVERY module you’ll ever need: The Revenue, Expenses, Capex, Depreciation, Tax, Cashflow Statement, Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Summary Sheet... the list goes on\n“The gold standard” Corporate template model\nGet the .xlsx file that gives you a chance to play with a business, modeled on a real shoe business.\nBuilding a financial model is not just a tick box exercise. It is a system for thinking through major decisions and helping you better understand a business.\nBuilding a best practice model is about 50 different things done well. It doesn’t matter if you’re the worlds smartest person, you’ll never figure it out on your own.\nWhy you should create a financial model for a corporate? A well-built financial model can help you to\n1. Value a company or an asset for an M&A transaction\n2. Plan for cash surpluses or shortages (ahem…call your bank!)\n3. Run scenarios to inform Corporate Strategy\n4. Test your assumptions\n5. Much much more…\nWhat will I be able to do after taking your course?\nYou’ll be able to build a gold standard best practice model that will serve a range of functions… follow the courses, do the material, and you’ll be able to knock the socks off recruiters, VP’s and your bosses in the following industries\n- Corporate Finance\n- Private Equity\n- Equity Analysis\n- Financial Planning & Analysis\n- Investment Banking\nWhy learn from me?\nOver the last 6 years, I’ve trained over one hundred live financial modeling courses, each course a full 2-3 days. To an audience of Wall St bankers, London Corporates, Dubai Private Equity Funds… and a mix in Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland… the list goes on. I know the issues my students experience, and I know where people get stuck. Every problem that you have – chances are I’ve seen it many many times. My passion is teaching people useful skills in as short a time as possible. I’m here to help you along the way.\nWhen I wasn’t training, I built models in that time, recently for a Californian Green Energy fund with over $2bn invested, the World Bank, and ran debt and equity processes. Trust me – it’s a lot easier to run every different combination and permutation of numbers when the model is well built!\nThe $2500 live courses I taught covered a fraction of the material I’m covering here – simply because you can’t fit this much learning into two days.\nWhat if I don't have any finance or Excel background?\nMost people spend years trying to figure out how to fit a model together. Most never figure it out.\nWith this blueprint template that helped me to put together hundreds of financial models, combined with extensive videos, you'll cut years off the learning curve too. Everything that you will need to do to build a model from scratch – I will demo for you, talk you through, explain, and even have pop-ups on the screen that you wouldn’t get in a live course. Financial modeling becomes a lot more fun when you have this.\nI want to do a live course; how do I do that?\nLive courses are great, you get the a added benefit of rubbing shoulders with likeminded people. You don’t, however, get the benefit of doing them again and again like an online course, with all the additional detail that comes along.\nI’m not currently running live courses, but I can recommend former colleagues etc who run great live courses. Email me if you’re interested.\nWhy a shoe business case study?\nThe case study models the North American arm of a (real) industry-leading shoe business.  Why? Everyone knows shoes – it’s not super complex to understand. Additionally, it's a relatively stable industry.\nHow does this translate to other financial modeling uses (project finance, start-ups)\n70-80% of a well-built model has the same functionality. This doesn’t cover project finance specific metrics, funding structures etc. This is geared to cover a corporate which is a stable business.\nOK, so how do I get a spot?\nClick the \"Buy Now\" button at the side of this page to get started with me now.\nThe sooner you get in, the sooner you start figuring out financial modeling and learning a skill set which will last you a lifetime.\nWith a whole lot of excitement for you,\nKyle Chaning-Pearce\nP.S. If you’re on the fence\nMay I make a suggestion?\nDon't make a decision now. Put the template to the test and try it for 30 days. Go through the model and have a play with it. Go through the videos to understand how the jigsaw of the underlying business fits together.\nFeel what it feels like to have a done-for-you model at your fingertips.\nSee what it looks like when everything comes together in one model\nGet used to crystal clear explanations.\nIf after 30 days it isn't everything I've promised and more, let me know and Udemy will refund every penny.",

Find him @SymonHe.\nArun Mohan - 5 Stars\n“The experience was an enlightening one as I was a novice in Finance and Excel and this Class was best fit for me. I could understand everything as the instructor took time to explain at a good pace and patiently introduced excel as well as accounting methods. Looking forward to getting acquainted with more of Finance.”\nEthan Wong - 5 Stars\n“The course was designed very well, with clear explanations of the topic matter. Having the instructor show you everything step-by-step was very useful for learning. Also, having the excel spreadsheets to practice on was perhaps the most useful thing for me.”\nThere are THREE things you need to do in order to learn financial modeling:\n\n\n1.         You need to understand the key concepts of Finance\n2.         You need to understand the relevant features & techniques in Excel\n3.         You need to be able to put both of those together in practice.\nYou're reading this because you have an interest in learning financial modeling for your work or a desire to get into corporate finance.\nWe did too many years ago.\nBut when we first started out, we wasted a lot of time and effort learning useless and unnecessary information and techniques.\nIt didn't have to be as painful and time-consuming as it was.\nThat's why we created this course,  so you can avoid making the same mistakes that we made and learn financial modeling fast with no wasted effort.\nYou DON’T have to learn everything about finance or Excel to become proficient at financial modeling.\nYou just need to know the RIGHT concepts and the RIGHT tools in each to get started.\nNow why should you learn from us?\nI’m proud to say that I have an MBA from Stanford University and have worked on many commercial real estate properties across a dozen asset types in multiple markets. I even helped create the underwriting standards for a 2000-store private restaurant chain, helping them open new locations around the world.\nAnd as a licensed broker and real estate consultant, I've helped many private clients with locating, evaluating, and structuring investment opportunities including multi-million dollar commercial property acquisitions and 1031 exchanges.\nMy co-instructor, Brandon Young, has a Masters in Real Estate Finance & Development from the University of North Carolina Charlotte as well as a Masters in Finance from Tulane University. He has over a decade of combined financial and real estate experience, including acquisitions and development.\nWe've been living and breathing in financial models for practically our entire careers.\nAndrés Soto - 5 Stars\n“A really good course for beginners. Right now I understand everything.”\n\n\nHenry Taatjes - 5 Stars\n\"great instructors, great content”\n\n\nBrady Burba - 5 Stars\n“After reaching this point I see the training is going deeper into Excel and how to utilize the many tools and formulas Excel offers, without training on topics that are not relevant to my needs. Thank you!”\nWhat if I don't have any Finance or Excel background?\nNo worries! This is an introductory course and it assumes ZERO prior knowledge or experience.  It is condensed because we've curated only the most relevant and useful topics to get you going fast.\nWhat will I be able to do after I take your course?\nAfter taking our course, you will be:\n•           Able to confidently speak to key finance, accounting, and modeling concepts\n•           Able to use over a dozen of the most useful Excel features & techniques\n•           Able to construct three distinct financial models from scratch\nWhat’s with the lemonade stand?\nLearning Excel or finance on their own is tough enough, and learning them at the same time can be extra challenging.  To further muddy the waters by asking students to learn an arbitrary business model would be unnecessarily confusing and a waste of time.\n\n\nBut even with a simple business model such as a lemonade stand, you'll be surprised by how complex and sophisticated the analysis can become.\nWhat’s holding you back?\nAre you afraid this course won’t work?  I promise you it will.\nAre you afraid this course will work and you’ll actually have to start investing? I think that’s a pretty good problem to have.\nAre you afraid it will take time and effort? It will. Real estate isn’t an easy business, if it was everyone would do it. But if you put in the work I promise you’ll see results.\nBest of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for.\nSo go ahead, sign up and let’s get to work right away!",

      "description": "Welcome to Forecasting Cryptocurrency Market with Prophet, Time Series & Machine Learning course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualization on cryptocurrency market dataset. This course will be focusing mainly on forecasting cryptocurrency prices using three different forecasting models, those are Prophet, time series decomposition, and machine learning particularly we are going to be utilizing Random Forest and XGBoost. Regarding programming language, we are going to use Python alongside with several libraries like Pandas for performing data modeling, Numpy for performing complex calculations, Matplotlib for visualizing the data, and TensorFlow which is an open-source machine learning library used for building and training various deep learning models. Meanwhile, for the data source, we are going to download the crypto market dataset from Kaggle. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of cryptocurrency market forecasting, such as getting to know the crypto market characteristics and forecasting models that will be used. Then, continue by learning the basic mathematics behind prophet model and time series decomposition where you will be guided step by step on how to analyze case study and perform basic calculation. This session is intended to prepare your knowledge and understanding before implementing these models in the forecasting project. Afterward, you will also learn several factors which can potentially impact the cryptocurrency market, such as liquidity, market cap, transaction volume, and circulating supply. Once you’ve learnt all necessary knowledge about crypto market forecasting, we will begin the project, firstly you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab since we are going to use it as the IDE in this project, then you will also learn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle. After preparing the IDE and datasets, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will be consisted of three parts, the first one is forecasting cryptocurrency market using Prophet model, the second one is forecasting cryptocurrency market using time series decomposition model, meanwhile, the third one is forecasting cryptocurrency market using machine learning models specifically Random Forest and XGBoost. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will also learn how to perform model evaluations to assess the accuracy and quality of your forecasting model.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn to forecast the crypto market? Is it going to be accurate? Well, there are many answers to those questions. Firstly, both cryptocurrency and big data technology have advanced very rapidly in the past few years, therefore, combining both sounds like a brilliant idea. In addition to that, integrating big data technology especially machine learning and time series will enable us to make more accurate data driven based predictions. Not only that, identifying patterns and trends from the historical data can be used as a good indicator to forecast what will happen in the future. Nonetheless, no matter how advanced or accurate your forecasting model is, you still need to be aware that there is no such thing as 100% accuracy when it comes to forecasting. Last but not least, learning how to forecast can be very valuable knowledge and skill sets since you will be able to implement the same exact concept to other markets like stock market, commodity market, or even real estate market.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\nLearn basic fundamentals of cryptocurrency market forecasting, such as getting to know crypto market characteristics and forecasting models that will be used\nLearn math and logics behind prophet forecasting model, such as getting to know trend factor, seasonality component, and holiday component\nLearn math and logics behind time series decomposition model, such as getting to know trend component, seasonal component, and residual component\nLearn how to split dataset using Random Forest algorithm and learn how to calculate Gini Impurity\nLearn several factors that can potentially impact cryptocurrency market, such as circulating supply, transaction volume, liquidity, market cap, and security\nLearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\nLearn how to upload data to Google Colab Studio\nLearn how to clean datasets from missing values and duplicate values\nLearn how to detect outliers in the dataset\nLearn how to analyse and visualise daily and annual price volatility\nLearn how to detect market trend and calculate moving average\nLearn how to find correlation between price and volume using TensorFlow\nLearn how to build forecasting model using Prophet\nLearn how to build forecasting model using time series decomposition\nLearn how to build forecasting model using machine learning, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost algorithm\nLearn how to evaluate the accuracy and quality of the forecasting models using prediction interval coverage, component analysis, and feature importance analysis\nAdditional Projects\nAnalyzing Market Sentiment Using Spacy\nIn this project, you'll use Spacy, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) library, to analyze market sentiment by processing and understanding text data. By analyzing financial news, social media, and other sources of market-related text, you can determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral, helping you make informed decisions based on market psychology.\nForecasting Price Using Support Vector Regression (SVR)\nIn this project, you'll apply Support Vector Regression (SVR), a machine learning algorithm, to forecast prices based on historical data. SVR is particularly useful for predicting continuous values, like stock prices or market trends, by finding the optimal hyperplane that best fits the data and minimizes prediction errors, helping you make data-driven price forecasts.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in creating business models in Excel for traditional offline businesses such as Retail, B2C services, and products, and B2B services, and products. It is designed for those who want to become consultants, business analysts, and people who need to be able to analyze any business in Excel. In the course you will learn 4 things:\nWhat your business model is about, what to concentrate on and what are the most important KPIs for you?\nHow to translate your business model into Excel and evaluate it?\nHow to draw conclusions using your business model in Excel?\nEstimate  the impact of specific changes that you may consider in your business\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nMost consultants and business analysts struggle with building business models in Excel as it requires a mixture of knowledge about the business, some fluency in simplification, and presentation in Excel of the logic behind the business. By training in modeling your business in Excel, you gain in-depth knowledge about your business and you can spot faster the links between seemingly unrelated issues. This course is designed to fill in the gaps and turn you into an expert in business modeling. I strongly recommend this course to people who want to be in charge of their business as it will empower you to move your business forward.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to build or to find improvements in any business you should master techniques related to modeling the business in Excel. That is why I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or business analysts who have to advise their customers but also to owners, founders of businesses as well as investment directors.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you analyze and create business models in Excel. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to build the model in Excel for your business\nHow to identify important issues for your business and how to reflect them in Excel\nHow to find ways in which you can significantly increase the value of the business\nHow to calculate the impact of proposed changes in Excel\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on production\nRetail. In the second section, I will discuss the business model of Retailers. I will show you the main challenges they are facing, KPIs that matter in Retail, and examples of companies. Since more and more Retailers operate also online I will also show you the details of the e-commerce business model. I will show you how to model traditional retail as well as e-commerce in Excel\nB2C  Services. In this section, I will discuss the business model of B2C services i.e. hairdressers, restaurant chains, plumbers, electricians, etc. I will show you the main challenges they are facing, the KPIs that matter in B2C service, and examples of companies. We will go into more detail when it comes to restaurant chains and I will show you how to model them in Excel.\nB2B Services. Next, we will move on to the business model of B2B services. They behave a little bit differently than the B2C service. I will show you the main challenges they are facing, the KPIs that matter in B2C service, and examples of companies. In the end, I will show you how to model a consulting business in Excel.\nFMCG. In this section, we will move to products. The first one to be discussed is FMCG products. I will show you the main challenges they are facing, the KPIs that matter in B2C service, and examples of companies. As an example, I will show you how to model in the Excel Cosmetics business.\nCommodity. On the other scale are products for which the brand is not that important and that are simply selling well-known,  not differentiated products. I will show you the main challenges they are facing, the KPIs that matter in B2C service, and examples of companies. As an example, I will show you how to model in Excel production of plywood\nI will be adding new sections and lectures in the coming months\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nModels in Excel shown in lectures\nLinks to books worth reading\nPresentations of different business models\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to\nPick the right business model for their business idea\nYou will understand what is important in your business\nYou will know what KPI you should look at and what are the benchmarks\nYou will be able to write down your business model in the form of an Excel model and draw conclusions from it\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness analysts\nInvestment Directors\nSmall and medium business owners\nStartups founders\nControllers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

      "description": "Course Objective\nIn an online environment, you will build a financial model suitable for advanced analysis of tax equity flip structures for wind and solar projects.\n\nThis course will provide step-by-step instructions on how to size tax equity investment, back-leverage loan, and how to estimate the sponsor's equity return.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to build complex, real-life project finance models to analyze tax equity flip structures.\n\n\nWhat This Course is About?\nProject finance models are used to assess the risk-reward of lending to and investing in an infrastructure project. The project's debt capacity, valuation and financial feasibility depend on expected future cash flows generated by the project and a financial model is built to analyze this. In the tax equity flip structures, there is additional complexity related to the IRS tax rules that have to be reflected in the financial model. On top of that, we have to be able to correctly size the back-leverage debt in the downside scenario, taking into account and reflecting the tax equity's seniority in the financial model.\n\nIn this course, we will model a complex tax equity flip structure for wind and solar projects in excel.\nYou will learn about:\nHow renewable projects are financed;\nHow to create best practice macro’s and Excel VBA codes to break circularities;\nHow to size debt based on multiple covenants for wind and solar projects;\nhow to create best practice macro’s and VBA codes to break circularities\nHow to model the allocations of tax benefits between tax equity and sponsor, including modeling the capital accounts, DRO, Qualifies Income Offset provisions, and outside basis;\nHow to size tax equity investment in a yield-based flip;\nOptimize the model to achieve the requirements of lender, sponsor and tax equity investor;\nGain insights into the financial model development process, step-by-step – for a renewable energy model;\nThis is the same comprehensive financial training used to prepare analysts and managers at top financial institutions and infrastructure funds.\nHow Does It Work?\nThe course length is over 14 hours.\n\nFirst, we will review how renewable energy projects get financed, so we understand all the essential components of project finance transaction.\n\nThen, we will go over the case study and review modeling methods to improve our productivity in excel. We will then dive into building our advanced financial model. We will model the tax benefits allocation and cash distributions before adjustments between partners, which will give us the correct cash flow to the parties.\n\nNext, we will size a preliminary back-leverage loan and model the construction funding. Once we have the construction funding, we will work on the adjustments that have to be made to the tax benefits allocated to the tax equity partner. We will implement the IRS requirements in the financial model (capital accounts, DRO, Qualified Income Offset, outside basis). This will allow us to size the tax equity's investment correctly.\n\nWe will then finalize the calculations of the cash flow available for the distributions to the sponsor. We will have to incorporate the DSCR lock-up and default covenants, and debt service reserve account into the calculations of the sponsor's cash flow to get to the sponsor's IRR.\n\nNext, we will work on scenario analysis to find a tax equity transaction structure that could enhance the value of the project for the sponsor and the tax equity partner.\n\nAnd, finally, we will work on modeling the partners' equity return when the sponsor exercises his buyout option. For those, who are interested in the accounting side of the tax equity transaction, we will also include the discussion and modeling of the HLBV accounting.\nIs This Course For You?\nYes, if you need to build, review or analyse project finance models for wind and solar projects in the United States.\n\nTypical students include analysts, managers, senior managers, associate directors, financial advisors, financiers and CFOs from project companies, investment banks, private equity and infrastructure funds.\nCourse Prerequisites\nNote that this is an advanced financial modeling course, and it is expected that you know how to model the project finance models for renewable energy projects. Most of our students take our other course \"Project Finance Modeling for Renewable Energy\" before taking the advanced course.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nMost businesses on the face of it look very complicated and difficult to understand. On top of that, the competition is so fierce that you have to make decisions based on data and not on gut feeling (a very misleading creature). That’s why it’s crucial to define and understand the main drivers and metrics measuring those drivers. If you have properly defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) you can understand the mechanism behind any business, you will be able to model it in Excel and you will know how to grow it or improve it. You can also use properly defined KPIs to manage people efficiently, and give them goals aligned with your goals. That’s why I have decided to create a course solely concentrated on these KPIs.\nThis course will give you the knowledge and insight into drivers and KPIs used in different business models that can be used for understanding the business, managing it, motivating people, and improving results. The course will make your life during a consulting project much easier. If you are already a manager thanks to this course you will learn how to use the KPIs to understand and grow your business.\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in understanding and improving your business using KPIs. It is designed for management consultants and newly appointed managers who want to excel at their work. In the course you will learn 6 things:\nHow to understand the business through KPIs\nHow to use KPIs to model the business in Excel\nHow to use KPIs to manage the business\nHow to use KPIs to motivate people\nHow to use KPIs to improve the business\nWhat is a good KPI\nThe course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting companies and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest companies from Retail, FMCG, SMCG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. On many occasions, I had to optimize also businesses I was responsible for. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Sales and Marketing Directors, Operational Directors, COOs, CEOs, Investment Directors, Directors in Consulting Companies, Supply Chain Directors, Board Members, Partners in PE, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through cases, so most of the lectures are case studies showing some business problems solved in Excel. There will be also a practical guide on how to create good KPIs and a library of KPIs from different business models such as marketplace, retail, e-commerce, restaurant chain, and SaaS businesses. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels shown in the lecture so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nMany people are overwhelmed with the complexity of the businesses they have to manage or improve. During consulting projects, I have seen business analysts and management consultants struggling to understand the business fast enough to deliver value to the customer. The course will give you the knowledge and insight that will help you define KPIs and use them to understand, manage, and improve any business. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to define and use KPIs during a consulting project or as a manager. I will show you also how to use the KPIs to model businesses in Excel. This part will be useful for estimating the potential improvements that can be made by improving certain drivers measured by KPIs.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to be a great management consultant or manager you should master the art of defining and using KPIs. That is why, I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or managers that have to advise their customers but also to owners, founders of businesses as well as directors.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you define and use the KPIs or metrics. There is little theory – mainly examples, and case studies with a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nHow to understand the business through KPIs\nHow to use KPIs to model the business in Excel\nHow to use KPIs to manage the business\nHow to use KPIs to motivate people\nHow to use KPIs to improve the business\nWhat is a good KPI\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly. If needed I will create additional content as well.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course. I will show you here what you can expect from this course and how it is organized\nUnderstanding the business through KPIs. In the second section, I will show you how to use KPIs to understand different businesses. We will start by defining drivers for different businesses and on the basis of that, we will pick the right KPIs to understand those drivers. We will do it for different business models: e-commerce, the marketplace, restaurant, retail, and a SaaS business model\nUsing KPIs to model the business in Excel. In this section, I will show you how to use the KPIs to model the whole business model in Excel. This part will help you see the big picture and estimate the potential impact of the improvements on certain KPIs\nHow to use KPIs to manage? In section number 4 I will show you how to use the KPIs to manage a business. We will use them to decide how to 10x the business, how to increase profitability, decrease costs, etc.\nHow to use KPIs to motivate? In the next section, I will discuss how to use KPIs to motivate certain behaviors. We will also talk about the traps and pitfalls as well as the problems that bad KPIs can cause\nWhat is a good KPI? This section will be devoted to a little bit of theory. I will show you what a good KPI is and how to define it\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nHow to understand the business through KPIs\nHow to use KPIs to model the business in Excel\nHow to use KPIs to manage the business\nHow to use KPIs to motivate people\nHow to use KPIs to improve the business\nHow to create great, useful KPIs\nWho should take this course?

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nMany companies despite having profits still have problems with cash. In other words, they have to improve their liquidity. This topic is not widely discussed and a few management consultants, as well as managers, know how to do it in practice. Therefore, more companies die because of problems with liquidity than due to low profits. Luckily, there are a lot of techniques that will help you, in a structured way, to look for ways to generate more cash from the business.\nIn this course, I will show you different methods that you can use to improve the cash position of your business. You will learn the following things:\nHow to identify potential ways to improve your liquidity, especially quick wins\nHow to estimate in Excel how much cash you can generate from a specific solution\nHow to pick the optimal solution\nHow to prevent the firm from going bankrupt due to liquidity problems\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. We have helped numerous firms improve performance and escape bankruptcy, by using techniques and frameworks shown in this course. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange Citigroup, Cisco, IBM, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To a lot of lectures, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures, so as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modification, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy did I decide to create this course?\nMost firms and universities don’t show how to manage and improve a firm’s liquidity in practice. They concentrate on the analysis of financial statements and calculating ratios. This, unfortunately, does not prepare you for a situation in which liquidity is a huge issue. Liquidity is the second biggest reason why companies fail, so as a Management Consultant or a Manager, most likely you will come across this problem at some point.\nThis course will help you become an expert in improving the liquidity of the firm. This skill will prove very useful not only in consulting but also later on when you become a director or you move on to build your own business. By giving you exposure to real-life cases and analyses I want to improve your skills in liquidity management and liquidity improvement. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do it during performance improvement as well as turnaround projects. We want to provide you with frameworks that will open your eyes to the active management of liquidity.\nTo sum it up, the course will help you become an expert in liquidity management and liquidity improvement on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, PwC, Deloitte, EY, and other top consulting firms. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Managers, Management Consultants as well as Investment Directors working for PE, Directors, and owners/founders of businesses.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you generate new business ideas. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nHow to identify potential ways to improve your liquidity, especially quick wins\nHow to estimate in Excel how much cash you can generate from a specific solution\nHow to pick the optimal solution\nHow to prevent the firm from going bankrupt due to problems with liquidity\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided into 10 sections. Currently, you will find the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nGeneral framework. In the second section, I will show how the general framework for liquidity improvement and liquidity management. We will use it throughout the whole course.\nReduce Inventory. In this section, I will show how to generate cash by reducing inventory. Inventory in most businesses is a must if you want to sell your products and scale the business. That is why it is so vital to reduce inventory if you want to get more cash.\nReduce Receivables. In the 4th section, I discuss methods that you can use to reduce receivables. Most firms don’t sell directly, so a lot of money is tied up in receivables. Luckily, there are certain ways to lower receivables and increase cash position.\nImprove Payables. After that in the next section, we will have a look at how you can generate additional cash by improving payables. Most companies have plenty of suppliers that they have to pay for their services and goods. A lot of additional cash can be generated by optimizing the payables.\nRestructure Debt. Another way to improve the cash position is to restructure the debts you have and to make them cheaper to service or change the schedule of payments. In this section, we will discuss the general framework and we will have a look at case studies.\nImprove Margins & Revenues. Many managers forget that one of the ways to get more cash is simply to increase the margins or revenues. This may help you, under certain conditions, improve your cash position. We will discuss the main methods and we will have a look at case studies\nRevise Investment. In this section, we will have a look at how you can save cash by revising investments and picking the right ones from the point of view of your cash position.\nStrategic Moves. In some cases in order to improve the cash position of your firm you are forced to make more drastic moves. This requires a change to the strategy as well. We will discuss this issue in this section.\nCut Costs. In this section, we will have a look at how you can generate cash, and improve liquidity by reducing costs.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nUseful frameworks and techniques\nSelected analyses are shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations, articles, and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will learn to…\nHow to Conduct Liquidity Improvement Projects\nHow to find ways to improve liquidity, generate more cash\nEstimate in Excel the potential impact of different projects on the firm’s cash position\nApply the right frameworks and techniques from your management consulting toolbox\nIdentify quick wins when it comes to liquidity\nManage Cash\nConduct Investment Analyses\nRestructure Debt\nReduce Receivables & Improve Payables\nReduce Inventory\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants and Business Analysts\nManagers\nAnalysts working in Strategic Departments\nStartup Founders\nInvestment Directors\nControllers\nFinancial Directors\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

The common example of a capital budgeting decision is the decision to purchase a large piece of equipment that will impact future cash flow for multiple years.\nThe typical format of a capital budgeting decision often includes a cash out flow a time period zero, resulting in cash inflows, or reduced outflows due to increase efficiencies, over multiple years.\nBecause capital budgeting decisions impact cash flows for multiple years, time value of money concepts are used, including present value of one calculations and present value of annuity calculations.\nThe primary tools used in capital budgeting decisions are the net present value calculation (NPV) and the internal rate of return calculation (IRR). Both of these tools utilize time value of money concepts, and we will spend a lot of time with them.\nWe will also discuss the payback period calculation and the modified internal rate of return or (MIRR).",

      "description": "The aim of the course is to show delegates how to assess the feasibility of a potential LBO transaction and how to flexibly model the acquisition and leveraging of a company by private equity investors.\nDelegates will build an integrated LBO model and a value bridge, disaggregating value added/destroyed into the various components, namely – growth, margin improvement, “multiple arbitrage” and fees. We will then use the model and some leverage comparables to structure a bid and also consider a potential competing Unitranche offer from a debt fund.\nThe course is practical and pragmatic: we look at the typical mandates of Private Equity Funds and how that drives the structures of deals – their return requirements, hold periods and exit routes and very importantly, the range of opportunities that this gives to the Bank. We also review and model the full range of funding sources available to borrowers, including products like Unitranche which are a strong competitor for the more “traditional” cash flow lending structures offered by banks through A & B loans.\nSpecifically, we will:\nBuild a transaction sources and uses;\nDerive a pro forma opening balance sheet;\nOverlay a detailed pro forma financing structure on the target company comprising a mix of senior and subordinated debt. Specifically, we will model debt with PIK components such as mezzanine debt;\nReview current leverage market practices and structures – what financing is available and on what terms? Who are the Bank’s competitors? What is the significance of the different products: A& B loans, Second lien, HY, Mezzanine and Unitranche?\nExplain structural and contractual subordination and explain how they are used in creating different classes of debt and indeed how shareholder loans are used to create preferences amongst the different “equity” providers such as “rollover” equity, sweet equity and institutional funding and what, if at all, is the typical role of vendor loan notes.\nBuild an integrated forecasting model\nCalculate standard return metrics, IRRs and money multiples and investigate the operating model using RoCE;\nMeasure the contribution of different value drivers to the total return using a “value bridge” calculation\nUse the model and some leverage comparables to structure a leveraged financing for an LBO.\nAt the end of the course delegates will:\nUnderstand the drivers of leveraged buyout structures and the specific constraints of private equity funds\nUnderstand the relevance of different funding options -A & B loans,\nBe able to build and use an LBO model to assess deal feasibility\nUsing comparable transactions as a basis, be able to assess the feasibility of a deal\nAssess management incentive structures\nBe able to assess the likely competitive threat from alternative debt providers",

The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.\nWhen thinking about financing options for a corporation we can break them into the two main groups of debt financing and equity financing. This course will focus on equity financing. When considering equity financing, we can further break the financing options down into the two main categories of common stock and preferred stock, common stock being what we usually think of when considering equity financing.\nCommon stock represents company ownership. Preferred stock has features related to both debt and common stock. Preferred stockholders do not have the same voting rights as the common stockholders. However, preferred stock generally has a priority claim to dividend distributions and a priority clam upon liquidation of the company when compared to common stock.\nWe will also discuss the concepts of majority voting and cumulative voting. With regards to cumulative voting, we will consider calculations related to the number of shares required to be able to elect a certain number of board members and the calculation to determine the number of board members that can be elected given a set number of shares.\nThe concepts related to majority voting and cumulative voting may be applicable in other setting as well, including politics and not for profit organizations.",

      "description": "Excel is an excellent tool for understanding the intricacies involved in financial modeling. The aim in each section of the course is to explain the implementation of the models using Excel.\nThe models discussed in this course:\n1) Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) Option Pricing Model\nYou will learn to calculate the price of a European-style call and put option using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. This includes cases where the underlying stock pays dividend.\nAfter that, you will compute the Option Greeks: Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho for the call and put options.\n\n\n2) Binomial Option Pricing Model\nUsing VBA, you will learn to create the calculator for a European-style call and put option using the binomial option pricing model, based on Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model.\n\n\n3) Portfolio Optimization\nYou will learn to use the Solver function to find the optimal asset allocation for a portfolio of stocks. You will learn to download the stock data and import into Excel, calculate the returns, variance, covariance and Sharpe ratios.\n\n\n4) Option Implied Volatility\nYou will learn to use the Goal Seek function to find the implied volatility of a call and put option based on the market price of the options.\n\n\n5)  Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVar): Historical, Gaussian and Cornish-Fisher (NEW! Added on 4th June 2020)\nUsing a selected stock, you will learn to compute the value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) using the historical VaR and historical CVaR, Gaussian VaR and Gaussian CVaR, and Cornish-Fisher VaR and Cornish-Fisher CVaR.\n\n\n6) Optimization of VaR and Trading Liquidity Risk: Unwinding a Position Optimally (NEW! Added on 4th June 2020)\nFirst, you will learn to calculate the cost of unwinding a position by considering the market risk exposure (measured by VaR) and the cost of liquidating the position (measured by the bid-ask spread). Then, you will determine the optimal liquidation period to minimize the market risk and cost of liquidation.\n\n\nTo benefit from this course, it is advisable that you try building the models as you go through the videos.",

      "description": "Факторный анализ - это важная часть любой профессии, связанной с финансами. Компании постоянно сравнивают свои фактические результаты с планами, прогнозами, прошедшими периодами, конкурентами и так далее. Такие сравнения неизбежно приводят к разницам и отклонениям, которые нужно объяснить. Для финансистов это чаще всего отклонения элементов Отчета о финансовом результате (P&L) и ОДДС (CashFlow) от плана и прошлого года.\nТехническое, на первый взгляд, упражнение, на самом деле оказывает значительное влияние на управление организацией  и качество принимаемых решений. Ведь качественно выполненный факторный анализ позволяет найти ответы на вопросы:\n- ЧТО произошло?\n- ПОЧЕМУ это произошло?\n- КАК это повлияет на будущее?\nПоследний вопрос, очевидно, приводит к необходимости выработки тактических решений или доработки стратегии\nОвладев навыками факторного анализа, специалист финансовой сферы сможет выйти за рамки технической роли \"калькулятора\", стать бизнес-партнером в своей области ответственности и внести значительный вклад в принятие бизнес-решений\nВ рамках курса вы научитесь проводить факторный анализ:\n- абсолютных величин (выручка/себестоимость/валовая прибыль/чистая прибыль и т.д.)\n- удельных величин (средняя цена за 1 кг; себестоимость за 1м и т.д.)\n- относительных величин, выраженных через % (% валовой/чистой прибыли)\n- микса в разнообразных разрезах (география, продукты, клиенты, по SKU, ингредиентам рецептуры и т.д.)\n- всего P&L от выручки и до чистой прибыли, а также визуализировать результат с помощью каскадной диаграммы (waterfall)\nОсобую ценность курс представляет для сотрудников компаний с большим продуктовым ассортиментом и/или широкой номенклатурой сырья, полуфабрикатов и готовой продукции (производство и ритейл)",

Proses penciptaan profitabilitas ini diciptakan melalui proses strategi manajemen yang diturunkan ke berbagai fungsi organisasi seperti fungsi operasional, pemasaran, sumber daya manusia dan fungsi keuangan. Fungsi keuangan menjadi salah satu yang penting karena setiap fungsi yang lain harus dapat diterjemahkan ke dalam satuan moneter. Oleh karena itu pada akhirnya pengukuran nilai suatu perusahaan berdasarkan atar jumlah arus kas yang dihasilkan oleh perusahaan. Karena itu perencanaan dan analisa keuangan. Perencanaan aktivitas berbagai fungsi sejak awal dikaitkan dengan biaya yang akan dikeluarkan perusahaan. Dan pada saat fungsi tersebut dijalankan maka perusahaan dapat mengukur kemajuan perusahaan dengan melihat kesesuaian fungsi di lapangan dengan perencanaan yang telah dibuat sebelumnya.\nPada akhirnya terdapat tiga keputusan yang harus diambil perusahaan yaitu keputusan investasi, keputusan pendanaan hingga keputusan dividen. Berdasarkan ketiga keputusan tersebut maka langkah pertama manajemen menentukan proyek atau kegiatan yang menjadi prioritas perusahaan. Langkah kedua adalah manajemen menentukan bagaimana pembiayaan aktivitas tersebut. Langkah terakhir adalah bagaimana perusahaan akan membagikan keuntungan yang dimiliki perusahaan atau keputusan dividen.\nDengan mempelajari tiga keputusan utama perusahaan ini maka seorang investor atau orang awam dapat melihat atau mengevaluasi apakah perusahaan sudah mengambil keputusan yang tepat. Tata kelola perusahaan bukanlah sesuatu yang luar biasa tetapi justru sesuatu yang logis dan sesuai dengan akal sehat. Oleh karena itu semakin jelas manajemen menjabarkan rencana-rencananya dan semakin jelas tolak ukurnya maka semakin jelas keputusan perusahaan tersebut diukur. Di sinilah peran perencanaan dan analisa keuangan, yaitu untuk memberi panduan bagi manajemen dalam mengambil keputusan dan bagi investor untuk menilai perusahaan.",

If they collapse, the entire country eventually collapses. Every person places a significant amount of trust in the banking system. Individuals and companies turn to banks for their funding needs. A nation's ability to assemble its capital effectively depends on them.\nThis is why banks are relevant during all economic cycles and makes the banking sector one of the most profitable sectors for investment.\nAcross the globe, banks occupy a substantial portion of the overall stock market, and hence, they probably form at least some part of the investment portfolios of equity investors. And if you are talking about S&P 500 in the USA, where approx. 11% weightage is from the financial sector or an emerging market like India, where a huge 40% weightage is only from financial services; the banking sector is an important one for any financial market or portfolio.\nInvesting in banks requires a careful analysis of financial data. Checking a few general ratios is not enough and needs to be focused on the framework specifically designed to analyze the efficiency of banks.\nHowever, analyzing banks is very different compared to analyzing a Manufacturing company. Unlike non-financial firms, wherein metrics like gross margin, working-capital cycle, debt to equity, etc., are essential criteria to consider, banks altogether have different metrics. To analyze a bank's financial statements, one must first have a clear understanding of these metrics.\nThis course will guide you on how you can analyze banking stocks in a simple and easy-to-understand language.\nWhat skills will you gain by taking this course?\nIn this course, you will learn what exactly a bank is, understand banking through a bank balance sheet, how is a balance sheet balance when transactions are made, what happens to the balance sheet when customers default, and Detailed insight on Equity, Return on equity, financial instruments, REPO, fair value methodology, goodwill, deposits, etc. Basel accords and important ratios like Capital Adequacy Ratio, Gross & Net NPA. Understand the relation between NII, NIM, and NPA and other important analysis metrics.\nAfter completing this course, you can analyze any bank of your choice.\nIf you are a banking aspirant or working in the financial sector or a business or stock analyst, this course will make you a pro in banking business analysis in no time.\nSo, if this sounds pretty lucrative to you, then hurry up and enroll in this course.",

We have noticed that especially first-time startups, do not really understand their business model (which is totally understandable). That’s why it is very difficult for them to know what they should concentrate on.  Most entrepreneurs/startups have a more or less clear business idea but quite often they do not know the business models they have chosen work in practice and they end up learning it the hard way, through their own mistakes.

      "description": "Instructor Symon He hosts near daily LIVE office hours on TikTok 10:30PM PDT. Find him @SymonHe.\nReasons why you should create a financial model for your startup or small business.  A good financial model can help you:\nTest your assumptions and verify key drivers of your business\nCompare and contrast different business choices, like pricing models\nCalculate the ACTUAL amount of capital you need to startup\nCalculate your burn rate\nModel out your user growth\nModel out your expenses\nBe more prepared talking to potential investors\nAnd loads more.\nBuilding a financial model isn't just a vanity exercise. When done right, it could help you better understand your business, whether it's a startup or an existing business you're growing.\n\nBut it's not easy and there is a right way and a wrong way to go about it.\nEven if you have little to no finance background, if you're going to be starting or running a business, this is a skill you need to have.\nA good financial model is an indicator of how deeply you understand your business model and market.  But building a good one requires the right tools and the right approach.\nWe're going to show you how to do that with a wide variety of examples and exercises.  But we'll also be teaching general best practices that will help you, no matter what you'll be building your financial models for in the future.\n\n\nWhy learn from us?\nBy signing up with us, you will be learning from two highly rated instructors that have a combined student count of over 750,000 students and 100,000 reviews!\nCheck out our profiles and see that we take care of your students and deliver the goods.\nEvan has extensive startup experience and previously worked as a venture capitalist, where he evaluated 100's of startups that trying to convince him to invest in them.\nSymon also has startup experience in both tech and brick & mortar businesses. Previously he built tons of models while working in mergers and acquisitions as well as in private equity.  And he's helped dozens of startups build financial models across a dozen different business models and industries.\nTogether, we pull directly from our experience and put it in this course--in fact, two of the case studies use the ACTUAL financial models used to raise funding.  The other case studies are inspired by well known startups you're sure to recognize.\n\n\nHow is this different from Symon's Intro to Financial Modeling Course?\nThe Intro to Financial Modeling course taught by Symon He and Brandon Young is an introductory course on financial modeling that presents a general overview covering the topic and is more relevant to those who wish to explore finance as a career option or those who want to understand financial modeling in a corporate context.\nThis course is all about financial modeling for startup businesses so it's more geared towards entrepreneurs or business owners who want to better understand the key drivers of a new business.\nThere is almost zero overlap.  Even though both courses introduce a lemonade stand as an example, those examples and models are quite different as they serve very different purposes.\nWhat if I don't have any finance or Excel background?\nNo worries! This course isn't an Excel or Finance course, although you will learn a bit of both.  We focus more on the rationale and the logic of modeling specifically for startups or growing businesses, so you can take what you learn to other spreadsheet tools.\nBut it will take practice.  You won't get better just watching the videos.  That's why have lots of practice exercises and sample models for you to learn from.\nWhat will I be able to do after I take your course?\nAfter taking our course, you will be:\nAble to confidently build financial models for your startup or new business from scratch\nAble to apply the best financial modeling practices and techniques\nAble to read and understand other financial models by looking at lots of practice models and case studies\nAble to leverage financial modeling to help you make smarter choices about your business.\nAble to learn a new skill set that you can take with you for any and every business venture you take up in the future.\nWhy lemonade stand example?\nBecause learning how to model on its own is tough enough but learning it while also having to learn a new business model makes it even harder.\nBut, even with a simple business model such as a lemonade stand, you'll be surprised by how complex and sophisticated the analysis could become.\nAnd since this is all about modeling for startups and new businesses, this example is different from the one in the Intro to Financial Modeling course.\nAfter the simple lemonade example, we cover 7 distinct case studies involving different business models in different industries.\nTell me again why I should take your course?\nYou have absolutely ZERO risk.\nUdemy gives you a solid as an oak tree 30-day money back guarantee.\nSo if you've read this far, we welcome you to join us inside.",

      "description": "Financial modelling is the most important analysis tool in a company’s decision-making arsenal. This course is specifically designed to provide dealmakers, analysts and other financing professionals with the tools they would require in order to analyze any mining financial model, and prepare powerful summarization outputs upon which decisions would be made.\nThis course is ideal for fast-tracking industry professionals in their career path - teaching them to analyze existing client models and also create their own models for various applications. The material is well suited to middle-office and front-office professionals, teaching them to assess the risks of funding mining opportunities.\nThis course blends theoretical principles with real industry insights. Its bottom-up nature is designed to provide a holistic journey, from the initial construction of a model, to the final financial assessment in order to be able to make an investment decision (whether debt or equity related). This would allow participants to deeply analyze potential funding opportunities, structure tailor-made financing packages, and produce comprehensive and concise outputs which summarize bulky raw data.\nBy the end of the course you will be able to effectively construct a financial model that describes the process flow of your mining business, from raw material extraction, all the way until net profit after tax. You will learn how to itemize all cost and revenue drivers, model tax, working capital, and debt funding.\nThe concepts taught are based on years of investment banking experience, and billions of dollars worth of project financing deals in multiple jurisdictions.\nStudents would need to download the ABC Mining Financial Model (provided for free) in order to participate in the course.\nI look forward to engaging with you as the course progresses!\nPerry Fisher",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in business analysis through a series of practical cases. It is designed for people who want to become business analysts or management consultants, work in management consulting, or do a lot of business analysis at their work. It is based on my 14 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting companies and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest companies from the FMCG, SMG, and B2B sectors that I worked for.  On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained over 100 business analysts and management consultants who are now Investment Directors, Senior Analysts, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that, my courses on Udemy have already been taken by more than 315 000 students.\nI teach through cases, so most of the lectures will be case studies showing some business problems solved in Excel. I will also show you the main techniques used by Management Consultants to properly structure the business analysis. To most lectures, you will find attached  (in additional resources) the Excel shown in the Lecture, so as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nThe companies I have worked with so far as a Board Member (I am usually, Chief Restructuring Officer, VP responsible for Strategy and Development) still have a huge problem with properly analyzing intermediate and advanced issues – they are usually preoccupied with current activities and have close to no time for analysis and strategic decisions. Moreover, they do not know how to approach many subjects from an analytical point of view to make sure that they are making the right decision. Therefore, quite often they hire consultants who, in turn, lack the practical knowledge and experience. This course is my small contribution to improving both consulting as well as operational and strategic analyses in FMC, SMCG, and B2B companies, including also online models like e-commerce, SaaS, and marketplaces.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you do the analyses, as well as the quality of the conclusions coming out of the available data in your company. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience, as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that, thanks to the course, you will know:\nHow to structure business analysis so you get the right results fast?\nHow to analyze different aspects of sales, marketing, and operations?\nHow to draw conclusions from those analyses – both for current operations as well as strategic ones?\nHow to be efficient in your work as a business analyst or management consultant?\nHow to build Excel files and PowerPoint presentations so that it is understandable for you and your team, even after some time?\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?    The course is currently divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on the role of business analyst – what skills, education, and knowledge are required from you, and what are the available career paths for you\nHow to create a top-notch business analysis in 8 steps. In this section, I will show you how to structure a business analysis so you get the results you want fast.\nCeramic tiles market estimation - example of business analysis.

In this section, I will again show slowly 1 example of business analysis from the beginning to the end\nTools. In the second section, we briefly go through the main tools and concepts for business analysts. We devote some time to the most popular ones: Excel and PowerPoint\nSales & Marketing. Analyzing the market, sales activities, and efficiency, and the potential for expansion are some of the most typical tasks set for business analysts. Here, I provide you with plenty of practical, real-life examples of problems and solutions\nBusiness modeling - example of analysis. On some occasions, you analyze the whole business to see what the logic behind it is. Here, we show how to do it for some of the business models\nOperations. Quite often, business performance depends on Operational Excellence. In this section, we will show you examples of analysis from logistics, production, production planning, and other supply chain issues.\nCases for training analytical skills - Market Estimation. This section will help you train your analytical skills using the market estimation cases\nCases for training analytical skills - Sales and Marketing. This section will help you train your  analytical skills using the sales and marketing cases\nCases for training analytical skills - Strategy.

Las acciones devaluadas son aquellas acciones que deberán de subir de precio una ves que las fuerzas del mercado se den cuenta que estas acciones están devaluadas. Las fuerzas del mercado son aquellas grandes instituciones financieras, inversionistas y empresas que cuentan con grandes cantidades de capital, y por ello son los que mueven los precios de las acciones que cotizan en la bolsa.\nEstarás aprendiendo la metodología de inversión “Value investing” que se traduce al español como invertir en valor. Value investing es un método inversión que ha sido utilizado por algunos de los inversionistas mas exitosos de todos los tiempos. Por ejemplo, esta es la técnica que Warren Buffet ha utilizado en el pasado y hasta la fecha lo sigue haciendo. Warren ha ganado miles de millones de dólares con este método de inversión. Sin embargo, Value investing es un método de inversión que funciona a largo plazo y es muy diferente al “trading.”\nEn este curso estaremos construyendo un modelo financiero en el sector de sistemas y de tecnología. Estaremos utilizando este sector solo como ejemplo. Sin embargo, tu conocimiento ganado lo podrás aplicar para la construcción del mismo modelo financiero, pero utilizando cualquier otro sector. Además, aprenderás a utilizar el buscador de acciones de Zacks Investment Research para crear una lista grande de acciones que cumplen con los requisitos para la construcción del modelo.\nEntonces, ¿que estas esperando? ¡Aprende YA a encontrar acciones devaluadas!",

When it is filtered it becomes INFORMATION. This information processed becomes RELEVANT INFORMATION. This relevant information communicated in simple laymen language helps in having a meaningful conversation. However, keeping it simple is not easy. That is why this Business Finance Analyst Program (BFAP) was prepared.\nThe BFAP is designed for professionals in any field who want to be recognized as a core team member in their organisation and want to step into a higher management position by demonstrating your ability to communicate numbers after filtering and processing data, and also by making smarter profitable decisions. The course is designed to get you excited with numbers for you to analyse, interpret and most importantly communicate in simple laymen terms. BFAP will enhance your ability to decipher financial problems and elevate your analytical skills.\nAnalysing the financials of any business requires you to understand its overall health and life-cycle. You will exactly be doing that starting from reading and understanding financial statements, types of transactions, breaking down the essential models and debugging common myths about finance.\nWe dive deeper with asking 'WHERE & WHY' the business is performing poorly because of some common red flags and how to fix them. We then understand the overall picture one is required to make smarter decisions or amends to bring the business back on track.\nGet a clear grip on balance sheets, profit & loss statements, expense & assets, depreciation, financial models, break-even point, cash flow statement and all of the critical 19 ratios.\nIn the final section, you will get a bird's eye perspective on the selected business of study. This essentially allows you to take charge of your intuition based on facts to assess the health of a business. Based on your assessment, you can foray into Budgeting and Forecasting which is the last step in taking any business to the next level.\nOn completion, you will have gained enough knowledge to pull out financial data of any company to assess its past, present and future.\nTake your learning journey to the next level with BFAP!",

These practice examples cover capital allocation across investments, working cash management, manufacturing input scheduling, and inventory order management.\nThe course comes with 7 great downloadable resources, including 6 Excel financial models as well as a helpful Solver debugging PDF. You'll use these resources while working through the examples in the course but can also re-use and modify them for your own optimization needs.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will be able to manage and model any of these domains with skill and insight, and maximize profit or minimize cost accordingly.",

      "description": "Hello friends!\n\n\nAs one of the original artificial intelligence and machine learning instructors on this platform, how could I not create a course on ChatGPT?\nChatGPT and its successor, GPT-4, have already begun to change the world. People are excited about new opportunities, and terrified of the potential impacts on our society.\nThis course combines 2 of my favorite topics: AI and finance (algorithmic trading).\nThe premise of this course is simple: use ChatGPT to build a trading bot (specifically, using pairs trading which is what I was interested in at the time).\nThroughout the course, we will learn about the amazing capabilities of ChatGPT and GPT models in general, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc. We will learn about the many pitfalls of these models, and why you need to keep your guard up. These models do make mistakes, but we will learn how to deal with them. We will learn the best ways to make use of ChatGPT to help us be more efficient and productive.\nImportant consideration: Why not just ask ChatGPT yourself and forego this course? Sure, you can tell ChatGPT if you get an error and maybe it'll fix it, but that only works for syntax errors (errors that break the rules of the Python language). What you'll miss, if you don't have foundational knowledge in Python, finance, and statistics, is semantic errors (errors in logic and reasoning), because you won't even notice them in the first place. That is what it means to \"keep your guard up\", and that is one of the major lessons in this course, which I'm already seeing is very easy for people to miss!\nSo what are you waiting for? Join me now on this exciting journey! ( And maybe learn how to make some money in the process :) )\n\n\nSuggested Prerequisites:\nDecent understanding of Python and data science libraries (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas)\nBasic understanding of finance (stock prices, returns, log returns, cumulative returns)",

      "description": "Financial instruments exhibit very dynamic behavior over time. Individuals dealing with them must understand the nitty-gritty details and associated risks to maximize profit. This knowledge can come in both white-box and black-box forms. As a data science practitioner, one would be more interested in the former. Deterministic models of financial instruments are often unproductive as they fail to capture hidden factors and the resulting uncertainty that may lead to potential business losses. Conversely, stochastic methods, particularly time-dependent stochastic processes, are far more effective in this regard.\n\n\nStochastic finance encompasses techniques for modeling financial instruments through stochastic processes. It goes beyond theory, focusing on designing and implementing these models in a programming language, particularly Python. The two main objectives are forecasting an instrument's future behavior and capturing uncertainty (i.e., risks), as these help investors manage their budgets effectively. Modeling the underlying stochastic process is a standard part of the solution in both cases.\n\n\n\n\nStochastic Finance is rooted in Probability and Statistics. A solid understanding of probability, statistical estimation theory, and simulations is necessary as prerequisites. Individuals with weaker statistical backgrounds will find the lectures on Probability, Simulation, and stochastic processes in the course beneficial, as most of these foundational topics are thoroughly covered using Python code. Topics like density estimation from characteristic functions should capture learners' interest. Therefore, this course serves as a primer for learning applied statistics from a financial theory perspective, as indicated by the subtitle.\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn:\n\n\ni. Finance & basic interest theory, computation of returns\nii. Python templates for Monte Carlo simulation\niii. Fundamentals of stochastic processes and how to apply Monte Carlo simulation to generate paths\niv. Stochastic differential equation foundations and diffusion models, accompanied by an MLE-based parameter estimation framework in Python.\nv. The jump model template, supported by Ito’s Lemma and the Merton model, emphasizes parameter estimation through a density recovery method based on the characteristic function, as well as the corresponding Python implementation.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nAs a business analyst or a consultant, you will have to from time to time create financial models. They are a bit different than business models. In business models, you go into details of operations and you focus on getting the links on the KPIs. Those models are usually done for internal purposes, to manage in the right direction the business. Financial models on the other hand are more for external users. You concentrate on creating a picture of the business in a standardized, understood by everybody way. You also want to create financial statements: profit & loss statement, balance sheet statement, and cash flow statement.\nOn top of that, you use financial statements for valuation purposes.\nThe most typical situation when, as a business analyst or a consultant, you will have to prepare such a model is connected with selling or purchasing a company. You may be doing it on the sell side or on the buy side.  Financial modeling is done as a part of strategy projects, turnaround projects, and due diligence.\nI will NOT teach you everything on financial modeling because it is simply not efficient (and frankly you don’t need it). This course is organized around the 80/20 rule and I want to teach you the most useful (from a business analyst/consultant perspective) ways to go as fast as possible from rough description to working model in Excel that you can make more and more complicated.\nThe aim of this course is that you are able to do a financial model of the business as fast as possible.\nIf done properly, this course will transform you in a few days into a pretty good business analyst who knows how to create fast and efficiently financial models.\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach step by step on the basis of Excel files that will be attached to the course.  We will go through a real-life example of a business and create the financial model for it. To make the best out of the course you should follow my steps and repeat what I do with the data after every lecture. Don’t move to the next lecture if you have not done what I show in the lecture that you have gone through.\nI assume that you know basic Excel so the basic features (i.e. how to write formulas in Excel) are not explained in this course. I concentrate on intermediate and advanced solutions and purposefully get rid of some things that are advanced yet later become very inflexible and useless (i.e. naming the variables).\nTo every lecture, you will find attached  (in additional resources) the Excel shown in the Lecture so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nThis course is a part of my attempt to help business analysts and consultants gain fast useful knowledge that will help them excel at their work. I have done 10 other courses that will help you become a great business analyst or consultant. I have covered already: hacks and tricks in Excel, business modeling, market research, management productivity hacks, and others. Now you have the opportunity to learn financial modeling in Excel\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you do the analyses as well as the quality of the conclusions coming out of available in your company data. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nWhat is the difference between business models and financial models?\nHow to model cost positions and balance sheet positions?\nHow to create on the basis of these financial statements: profit and loss statement, balance sheet statement, and cash flow statements\nHow to make sure that there is integrity in the model?\nWhat analyses and conclusions you can draw from the financial model?\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into 10 sections and will be adding new sections to address other important issues. Currently, you will find the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course\nModeling of Profit & Loss account. In this section, we start by showing how to model cost positions (except for Depreciation)and how to create on the basis of this, a profit & loss statement\nCapex and Depreciation.  Capex and Depreciation are some of the most difficult elements that you will model in Excel. Therefore, we have created a separate section devoted just to this subject. In this section, you will learn how to follow specific groups of assets, track their gross and net value, and calculate depreciation.\nWorking Capital. Working capital is crucial to the business as it defines how much money you have to have engaged in the business. I will show you how to model specific positions of Working Capital\nDebt.  You may need external sources of financing for the company. I will show you how to model loans and get the necessary info to create a balance sheet later.\nEquity. In this section, I will show you how to model equity and all relations with shareholders\nBalance sheet modeling. Here we get everything together to model the balance sheet statement.\nCash flow modeling.  Here we get everything together to model the cash flow statement.  Here we will check the integrity of the model as well.\nAnalyses of the Financial Model.  In the end, on the basis of a ready model, I will try to draw conclusions that will show us whether the business we have been analyzing is interesting or not\nValuation. In this section, I will show you the main valuation methods. We will look at DCF and the Multiplier method\nBusiness modeling. In many cases, you will have no time to do a full financial model. In such situations, you may resort to creating a business model. A business model will usually have only a P&L statement. In some cases also simplified the Cash Flow statement. In this section, we will see how you can create such models. You can also get access to more than 30 models. You will see how to model e-commerce, marketplace, real estate, subscription businesses, and many more.\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nYou will master financial modeling in Excel at the needed for a business analyst and consultant level\nUnderstand the main challenges in financial modeling\nPerform the analyses of the financial model\nYou will get a ready model that you can utilize for your purposes\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nBusiness analysts\nResearchers\nControllers\nConsultants\nSmall and medium business owners\nStartups founders\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

      "description": "Employees are asking for a raise. A key supplier needs a commitment. A customer wants reassurance. You need to raise funds—fast!\nNo matter what role you’re in—whether you’re managing a team, running a business, or leading a department—financial statements hold the insights you need to make smart decisions.\nSure, you can ask an accountant to explain the numbers. But here’s the thing: that accountant might not understand the specifics of your industry.\nThe truth is, you don’t need to be an accountant to do your job well. But you do need to know how to read and use financial information. The good news? You can learn to understand financial statements yourself—and apply them more effectively than someone who doesn’t know your business as well as you do.\nI’m Dr. Eric Knight, I am a CPA with over 20 years’ experience in business and academics. I’ve designed this course to explain financials in a thorough but straightforward manner without the complexities. You’ll be introduced to the financial statement information. Then, you learn how to analyze financial statements. I’m not just going to provide formulas but I’ll explain why you need the ratios and how to apply them to a business. I’ll demonstrate using real-world company data to see the story of the business behind the financial information. We’ll see where managers could exploit flexibility so we don’t have any misunderstandings.\nIn addition to case studies and examples, you can test your knowledge with quizzes and discussion questions that offer an opportunity to apply the information to your field.\nWhatever field you are in, make understanding financial statements your superpower!\n\n\nWhy we analyze financial statements\nFinancial statements may be prepared by accountants—but they’re not just for accountants.\nThey’re for managers, investors, lenders, and decision-makers like you. So who uses financial statements, and what exactly are they looking for?\nIn this lesson, we’ll break it all down. You’ll learn who relies on financial data, why they need it, and how financial statement analysis helps turn raw numbers into smart decisions.\n\n\nGAAP - The Rules\nTo truly understand financial statements, you need to understand the rules behind them—rules known as GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).\nIn this lesson, we’ll explore where these rules come from, who creates and enforces them, and why they matter. We’ll also look at how management interacts with financial reporting—and the incentives that can shape what gets reported and how.\n\n\nTiming is everything\nRevenue drives business decisions, and profitability is what owners and investors watch closely. But here’s the catch: there’s more than one way to measure profit.\nYes, profit isn’t as absolute as it seems. In this lesson, we’ll break down how timing, recognition, and accounting choices impact reported income—and why it’s crucial for anyone using financial statements to understand how these figures are determined.\n\n\nEarnings Management\nIdeally, financial statements should reflect the true health of a business. But managers often have strong incentives to present their company in the best possible light.\nBecause GAAP allows for some flexibility in its application, this opens the door to Earnings Management—strategic choices in reporting that influence how financial results appear. In this lesson, we’ll unpack what that means, how it’s done, and what to watch for.\n\n\nBalance Sheet Part 1\nLet's take a closer look at the financial statements. In this lesson we'll begin with an overview of the two key statements used in business. The balance sheet and income statement. As important as knowing what is included on the statements, is understanding how the value of each element was derived. This lesson begins with a closer look at current assets.\n\n\nBalance Sheet Part 2\nWe continue to unravel the mysteries of the balance sheet in our lesson. One of the most misunderstood accounting concepts is depreciation. We'll discuss how property and equipment is valued first. Then we discuss what depreciation really is and what it is not. By the end of the lesson, we'll understand book value.\n\n\nBalance Sheet Part 3\nOur journey through the balance sheet continues with intangibles and onward to the liabilities. Who knew the balance sheet could provide so much information on a business? The lesson ends with an overview of corporate bonds.\n\n\nStatement of Cash Flows\nWe finally finish up with the balance sheet and move on to the Statement of Cash Flows. Cash is the most important current asset a business has. Without cash the business cannot pay employees or vendors. So how that cash is derived gives the financial statement analyst important information. This lesson takes us through the Statement of Cash Flows while explaining the implications of cash to the organization.\n\n\nTime Series\nThe objective of the financial statements are to provide external users with a window into the company. But do we understand what we see in that window? Let's begin understanding the financial statements by using time series analysis. This lesson starts explaining how to analyze a business using the financial statements.\n\n\nRatios\nRatios provide analysts with tools to develop deeper understanding of the financial statements. Ratios can help us to determine risk and get a feel for management's performance. In this lesson we learn ratios that can evaluate profitability, liquidity and solvency of an organization.\n\n\nApplying Ratios\nIn a previous lessee we began our journey towards understanding ratios. In this lesson we take the next step. We use those ratios on real companies that actually exist. We'll analyze real numbers from Lowe's, Home Depot, Pepsi, Coca Cola, and Monster to see how using ratios can tell us a story about the operations of management.\n\n\nValuation\nWhat is a business worth? Is it the buildings and equipment the company has? Is it the value of the employees? Is it the earnings power? Determining value is not as easy as one might thing. In this lesson we'll dive into this idea of valuation.\n\n\nCredit\nA common option used in business is to obtain funds to buy the necessary resources by taking a loan. The creditor needs to understand the business to ascertain the risk of not being paid back. This lesson examines the various methods that creditors approach determining a risk. We begin with an overview of the various types of loans used in business in general.\n\n\nContracts\nContracts are used extensively in management. Human resources or supply chain managers for example. HR may need to make a decision on giving employees raises? Supply chain managers need to determine if their supplier is in good financial shape? So, the financial statements are often a big part of the contracting function of business. In this lesson we will consider how financial statements can shape our business contracts.\n\n\nExecutive Compensation\nManagers are people. People tend to look out for their own best interest. But what about the company stockholders? How can we structure management compensation in a manner that leads to a win-win situation between management and the stockholders? Our lesson will consider the long- and short-term considerations used to develop management compensation.\n\n\nLeases\nWhy discuss leases in a course on financial analysis? Well, it seems leases are a tool that management might use to influence the performance of the financials without increasing actual efficiency. Because we are learning to analyze and understand the financial statements, we need to be aware of the implications of using leases for that purpose.\n\n\nOwners' Equity\nAnother option a manager has to get funding for the business, is to sell stock. Stock is a share of a business. Stockholders are owners. There are multiple types of stock. Stocks may have features associated with the shares. Let's learn more about the equity side of balance sheet!\n\n\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Earnings Per Share ratio is used extensively by stock analysts. It is the only ratio included with the financial statements. However, earnings per share can be impacted by changes to the number of shares. In our lesson we see how that can occur and how we adjust the Earnings Per Share to include potential harmful impact of changes to the number of shares.\n\n\nSo, before you go...\nWhether you’re a manager, entrepreneur, or business professional, understanding financial statements gives you a competitive edge. This course empowers you to interpret the numbers, spot red flags, evaluate performance, and make informed decisions—without needing to be an accountant. By the end, you’ll not only read financial statements—you’ll use them to lead smarter, ask better questions, and drive results.

En 2020, decidí que ya no quería trabajar en universidades, sino que quería compartir contenidos de clase mundial a un precio simbólico en plataformas en línea para poder impactar al mayor número de estudiantes, ayudando a desarrollar habilidades demandas por el mercado laboral.\nEn este curso aprenderemos a utilizar la biblioteca xlwings que permite integrar scripts elaborados en Python en Excel, combinando lo mejor de dos mundos: la facilidad y conveniencia para el usuario de las hojas de cálculo con la potencia y versatilidad de Python.\nComenzaremos el curso con una introducción a Python desde cero en la que aprenderás los tipos de variables, operadores, condicionales, secuencias, funciones, iteraciones y principales paquetes como matplotlib, numpy y pandas. En la segunda sección, sentaremos las bases de la biblioteca xlwings, interactuando entre Python y Excel, creando scripts y funciones en Python que luego podrás utilizar en Python.\nEn las siguientes secciones haremos dos casos de aplicación desarrollados por completo y paso a paso. En primer lugar, evaluaremos un proyecto de inversión utilizando simulación MonteCarlo con un script que escribiremos en Python. Te imaginas poder crear tu propio script en lugar de pagar anualmente la licencia de un add-in con precio significativo, super cool verdad. En la segundo lugar, automatizaremos la creación de un dashboard para evaluar acciones. Luego de que escribas tu script y lo integres a tu hoja, podrás crear tu dashboard con sólo dar click en un botón utilizando datos de la API de Yahoo! Finance.\n\nLos estudiantes ideales de este curso son usuarios de nivel intermedio y avanzado de Excel que deseen aprender una nueva herramienta que potencialice y automatice sus hojas de cálculo. Este curso es el punto de partida ideal si alguna vez has sentido curiosidad por aprender Python, ya que no asume conocimientos previos en este versátil lenguaje de programación y podrás aplicar lo aprendido directamente a tu entorno laboral.\n\nTe invito a que revises la información del curso y te inscribas. ¡Nos vemos en la primera clase!",

And financial modeling is no different.\nWith the capability to summarize data, transform them and process them, validate assumptions, generate scenarios, apply formulas and templates instantly, and more, text generative AIs such as ChatGPT are changing the modeling landscape.\nThis course will cover how to incorporate generative AI into your financial modeling pipeline, improving it for this new era.\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING.\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn about the basics of generative AI, including its capabilities, limitations, common models and technology used, and how it accelerates various tasks;\nYou'll learn about the basics of financial modeling, including the general modeling process with four steps (gathering data, establishing assumptions/constraints, building the model, and validating it/using it);\nYou'll learn about some common modeling use cases in finance, such as the Discounted Cash Flows analysis for valuation, regression for credit scoring, time series and machine learning for security price prediction, and actuarial/catastrophe models for insurance risk pricing, as well as the usual inputs and assumptions in general;\nYou'll learn about the main types of financial models: mathematical (where we apply operations to the inputs given), statistical (where we calculate results based on causality, correlation, or other relationships among variables), simulations (where we stochastically simulate various scenarios and gauge variations in outputs due to these), and algorithmic/computational (where we execute a set of steps, in a programmatic manner), as well as how these are used for common use cases such as banking/lending, trading, fraud detection or insurance;\nYou'll learn about the steps of the modeling process in depth, including what to take into account at each step (when gathering and preparing data, when establishing assumptions and constraints, when building the model itself, and when validating or using the model);\nYou'll learn about ways in which gen AI can accelerate or augment each of the four main steps of the modeling process (extracting or transforming data when gathering data, double-checking and generating assumptions when establishing assumptions, applying formulas or making calculations when building the model, and validating outputs or generating various scenarios when validating or using the model);\nYou'll learn about the usual models used for credit analysis (regression models, credit scoring models, and machine learning models), and how Gen AI can augment them;\nYou'll learn about the usual models used for fraud prevention (rules-based systems, anomaly detectors, and network algorithms), and how Gen AI can augment them;",

      "description": "Hola y te doy la más cordial Bienvenida al curso \"Evaluación Financiera de Proyectos (Guía 100% Práctica)\"\nDestacamos que este curso NO tiene como fundamento ser de estilo rígido-académico, por el contrario, busca ser un curso lo más práctico posible, en este contexto, repasamos brevemente algunos conceptos y luego nos vamos directamente a estudiar los temas mediante ejemplos.\nLa Sección N° 1 presenta su estructura general del Curso.\nEn la Sección N° 2 presentaremos un “Repaso de matemáticas financieras”, donde comenzaremos con la descripción de los concepto básicos de Tasa de Descuento y Valor Presente\nLa Sección N° 3 corresponde a la “Reseña Estados Financieros”, donde veremos cómo están compuestos los estados financieros (el Estado de Resultados, el Balance General y el Estado de Flujo de Efectivo)\nEn la Sección N° 4 ya nos adentramos en las “métricas tradicionales de decisión para inversiones”, aquí veremos en forma conceptual las métricas, su fórmula para calcularlas y cómo se interpretan sus resultados. Las métricas tradicionales que estudiaremos son: VAN, TIR, Índice de Rentabilidad y el Payback (incluiremos un ejemplo en Excel donde presentaremos en detalle cómo se calculan estas métricas).\nLa Sección N° 5 denominada “cálculo del flujo de caja libre (FCFF), EVA y WACC”, en primer lugar incluye un análisis conceptual del costo promedio ponderado de capital (WACC), describiendo en qué se utiliza y un ejemplo de su cálculo. En forma posterior veremos una detallada definición de lo que es el flujo de caja libre de la empresa y 3 fórmulas que permiten su cálculo. Luego presentaremos un ejercicio en Excel donde calcularemos el flujo de caja libre de la empresa. En forma adicional agregaremos un ejemplo detallado de la valoración de una empresa con la metodología EVA (Valor Económico Agregado), el cual será contrastado con el método de flujo de caja descontado (DCF)\nEn la sección N° 6 veremos los “Modelos de riesgos (CAPM y APV) y Escenarios”, donde comenzaremos con la presentación del modelo CAPM, revisaremos su fórmula, gráfico y supuestos del modelo. Posteriormente estudiaremos en detalle el riesgo sistemático o beta. En esta sección también veremos el cálculo del valor de una empresa mediante el método del APV (Valor Presente Ajustado). Finalmente veremos los “escenarios” (el pesimista, el normal y el optimista) de la Evaluación Financiera de un proyecto.\nEn la sección N° 7 denominada “Construcción de un Modelo en Excel para la Evaluación Financiera de Inversiones”, incluiremos una planilla Excel con un modelo de evaluación financiera cuyo propósito será repasar gran parte de los temas tratados en el curso, veremos en detalle cómo se llena esta plantilla, los resultados que arroja y de qué forma lo interpretamos.\nFinalmente, en la Sección N° 8 denominada \"Errores Comunes en la Evaluación de Proyectos de Inversión y Despedida del Curso\", presentaremos un listado de los errores más comunes que se cometen en la evaluación financiera de proyectos de inversión, para que el estudiante tenga la precaución de eliminarlos o minimizarlos cuando vaya a desarrollar su propia evaluación financiera.\n\n\nEn resumen, con este curso en forma sencilla y muy práctica aprenderás a realizar una Evaluación Financiera de Proyectos de Inversión, tendrás a tu disposición toda la información documentada y Ejercicios en Planillas Excel (sin fórmulas ocultas ni hojas protegidas) para llevar a cabo con éxito esta tarea.\nMuchas gracias y Nos Vemos en el Curso!!!",

      "description": "2025 UPDATED!\n\n\nLearn how to design scalable, flexible, and reusable financial models with Excel, using plain English and crystal clear explanations.\nWelcome to Excel Financial Modeling and Business Analysis Masterclass!\nDuring this course, we will create a complete range of applicable Excel models from:\nFinancial Statement Modeling\nBudgeting\nForecasting\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCF)\nWhat-if Analysis\nProject Costing Models\nActivity-Based Costing\nAdvanced Financial Techniques\nExcellent Formula tips and tricks\n\n\nExcel financial modeling involves designing and building calculations to assist in decision-making. Learning how to build models with complexity in an accurate, robust, and transparent way is an essential skill in the modern workplace.\nThe goal isn’t to teach you how to memorize Excel Models but to actually learn the skills to generate your own reports with a clear idea of how to structure a financial report so it has maximum flexibility.\nAnd by the end of this course, you will learn how to build effective, robust, flexible financial models.\n\n\nContent and Overview\nFirst, I’ll take you through the Financial Modeling Theory. I define financial modeling — what it is, who uses it, and why it matters.\nThen we will dive into how to Plan and Design your Financial Model: how to find the Data for the Model, the steps To Build a Model, and methods for Including Documentation in a Model.\nAlso, you’ll learn tools and techniques for Financial Modeling, like cell referencing, Naming and Dynamic Ranges, profit and loss Calculations, Restricting and Validating Data, and Goal Seeking.\nThen I’ll take you through some Excel Shortcuts. These things will make your life easier when you move around an excel spreadsheet.\nIn the following three sections, you will master the Excel formulas and functions necessary for building practical calculations and flexible, pliable models. There are three parts: Essential Functions, Advanced Functions, and Financial Functions.\nThen I’ll walk you through building Scenarios to Financial Models, like drop-down Scenarios. You’ll learn Sensitivity Analysis with Data Tables and how to use Scenario Manager with real-world examples.\nAlso, you will learn some excellent charting techniques, which all fall off the back of our calculations page. I firmly believe that if you set up a robust calculations area, the charts, and the management summary, everything falls out of that workhorse, which is the calculations page.\nThe following section discusses accounting and the most common daily tasks and approaches accountants face.\nAnd in the following sections, we get into the real meat of the course. This is about putting them all together and creating over five effective, robust, flexible financial models from scratch, like:\n--> Financial Statements (3-statement) Model\n--> Project Costing Model\n--> Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Modelling\n--> Activity-Based Costing\n--> Budgeting\n\n\nOnce you complete every section, you’ll have quizzes and exercises to solve and fully understand the theory.\nThe course will cover model construction, assumptions, advanced excel functionality, error trapping, sensitivity analysis, presentation of model output, and pro tips and tricks.\n\n\nIf you’re ready to take your financial modeling and business Analysis skills to the next level, this course is for you.\nSign up today and get immediate lifetime access to over 15 hours of high-quality video content, downloadable project files, quizzes and homework exercises, and one-on-one instructor support.\nAnd by the way, at the end of the course don't forget to print out the certificate of completion.\n\n\nThis course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course more effective and engaging.\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. I got into this industry because I love working with people and helping students learn.\nEnroll now and enjoy the course!\n\n\n*** learning is more effective when it is an active rather than a passive process ***\nEuripides Ancient Greek dramatist",

Soy Carlos Martínez, tengo una Maestría en Finanzas de la Universidad Centroamericana, un MBA de INCAE y un Ph.D. en Management de la Universidad de Saint Gallen en Suiza. He presentado mi investigación en algunas de las más prestigiosas conferencias y coloquios doctorales sostenidos en la Universidad de Tel Aviv, el Politécnico de Milán, la Universidad de Halmstad en Suecia y el MIT. Además, soy coautor de más de 25 casos de enseñanza, algunos de ellos incluídos en las bases de casos de universidades relevantes como Harvard y Michigan.\nLos inversionistas y analistas no compran el número del precio de la acción, sino que la historia detrás del número. Por esta razón, este curso va mucho más allá de simplemente descontar flujos de efectivo a un determinado costo de capital y se enfoca en convertir las palabras clave de la narrativa en impulsores o palancas de valor que luego se vinculan al precio de una acción a través de un modelo de valoración. Este es un curso con un enfoque 100% práctico, en el que aplicamos el framework del Profesor Damodaran a tres casos reales de empresas relevantes como lo son Netflix, Apple y Tesla.\nEl curso tiene contenidos similares a los de un curso de educación ejecutiva en valoración de empresas y está diseñado para estudiantes y profesionales interesados en finanzas y que ya sea por falta de tiempo o recursos no puedan acceder a una escuela de negocios. Los contenidos son de un nivel intermedio y se asume que los estudiantes ya pueden construir flujos de efectivo y estimar costos de capital.

Si se regresa ya has cobrado, y si sigue aun estas dentro y no abrirás de nuevo una operación tardía por miedo a perderte de algo.\n\n\nCualquiera puede entrar al mercado con muy poco dinero, pero eso no significa de que esto sea fácil, esto es la Arena de los Titanes de las Finanzas, así que debes prepararte.\n\n\nLo único que debes hacer es tener tu modelo de Trading y seguirlo, después de tu hora de Trading hacer un Journaling y escribir como ha sido tu análisis antes de empezar y como fue después, te darás cuenta de muchas cosas y así aceptando y reconociendo tus errores avanzaras.\n\n\nUno de mis errores al iniciar era que cuando perdía no revisaba mis Operaciones, simplemente me dolia verlas y no las enfrentaba.

Following this, the course will cover earnings per share (EPS) calculations, allowing students to understand a company's profitability per share of stock. Finally, they will compute weighted average shares, which is essential for accurate EPS calculations, thereby completing the income statement forecasting process.\nSection 3: Forecasting the Balance Sheet\nIn this section, students will learn how to accurately forecast the balance sheet, an essential component of financial modeling. They will begin with an introduction to the balance sheet and its components, including assets, liabilities, and equity. The course will cover the calculation of net working capital, which reflects a company's short-term financial health, and explore the cash conversion cycle to understand the efficiency of cash flow management. Participants will also learn how to calculate accounts receivable and how to build assumptions that drive balance sheet forecasting. Finally, students will link working capital values to the balance sheet, integrating all components into a cohesive financial model.\nSection 4: Depreciation Schedule\nIn this section, the focus will be on forecasting capital expenditures and understanding depreciation schedules. Students will learn how to forecast capital expenditures, a critical aspect of long-term asset management. They will then explore how to forecast depreciation using waterfall techniques, which will help them understand the impact of asset depreciation on financial statements over time. The course will also cover the calculation of ending net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), providing students with the tools necessary to manage a company's tangible assets effectively. Understanding these concepts is crucial for assessing a company's investment in its operational capacity.\nSection 5: Shareholders Equity Schedule\nThis section is dedicated to understanding the shareholders' equity schedule, a vital aspect of financial modeling. Students will learn about common stock and retained earnings, exploring how these components reflect a company’s financial performance and shareholder returns. They will also delve into forecasting dividends, an important aspect for investors looking to evaluate a company's profitability and commitment to returning value to shareholders. By the end of this section, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how equity financing works and how it impacts financial statements.\nSection 6: Cash Flow Statement and Debt Schedule\nThis section provides insights into constructing the cash flow statement and understanding debt schedules. Students will explore the intricacies of current and non-current liabilities and learn how to forecast long-term debt, a critical component for understanding a company's financial obligations. The course will also cover interest expense calculations, teaching students how to assess the cost of borrowing over time. Understanding cash flow dynamics and debt management is essential for evaluating a company's liquidity and overall financial health.\nSection 7: Completing the Missing Links\nIn this section, participants will focus on integrating various components of their financial models. They will learn how to link debt elements within their models to ensure consistency and accuracy. The course will address circular references, a common challenge in financial modeling, teaching students how to manage these situations effectively. Finally, the section will cover the mechanics of discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, providing students with a critical tool for assessing the value of future cash flows and making informed investment decisions.\nSection 8: Discounted Cash Flow Valuation\nThis section delves into the intricacies of discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, a key technique for valuing investments. Students will learn how to model the cost of debt and understand the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), both of which are crucial for determining the appropriate discount rate for future cash flows. By mastering these concepts, participants will be equipped to perform DCF analyses accurately, a vital skill in investment banking, equity research, and corporate finance.\nSection 9: WACC Calculations\nIn this section, students will explore the WACC concept in depth, understanding its significance in financial modeling and valuation. They will learn about the time value of money and opportunity cost, foundational concepts that underpin valuation techniques. Participants will calculate the risk-free rate, beta, and equity risk premium, which are essential for determining WACC. The course will also cover how to assess the market value of equity and the book value of debt, culminating in accurate WACC calculations. This knowledge will enable students to evaluate investment opportunities and make informed financial decisions.\nSection 10: Free Cash Flow to Firm\nThis section introduces students to the concepts of Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE), essential metrics for assessing a company's financial performance. Students will analyze the FCFF of a well-known company, such as Apple Inc., exploring factors that influence free cash flow generation. The section will also cover growth rate considerations, helping students understand how to project future cash flows and evaluate a company's potential for growth. Mastering these concepts will empower participants to conduct comprehensive financial analyses and investment valuations.\nSection 11: Presenting the DCF Output\nIn the final section, students will learn how to present their DCF analyses effectively, a crucial skill for communicating financial insights. They will calculate the net present value (NPV) of the explicit period, target share price, and conduct sensitivity analyses to assess how changes in assumptions impact valuation. The course will also explore the relationship between growth rates and valuation, enhancing participants' understanding of the dynamics of financial forecasting. The concluding lectures will prepare students to present their findings clearly and confidently, ensuring they can articulate the value of their financial models to stakeholders.\nConclusion:\nBy completing this course, students will possess a comprehensive skill set in financial modeling and valuation techniques, enabling them to construct and analyze sophisticated financial models with confidence.

But for many analysts I have spoken to, that is simply too much information at once. And in a well-intentioned effort not to overload students, course-makers end up leaving out many significant details.\nThis course takes a different approach.\nIt gives you a narrow, laser-focused examination of issues that are central to any project finance deal:\n\nHow much debt is going loaned to the company?\nHow is it going to be paid back?\nProject finance models answer critical questions with mathematical procedures centred on project finance debt ratios.\nThis course will look at all the project finance ratios, along with mathematical explanations about how, and why they work… (instead of asking you to just copy them and trust that they do.)\nYou will finally gain clear-minded understanding, and be able to spot and avoid errors that trip other analysts up... and which may even be lurking in the model you have inherited.\nAll this will help you work, faster, more confidently, with lower risk of error - a great reward for your investment.",

      "description": "Marginal costing is the accounting system in which variable costs are charged to cost units and fixed costs of the period are written off in full against the aggregate contribution. Marginal costing is also the principal costing technique used in decision making. The key reason for this is that the marginal costing approach allows management's attention to be focused on the changes which result from the decision under consideration. The concept of marginal costing is based on the behaviour of costs that vary with the volume of output. Marginal costing is known as ‘variable costing’, in which only variable costs are accumulated and cost per unit is ascertained only on the basis of variable costs. A break-even point is the minimal accepted point for most businesses. Here, the total costs for a product or service and the total revenue that product or service have brought in are equal. Therefore, there is no profit nor any loss. This type of revenue is needed to cover the total fixed and variable expenses of the company for a specified time period.\nTo calculate the BEP in units:\nBEP in Units = Fixed Costs / (Sales Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)\nTo calculate the BEP in Dollars:\nBEP in Rupees = Sales Price per Unit x BEP in Units\nThere are 3 factors in the breakeven calculation:\nthe sale price\nthe level of variable costs\nthe level of fixed costs\nThe breakeven point is reached when the margin on variable costs generated by the company equals the total amount of its fixed costs.\nIn this course, the students will learn:\nConcept of Marginal Cost and Break Even Point\nMarginal Cost Equation\nCases and Problems in Marginal Costing\nBreak Even Point (BEP) & Profit Volume Ratio (P/V Ratio)\nIncome Statement in Break Even Analysis\nIndifference Point",

This is unlike other financial modeling courses that start with a template - by starting from scratch, we guarantee that you will have a deeper level of understanding for how financial modeling works, and have more freedom to customize your projections for your own business.\n\n\nAt the end of this course, you will have a full 3 statement financial model (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Statement of Cash Flows) forecasted monthly and formatted attractively. We focus heavily on showing you the calculation logic so that you will be able to tailor your model to your specific needs.\n\n\nWhy build a financial model?? Lots of reasons - but specifically a financial model will:\n\n\n1.) Help you raise money for your business\nInvestors speak the language of finance - and a financial model is a great communication tool for investors. Presenting a model will inspire confidence that you'll be a good fiduciary of their investment, and that you are a competent operator that knows their metrics!\n\n\n2.) Help you run your business better\nA financial model is a mathematical simulation of your business. Once the simulation is build, there are endless questions that you can \"ask it\". What happens if you raise prices? Hire more people? Raise money? A good financial model is the closest thing a founder has to a \"crystal ball\"",

      "description": "About the Course\nThis course has a single objective which is to build up an Excel based Black-Scholes-Metron Model used for option pricing and calculating option price on a future date. Two of the three persons after whom the model is named are winner of Nobel Memorial Prize for Economic Sciences. The third person would also have got the prize, but he died before the prize was announced and  this prize is not given posthumously. Since 1973 till today this model is widely used by traders to understand movement of European Option price. I have developed this model in Excel and have back-tested with actual market data.\nYou can first understand the theory behind this model. Then you need to understand the difference between European and American stock options.  Then you can understand three important Excel function NORMSDIST(), EXP() and  LN(). If you are using the latest version of Excel you can use the NORM.S.DIST() function of Excel also. Then I shall take you through the concepts of Option Expiry Date, Option Valuation Date, Underlying Price, Exercise Price, Time to Maturity, Risk Free Rate of Interest, Dividend Yield and Volatility. Then I shall develop,step by step, the valuation model for both PUT and Call European options. Input in each cell will be explained and how they are linked with formula will also be explained. Finally you shall be able to download the entire spreadsheet and view all the formula that are working in the background. The beauty of this spreadsheet is, it has no user-defined functions and no macros. It works in all the versions of Excel from 2007 to any later version of Excel. In case of any difficulty I am always available through the Udemy system. I shall try to answer any query that you may have in 48 hours flat.\nAbout the Black-Scholes-Merton model\nBlack-Scholes-Merton  is a pricing model used to determine the fair price or theoretical value for an European call or a put option based on five variables such as volatility, underlying stock price, time to maturity, strike price, and risk-free rate of interest.\nThe Black-Scholes-Merton model assumes that stock prices follow a log normal distribution based on the principle that asset prices cannot take a negative value; they are bounded by zero.\nThe model assumes that the options can only be exercised on its expiration or maturity date. And so it is extensively used in the European options market. Hence, it does not accurately price American options.\nThe Excel functions used\nBlack-Scholes-Metron model tries to value the options, call and put, in a random walk situation. That is why it is anchored on the underlying stock price. To that it applies the concept of volatility, time to maturity, strike price and risk free rate of interest to arrive at the correct price of option. An additional input that is considered is dividend yield, in case of a dividend paying stock.\nThe probability of underlying stock price being higher or lower than the strike price determines a part of the option price. Hence the Excel function of NORMSDIST() or NORM.S.DIST() is used.\nAnd the underlying stock price follows a log normal distribution and can never be zero. That is why Exp() and LN() functions are used.\nPlease follow the lessons sequentially only to get the full benefit of the course.\nUltimately,  you shall get a downloadable  fully developed model in Excel, which can be used at all times in the future. I shall not only develop the model, I shall show you how to use it.\n\nHappy learning !",

      "description": "FTE stands for 'Full-time equivalent'. This helps in understanding the productivity level of staff for any business unit.\nFTE analysis reveals the optimum level and accurate productivity level of the workforce. It is sometimes confused with Actual headcounts. Actual Headcount, popularly known as 'HC', represents the actual number of staff in any business. With a new recruitment or resignation of staff, there will be a change in HC.\nFTE is a count of the actual number of hours used by active staff in the business. It is quite fluid because the actual number of staff hours used in businesses is based on the business requirements, i.e., staff leaves/holidays change their working days/hours.\nIf any business operates on part-time staff(PT) or casual staff(CS), then it is easy to inflate and reduce the number of staff working on the business unit, thus making the FTE concept more useful.\nIt is a process of managing payroll costs by managing FTE.\nThe challenge that we may face is if the staffing is based on FT (Full-time permanent staff), then it will be difficult to reduce the actual working hours.\nManagers must assess the requirement of FTE based on business, on books, or weekly trend to ensure proper control of working days or hours of staff.\nThis course explains the link between FTE and Productivity.\nAnyone after completed this course can start using the FTE and Productivity model in their businesses and take the benefit.",

Que al reinvertirlo te genere 4 y al repetir el proceso te dé 8, y así sucesivamente.\nEso se llama interés compuesto y es la forma más poderosa que existe para alcanzar la solvencia económica.\n¡Así que matemáticamente es posible multiplicar tu dinero de 10 mil a 1 millón en 4 años y en este curso te guiaremos para que así lo logres!\nRequieres 3 cosas\n1.- Actitud para intentarlo. ¡Seguro lo lograrás!\n2.- Usar el poderoso interés compuesto a tu favor. ¡Reinviertes lo que ganes + el capital inicial!\n3.- Aprender a hacer trading. ¡Con éste curso!\nPASA A LA ACCIÓN:\nNuestro curso te prepara en 4.5 horas para que comiences a comprar y vender activos de los mercados financieros, tales como Acciones, Etfs, Índices, Divisas, Criptodivisas, etc. con altos % de rendimiento.\n¿POR QUÉ ES RÁPIDO ESTE CURSO?:\nLa mayoría de cursos te enseñan muchas variables y análisis que existen: Patrones de velas, patrones gráficos o chartistas, decenas de indicadores, etc.\nLa realidad es que los traders no usamos más de 5 instrumentos en promedio, pudiendo ser menos.\nAsí que te enseñamos la fórmula de Vivir Tomando Ganancias, sin rodeos y directo al grano, con lo que comprenderás como analizar y entender las fluctuaciones del mercado y combinar los mejores indicadores para ser un trader efectivo y exitoso de inmediato.\nLlevamos la teoría a la práctica para que no te resulte aburrido aprender.\nEl curso es un concepto que resume mi aprendizaje de 4 años y te permite ahorrarte la curva de aprendizaje larga y costosa que tuve. Considera aquello que faltó para que tú no lo tengas que padecer y de paso, le quitamos la paja, para que no te llenes de conceptos y te revuelvas sin ni si quiera operar y ver resultados ganadores.\nCon lo aprendido en este curso, toda información que recibas, será muy fácil de entender ya que estarás correctamente contextualizado en el mundo del trading y los mercados financieros.",

      "description": "Every business has several levers that determine its financial performance.\nFor example,\nThe business can increase its sales.\nIt can improve its margin.\nIt can improve the efficiency of its back office activities.\nIt can use its assets more efficiently.\nIt can do combinations of the above and more.\nIn corporations, business unit directors are held to account against performance targets set by the main board.\nThe business unit director should be asking, \"How confident can I be that the business will achieve the performance I am being set?\"\nSuppose the sales team cannot meet the 10% pa improvement target you set them.\nSuppose operations cannot meet the 5% pa margin improvement you require.\nWhat will be the free cash flow you should expect?\nEnter Monte Carlo Analysis.\nThis technique allows you to set a range of performance improvements instead of point targets.\nFor example, if you ask the sales director what is the maximum improvement the sales team can achieve and what must go right to make this, you have a clear idea of the most you can expect and what you have to manage to improve the likelihood of securing it.\nIf you also ask the sales director what is the minimum improvement the sales team can achieve and what must go wrong for it to be so low you can be confident that this is the worst you should plan for and know what you must mitigate to lower the likelihood of such a poor performance.\nIf you then ask the sales director what it is the most likely improvement in sales you will have the benefit of the salesperson's expertise and experience.\nInstead of the traditional single point target you now have a range of plausible sales performance forecasts defined by these three points:\nthere is no chance of performing below the minimum\nthere is no chance of performing above the maximum\nthere is a calculable chance of achieving the most likely\nthere is some calculable chance of achieving every sales improvement performance between the minimum and the maximum.\nNow let's ask the Operations Director the same regarding margin.\nLet's ask the back office functions the same regarding selling and general administration.\nMonte Carlo Analysis allows as many scenarios as you want to be constructed by randomly selecting values for all the levers in your business plan and forecasting the free cash flow for each scenario. By collecting the free cash flow from every scenario, the analysis builds up a picture of the range of possible outcomes and the probability of them occurring.\nNot only does the course show you how to do this. It also includes an Excel spreadsheet that calculates one thousand such scenarios from the financial data you provide and the levers you set using three-point estimates.\nThis delivers five free cash flow forecasts for the next five years:\nthe minimum free cash flow for each year, meaning there is zero chance of achieving less than this\nthe 10% confidence line, which means that 10% of outcomes lie between the minimum and this line\nthe median line, which means that 50% of outcomes lie between the minimum and this line\nthe 90% confidence line, which means that 90% of outcomes lie between the minimum and this line\nthe maximum free cash flow for each year, meaning there is zero chance of exceeding this.\nYou can see immediately that 80% of outcomes lie between the 10% and 90% lines.\nThe spreadsheet also calculates the net present value of these forecast cash flows.\nThe most powerful feature is that the spreadsheet allows you to set a free cash flow or net present value target and responds with the confidence in exceeding it. Thus, if the main board want to set a target you can calculate how confident you can be in achieving it.\nThe spreadsheet uses all native Excel functions. That is, it requires no add-ins and no Visual Basic.\nIf you have completed my Forecast Business Outcomes with Monte Carlo Analysis then you will be well prepared to extend your knowledge and skills with this course.\nIf you have an appreciation of Monte Carlo Analysis or will take the theory behind it on trust, then you will be able to improve your business planning rightaway using this technique and the spreadsheet provided.",

The ability to create reliable and well-structured financial models is therefore crucial if you aim to pursue a career in corporate finance.\nThis is why many job interviews include technical cases on Excel. Within 30 minutes to an hour, employers can assess candidates by providing them with a computer and specific instructions, effectively identifying the top 10% who excel in financial modeling.\nThis comprehensive finance course on Excel will provide you with the knowledge, techniques, and best practices to create clear, well-structured models that meet the high standards of investment banks, Private Equity firms and financial management teams.\nIn this training, you will learn the standards and rules of financial modeling to produce professional, rigorous, optimized, and error-free outputs. You will be guided through designing a complete financial model with various investment and development scenarios for a company, including a debt schedule with multiple financing tranches, a Sources and Uses table, a clear Business Plan, and valuation using the transaction comparables method based on a normative EBITDA. Finally, we will calculate the IRR and analyze it according to investment exit parameters.\nIf these concepts are unfamiliar to you, we will cover them before diving into financial modeling in Excel. This course revisits essential finance fundamentals and the necessary knowledge you must master if you are interested in financial controlling, financial analysis, or transactional careers (PE, M&A, TS).\n\nInstructor Introduction:\nMy name is Yassine, and I am the founder of a corporate finance training organization that has helped thousands of students and recent graduates prepare for interviews in Private Equity, investment banking, and consulting firms in Transaction Services, Valuation, and Financial Restructuring.\nI am also a former Associate in Private Equity, having worked for two years in two different investment funds in Paris on small-cap operations across various sectors, including hospitality and real estate, tech and media, and renewable energy.\nAdditionally, I was a senior consultant in Valuation and Financial Modeling at EY, where I worked on multiple financial models in transactional contexts and investment projects.",

      "description": "Welcome to Forecasting Real Estate Market with Linear Regression & LSTM course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualisation on real estate market data. This course will be mainly concentrating on forecasting the future housing market using two different forecasting models, those are linear regression and LSTM which stands for long short term memory. Regarding programming language, we are going to use Python alongside several libraries like Pandas for performing data modelling, Numpy for performing complex calculations, Matplotlib for visualising the data, and Scikit-learn for implementing the linear regression model and various evaluation metrics. Whereas, for the data, we are going to download the real estate market dataset from Kaggle. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of real estate market forecasting, such as getting to know the characteristics of the real estate market, forecasting models that will be used, and major problems in the real estate market nowadays like limited housing supply and population growth. Then, continue by learning the basic mathematics behind linear regression where you will be guided step by step on how to analyze case study and perform basic linear regression calculation. This session was designed to prepare your knowledge and understanding about linear regression before implementing this concept to your code. Afterward, you will learn several different factors that can potentially impact the real estate market, such as population growth, government policies, and infrastructure development. Once you’ve learnt all necessary knowledge about the real estate market, we will start the forecasting project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE, then, you will also learn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will consist of two main parts, the first one is forecasting the real estate market trend using linear regression while the second one is forecasting the real estate market trend using a long short term memory model. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn how to evaluate the accuracy and performance of your forecasting models using R-squared and directional symmetry methods.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn to forecast the real estate market? What’s the benefit? Well, I have a ton of answers to those questions. Firstly, the real estate market has always been considered a strong investment option due to its potential for long-term appreciation and income generation. Property values tend to appreciate over time, offering the opportunity for capital gains, while rental income from properties can provide a steady cash flow. Meanwhile, as big data technology has advanced very rapidly in the past few years, integrating this technology to forecast future market trends and prices by identifying patterns in the historical data can be very beneficial as it allows investors to make a data driven investment decision. In addition, these skill sets that you learn are extremely valuable as they can be applied to different markets other than real estate.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn basic fundamentals of real estate market forecasting, such as getting to know market characteristics and major problems faced by real estate market\nLearn how to perform linear regression calculations and gain an understanding of regression coefficients, intercepts, dependent variables, and independent variables\nLearn several factors that can potentially impact real estate market, such as population growth, job market, and infrastructure development\nLearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\nLearn how to upload data to Google Colab Studio\nLearn how to clean datasets by removing rows with missing values and duplicates\nLearn how to detect potential outliers in the dataset\nLearn how to analyze property price trend by calculating its annual mean and median\nLearn how to find correlation between property price and property type\nLearn how to analyze real estate market trend and find investment opportunities using sales ratio calculation\nLearn how to forecast real estate market trend using linear regression model\nLearn how to forecast real estate market trend using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model\nLearn how to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the forecasting models using R-squared analysis and directional symmetry analysis",

      "description": "This is an introductory course in Finance.\n\n\nThe emphasis is on the financing and investment decisions of the financial manager. Topics include planning and control, working capital management, financial analysis, time value of money, risk and return, valuation of bonds and stocks, capital budgeting, and cost of capital.\nObjectives of Corporate Finance\nBy the end of this course students should have an understanding of:\nThe nature of financial management and the objectives of financial management and mangers.\nThe basic techniques of financial analysis and planning.\nThe concept of time value of money and its application in the investment analysis.\nThe techniques of bonds, stock and capital budgeting\nThe methods of raising capital for project financing.\n\n\nOutline of the Course\n\n\nIntroduction\nFinancial Statements\nRatio Analysis\nTime Value of Money\nCapital Budgeting\nCash Flows\nRisk and Return\nBonds\nStocks\nCost of Capital\nOperating and Financial Leverage\nCapital Structure\nDividend Policy\nCapital Markets\n\n\nHighlights of Topics Covered\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nCorporate Finance is a broad subject, and financial decisions are all around us. Whether you work on Wall Street or in a small company, finance is vital to every business.\nTherefore, understanding the fundamentals of corporate finance is vital to your business education. This introductory unit addresses fundamental concepts of finance, stocks, and bonds. Also,\nUnit 1 of corporate finance exposes the importance of understanding ratios for financial statement analysis and analysis of cash flows. The main ratios explained are: solvency (or liquidity ratios), financial ratios, profitability ratios, and market value ratios.\nIn addition, you will learn about financial growth, what financial factors determine growth, the importance of maintaining a sustainable growth rate, and how to use financial statement information to manage growth.\nConsider this situation: You are the manager of a small retail chain and your boss has given you the task of deciding whether to invest in a second store. You know that adding a second store means greater potential for growth. However, you also know that adding a new store will require spending cash. Facing this tough decision, how could you determine whether the company can \"handle\" such an investment? The answer might lie in ratio analysis. This section will explain how to use financial ratios to help you make these types of business decisions.\n\n\nTime Value of Money\n\n\nSuppose you have the option of receiving $100 dollars today vs. $200 in five years. Which option would you choose? How would you determine which is the better deal? Some of us would rather have less money today vs. wait for more money tomorrow. However, sometimes it pays to wait. This unit introduces the concept of time value of money and explains how to determine the value of money today vs. tomorrow by using finance tools to determine present and future values. Also, this unit exposes the concept of interest rates and how to apply them when multiple periods are considered.\n\n\nCapital Budgeting\n\n\nThe capital budgeting unit will show you how a financial manager makes capital investment decisions using financial tools that are pres3nted in this corporate finance course. It is especially the case that this unit addresses the concept of capital budgeting and how to evaluate investment projects using the net present value calculations, internal rate of return criteria, profitability index, and the payback period method. In particular, this unit will teach you how to determine which cash flows are relevant (should be considered) when making an investment decision.\nSay for instance, you have been asked to give your recommendation about buying or not buying a new building. As the financial manager, it is your task to identify cash flows that, in some way or another, affect the value of the investment (in this case the building). Also, this unit explains how to calculate \"incremental\" cash flows when evaluating a new project, which can also be considered as the difference in future cash flows under two scenarios: when a new investment project is being considered and when it is not.\n\n\nRisk and Return\n\n\nThis unit provides an explanation of the relationship between risk and return. Every investment decision carries a certain amount of risk. Therefore, the role of the financial manager is to understand how to calculate the \"riskiness\" of an investment so that he or she can make sound financial and business decisions.\nFor example, you are the financial manager for a large corporation and your boss has asked you to choose between two investment proposals. Investment A is a textile plant in a remote part of a third world country.\nThis plant has the capacity to generate $50 million dollars in yearly profits. Investment B is a textile plant located in the United States, near a small Virginia Town with a rich textile industry tradition. However, investment B's capacity for profits is only $30 million (due to higher start-up and operating costs). You are the financial manager. Which option do you chose? While investment A has the capacity to yield significantly higher profits, there is a great deal of risk that must be taken into consideration. Investment B has a much lower profit capacity, but the risk is also much lower.\nThis relationship between risk and return is explained in this unit. Specifically, you will learn how to compute the level of risk by calculating expected values and the standard deviation. Also, you will learn about handling risk in a portfolio with different investments and how to measure the expected performance of a stock investment when it is being affected by the overall performance of a stock market.\n\n\nOther Topics in Corporate Finance\n\n\nDoes it matter whether a company's assets are being financed with 50% from a bank loan and 50% from investors' money? Does that form of capital structure, where 50% of assets comes from debt and 50% from equity, influence how a company succeeds in business? This unit addresses these questions by focusing on the theory of capital structure. Specifically, Unit 5 explains the concept of capital structure and introduces you to the most common formula used when comparing a company's return to the cost of capital: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC).",

They can make strategic decisions after the flow-through is calculated.\nThis makes 'Flow-through' calculation a unique tool not only for owners or investors, but also for the managers and the team responsible for running the business efficiently.\nAlso, if any business has a negative flow-through, which is because of lower revenue with the compered period, then the 'recovery of loss' is calculated.\nSo, a ratio below -50% is considered a better recovery because it shows the percentage of costs and expenses recovered in an adverse situation.",

      "description": "The course, Quantitative Finance from First Principles, focuses on the practical implementation of topics that a quant uses in their day-to-day work.\nThe course begins with an in-depth exploration of yield curve construction and bootstrapping techniques. Students will learn how to derive zero-coupon curves from market instruments. These yield curves form the foundation for pricing a wide range of fixed income and derivative instruments.\nThe course then progresses to valuation adjustments (XVA), including Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA). These are explored both conceptually and via numerical implementation, with an emphasis on Monte Carlo simulation.\nModel calibration is the final core theme, where students will learn to calibrate the Hull-White model to market data.\nExcel and Python are used to implement the models covered in the course, offering students hands-on experience with industry-standard tools. Excel is used for rapid prototyping, visualisation, and understanding the structure of financial calculations. Python, with its robust libraries such as NumPy and SciPy, has become an industry-standard tool. By working with both platforms, students develop a strong practical skill set that complements their theoretical knowledge and prepares them for real-world Quantitative Finance applications and model development.\nBecome a well-respected Quantitative Analyst today!",

It involves assessing potential expenditures on fixed assets, such as machinery, equipment, or new business ventures, to ensure they generate sufficient returns for the business.\nCapital investment appraisal is vital for ensuring that resources are invested wisely to achieve financial and strategic objectives. By leveraging quantitative techniques like NPV, IRR, and payback period alongside qualitative considerations, businesses can make informed decisions that drive growth and long-term success.\nCapital investment appraisal provides a structured framework for evaluating long-term investments, helping organizations maximize returns and allocate resources effectively. However, understanding the factors influencing appraisal outcomes and recognizing the limitations of these methods is crucial for making balanced, informed decisions. By complementing appraisal techniques with qualitative analysis and strategic considerations, companies can achieve a more comprehensive evaluation of investment opportunities.",

      "description": "Before you take up this course, let me tell you This Course DOESN'T cover Ratio Analysis, Financial Modeling or other Quantitative Finance Methods. Rather, it asks you to avoid using Excel. Yes, this is a unique Financial Statement Analysis course that focuses on Analyzing Financials (numbers) using a Qualitative Approach - where you try to read beyond what is obvious, beyond what numbers often tell you. This course dumps the traditional analysis methods taught in b-schools and takes a more practical and comprehensive approach.\nUsing a Qualitative Approach combines financials with business of the company & keeps its focus on the quality aspects. In other word, it is a combination of Financial Analysis + Business Analysis. The approach focuses on reading about business from a financial metric - for example Revenue of $3 billion (Rs 21,000 crores) tells you a lot. While it's the amount of sales done by a company in year, it also tells you that it's a large company, it's not a start-up, should have been in existence for quite some time (may be a few decades), should be commanding large market share & so on. This means, a number can hold much more information than what we generally think of. We will learn many such insights in this course. We will also interconnect P&L with Balance Sheet and Cash flow.\nOften students and new analysts focuses too much on calculating financial ratios, building models & in this process they miss out on discovering the true story of the company using financials. Yes, it is possible to read the story of the company from financials, as if you are reading a book. Just that you need to focus on quality behind each number & know the interconnect between P&L, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow.\nThis course is part of a 2-Series Financial Statement Analysis Course viz (1) Qualitative Analysis (2) Quantitative Analysis. The 1st course avoids using Excel & calculating ratios. Rather it focuses on Quality of each number. It's all about numbers & it's quite enriching, just that it may not look as fancy as Financial Modeling. The 2nd course, which is an extension of 1st course, involves Quantitative methods, Financial Modeling, Ratio Analysis and all that students & finance aspirants often think of.\nMy suggestion is to take up both the courses. You won't repent.\n\n\nWatch the preview video to know what is unique about & what all it has to offer.\nBest Wishes",

      "description": "Welcome to 3-statement financial modeling! If you’ve taken our Introduction to 3-Statement Modeling course, much of this will feel familiar – think of this course as the next step. While the fundamentals remain the same, here you’ll learn how to build a detailed, monthly operating model designed for actually running a business.\nWhat sets this course apart from others is its unique approach. Unlike courses that are too basic or require you to watch too many hours of videos, this course provides a comprehensive and practical guide to building a robust operating model that can be applied in real-world business scenarios.  We've distilled complex concepts into concise, to-the-point videos, paired with a detailed e-guide that allows you to learn at your own pace.\nThree-statement modeling is an essential skill for any finance professional. It integrates the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement into a dynamically linked, comprehensive model. This allows you to thoroughly evaluate a company’s financial health and forecast its future profitability, asset position, and cash outlook. As a key decision-making tool, it serves as the foundation for more advanced models, such as discounted cash flow (DCF) and merger models. Ultimately, everything in business and finance ties back to these three financial statements, as they form the bedrock of performance analysis and strategic decision-making.\nWhether you're an FP&A leader, a private equity professional, or a student launching a finance career, this course will teach you the skills and knowledge needed to build effective, real-world three-statement models.  Happy modeling!\n\n\nCourse Outline:\nIntroduction\nGetting Started: Building the Model\nModel Design & Model Layout | Historical Actuals | Inputs & Headcount Planning\nBuild the Operational Schedules\nRevenues & Costs | Working Capital | Capex & Depreciation | Income Tax\nBuild the Capital Structure Schedules\nDebt Schedule (including revolver and cash sweep) | Equity Schedule\nBuild the 3 Core Financial Statements\nIncome Statement | Cash Flow Statement | Balance Sheet\nBring it Home\nCircularity | Error Checking | Outputs & Exec Summary\nConclusion",

This course addresses the transition from traditional financial reporting and control roles toward value-adding, insight-driven finance leadership.\nAs organizations adapt to increasing complexity, digitization, and economic uncertainty, the role of the finance professional has expanded. No longer confined to budget preparation or compliance, today’s finance leaders are expected to actively shape business decisions, drive performance, challenge assumptions, and align financial outcomes with organizational strategy.\nThis course will enable participants to become proactive contributors to the business, helping leadership teams navigate decision-making, interpret financial implications of strategic choices, and drive sustainable value creation through cross-functional collaboration.\nThrough case studies, scenario-based practice, interactive workshops, and simulation exercises, learners will develop a practical skillset that blends finance expertise with business acumen, storytelling, influence, and stakeholder engagement.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of the program, participants will be able to:\n1. Translate financial data into strategic insight and action\nLearners will develop the ability to analyze financial and non-financial information to identify trends, risks, and opportunities, and translate this into commercial insights that inform strategic decision-making.\n2. Build strong cross-functional relationships and influence outcomes\nParticipants will learn techniques to engage, influence, and collaborate with stakeholders across departments (e.g., sales, operations, marketing, R&D) using structured communication, active listening, and credibility-building strategies.\n3. Drive financial performance and support decision-making\nTrainees will develop an ability to challenge business assumptions, assess trade-offs, and use decision-support tools (e.g., scenario analysis, NPV, cost-benefit) to guide investment, pricing, product, and operational decisions.\n4. Design and deliver impactful financial narratives\nParticipants will master techniques to deliver high-impact presentations, dashboards, and financial storytelling using data visualization tools and best practices in report structuring for executive audiences.\n5. Lead finance transformation and foster a performance culture\nGraduates will be equipped to lead or support finance modernization initiatives (e.g., digital tools, automation, integrated planning) and embed continuous improvement and performance accountability within the business.\n\n\nPractical Implications\nFor the Organization:\nStronger Decision-Making: FBPs help operational leaders understand the financial impact of decisions, which reduces risk and improves capital allocation.\nImproved Forecast Accuracy: With embedded FBPs, forecasts and budgets become more grounded in business reality.\nCulture Shift: FBPs promote a culture of accountability, ownership, and strategic focus, often acting as change agents in finance transformation.\nFor the Finance Professional:\nExpanded Influence: FBPs move from passive reporting to active shaping of decisions and outcomes.\nStronger Career Prospects: Skills in business partnering, storytelling, and decision support are in high demand across industries.\nMore Meaningful Work: The FBP role allows finance professionals to see the real-world impact of their work on product launches, customer strategies, and operational efficiency.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\nAn FBP embedded in a retail chain helps optimize store-level profitability by analyzing customer buying patterns and negotiating supplier terms.\nIn a manufacturing firm, FBPs challenge production assumptions, helping avoid a costly expansion through better demand forecasting.\nIn a tech startup, FBPs partner with product teams to evaluate new product lines, balancing innovation with capital efficiency.",

This is especially true during due diligence projects, strategic projects, and turn-arounds. Financial analyses will help you decide which option is better, what investments you should take, estimate potential improvements, or estimate the impact on the profit and the balance sheet. On top of that, during consulting projects, you have to do everything 3x faster and with little data. Therefore, I will teach you in this course how to do fast and efficiently financial analyses and how to draw conclusions from them\nIn the course you will learn the following things:\nHow to do financial analyses in Excel fast and efficiently\nHow to draw conclusions from the analyses\nHow to analyze financial statements in Excel\nHow to use financial indicators\nHow to model a business in Excel\nHow to analyze business units of the firm\nHow to carry out analyses related to M&A\nHow to evaluate a potential investment in Excel\nHow to estimate the value of the firm using simple methods\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nAnalyzing the financial situation of the firm is a fundamental skill in consulting. It helps you understand the current situation of the firm, identify problems, and estimate potential savings. Many Management Consultants and Business Analysts did not finish Business School and sometimes struggled with some financial analyses. This sometimes puts them at a disadvantage and makes it difficult for them to get promoted. On top of that, many consultants and analysts who did study finance at university/college have forgotten some things.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students understand or refresh how to do financial analyses in Excel. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know how to understand financial data, analyze them, and draw conclusions from them. You will also master the essential information related to valuation.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of financial analyses. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those who did not finish business school or Economics. The course will help you become an expert in financial analyses on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Managers, Management Consultants, and owners/founders of businesses that need better to have a good understanding of the business.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nHow to do financial analyses in Excel fast and efficiently\nHow to draw conclusions from the analyses\nHow to analyze financial statements in Excel\nHow to use financial indicators\nHow to model a business in Excel\nHow to analyze business units of the firm\nHow to carry out analyses related to M&A\nHow to evaluate a potential investment in Excel\nHow to estimate the value of the firm using simple methods\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into 8 sections. Currently, you will find the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nGeneral Analysis of Financial Statements. In the second section, I will show you how to analyze 3 main financial statements: cash flows, profit, and loss statements, and balance sheets.\nFinancial Analysis of Indicators. In this section, I will show you how to use financial indicators, and ratios to analyze the situation of the firm, especially in comparison with other firms. We will look at profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and debt ratios.\nModeling of Profit & Loss statement in practice. In the 4th section, I show you how to model the profit and loss statement of a company in Excel. A business model of the firm you can use to understand the business, forecast future growth, or for valuation purposes\nBusiness Units Analyses. In the 5th section, we will discuss the analysis of Business Units. Many firms are running more complicated businesses with plenty of business units that you should analyze separately. We will have a look at 2 examples of such analyses\nValuation. During consulting projects, especially devoted to M&A or due diligence you will have to evaluate a specific business. In this section, I will show you examples of how to do it in practice.\nFinancial Analyses related to M&A. In this section, I will show you how to analyze the different aspects of M&A. Here we will see what is better: organic growth or M&A, how to estimate the impact of M&A on the firm, and how to decide whether to sell a business unit or not\nInvestment Analyses. In the last section, I will show you how to analyze different investments in the firm. We will look at investments demanded by customers, investments that are supposed to generate savings, and investments in bottlenecks. Different types of investments require different approaches.\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\nUseful frameworks and techniques\nSelected analyses presented in the course\nLinks to additional presentations, articles, and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nHow to conduct fast and efficiently financial analyses during a consulting project in Excel\nHow to draw conclusions from financial analyses\nAnalyze financial indicators, ratios\nDo essential firm valuation\nAnalyze investments in Excel\nEstimate the impact of the M&A activity\nCreate a business model of the firm in Excel\nAnalyze business units\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants and Business Analysts\nManagers\nFinancial Controllers\nStartup Founders\nOwners of small and mid-sized businesses\nInvestment Directors\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance\nBasic or intermediate knowledge of finance & accounting",

Esse curso não é recomendado para pessoas interessados no mercado Forex.\nDurante o curso, vamos desenvolver passo a passo do zero, um robô que opera gradiente linear.\nO conceito de gradiente linear pode ser um pouco controverso. Pois dependendo do ponto de vista pode nem ser considerado uma estratégia, e sim uma forma de operar.\nEm operações tradicionais, procuramos um ponto de entrada e ouro de saída no gráfico. Se o movimento for a favor e bater no alvo, ganhamos. Se ver contra e bater no stop, perdemos.\nQuando se opera utilizando gradiente linear, a situação muda um pouco. Pois ao invés de ficar esperando bater no meu alvo, posso ficar fazendo várias operações menores enquanto o mercado fica lateralizado. Podendo até mesmo bater a meta financeira de ganho mesmo com o mercado lateral.\nDessa fora, temos mais possibilidades ao meu favor. Se o mercado ficar lateral eu ganho, se bater no meu alvo eu ganho, se ficar lateral e depois bater no stop loss, posso reduzir bastante o loss e só perco o loss cheio se o mercado fizer um movimento muito brusco em direção ao meu stop loss pegando várias entradas.\nClaro que nesse cenário, o valor nominal do loss cheio vai ser bem maior que o gain cheio. Por isso a importância de escolher bem a região onde operar gradiente linear e ter um gerenciamento de risco bem planejado.\nPra quem já opera gradiente linear manualmente, sabe que é bem trabalhoso gerenciar várias ordens de compra e venda e ao mesmo tempo ficar prestando atenção nos movimentos do gráfico.\nPor isso, nesse cenário um robô pra gerenciar essas ordens automaticamente ajuda muito.\nAbordaremos temas bastante interessantes que lhe ajudarão e obter uma performance significativa utilizando robôs para fazer operações financeiras.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Equity Research & Equity Analyst Program—a comprehensive, hands-on course designed to prepare you for a career in equity research, investment banking, or financial analysis. Using Praj Industries Ltd, a leader in ethanol technology and engineering solutions, this program walks you through every stage of financial modeling, company analysis, and valuation. From understanding the business model to projecting financials and estimating share value, you will learn how real analysts think, research, and present investment recommendations.\nWhether you're a student or a working professional, this course equips you with job-ready skills in Excel-based modeling, financial statement interpretation, and sector forecasting.\nSection 1: Introduction\nThis foundational section introduces Praj Industries Ltd, its ethanol-driven business model, and its role in the broader renewable energy ecosystem. You'll learn how the company manufactures ethanol, its market segments, and how government policies and emerging markets are fueling growth. We also provide an industry-level view of ethanol’s strategic importance to India’s energy independence, laying the groundwork for sector-specific modeling.\nSection 2: Financial Statement Analysis\nHere, you’ll roll up your sleeves and start working with Praj’s quarterly and annual reports. You'll input (or \"punch\") data from both standalone and consolidated financials into your Excel model. The section includes management analysis, income statement breakdowns, balance sheet reviews, and linkage-building between statements. You’ll also learn how to reverse-engineer FY16 cash flows when full reports aren't available—just like real analysts do.\nSection 3: Ethanol Demand and Order Flow Projections\nAnalyze the macro and micro demand drivers for ethanol in India. You'll forecast petrol consumption trends, understand government mandates for ethanol blending, and estimate how these trends translate into new order flows for Praj and its competitors. Using data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), you’ll develop demand models and run sensitivity analyses.\nSection 4: Brewery and Emerging Market Order Flow Projections\nExtend your demand modeling to Praj’s other business lines, including breweries and global markets. Learn how to use assumption sheets to model new order inflows and analyze how global expansion in ethanol policies may impact Praj’s financials in the coming years.\nSection 5: Projection of Revenues\nMove from top-line forecasting to a detailed revenue model. You'll project sales, estimate operating costs, calculate margins, and adjust for variables like foreign exchange fluctuations and other income sources. This section also includes projections of depreciation, amortization, and finance costs—all critical for building a reliable income statement forecast.\nSection 6: Projection of Balance Sheet\nThis section teaches you to project all critical components of the balance sheet, such as assets, liabilities, and equity. You'll also learn to calculate working capital elements like trade payables and build a fully integrated balance sheet that connects with your income statement and cash flow projections.\nSection 7: Projection of Cash Flows\nCash flow modeling is essential for valuation and risk analysis. You’ll learn how to project cash flows using the indirect method, linking them to the income statement and balance sheet. This section will help you evaluate free cash flow, a key driver of valuation in equity research.\nSection 8: Projections of Equity Value Per Share\nOnce the model is complete, you’ll use it to derive valuation multiples. This includes drawing 1-year and 2-year rolling PE charts to assess relative valuation. You'll explore how to estimate intrinsic value and understand the valuation metrics used by buy-side and sell-side analysts.\nSection 9: Preparing Summary Sheet\nYour final step is to compile all insights into a one-page Equity Research Summary Sheet—just like real analysts do. This includes financial highlights, valuation, recommendations, and key investment risks. It’s a perfect takeaway for interviews, reports, or client presentations.\nBy the end of the Equity Research & Equity Analyst Program, you will have built a fully integrated financial model, conducted industry demand forecasts, and created a valuation summary for Praj Industries. This isn’t just a learning experience—it’s a portfolio-ready project that showcases your capabilities as a future equity research analyst.",

      "description": "The word modeling refers to complex mathematical calculations. Financial models, therefore, refers to the creation of abstract representation of a company's financial statements. The idea behind the creation of these models is that decision-makers can simulate their decisions and finally see the impact on the company's finances. A financial model allows a company to simulate their revenue and expenses under various situations. This is the reason why financial models are extensively used when companies are about to make big decisions like launching a new product line, entering a new market, or acquiring a competitor.\nThere are several objectives of financial modeling such as profitability planning: the most obvious use of financial modeling is to optimize the day to day operations of a firm. This types of models is used by companies to ascertain how they can deploy their resources in the most profitable manner. Profitability analysis is different from capacity planning. Capacity planning is done keeping only operational considerations in mind. However, profitability analysis and planning takes a holistic view. Usually such models enable companies to decide on an optimal product mix which would enable maximum profitability.\nIn creating a revenue model financial mode is often called \" model of models\" this is because there are several parameters which go through a series of complex calculations themselves. Revenue is a perfect example of such parameters. For the financial model as a whole, the revenue number is just one of the many inputs required for the calculations to be run.\nFinancial models are used to forecast a company's future earnings, performance, and financial health. Whether you own a business or want a job in finance, financial modeling will make an excellent addition to your skill set. Building models requires attention to detail and it might take some time to get the hang of it.",

Covid-19, the Big Resignation, war in Ukraine, changes in supply-chains at the global level and price adjustments…although we all might hate them individually, these are all great triggers for the next wave of mergers and acquisitions for the years that are coming. That’s why we believe M&A is going to become core corporate or business strategy topic for all types of decision makers – either Entrepreneurs, Business owners, Executives, Investors, or many other (just) curious people.\nHere, the point of this course is not just to focus on an end goal (meaning how to buy the business), but to better understand the process itself, learn how to find the right companies and choose the best approaches how to structure and run your M&A deal.\nThat is why we have structured this course to cover the following:\n- Investor’s challenge – finding the right target;\n- M&A process overview;\n- Valuation and investment rational;\n- Securing financing; and\n- Integration plan and / or Exit strategy;\nWithin a Section focused on Investor’s challenge, we are going to explain you what are the key deal drivers for different types of investors, what tools professional investors use in assessing market attractiveness, how they assess individual company’s attractiveness, how they make money in M&A deals, and how to position yourself as being an investor.\nIn M&A process overview – we are going to explain initial deal planning and acquisition preparation, we are going to cover all activities from market screening to submitting a winning Non-Binding Offer, how to execute Due Diligence, negotiate different elements of a Sales and Purchase Agreement, and finally Close the deal.\nWithin a Valuation Section – we are going to explain the most common valuation techniques like DCF, multiple based, or relative valuation and Net Assets Value. On top of that – we are going to walk you through 3 Financial Models to illustrate you how a valuation really works in practice.\nRegarding Securing financing – we are going to explain you a concept of a Debt capacity so you will be able to assess what is your realistic reach. We will cover the most common sources of financing, why some investors create SPV (or, Special Purpose Vehicle) in order to execute an M&A deal, and we will highlight you the most important success factors relevant for executing the deal.\nFinally, we are going to help you with developing your integration plan, or with your Exit strategy.\nI hope you are going to enjoy!\nSee you at the other side.\nBye!",

      "description": "Welcome to Forecasting Stock Market with ARIMA Model & Time Series course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualisation on stock market data, in addition, the course will be concentrating mainly on forecasting future stock prices using ARIMA model and implementing time series. For the programming language, we are going to use Python alongside several libraries like Pandas for performing data modelling, Numpy for performing complex calculations, and Matplotlib for visualising the data. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of stock market forecasting, such as getting to know factors that affect forecasting accuracy and models that will be used in forecasting. Then, continuing by learning the basic mathematics behind forecasting stock market, you will learn step by step on how to calculate moving averages manually. Not only that, you are also going to learn the mathematics behind the ARIMA model, there will be one comprehensive case study to teach you how to do manual calculation using the ARIMA model. Afterward, you will also learn several internal and external factors that could potentially impact the stock market, for example market sentiment, earning reports, and interest rates. Once you’ve learnt all necessary knowledge about stock market forecast, we will begin the project, firstly, you will learn how to set up Google Colab since that is the IDE that we are going to use, Then, you will also learn how to find and download stock market datasets from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section where we are going to spend most of our time here, conducting experiments with the dataset. Lastly, at the end of the course, you also learn several metrics for evaluating forecasting model performance, such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error, in addition, you will also learn how to implement those metrics on a simple dataset.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions: why should we learn to forecast the stock market? How are we able to know if the forecast is accurate? Well, in my opinion, there are many answers to those questions. Firstly, people have been investing in the stock market since a hundred years ago, therefore, this type of investment has been around for a long time. As the advancement of technology and big data nowadays, people started to realize that integrating big data technology into stock market investing is going to be extremely beneficial as it allows investors to identify patterns from the historical data to make a prediction about the future. Then, the next question might potentially be, how accurate is the forecast going to be? Well, there is no such thing as 100% accuracy. When it comes to forecasting the stock market, we use the data from the past to make a data driven investment decision. Nonetheless, no matter how convinced we are with a pattern from the historical data, there is still no 100% guarantee that the same exact pattern will repeat itself in the future. However, when you spot a repetitive trend or pattern in the data, it basically indicates there is a higher chance that the pattern will happen in the future and that is what the forecasting model is actually based on.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn basic fundamentals of stock market forecasting, such as getting to know factors that affect the forecasting accuracy and several forecasting models that will be used\nLearn how to calculate moving average\nLearn how to apply ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model into simple dataset and do the basic forecasting\nLearn several internal and external factors that can potentially impact stock market\nLearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\nLearn how to upload data to Goolge Colab Studio\nLearn how to clean the dataset by removing missing values and duplicate values\nAnalysing & visualising average highest & average lowest stock price per year\nAnalysing & visualising average volume\nFinding correlation between volume & price changes\nCalculating 100 days moving average\nAnalysing & visualising volatility\nLearn how to analyse autocorrelation function & partial autocorrelation function\nLearn how to perform forecasting using ARIMA model\nLearn how to perform residual analysis\nLearn how to do forecasting model evaluation by calculating MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)",

      "description": "You are going to learn CAPL programming in this course. CAPL is similar in syntax to the C programming language, making it relatively easy for engineers with C knowledge to learn. It supports variables, loops, functions, and conditional statements, allowing for complex logic implementations. However, unlike C, CAPL is designed to work with event-driven programming, where functions are executed based on predefined events such as message reception, key presses, or timer expirations. This makes CAPL highly efficient for handling asynchronous communication tasks in CAN networks.\nThe primary building blocks of a CAPL script include event procedures, message handlers, timers, and system variables. Event procedures define how the script responds to specific triggers, such as a received message or a timer event. Message handlers allow the script to process incoming CAN messages and take appropriate actions based on their content. CAPL is mainly used within the CANoe and CANalyzer tools provided by Vector, which are widely adopted in the automotive industry for network analysis and simulation.\nCAPL is a powerful scripting language tailored for CAN-based systems, offering event-driven capabilities that make network simulation, testing, and analysis more efficient. Its close resemblance to C, combined with its specialized event-handling mechanisms, makes it an essential tool for automotive software engineers.",

      "description": "TECHNICAL ANALYSIS, VOLUME ANALYSIS AND CHART READING MASTERY BUNDLE\nTake your understanding of Technical analysis, Volume analysis, Chart reading skills and Smart Money to nothing short of \"Mastery\" with this bundle\nMASTER TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\nTechnical analysis has become extensive in recent years. We study the psychology of technical analysis and why they work 60 to 70% of the time. There are several categories of technical analysis - Price indicators, Support and Resistance levels, Momentum indicators, Volume indicators, Oscillators and Statistical price movement indicators. We cut through all the noise and show you why there are 4 or 5 indicators you should study and that's all you really need to make informed entry and exit decisions. Technical analysis is a self-fulfilling prophecy and gives deep insight into crowd behavior.\nWhat you will master\nWhat is Technical Analysis and why is crowd psychology an important factor in markets\nWhy does technical analysis work only 60 to 70% of the time\nWhy are Price indicators called \"lagging\" indicators\nWhat are potential \"leading\" indicators\nA study of Moving averages and which ones are helpful\nWhat are the best indicators for short, medium and long term trends\nWhy do we need a \"confluence\" of indicators to make a decision\nWhy the Bollinger Bands are a cool indicator\nAdjusting technical indicators to match your trading timeframe\nWhy technical analysis \"works until it doesn't\"\nSECTION 1\nLecture I -  What is Technical Analysis\nTechnical analysis is primarily a study of Crowd psychology and crowd behavior. If a certain number of people act in unison at a certain time, and other people can observe this group of people taking a certain action, then they are motivated to join in. And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Technical analysis is a very powerful force in the markets, but it has limitations. This Introductory lecture explains these details.\nLecture 2 - Crowd psychology and Crowd behavior\nWhat is crowd psychology and why does it matter ? In this lecture, we study the S&P 500 Index over the last 20 years, and also observe a certain technical pattern that is currently playing out textbook-style. How could this pattern impact the markets this year ?\nLecture 3 -  Limitations of Technical Analysis\nWhat are the limitations of Technical analysis - when does it work, and when does it not work. Knowing when it does not work is as important as knowing when it works.\n\n\nSECTION 2\nSection 2 is a detailed discussion of all the types of Technical analysis indicators. You have various kinds - Price Indicators, Momentum indicators, Statistical and Volatility indicators, Support and Resistance, Volume indicators and Oscillators. Each of these indicator types are broken down in detail as well as insightful tips on their usage and interpretation.\n\n\nSECTION 3\nSection 3 is a complete case study set of 5 stocks -\n1) Apple (AAPL) - 1 Year Chart. And how AAPL gave 3 points of entry for the perfect Bearish trade.\n2) Priceline (PCLN) - No clear long-term signals, but a short term bearish trade could be played out.\n3) Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) - an absolutely amazing Statistical indicator gives away the perfect \"Long\" signal\n4) The Gold ETF GLD - Hidden inside a very bearish chart is the potential for a reversal trade\n5) And on the Google (GOOG) charts, we can study the battle between the Bulls and Bears at a recent breach of Google's all-time high.\nApplying correct Technical Analysis techniques can set you with a fantastic trade entry. If you get your trade entry correctly, you have just increased your chances of a profitable trade a whole lot.\n\n\nVOLUME ANALYSIS AND TRACKING SMART MONEY\nVolume is perhaps the most under-rated indicator in the markets. Volume shows the activities of the big hedge funds and proprietary desk traders,  players we often refer to as \"smart money\". Good volume analysis shows critical points at which markets turn around, when activity levels are low or high or when smart money is active or inactive. In this technical analysis course, we analyze various stock charts, and combine volume analysis with price action. Volume also provides a storyline to the markets. Constructing this storyline correctly is critical in terms of trade entry and exits.\nSmart Money or Big money has always tried to (legally) manipulate the markets to their advantage. Their goals are to conceal their activities as much as possible. But Volume is one indicator they cannot conceal. In many ways, this technical analysis course levels the playing field for the average retail investor. Once you take this course, you'll know what to look for, and you'll be in a position to track smart money as they're entering a Stock or they're running for the exits. And your objective is to \"follow the smart money\". When you position your trades in harmony with the money flows of smart money, you're adding a whole layer of high-probability characteristics to your investing activities.\nThis is an exciting course!\n\n\nWhat you will master\nWhy is Volume the most under-rated indicator\nIdentify the activities of smart money precisely\n\"Swim with the tide\" - increase your odds of success\nHow to read long term and shorter term charts\nIdentify points of major market reversals (before they happen)\nWhat is Distribution and Accumulation\nPut short term price action in context of longer term charts\nAll of this explained in simple terms\nStudy of various charts on various timeframes\n\n\nSECTION IV\nIn this Section, we explore why Volume is a critical indicator to study, and why this is the only indicator that clearly shows the activities of Smart Money. What can Volume analysis tell us about activity levels in the markets. Volume is sometimes referred to as the \"fuel of the markets\", and this is very true. This Section also defines some of the rules of \"Smart Money\". These rules form the basis for the games and that Smart Money play, and the tactics they deploy to manipulate the markets to their advantage.\n\n\nSECTION V\nThis section is a deep-dive into the methodology for spotting and tracking \"Smart Money\" using Volume analysis. A perfect timeframe for analyzing these activities was during the period preceding the financial crisis of 2007/2008 and the period after the bottom in March 2009. And there is no better instrument to study this than the S&P 500 Index itself. This section is a fascinating and shocking analysis of how we could spot Smart Money doing the following -\n- Start selling in March 2007, about 6 months before the top in October 2007\n- They sold (\"distributed\") for about 9 months with barely a move in price\n- Ran the bear market down to their liking\n- Start \"accumulating\" stock by the end of 2008\n- Finished accumulation phase over a period of 9 months\n- Are running the Bull market right now to their liking\n\n\nSECTION VI\nDetailed case studies of major stocks analyzing Smart money activity points -\n1) BIDU - Smart Money is in, and they are not leaving\n2) CAT - Similar to BIDU but more choppiness\n3) FSLR - Gave a clear signal of smart money entry\n4) NFLX, PCLN and FXE - Gave various signals for entry and exit\n5) Silver Case study - Smart Money left Silver and has not come back yet.",

      "description": "¿Te gustaría aprender a analizar estados financieros de manera eficiente? En este curso aprenderás cómo utilizar Excel y ChatGPT para estimar razones financieras y presentar informes de análisis completos y precisos. Soy Carlos Martínez, tengo un MBA de INCAE y un Ph.D. en Management de la Universidad de Saint Gallen en Suiza. Como académico he presentado mi investigación en algunas de las más prestigiosas conferencias en universidades muy relevantes a nivel global y también soy coautor de más de de 25 casos de enseñanza algunos de ellos incluídos en las bases de casos de universidades muy reconocidas como Harvard y Michigan.\nEn 2020 decidí que ya no quería trabajar en universidades y descubrí que mi propósito en la vida sería compartir contenidos de clase mundial a un precio simbólico en plataformas en línea para ayudar a la mayor cantidad de personas a desarrollar habilidades demandadas en el entorno laboral.\n\nCon este curso, aprenderás a estimar razones financieras con Excel en diferentes categorías como lo son la rentabilidad, eficiencia operativa, apalancamiento, solvencia y liquidez. También aprenderemos a realizar tanto análisis sectoriales en los que comparas el desempeño de una empresa relativo a sus pares en la misma industria como análisis de series de tiempo, en los que evalúas el desempeño de una empresa a lo largo de un horizonte de varios años. En la última sección del curso, aprenderás a utilizar ChatGPT para generar la estructura básica de un informe de análisis financiero que por supuesto deberás corregir y complementar con base a tu análisis crítico de las razones financieras. En el curso analizaremos tanto empresas globales con su matriz en EEUU y Europa, como empresas cercanas a nuestra realidad Latinoamericana como FEMSA, Grupo Argos, América Móvil entre otras.\n\nQuiero enfatizar que este no es simplemente un curso de ChatGPT, el énfasis del curso está en la parte de cálculo e interpretación de razones financieras que aprenderemos con el mismo rigor con el que se enseñan en las escuelas de negocio a nivel de maestría y cursos de educación ejecutiva. Los participantes ideales de este curso son estudiantes y profesionales en las áreas de finanzas, contabilidad, administración de empresas, ingeniería industrial y realmente cualquier persona interesada en mejorar sus conocimientos en análisis financiero. Los prerrequisitos del curso son el uso básico de hojas de cálculo y el conocimiento a nivel básico de los estados financieros. Si conoces a grandes rasgos que es un balance general y un estados de resultados no tendrás problema para seguir el curso.\nTe invito a que revises la información del curso y te inscribas. ¡Nos vemos en la primera clase!",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nModeling real estate in Excel is not easy. In real estate, you will have to forecast the cash flow for long investment periods. In most models, you will have to forecast loan payments, maintenance costs, operational costs, and potential revenues from operating the real estate. On top of that, in real estate, we have different business models that will have different business drivers. To make your work easier, I will teach you in this course how to model in Excel fast and efficiently real estate investments.\nIn this course you will learn the following things:\nEssential concepts related to real estate and modeling them in Excel\nWhat are the main drivers of the profits in real estate for different business models?\nHow to model the buy & rent of real estate in Excel\nHow to model in Excel hotels and other short-term renting businesses (Airbnb, Booking)\nHow to model in Excel flips/flipping\nHow to make decisions on the investment in real estate, based on the Excel model\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated in a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy did I decide to create this course?\nModeling real estate in Excel is not easy. Many Management Consultants and Analysts did not finish Business School and sometimes struggled with some financial analyses, including modeling real estate. This sometimes puts them at a disadvantage and makes it difficult for them to get promoted. On top of that, many consultants and analysts who did study finance at university/college have forgotten some things.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students understand or refresh how to model real estate in Excel. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know how to understand the different business models in real estate and how to model them properly in Excel. I will also show you how to draw conclusions based on the model in Excel.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Financial Analyst, Management Consultant, or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of real estate. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those who did not finish business school or Economics. The course will help you become an expert in modeling real estate on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples in Excel, and a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nEssential concepts related to real estate and modeling them in Excel\nWhat are the main drivers of the profits in real estate for different business models\nHow to model the buy & rent of real estate in Excel\nHow to model in Excel hotels and other short-term renting businesses (Airbnb, Booking)\nHow to model in Excel flips/flipping\nHow to make decisions on the investment in real estate, based on the Excel model\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into 7 sections. Currently, you will find the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nEssential Concepts. Modeling real estate requires learning certain concepts that will help you handle the long-term nature of the real estate. This is what we will discuss in this section.\nModeling Simple Buy & Rent businesses. In this section, I will show you how to model in Excel buying and renting apartments. We will first look at renting 1 apartment and then what would happen if we do it on a much bigger scale\nModeling Airbnb & Hotels. In this section, I will show you how the model in Excel is a bit different business model – short-term rentals of real estate. We will first the discuss hotel business model and we will model it in Excel. After that, we will look at a business model where we rent apartments from owners and sublet them through Airbnb.\nModeling of Profit & Loss statement in practice. In the 5th section, I show you how to model the profit and loss statement of a company in Excel. A business model of the firm you can use to understand the business, forecast future growth, or for valuation purposes\nModeling Flips. In the 6th section, we will discuss the modeling of so-called flips. Again we will discuss the business model and after that, we will model it in Excel.\nRestaurant Business model. In the last section, I will show you a model related to the real estate model – a restaurant business chain\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nUseful frameworks and techniques\nAnalyses and models are shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations, articles, and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nHow to build from scratch a functional, dynamic real estate financial model\nHow to understand the different business models in real estate\nMain KPIs in different real estate business models\nModel in Excel real estate\nHow to analyze models of real estate in Excel\nHow to decide on investment based on a model in Excel\nEvaluate potential investments in Buy & Rent\nEvaluate potential investments in Flips, Airbnb, Hotels\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants and Business Analysts\nFinancial Analysts\nInvestment Analysts\nFinancial Controllers\nPeople interested in real estate\nInvestors in real estate\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic or intermediate knowledge of finance & accounting",

      "description": "Is this course for me?\nIf you want to become a better trader, then this course is for you.\nIf you want to backtest anything on Tradingview, then this course is for you.\nIf you want to forwardtest anything on Tradingview, then this course is for you.\nIf you want to turn your trading logic into an automated strategy, then this course is for you.\nIf you've purchased an indicator for its signals, but are having second doubts about those signals and wish you could test them, then this course is for you.\nIf you want a comprehensive understanding of how backtesting and forwardtesting works on Tradingview, then this course is for you.\nIf you are short on time and need a guide on building strategies in Pinescript, then this course is for you.\n\n\nWhat skills will I learn in this course?\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to:\nBuild strategies in Pine Script by using your own trading logic, or by modifying existing scripts.\nBacktest strategies the right way.\nForwardtest strategies the right way.\nConvert Indicators to strategies.\nBacktest Indicators -- Yes I will show you how to backtest an indicator!\nTrack and Improve the performance of your trading strategy by understanding key metrics.\nRemove uncertainty with data & gain greater confidence in your trading.\nAutomate trading logic.\n\n\nHow will I learn?\nYou will experience Pinescript from the eyes of a seasoned Programmer and Trader cultivated from years of passionate improvement.\nThroughout the course:\nI will guide you from basic to advanced concepts.\nI will use spaced repetition, an evidence-based learning technique, to drill important concepts into your mind so you won't forget.\nYou will be shown several different ways to accomplish one thing, making sure you understand the differences between each approach while highlighting which approach you should use.\nYou will fortify theory and knowledge with hands-on practice, by doing code alongs in the Pine Editor on Tradingview.\nYou will convert real trading rules to indicators, and indicators to strategies to analyze their real performance.\n\n\nIs this course worth my time and money?\nBecause this is a highly subjective question relating to personal experience, conditions, knowledge, mental characteristics, and states; the answer depends on the person taking this course a.k.a. YOU.\nWith that in mind let me offer some objectives for your perceptions.\nThere are around 5 hours of content jam-packed into this course. Now length doesn't exactly equate to quality, but I spent a considerable amount of time, scripting and editing course content so you don't have to listen to me ramble, stutter, mumble and meander off-topic. I stay on track and include references to other sources if you need further explaining. And, if your short on time, you can always listen to the course on x2 speed, then it's only 2.5 hours long! :P\nThis might be subjective, but I am almost positive it is the most comprehensive course available today covering Pinescript Strategies. You will not find anything better and I am not saying that because I am naturally biased, but I say that because I looked.\nI've spent almost 5 years learning what I know now. I've consolidated and condensed that knowledge into this course, so you can be confident you are learning the right things the right way. By doing this, I am saving you time so you don't have to do 10,000 google searches piecing together outdated blog posts, youtube tutorials, and difficult documentation. Put simply, you can learn all this stuff on your own and it will take you a while. Or you could take my course and I can teach you everything in 4.5 hours\nPeople are selling indicator subscriptions on TV for anywhere between $50 and $200 a month, I can't speak for the quality of these, but after taking this course you will be able to identify if they are worth the cost. Saving you from additional subscription costs and/or time on bad signals before you realize they are bad signals.\nBefore I knew how to code, I would backtest my trading logic by HAND. Knowing how to use Pine Script will save you lots of time.\nIf you ever get stuck, I am available to answer questions and help you out! I have been working with Pinescript for almost 5 years now and have extensive experience building indicators and backtesting strategies for myself and clients. I have worked with Python, Javascript, C++, C, and other Domain-Specific Languages like mql4 within the sphere of financial analysis and quantitative analysis. I’ve come across many frameworks for building and testing strategies, and can honestly say that Pinescript is now my go-to backtesting engine. It hasn’t always been that way, but Pinescript has been rapidly evolving and finally can do the things I need it to do rapidly.\nFinally, you can always get your money back if you're not satisfied!\n\n\nWhat will each section cover?\nI've designed the course in a way so that you can view the course from beginning to end, or you can jump around to just the stuff you need! This way after finishing the course, you can use it as a reference guide for when you are building your own strategies.\nHere is an overview of each section with descriptions.\nQuickstart - The purpose of this section is to introduce the student to core concepts and get them up and running quickly with the proper mindset.\nAnalyzing Strategy Results - No strategy is worth building if you can't examine and understand the backtesting and forwardtesting results. This section walks you through the key performance metrics in the strategy tester tab.\nBasic Order Types - Don't be fooled by the section title. This section is dense and fundamental. We start off by reviewing trading order types and then taking a birds-eye view of all the important strategy functions Pine Script makes available to execute those orders types. We'll convert an RSI indicator to a strategy, and then use that strategy with every different order type, in various ways, so we can get a good fundamental understanding of how things work. You will learn about market orders, limit orders, stop orders, entries, exits, multiple entries, pyramiding, date filtering, and visualization techniques.\nAdvanced Order Types - This section builds on the last. You will learn how to place take profits, stop losses, stop-limits, OCO's, trailing stops, and more advanced visualization techniques for viewing these orders on your charts.\nUnderstanding the broker emulator - A crucial step in becoming a master of Pinescript strategies. I've broken down the complex broker emulator in a simple way anyone can understand. I can't tell you how many people think Pine Script is broken or crappy because they just don't understand the broker emulator. This section is designed for the go-getters who want to separate themselves from a novice to a professional.\nPractical Examples - Take everything we've learned and put it into action. I take real-world trading logic and put it to the test. This section explores practical applications, converting trading logic into code, and then into strategies. We experiment with a bunch of different strategies, including one of my own (The only one that works.). I code everything up live, so you get to see me make mistakes and debug the code. (Don't worry I edited the process, so we skip the parts where I stare at the screen and murmur expletive undertones).\n\n\nWhat you get with the course:\nOver 34 On-Demand Video Lessons\n4.5 Hours Of Jam-packed Content\n5 Strategies To Build On With Code\n11 Downloadable Resources, including all the code I use\n30-day money-back Guarantee\nInstructor feedback -- Yes I care about my students and want you to be successful\nExclusive Group access & extra resources for extended learning beyond course materials\nQuizzes & Activities\nFull lifetime access\nAccess on mobile and TV\nCertificate of Completion at the End",

      "description": "*** Now You can Create the exact same model with Google Sheets instead of Microsoft Excel ****\nForecasting Business performance for the next year or more is absolutely crucial for any startup or even for Existing Businesses.\nTherefore, it is important to use robust tools to generate reliable forecasting for your business well ahead of time; this will surely prepare you for any uncertainties that may arise.\nThe best and easiest way to prepare a business performance forecast is to prepare a Financial Model in a familiar application called Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets!\nWhile preparing Financial Models, people usually focus on KPIs like Sales, Sales Growth, Cost of Sales, Fixed overheads and Net Profit in creating their forecasting models, but the most important lifeblood for any startup or business is CASHFLOW.\nThere is no one better than you who can understand the value and importance of your business/idea/venture, so I believe you should be the one to predict the future of the business by preparing your own Forecast; my goal here is to empower non-finance business personnel with tools and techniques to get control of their business performance and outcomes! Therefore I have designed this course with easy to a follow approach where Non-Finance entrepreneurs and business owners can follow along and build up a financial model for their dream business ideas! (don worry if you get stuck. You can always reach out to me via the Q&A forum on this platform)\nWelcome to the course: Build A Financial Forecasting Model for your next Startup\nFinancial modelling for any kind of business is a crucial task and is often considered a job only an Excel or Finance expert can do!\nWhile I do not disagree with the above statement, even if you do not have any finance or accounting background or expert Excel/spreadsheet skills, you can easily learn them within a few hours, and you can still build a robust and reliable finance model for your own business within a few hours!\nIn this course, you will learn how to build a UNIQUE financial model from scratch; this course is specially designed for NON-FINANCE people/entrepreneurs.\n\n\nThis Financial Model allows forecasting two major components of Business which are key for success:\nIncome Statement\nCashflow performance and Funding required to keep business afloat\nIncome Statment Forecasting is key for your business success, with this Financial Model you will be able to forecast or model:\nSales and Revenue (with growth type: linear or selective), this is also perfect for any seasonal business model as well\nCost of goods sold and Gross Profit for each of your products (linear or selective)\nInventory balances (for trading business which has inventories)\nDirect other costs (Eg customs duties, import duties, freight etc.)\nGross Profit (% GP)\nIndirect overheads or semi-fixed overheads (Eg Property rentals, Salaries, Vehicle rentals, utilities etc.)\nNet Profit (% NP)\nThe model is ideal for businesses where there are seasonal fluctuations in sales and sales growth; you can model each moths' revenue where there will be lower sales or vice versa.\nCashflow Forecasting is as important as Income Statment Forecasting. The business world is full of uncertainties, and even if your idea is a breakthrough, you might face temporary cash issues due to many reasons beyond your control. Therefore, using the proper Cashflow forecasting method is absolutely essential. Cash is king in any business, and it’s THE most important resource for any business to go on for a long time.\nGuess What? This model lets you model key factors and indicators affecting cashflow as follows:\nAmount and portion of Cash Sales in business, everyone prefers to sell their products or services on a Cash basis only, but for sustainable business growth, you will have to provide the optimum amount of credit to your major customers. The model allows you to set % of cash sales and credit sales, and you find at what level of % you will have maximum sales growth.\nCash collections from your customer – How much credit should you give to your customers for each of your products to ensure that you don’t run out of cash\nCash collection prediction becomes even more crucial when you have a seasonal business model; this model lets you predict and forecast your cash collections when your sales are really high or really low throughout the year.\nCash payments to your suppliers – suppliers are as important as customers; how you should negotiate with your suppliers to give you optimum credit (in days) to ensure the overall cash position of your business is always positive\nIn case you run out of cash for any reason, you can setup a revolving line of credit with your bankers to provide you with a temporary line of credit or bank overdraft; this model lets you forecast that as well, and you can clearly view how much temporary funding will be required in case business is not performing well in order to run the operations at the base level.\nIf you are borrowing temporarily, you must keep in mind the interest cost which you will incur; this model lets you forecast interest expenditure as well as how managing credit periods with your customers and suppliers reduces interest expenditure each month/year.\nHaving an optimum mix of Cash sales/purchase and Credit days (allowed and to get) could be the key to a successful startup or business venture; you can achieve the optimum mix required for your nature of business with this Financial Model easily and effectively.\n\n\nThis course covers:\nThe basics of Accounting and Finance (the accounting equation, Debits and Credits, what is balance sheet etc.)\nExcel /Google Sheets formulas and functions to be used for building the ultimate Financial model\nAdvanced Financial Model building process (step-by-step, beginner-friendly)\nAdvanced Charting Techniques and Dynamic Dashboard building to supplement your Financial Model's KPIs in a visual manner\nThis model can be used to present your business plan in Infront of prospective Investors, venture capitalists, bankers to obtain the necessary funding to expand and grow your dream business\nThis model is an ideal tool for new businesses or startups, existing small to medium-sized businesses in many sectors and industries, for example:\nFMCG – Fast-moving consumer goods like electronics goods (Trading)\nRestaurant business\nConsulting business\nOnline store/e-commerce business\nAny seasonal businesses (where some months have more sales growth than others in a year)\nAny other small to medium-sized businesses\n\n\nAs mentioned above, many numbers of scenarios can be modelled here, and you are not limited to worst, good and best scenarios only.\nYou can add more products and forecast each product’s performance either with linear growth (month-to-month fixed increase or in sales), or you can make more practical growth predictions with selective growth for each product month on month.\nAnd if you are dealing with seasonal business, this model lets you forecast monthly sales quite accurately to manage the impact of seasonal sales (up and down)\nSimilar to sales growth, you can also predict gross profit and cost of goods sold for each of your products either with linear or selective growth % values.\nSo what are you waiting for? Start your journey of learning an awesome and powerful financial Model building! ENROL NOW",

Es decir, marcha a través de algoritmos que van variando según la data que procesan. Para ello, los bancos evalúan el comportamiento de su cartera de créditos para determinar las características o patrones comunes que se repiten con mayor frecuencia en los créditos impagos.\nEn cuanto a la información que necesita el banco, esta puede ser dividida en dos bloques: aquella que no requiere documentación y que usualmente el banco ya la tiene, y aquella que si la necesita.\nEn el primer grupo, se encuentra la siguiente información:\nDatos personales del posible acreedor: edad, profesión, estado civil, domicilio, hijos, etc.\nVinculaciones financieras con los clientes: tarjetas contratadas, cuentas bancarias, etc.\nHistorial crediticio: revisión de préstamos anteriores ya cancelados por el cliente y aquellos que aún están vigentes.\nInformación de ficheros externos: lista de morosos (Infocorp).\nAdicionalmente, la entidad bancaria podría solicitar una serie de documentos que sustenten o complementen la información anterior. Por ejemplo:\nAcreditación documental del correcto cumplimiento de los préstamos que el cliente tiene con otras entidades.\nIngresos de los intervinientes en la operación (boletas de pago).\nJustificación de la finalidad del crédito: en préstamos a mypes (facturas, contratos de compra-venta u otros, etc.).\nDocumentación registral y tasación de bienes a hipotecar, de ser necesario.\nEsta data es procesada por un software que, tras analizar la información, arroja un número que representa la probabilidad teórica de que un cliente pague el préstamo en el tiempo previsto.",

These numbers can be figures related to revenue, assets, credit flow, future projections, mergers, takeovers and every other financial aspect that influences the sustainability and earning capacity of an organization. This close relationship to numbers, statistics, analytics, skillset involving risk projections and strategic thinking, and significant impact to an organization's financial management, makes Business Finance one of the most sought after career options for professionals globally.\nBusiness Finance, in simple words, refers to the raising and managing of funds by businesses and organizations. Business Finance involves planning, analysis, and control operations. In small firms, these are the responsibilities of the financial manager, who is part of the middle and senior management and is at the higher levels of the organizational structure of a firm. In large companies, major financial decisions are often made by a finance committee.\nSince Business Finance involves management of the funds and credit employed in the business, it acts as the foundation of any business. The typical finance requirements within an organization are to purchase assets, goods, raw materials and for the other flow of economic activities.\n\n\nWhat is Financial Modeling?\nFinancial Modeling refers to the creation of a mathematical representation or model of the financial and operational characteristics of a business. Some of the most practical applications involving financial modeling include business valuation, management decision making, capital budgeting, financial statement analysis, and determining the firm’s cost of capital. Such models provide a simplistic illustration of how the firm actually creates value for its shareholders. Their real value comes from forcing the model builder to think about the important relationships among the firm’s financial statements and to focus on the key determinants of value creation and the assumptions underlying forecasts. Financial models provide simulation capabilities that act as a useful means of assessing alternative options and associated risks and of identifying how firm value is affected by different economic events. For e.g., to estimate the value of a firm, financial modeling helps in a sound forecast of the future cash flows, assets valuation, user acquisition, sales growth, risk anticipation, etc.\nA financial model consists of one or more input parameters along with data and formulas that are used to perform calculations or make predictions. By changing the values of the input parameters, one can do what-if studies to see what happens when the inputs change or the parameters affecting the outcome are altered in different combinations. It is a science of building models to depict financials statements and investments.",

      "description": "Do you ever find yourself, in business review meetings, trying to explain the business performance versus budget, or prior period, but not having all the answers? Then, this course is just for you.\nBeing able to analyse and present the profitability of a business through variance analysis is a key business partnering skill. It can help you identify key business issues and establish your position as a trusted finance business partner to the senior management. This is a must have skill for all finance and business professionals, specially Sales Analysts, Financial Analysts, Accountants, Controllers, CFOs, General Managers and CEOs.\nIn this course, we take a detailed look at calculating and analyzing variances in sales and gross profit (budget variance analysis and prior period variance analysis), driven by changes in sales prices, sales quantities and product mix. With the help of these variances we will be able to explain precisely the performance gap, both in terms of dollar amounts and profit margin percentages, vs budget and prior period. We will calculate the variances by developing automated Microsoft Excel files. Once all the variances in price, volume, quantity and mix are calculated, we will convert them into charts for presentation, and then analyze in detail each variance. We will also explain performance versus budget and prior year, and then make precise recommendations to improve profitability and business performance.\nHere is what you will learn in this course?\n- You will be able to explain precisely the variance in amounts for Sales, Cost of Sales and Profit vs budget and vs previous period.\n- You will also learn how to explain the variance in Profit margin percentage (%) vs budget and vs previous period, and what impacts the variance in margin points.\n- You will learn how to summarize the variance results and present it to management in the form of easy to follow graphs/charts (visualization).\n- You will learn how to analyse the results of the variance calculations, and provide recommendations to management (using Microsoft PowerPoint).\n- You will start with current period actual sales, cost of sales and gross profit of a company, compared with budget and prior year results.\n- You will learn about the hierarchy of sales variances; Sales Price, Volume, Quantity and Mix.\n- You will learn how to create Excel templates to calculate all of these variances that are automated and update as soon as new data replaces existing data (this is great for monthly and weekly, or even daily updates).\n- You will learn about when to use Selling price, and when to use Profit as a base for calculation.\n- There will be quizzes and assignments to test and reinforce your knowledge.\n- You will also get downloadable solved variance analysis Excel files, that we prepare during the course lectures.\nIn summary, by the end of this course, you will be able to explain financial performance vs budget and previous year as a result of changes from sales price, quantities and product mix. You will be able to successfully explain results, and empower decision makers to make informed business decisions based on your recommendations. This will save you a lot of time and effort, and is likely to have a significantly positive impact on your confidence and career growth.\nYou can achieve this mastery of explaining variances in sales and profitability as soon as tomorrow, or your next meeting, if you take this course now.\nSo, don't wait and start learning by enrolling for the course, right now.\nHope to see you inside the course!",

      "description": "This course offers an unbelievable Return on Investments. This is not a theoretical course like thousands available online for Basel 3. I have spent years in designing this course in MS Excel (Excel sheet provided as part of this course for conceptual understanding, doing simulations and scenario analysis) through my over 10 years of risk management consulting experience across several Investment Banks in Basel 3 and Capital Optimisation. When you take this course, you will feel, you are sitting in a bank's risk management desk as it's outlined in a way exactly resembles how banks analyse real data from their front office system.\nLearn, understand & simulate in Excel- Derivative capital calculation by understanding all components what makes Exposure at Default( EAD): Notional Amount, Mark to market, Gross/Net EAD, Gross/Net PFE (Potential future exposure), Incurred CVA (Credit Value Adjustment), Risk weighted Assets (RWA) & Capital impact under Standardised (STND) Approach used by 50% of banks - A look up table which is based on counterparty exposure class [ Sovereign, Institutions, Corporates] and their external rating given by rating agencies like Moody's, S&P, Fitch and Internal.\nAlso calculate Risk weighted Assets (RWA) & Capital impact under more advanced Internal Rating Based (IRB) Approach used by remaining 50% of big banks which needs Regulator's approval - Derive risk weights of counterparty through variables like Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), Weighted average maturity (WAM). Most importantly understand these concepts.\nWe will also take a deep dive into various capital optimisation strategies of reducing RWA and improving capital ratios. My expertise include capital management, which i will share details with you which is currently used in most banks and will be the most important KPI for all big banks in future.\nAs a part of Premium lectures, enter into advanced risk modelling concepts where we derive internal rating risk weights in excel for all counterparties with given PD, LGD, correlation, weighted maturity by using Merton & Vasicek model for credit risk. I will take you step by step and make everything absolutely easy to understand, so you can explain it to others!.\nI always assume when training in banks, audience have no previous background of Basel 3 or capital management, so students don't need any previous background (only basic excel knowledge is needed). Post this course, you can easily get a great job in Risk/Capital management within any top IB's or Commercial banks. Even if you don't want a career in Risk/Capital management, you would know in great depth about the hottest topic in banking industry. Happy learning!",

      "description": "In today’s finance-driven business world, the ability to build robust financial models is a superpower. Mastering Financial Modeling & Valuation with Excel is a comprehensive course designed to take you from beginner to proficient modeler through hands-on instruction, real-world case studies, and practical Excel tools. Whether you're preparing for a job in investment banking, private equity, corporate finance, or simply looking to sharpen your decision-making with data-driven insights, this course provides the complete roadmap.\nThrough six intensive sections, you’ll explore Excel functions, charting, Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Relative Valuation, and finally, complete financial modeling using a case study on Siemens AG. You’ll also prepare for job interviews with dedicated sessions on common valuation questions.\nSection 1: Financial Modeling Overview\nThis foundation module introduces you to the world of financial modeling. You’ll understand what models are, why they’re built, and how they’re used across industries. The section includes a detailed case framework, outlines modeling requirements, explains user needs, and walks through economic and industry context—including macro factors like Brexit. It ends with a crash course in accounting equations that are essential for model building.\nSection 2: FM Prerequisites – Excel Shortcuts\nNo modeler can succeed without Excel mastery. This section drills deep into over 50 essential Excel functions and formulas—from shortcuts like F2 and Ctrl + Shift + Tilde, to logical functions (IF, AND, OR), date/time functions, lookup functions (VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, MATCH), financial formulas (PMT, IPMT), and statistical tools. Every function is taught in a practical, modeling-relevant context to boost your speed and accuracy.\nSection 3: FM Prerequisites – Excel Graphs & Charts\nYou’ll move from formulas to visual storytelling. This section covers every major Excel chart: bar, pie, line, area, bubble, sunburst, radar, histogram, and combo charts. You'll also explore dashboard elements, smart art graphics, and best practices for choosing the right chart for financial insights. The goal is to make your models visually compelling and client-ready.\nSection 4: FM Prerequisites – DCF Valuation\nLearn the theory and structure behind one of the most widely used valuation techniques: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). You'll cover valuation methodologies, terminal value, net debt, beta, WACC, forecasting cash flows, and building a complete DCF case study. This section builds conceptual understanding before applying it in Excel later on.\nSection 5: FM Prerequisites – Relative Valuation\nThis module explores Comparable Company Analysis (Comps) as a method of valuation. You'll learn to select peer groups, apply industry-specific multiples (like EV/EBITDA, P/E), and draw comps sheets. Using structured steps and equations, you’ll understand how relative valuation complements DCF and when each method is appropriate.\nSection 6: Financial Modeling and Valuations on Excel\nIn the capstone module, you’ll build a full-blown 3-statement financial model from scratch using Siemens AG as a case study. You’ll populate historicals, forecast income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows. Then add depreciation, debt, equity, working capital schedules, and perform ratio analysis, sensitivity tables, and scenario modeling. Common Excel pitfalls and interview prep are also covered to solidify your real-world readiness.\nConclusion:\nThis course is a practical, immersive learning experience designed to make you fluent in Excel-based financial modeling and valuation. From foundational shortcuts to building complex valuation models, this is your all-in-one toolkit to excel in finance interviews, on the job, or in entrepreneurial decision-making.",
