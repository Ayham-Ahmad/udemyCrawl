There are no theoretical textbook explanations with fictious examples. All examples used are real-life financial statements.\nMost importantly, you will be able to WRITE A CREDIT REPORT. No course out there offers you such a deal. Most courses simply tell you all the theory, derivations with no use in the actual workplace.\n\nWhat’s the point of knowing the definitions of cash flow? We teach you exactly how to write out an entire section about Cash flow analysis, the type of analysis seen in professional reports like those seen in S&P, Moody’s and Fitch.\nThis is as real as it gets to working directly in a credit risk department in a bank or a company.\nOn top of that you learn the actual CREDIT RATING. You will know what Rating to assign to a company. You won’t be lost reading about rating criteria and be stumped when it comes to the rating assignment. You will be able to confidently assign a rating and explain it professionally.\nNo more paying for hundreds or thousands of dollars and still not able to write a credit report.\nIf you are new to credit analysis, financial statements, I’d like to show you how to get started fast.\n\nIf you already have been learning a little about analyzing financial statements, I like to show you how to systematically interpret them and write credit analysis reports which will help you grow your career in the financial sector to over 6-figures salary\nI’d give you all the tools, the techniques, the systems, all the wining frameworks, templates and the exact stuff that professionals look out for in financial statements and annual reports.\nIdentify which parts of the financial statements that really matter in analysis\n\nCreate analytical reports for your job or for your own investments\nAttract headhunters and the largest companies in the world to call you for interviews\nRapidly grow your salary to the 6-figure range and broaden your choice of jobs\nWrite effective reports that read professionally which credit rating agencies like what S&P, Moody’s produce\nAnd More...\nWhat you won’t get from this Course?\nIf you are looking for textbooks, theories that won’t help you write a credit report or answer credit-related interviews, then you will be disappointed.\n\nWe used to go through tons of such materials, and yet we still struggled when asked to write a credit report on a job interview as a case study. In other words, most courses and textbooks out there do not provide the bridge from theory to reality.\n\nWe want to offer you training as good as you will get if you join a bank or a financial institution. The best suite of training materials to support you in everyway possible so that you can jump straight into any credit analyst job right away.",

      "description": "Course Introduction:\nTrade finance is at the heart of global commerce, offering the essential financial tools that facilitate international trade. Whether you’re looking to gain foundational knowledge or enhance your expertise in managing cross-border transactions, this course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of trade finance. Covering essential topics like documentary credits, letters of credit, forward contracts, and bank guarantees, it equips you with the necessary skills to navigate the complex world of global trade. Through a series of detailed lectures, learners will understand how trade finance mitigates risk, ensures liquidity, and supports businesses in conducting seamless international transactions.\n\n\nSection 1: Trade Finance Introduction\nThe first section introduces students to the fundamental principles of trade finance, which play a critical role in international trade by managing risk and ensuring payments between buyers and sellers across borders. This section outlines the various mechanisms through which trade finance supports global transactions, such as financing, risk mitigation, and liquidity management. Learners will gain an appreciation for the key players in trade finance, including banks, importers, exporters, and regulators, understanding how these institutions interact to enable smooth international trade. The lectures in this section provide a strong foundation for understanding the broader landscape of trade finance and its importance in the global economy.\nThrough this introduction, students will also explore the historical context of trade finance, learning how these practices have evolved to meet the growing demands of modern global trade. By understanding the types of risks associated with international transactions—such as credit risk, currency risk, and transportation risk—students will be better equipped to manage these risks as they progress through the course. This section sets the stage for more advanced topics by offering a holistic view of trade finance’s significance.\n\n\nSection 2: Documentary Credit\nDocumentary credit, a core concept in trade finance, is thoroughly covered in this section. It is a financial tool that provides security to both buyers and sellers by involving banks as intermediaries to ensure that payment is made only after the goods and documents have been correctly delivered. This section begins by explaining how documentary credit operates and the importance of having all terms and conditions clearly defined and agreed upon by all parties. Learners will explore the detailed steps involved in documentary credit transactions, from issuing the credit to final payment, offering a clear roadmap of how these transactions work in practice.\nThe section further delves into the roles of key participants, including importers, exporters, issuing banks, and advising banks, highlighting how each party contributes to the success of a documentary credit transaction. It also includes a thorough examination of the rules and regulations that govern documentary credits, particularly those established by the International Chamber of Commerce under the UCP 600 (Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits). By understanding these rules, students will be able to navigate complex trade finance transactions with greater confidence. The section concludes with a focus on commercial invoices, Incoterms, and checklists that ensure documentary credit compliance, giving learners practical tools to apply in real-world trade finance operations.\n\n\nSection 3: Letters of Credit\nThis section dives deeper into the mechanics of Letters of Credit (LCs), which are widely used in trade finance as instruments of payment. Letters of Credit serve as guarantees from banks that a buyer’s payment will be received on time and for the correct amount, providing assurance to sellers in international transactions. In this section, learners will understand the different types of LCs, including revocable, irrevocable, and standby LCs, along with how each is used in various trade scenarios. The lectures will also cover the common terms used in LCs, helping students to become familiar with the legal and financial language involved in drafting and interpreting these documents.\nIn addition to understanding the different types of LCs, students will gain practical insights into the documentation required for LC transactions, including shipping documents, invoices, and bills of lading. They will also learn how to identify common defects in LC documents that could delay payments or invalidate transactions. The section also introduces learners to SWIFT messages, a standardized form of communication used between banks in trade finance. Learners will explore the role of specific SWIFT messages, such as MT 700 and MT 710, and their importance in ensuring the secure transmission of LC-related information. By the end of this section, learners will be able to manage and execute LC transactions with a deep understanding of the related risks and processes.\n\n\nSection 4: Future Contracts and Forward Contracts\nFuture and forward contracts are essential financial instruments used to hedge against risks, particularly currency fluctuations, in international trade. This section offers a detailed look at how future contracts work, explaining the mechanics of these agreements and their role in stabilizing trade transactions by locking in prices for goods or currencies at a future date. Learners will also explore the role of forward contracts, which are customized agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date. By comparing these two types of contracts, students will understand their applications in different trading scenarios, particularly how they help mitigate risk in volatile markets.\nBeyond the theoretical understanding, this section will guide students through the workflow of executing forward contracts, from drafting the agreement to settlement. It also introduces key terms used in these contracts, providing learners with the necessary vocabulary to work effectively in trade finance environments. The section further includes detailed explanations of the settlement processes for forward contracts, highlighting the steps involved in closing a trade. By covering both future and forward contracts comprehensively, this section equips learners with the tools to effectively manage currency and pricing risks, which are critical in international trade transactions.\n\n\nSection 5: Bank Guarantee\nBank guarantees are another vital tool in trade finance, offering protection to both buyers and sellers by ensuring that a bank will cover a payment if the buyer defaults. In this section, learners will explore the structure and function of bank guarantees, focusing on the different types, such as demand guarantees and performance guarantees. The lectures explain how bank guarantees differ from letters of credit, particularly in their application and risk management potential. Students will learn about the various workflows involved in processing bank guarantees, from application to issuance, and how these guarantees help businesses secure trade agreements.\nThis section also delves into international standards that govern bank guarantees, including URDG 758 (Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees) and ISP 98 (International Standby Practices). These standards are critical for ensuring the enforceability and uniformity of guarantees across different jurisdictions. By understanding these rules, learners will be able to apply best practices in managing bank guarantees in global trade transactions. The final lectures in this section cover real-world examples of how bank guarantees are used in different industries, such as construction and manufacturing, giving students a practical perspective on their importance in mitigating trade risk.\n\n\nCourse Conclusion:\nThis course provides learners with an in-depth understanding of trade finance, covering key topics like documentary credits, letters of credit, forward contracts, and bank guarantees. By mastering these essential tools, students will be able to navigate the complexities of international trade with greater confidence and precision. With practical insights and real-world examples, the course equips students with the skills necessary to manage and execute trade finance transactions effectively, ensuring financial security and minimizing risks in cross-border trade.",

By using SAP In-House Cash you can reduce the number of external bank accounts you hold and the volume of foreign payments you have to make. SAP In-House Cash is implemented at a central location within a group of companies, for example, in head office.\nWith SAP In-House Cash , you can process the following transactions:\nInternal payments\nCentral payments\nLocal payments\nCentral incoming payments\nThe following graphic shows the flow of data within a group of companies that uses SAP In-House Cash in its head office.\n\n\nTo use the In-House Cash functions, make the necessary system settings in the Implementation Guide (IMG) by choosing Financial Supply Chain Management In-House Cash.\nMake the following settings in the implementation guide (IMG) under Financial Accounting for the subsidiary companies and head office.\n\n\nSAP In-House Cash is connected to the head office's Financial Accounting (FI) system, and uses its functions, such as the payment program. The affiliated companies also use Financial Accounting (FI) functions. For instance, they also use the payment program to clear open items. The IDocs generated as a result automatically forward payment orders to the in-house cash center. Electronic account statements for the house bank of the head office can be imported to Financial Accounting (FI), and the data is passed on to the in-house cash center. The affiliated companies also receive an account statement from the in-house cash center.\nIf you create an IHC financial status , you can forward this to SAP Cash Management .\n\n\nThe main component of SAP In-House Cash is the in-house cash center which processes payments between the various subsidiary companies. The in-house cash center is basically a virtual internal bank where subsidiaries hold current accounts. Current account processing depicts receivables and payables between the in-house cash center and affiliated subsidiary companies. It calculates the turnover and balances of the current accounts and forwards this information in summarized form to Financial Accounting (FI).\n\n\nYou can find the SAP In-House Cash functions on the SAP Easy Access screen under Accounting Financial Supply Chain Management In-House Cash .\nExample\nThe following graphic shows a group of companies, organized to enable both cross-bank-area and local payments:\nTwo companies use SAP In-House Cash and both serve as internal banks for a certain number of subsidiary companies.\nThey are also mutual clearing partners.\nSubsidiaries 3 and 4 carry out local payments as clearing partners for other subsidiaries.\nInternational Group Structure\nBank Area\nDefinition\nOrganizational unit of Bank Customer Accounts that allows independent account management. This also means that the account numbers that exist in a bank area must be unique.\n\n\nStructure\nCustomizing Settings\nYou make settings for bank areas in Customizing for Bank Customer Accounts (BCA). The important settings are described below:\nBank key\nCheck digit method that controls or checks the issuing of account numbers\nTime at which posting cut-off is to be automatically executed every day\nExchange rate category that stores conversion rates in the system\nCountry/region, language, and the public holiday calendar used\nSpecial Feature: Bank Area and Bank Key\nThe bank key is particularly significant, since bank keys, along with the account number, are used for the processing of payment transactions. All banks participating in payment transactions can be identified by a unique numerical labeling.\nBranch offices either have their own bank identification number or one that is related to their main office.\nThe internal organization of a bank may require several bank areas to depict the bank structure.\nOne Bank Key Can Involve Several Bank Areas\nThe system checks that the account number is unique in all bank areas with the same bank key. In addition, to avoid the creation of the same account number simultaneously in different bank areas, the system locks this account number in all bank areas belonging to the bank key.",

      "description": "Institutional wealth management involves the professional management of assets for organizations, endowments, and other large-scale entities. The goal is to grow and protect their wealth efficiently while managing risk. Institutional investors are corporations, trusts, or other legal entities that invest in financial markets on behalf of groups or individuals, including both current and future generations. Institutional wealth management is indeed a specialized field that requires expertise in navigating various financial markets and managing assets on behalf of large organizations. The goals of growing and protecting wealth efficiently while managing risk align with the fiduciary responsibilities these institutions have toward their stakeholders. It's important to highlight some key points:\nDiverse Range of Institutional Investors:\nDefined benefit and defined contribution pension plans play a significant role, collectively representing a substantial portion of global institutional assets.\nSovereign wealth funds are government-owned and contribute to the investment landscape, often with a focus on both financial and real assets.\nEndowments and foundations manage assets for charitable organizations, including educational institutions, hospitals, churches, museums, and others.\nBanks and insurance companies act as financial intermediaries, balancing portfolios to meet the financial obligations to depositors, policyholders, and creditors.\nInvestment Challenges and Constraints:\nInstitutional investors operate in a complex environment and face various challenges, such as market volatility, regulatory changes, and economic uncertainties.\nManaging large and diverse portfolios requires sophisticated strategies to optimize returns while staying within legal and regulatory constraints.\nFiduciary Responsibilities:\nInstitutional investors have fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of their clients or stakeholders. This involves making prudent investment decisions and actively managing risks.\nInvestment Risk Models:\nThe distinction between defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans emphasizes the different approaches to investment risk. In the former, the sponsor assumes risk, while in the latter, individuals make investment decisions and bear the risk.\nOverall, institutional wealth management is a dynamic and multifaceted field that necessitates a deep understanding of financial markets, risk management, and the ability to navigate a constantly evolving economic landscape.\nYou will be learning the followings:\nInstitutional Investors\nPension Plan (DB vs DC)\nDefined Benefit Plans\nReturn and Risk\nDB Plan - Time Horizon\nFoundation - Risk and Return Objectives\nFoundations - Constraints\nEndownments\nObjectives and Constraints\nInsurance Companies\nLife Insurance Companies - Return Objective\nThree Issues Affecting LI Liquidity\nLife Insurance - Time Horizon\nNon Life vs Life Insurance and Underwriting Cycle\nNon Life Insurance - Objectives\nPolicy of Total Return\nNon Life Insurance Companies - Liquidity\nBank Securities Portfolio Objectives\nSecurities Portfolio - Objectives\nSecurities Portfolio - Constraints\nAsset Liability Management\nIntroduction to Concentrated Positions\nOverview of Concentrated Positions\nInvestment Risk\nGeneral Principles and Considerations\nInstitutional and Capital Market Constraints\nGoal Based Planning\nConcentrated Wealth Decision Making\nManaging Risk and Tax\nMonitizing Strategies\nConcentrated Positions - Hedging\nConcentrated Positions - Heding Strategies\nYield Enhancement\nManaging Risk of Private Business\nConsiderations of Different Strategies\nManaging Concentrated Real Estate\nLinking Pension Liabilities to Assets\nAllocating Shareholder Capital to Pension Plans",

Remember, in Finance, there is No Free Lunch.\nThe Normal Law will be studied in details, as it is the building block of the Black Scholes model and it is extensively used in Finance.\nDetailed description of Option. Why do we need an option model, can we see an option with a static hedge: the notion of break-even\nAnother 'must know' is the Taylor Development and the mathematical Derivative, a chapter that will allow the student to learn or review these concepts.\nThe Black Scholes model and its Greeks will be analysed in detail, especially its replication theory: you will have an assessment to risk manage a dummy option portfolio until its maturity in Excel, this is a good way to understand how the Gamma/ Theta works. Back in the days when I was a trader, the seasoned option traders used to say \"you do not understand Gamma nor Theta until you lose 50K $ on it\".\nSo this live Simulation is in my opinion a very good exercise, and it saves 50K $ ;-)\nThe Vega risk management: we will prove that it is nice to be long Out of the Money options, this will be done in Excel. It will lead to the introduction of the Volga.\nIt is well known that Black Scholes is a model where nearly all of its assumptions are wrong, the smile is the answer of the Markets to this issue. We will analyse the two components of the Smile: Volga and Crisis.\nLight introduction of the SABR model as it is a representative of the Smile models: you will also perform a Calibration of SABR parameters\nEventually, we will build a Risk Management System in Excel for WTI Futures and Options. All of the previous concepts will be used to create this Excel, it will show all our Option Greeks. The first version will be built with a Flat volatility for each Future. In a second time, SABR smile will be integrated.\nA small chapter will study the interpolation methodologies, as they must be carefully chosen. The Risk Management is quiet complex, as always in finance, it is the sum of small simple process and measures, but the devil hides in the details and being wrong in the details will cost you a lot of money.\nEventually, the Option Trader Job will be presented, with daily tasks, risk measurement and P&L verification.\nSo this class is a complete overview of the option trading process from theory to practice. It has a lot of material based on Excel, and it is downloadable for the students.",

      "description": "Brands may need to be valued for a variety of reasons; some of them are listed below:\nSale of intangibles\nPurchase price allocation\nImpairment\nCollateral security\nEconomic damages/lost profits related to infringement, breach of contract, or other commercial litigation\nFinancial Reporting\nWhen valuing a brand, it is particularly important \"for whom\" that value is being determined for. The value of a particular brand is not the same for the company that owns the brand as for a company with a competing brand or for another company operating in the industry with a brand that does not compete directly with it.\nBrand valuation has been by far used for many purposes by companies.\n1. Mergers and Acquisitions: Usually, a company or an organization does not pay the book value while acquiring another business entity. Now the difference between the paid acquisition price and book value is known as Goodwill. Goodwill can be defined as the value of a business entity which is not directly attributable to its tangible assets and liabilities. Estimating the financial value using brand valuation of a brand helps us to determine the premium over book value that a buyer should be paying.\n2. Licensing: One of the approaches to take advantage of the value of a solid brand is by broadening or permitting the brand. It is feasible for both the licensor and the licensee to profit financially from an authorizing course of action. The licensor profits by another wellspring of income that requires minimal capital speculation. The licensee benefits by having a lower channel, publicizing and client obtaining costs\n3. Financing: While companies don't convey marks on their monetary records as long-term resources, money related markets perceive the commitment brands have on investor esteem. Organizations with solid brands consistently acquire preferable budgetary terms over organizations with poor brands. The higher the estimation of the brand through brand valuation, the better the terms.\n4. Brand Reviews: Usually, brand investment reviews entail the comparison, across brands and against competitors of hard measures, such as sales and market share, and soft measures, such as reputation and awareness. For some brands, it is also important to determine financial value. Brand valuations allow companies to gauge their return on brand investment and to develop appropriate investment strategies across a portfolio of brands.\n5. Budget Allocations: The marketing mix is utilized by advertisers who must settle on choices about the assignment of spending plan and assets. Organizations can now more precisely gauge the blend of promoting vehicles required to expand both spending proficiency and advertising viability. For a few organizations, brand valuations are a basic component of the marketing mix.\nPlease read the contents of course before purchasing..",

      "description": "Anti-Money Laundering (AML) includes policies, laws, and regulations to prevent criminals' financial crimes and illegal activity.Companies must comply with these regulations, even though compliance can be complex.\nAnti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to the collection of laws, law enforcement, processes, and regulations that prevent illegally obtained money from entering the financial system.\nBecause most criminals and terrorists rely significantly on laundered money for their illegal operations, having effective AML procedures in place has broader crime-reducing consequences.\nFinancial institutions are the most prominent users of AML legislation, as they are compelled to report any suspicious behavior to authorities. However, financial institutions are not only obligated to report suspicious behavior.\nAn anti-money laundering compliance program is what a company does to adhere to AML policies and regulations. An AML compliance program is also designed to expose and react to money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud-related risks.\nWhile money laundering is an international crime, many rules are local, and they can sometimes conflict with federal policies, making it difficult for financial institutions to remain compliant with rules and regulations. Some banks even decided to suspend services in countries that make it hard to stay compliant or have a reputation for facilitating money laundering",

This course offers a comprehensive exploration of financial strategy, with a focus on the theoretical frameworks that underpin sound financial planning and investment decisions. By concentrating on key principles rather than just practical application, students will develop a deep understanding of the critical concepts that guide financial success across various contexts.\nThe course begins with an introduction to foundational financial concepts, offering students a solid grounding in personal finance, investment strategies, and the overarching principles of financial planning. These early lessons are designed to ensure that learners are comfortable with the basics, enabling them to appreciate more complex financial strategies later on. Although real-world examples are referenced, the course emphasizes a theoretical approach to understanding how financial strategies can be applied to ensure sustainable growth, both personally and within businesses. Through this approach, students gain the analytical tools needed to evaluate financial opportunities and risks from an informed perspective.\nDeveloping a personal financial plan is a critical aspect of this course, guiding students through the process of creating their own financial strategies based on sound principles. This section equips learners with the knowledge to assess their financial situation, set realistic goals, and develop practical steps to achieve them. The focus remains on cultivating a strong theoretical foundation, which supports the ability to make informed decisions in various financial contexts. By mastering these concepts, students will be prepared to navigate their own financial journeys with confidence.\nInvestment strategies form a key part of the course, where learners are introduced to the fundamental principles of investing. This section goes beyond just explaining different types of investments and delves into the underlying theories that support successful long-term investment planning. Students will gain insight into how diverse investment strategies can be applied to create financial stability and growth, learning to evaluate different asset classes, risks, and returns. By focusing on the strategic thinking behind investment decisions, the course ensures that students can adapt to a wide range of financial environments.\nBudgeting and saving strategies are also central to the curriculum, and students will be introduced to the theoretical models that support effective budgeting. This section provides an understanding of how to allocate resources wisely, manage financial constraints, and create saving plans that align with personal or business financial objectives. Again, while the course references practical approaches, the emphasis is on the strategic thinking that allows individuals and organizations to adapt their financial plans over time.\nAnother key aspect of the course involves aligning financial strategies with broader business goals. Students will explore how financial objectives and business strategies can be harmonized to ensure long-term success. This section emphasizes the importance of strategic financial planning, offering a theoretical foundation for how businesses can use financial planning as a tool for growth and competitiveness. By focusing on the integration of financial and business strategies, the course provides valuable insight into how financial decisions impact organizational goals.\nFinally, students will learn to evaluate and adjust financial strategies in response to changing circumstances, preparing them to navigate the complexities of financial decision-making in dynamic environments. This section reinforces the importance of flexibility and continuous evaluation, ensuring that financial strategies remain aligned with both personal and organizational goals.\nThroughout the course, students will be equipped with the theoretical tools necessary to develop effective financial strategies. By the end, they will have a deeper understanding of how to apply these strategies to achieve personal financial stability and to support business growth.",

Risk managers must not only recognize these risks but also apply structured frameworks to monitor, measure, and mitigate them.\nIn this course, you will (all taught in English):\nExplore the six major types of risk: market, credit, operational, liquidity, model, and emerging risks.\nLearn how each risk type impacts financial institutions and why regulators emphasize their management.\nStudy the Basel Accords (Basel I, II, III) and understand how global standards evolved in response to crises.\nExamine Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and COSO frameworks, and how organizations use them for governance and internal controls.\nReview the 2008 financial crisis as a case study of how weaknesses in risk management triggered global instability — and how Basel III reforms were designed to prevent a repeat.\nThis is not just theory. Each section connects practical examples with exam-relevant knowledge, giving you a balanced view for both FRM preparation and real-world application.\nBy the end of this Nano course, you will be able to confidently (in English):\nClassify and explain different types of risk.\nUnderstand the role of global risk frameworks in maintaining financial stability.\nRecognize the importance of lessons learned from past crises.\nBuild a solid foundation for FRM Part I success.\nThis course is designed to be short, practical, and focused, delivering maximum value in under an hour. Whether you are an FRM candidate, a student in finance, or a professional looking for a refresher, this course gives you the essential building blocks for your journey into financial risk management — all in clear English.",

This course is based on learning how to apply data storytelling concepts and techniques to deliver client financial advice as a compelling narrative. Your learning will be enriched with quizzes and reading materials augmented with hands-on learning assignments.\nFinancial Data Storytelling Concepts: This lesson introduces the key concepts of storytelling in the context of financial advisory services. It focuses on the importance of effective communications, the challenges advisors face when conveying financial data, and how storytelling can bridge the gap between numbers and client comprehension. The content further enables students to understand some of the limitations that exist when presenting data as a series of tables and charts without an engaging narrative.\nVisualization Techniques for Financial Data: This lesson focuses on the importance of data visualization in understanding patterns and relationships within financial data. The concepts of structural patterns and flow relationships are introduced to provide criteria for effective charting techniques. Sankey diagrams are introduced as a powerful technique to consider, and the rationale for this is described.

The main currency and valuation types are:\nCompany Code Currency (Local):\n10: Legal Valuation (statutory view)\n11: Group Valuation (eliminates internal profits)\n12: Profit Center Valuation (internal transfer prices)\nGroup Currency:\n30: Legal Valuation\n31: Group Valuation\n32: Profit Center Valuation\nHard Currency:\nUsed for countries with high inflation or for global comparability.\n40: Legal Valuation\n41: Group Valuation\n42: Profit Center Valuation\nIndex-Based Currency:\nSupports inflation accounting.\n50: Legal Valuation\n51: Group Valuation\n52: Profit Center Valuation\nGlobal Company Currency:\nUsed for global consolidation and reporting.\n60: Legal Valuation\n61: Group Valuation\n62: Profit Center Valuation\n3. Concept Overview\nThis financial architecture empowers organizations to:\nMaintain Parallel Ledgers:\nSupport different accounting principles (e.g., IFRS, US GAAP) simultaneously, ensuring compliance with various statutory requirements.\nMulti-Dimensional Valuation:\nValue inventory and COGS in several currencies and from different perspectives (legal, group, profit center), supporting both external and internal reporting.\nReal-Time, Integrated Reporting:\nThe Universal Journal (table ACDOCA) merges financial and controlling data, enabling real-time, multi-dimensional analytics and reporting from a single source of truth.\nComprehensive Compliance:\nMeet local, group, and global reporting requirements within a unified, integrated system, reducing complexity and risk.\n4. Transfer Pricing Concepts\nIntercompany Transfer Pricing:\nManages the pricing of goods and services exchanged between different legal entities within the same corporate group. Ensures transactions are recorded at arm’s length prices, supporting tax compliance, transparency, and accurate group reporting. The Material Ledger automatically tracks these flows and valuations.\nIntracompany Transfer Pricing:\nHandles transactions between different profit centers or segments within the same legal entity. Enables organizations to analyze internal profitability, allocate costs, and measure the performance of individual business units, while maintaining consistency with external reporting.\n5. Integration and Reporting\nAll valuation views (legal, group, profit center) are stored in the Universal Journal, allowing for seamless, real-time reporting and analytics. This supports both statutory and management reporting requirements, providing transparency and insight across the entire value chain.",

Unlike profitability, which is often influenced by accounting practices, cash flow analysis provides a clear picture of liquidity and solvency. By analysing a company's cash flow, stakeholders can evaluate its ability to sustain operations, invest in growth, and meet financial obligations.\nCash flow analysis examines a company’s cash inflows and outflows over a specific period to assess financial health. It involves examining the movement of cash into and out of a business over a specific period. It provides a detailed view of how a company generates and uses cash in its operations, investments, and financing activities. Unlike profitability measures, which accounting practices can influence, cash flow analysis focuses purely on liquidity and solvency.\nThis lecture aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of cash flow analysis, focusing on its significance, methodology, and practical application in financial decision-making.\nThis lecture is designed for students, professionals, and business owners who wish to enhance their financial management skills and gain insights into the liquidity and operational efficiency of a business.\nThe primary aim of this lecture is to equip participants with the knowledge and tools necessary to analyse and interpret cash flow statements effectively, ensuring better financial planning and strategic decision-making.\nBy the end of this lecture, students will have a clear understanding of the structure and components of a cash flow statement, be able to differentiate between operating, investing, and financing activities, and calculate key cash flow metrics for real-world application.",

      "description": "THE ULTIMATE STUDENT LOAN COURSE - LEARN HOW TO GET DEBT FREE AND TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR PERSONAL FINANCES!  BREAK FREE FROM YOUR STUDENT LOANS!\nSet yourself up for success and take full control of your student loans - from Repayment to Refinancing.\nWith years of experience coaching folks to pay back their student loans and helping my student save $750k in interest, I have gained a lot of valuable experience and knowledge. And today, we want to share that information with you. We’ll help you take the first (or second) step in getting debt free.\nIn this course, we have simplified the student loan process. One that typically brings stress, uneasiness, and frustration will no longer do so as you understand and take control of your finances.\nThe student loan industry is an ever-changing landscape. This course will serve as your roadmap to navigating the steps and ensuring you are on your way to being debt free!\nSo, whether you’re 250k in debt, or 15k in debt – let this course be the first step of a lucrative and debt free life.\nCourse enrollment grants you lifetime access, with no expiration, to all the course lectures, activities, handouts, and quizzes. In addition, you’ll also receive 1-on-1 support for any questions or uncertainties that come up. And this all comes with a money-back guarantee. You have nothing to lose and so much to gain.\nWhy pay off your student loans in the first place?\n1. Eliminate monthly payments – Let’s be honest, nobody likes paying monthly on debt. So, you’ll be happy to hear that we dive through   specifics so that can have the $500 payment back in your pocket as quickly as possible.\n2. Your interest rates are killing you, REFINANCE TODAY – Your private loans likely have HIGH interest rates that are causing you to pay $1,000's and $10,000's in added money to banks.  Lowering your interest rates = keeping more $$$$ for yourself.\n3. Live debt free – Debt sucks.  I get it. I graduated college and came out of school with $30K in student loan debt.  Not knowing what to do, I studied the ins and outs of student loans for 3 months and taught myself the best way to refinance student loans.  Through this process I was able to refinance not only my loans, but also my 2 siblings student loans and save the 3 of us a combined $75K in future interest.\n4. Take control of your personal finances – Most people don't pay off their student loans until well into their 30s and sometimes 40s.  A 4-year degree should not cost you 20 years of your life.\n5. Educate yourself – Knowing more about student loans not only will help you with paying them off faster, but also help you know more about personal finance and deepen your knowledge in an oftentimes neglected area of your life.  80% of your decisions are made off money, so you might as well get a grip on it!\nSo if you’re looking for a challenging and rewarding career, I highly encourage you to take the interview prep seriously!\nJust ask the students who’ve already taken this course:\n★★★★★ Have learned more about Student Loans and personal finances in 30 minutes the 20 years of school. Through the refinancing process I was able to save ~$8000 in interest by refinancing my private student loans. The excel spreadsheet is extremely helpful for keeping track of loans. Highly recommend this course! --Emily Bowe\n★★★★★ Such a great course! Very happy I was able to take it!-- Logan Guest\n★★★★★ This is just what I have been looking for. I have previously been kind of lost scouring YouTube for help with refinancing, and have come to a dead end (watch a few hour+ long videos that didn't get me anywhere). I appreciate how this information is current and gets right to the point. Definitely will rewatch as I am working through this process and look forward to any future content. This should be 101 requirement for any student entering college. -- Mark James\n★★★★★ As a recent college graduate, I think it is important to understand student loans and how they can be adjusted according to one’s lifestyle. I think this course did a great job in explaining the basic of student loans and how to approach refinancing them. Would definitely recommend to others! -- Zach Hust\n\n\nWhat exactly is included in this course?\nStudent Loan Basics – learn what your loans actually are\n\n\nA breakdown of each of the types of loans\n\n\nLearn how to properly refinance your loans, and which loans not to refinance\n\n\nGain insight into how much your loans will cost to pay back.\nExample: $30,000 Loan, 7% Interest Rate, 15 year term = $270/month payment and $18,537 in interest\nYou pay $48,537 for a $30,000 Loan!!!! - You're getting screwed!!\nStill Unsure?\nI understand – why this course, why not just google and youtube your way to student loan success… so here’s a list of extra bonuses that are included, as part of your enrollment to the course:\n- Comprehensive student loan spreadsheet - so you never feel unprepared again!\n- A Guide to Refinancing – there's a right and wrong way to do it.  You might as well go with the right.\nAnd if you’re still not sure – here’s my promise to you:\nThis course comes with a money-back guarantee! That means, if you aren’t completely satisfied with your purchase, I’ll give you a refund – no questions asked!\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have the knowledge and the means to apply that knowledge, to not only your student loans – but your entire personal finances.\nSo, if you have any interest at all in making your career a successful one, enroll today, and get started learning the fundamentals of the student loan process today!\nWhat you’ll learn\nFederal vs Private Loans\nHow to properly pay back loans\nMinimizing your interest payments\nHow to refinance\nHow to pay off your loans faster\nWhat to pay off first\nPersonal finance tips and mindset\nAre there any course requirements or prerequisites?\nNo\nWho this course is for:\nRecent grads and individuals with student loans\nFolks looking to get debt free\nFinancial Advisers\nThose who want to level up their personal finances",

Do you prefer to find what works under which circumstance than spend time and energy complaining about how difficult it is to get funded?\n\n\nWelcome to this program, a comprehensive program in easy to understand, short chunks organized in a way that you can think differently and act upon it, so you can get the resources you need to start and grow your company.\n\n\nThis programs helps individuals learn how to fund start-ups, causes, projects inside organizations or corporations and existing companies.\nIt integrates funding needs with investment needs, and provides a conceptual understanding of the funding mechanisms so you can think strategically, and be proactive, instead of reactive, to funding.\nThe course is structured in six sessions:\n1. Basic concepts and mindset;\n2. Funding mechanisms (unfunding, debt and equity);\n3. Unfunding (crowdsourcing, factoring, leasing, disappearing);\n4. Equity funding (founders, family, friends, partners, angels, VC);\n5. Debt (short-term, long term) and\n6. Funding strategy.\nWe provide a format useful to many learning styles: whether you learn by watching, listening or doing. If you need the \"helicopter view\" or if you want to dive deeper into details, with templates, discussion guides and other resources.\n\n\nI created the program because funding is a PROCESS, not a series of unconnected events. There is a special session for minorities, that is related to overcoming internal battles, imposter syndrome and reactions from others that throw founders into a negative spiral.\n\n\nThe program is also useful to investors, relatives and friends and consultants who are curious about funding as a process and would like to provide better support.",

      "description": "1. Understanding the Need for Universal Parallel Accounting (UPA)\n1.1 Traditional Limitations in SAP ERP\nHistorically, SAP ERP systems allowed organizations to maintain multiple ledgers in the General Ledger (GL) to support different accounting standards such as IFRS, local GAAP, and tax regulations. However, this multi-ledger capability was not consistently available across all submodules. Modules like Controlling (CO), Asset Accounting (AA), and the Material Ledger (ML) often operated in silos, supporting only a single valuation or requiring complex workarounds for parallel accounting.\nThis led to several challenges:\nFragmented Reporting: Financial reporting could be ledger-specific, but cost management and internal reporting were not, leading to inconsistencies.\nManual Reconciliation: Adjustments for compliance and reconciliation between different accounting standards had to be performed manually, increasing the risk of errors and inefficiencies.\nLimited Transparency: The lack of end-to-end multi-ledger support made it difficult to achieve real-time, transparent, and reconciled financial data across the enterprise.\n1.2 SAP’s Breakthrough: Universal Parallel Accounting (UPA)\nTo address these limitations, SAP introduced Universal Parallel Accounting (UPA) with the S/4HANA . UPA represents a fundamental redesign of the ERP architecture, enabling true end-to-end support for multiple accounting principles across all relevant modules.\nKey innovations include:\nNative Multi-Ledger Support: All submodules (FI, CO, AA, ML, COPA) now natively support multiple ledgers.\nReal-Time, Accurate Reporting: Every business event is posted to all relevant ledgers automatically, ensuring real-time, reconciled reporting.\nHarmonized System Architecture: UPA provides a unified platform for legal, group, and management reporting, eliminating data silos and manual reconciliation.\n2. Core Capabilities of UPA in SAP S/4HANA\n2.1 Seamless Ledger-Specific Integration\nUPA enables seamless, ledger-specific financial processing across key modules:\nGeneral Ledger (GL): Multi-ledger postings for all financial transactions.\nFixed Assets (AA): Ledger-specific asset valuation and depreciation.\nCost Centers (CO): Cost management and allocations per ledger.\nProduct Costing (PC): Ledger-specific cost estimates and actuals.\nInventory Valuation (MM): Real-time, multi-ledger inventory valuation.\nEvent-Based Production Costing: Immediate cost postings for production events.\nMargin Analysis (Account-based COPA): Profitability analysis by ledger.\nThis integration ensures that every business event is reflected in all relevant ledgers, eliminating the need for manual reconciliation and ensuring data consistency.\n2.2 Flexible Costing per Accounting Principle\nWith UPA, organizations can:\nMaintain Separate Costs: Standard, planned, and actual costs can be maintained for each ledger.\nRun Ledger-Specific Cost Estimates: Product costing can be aligned with different accounting rules (e.g., local vs. group GAAP).\nConfigure Cost Structures: Distinct cost component structures, overhead rates, and costing variants can be set by ledger.\nThis flexibility allows businesses to comply with multiple accounting standards while maintaining accurate and transparent cost data.\n2.3 Fully Ledger-Specific Asset Valuation\nAsset Accounting under UPA supports:\nMultiple Depreciation Areas: Each tied to a specific ledger.\nDifferent Methods and Useful Lives: Per accounting standard.\nLedger-Specific Depreciation Runs: Ensuring accurate reporting in IFRS, local GAAP, etc.\nThis ensures that asset values and depreciation are accurately reflected in each ledger, supporting both statutory and management reporting.\n2.4 Event-Driven Finance Processes\nUPA supports event-based postings for:\nOverhead Calculation\nProduction Work in Process (WIP)\nVariance Calculation\nSettlement Processes\nEvery operational event (e.g., production confirmation, goods issue) triggers real-time financial updates per ledger, providing immediate insight into financial performance.\n3. Architecture of UPA: Ledgers and Valuation Views\n3.1 Ledgers in S/4HANA\nUPA operates through a multi-ledger framework:\nLeading Ledger (0L): Used for global accounting (typically IFRS).\nNon-Leading Ledgers (e.g., 2L, 4G, 5P):\n2L: Local GAAP\n4G: Group reporting\n5P: Profit center-specific view\nEach ledger is assigned a valuation view, allowing financial transactions to be evaluated differently across legal entities, consolidation groups, or internal management views.\n3.2 Universal Journal (ACDOCA)\nAll postings flow into the Universal Journal table (ACDOCA), which serves as the single source of truth for all financial and controlling data. This unified structure:\nEliminates Data Silos: All modules post to the same table.\nEnables Real-Time Reporting: Immediate availability of valuation-specific data.\nSupports Auditability: Complete traceability of all postings.\n4. Real-World Scenarios with UPA\n4.1 Fixed Asset Depreciation (Multi-Ledger)\nScenario: A machine is purchased for ₹1,00,000.\nIFRS (0L): Straight-line depreciation over 5 years.\nLocal GAAP (2L): Declining balance over 3 years.\nWith UPA:\nThe asset master includes ledger-dependent depreciation areas.\nMonthly depreciation is automatically posted with different values to both ledgers.\nReports show side-by-side comparisons with no manual effort.\n4.2 Ledger-Specific Costing and Production Orders\nScenario: A production order is created.\nIFRS ledger (0L): Values raw materials at standard cost.\nGroup ledger (4G): Uses transfer prices or eliminates markup.\nAt period-end:\nEach ledger calculates and settles its own WIP, variances, and actual costs.\nThe controlling and financial results match perfectly across systems.\n4.3 Event-Based Production Accounting\nScenario: As production events occur (goods issue, confirmation, goods receipt), costs are posted in real time to all relevant ledgers, ensuring immediate visibility and eliminating the need for period-end reconciliations.\n5. UPA Architecture Setup and Configuration\n5.1 Universal Journal (ACDOCA) as the Foundation\nUPA is built upon the Universal Journal (ACDOCA), which centralizes postings from FI, CO, and ML into a single source of truth. This harmonized architecture:\nEliminates Data Silos: Financial and managerial reporting are fully integrated.\nEnables Real-Time Integration: Data consistency is maintained across all modules.\nStreamlines Reconciliation: Financial close processes are faster and more accurate.\n5.2 Ledger Configuration via FINSC_LEDGER\nUsing the FINSC_LEDGER Fiori app, organizations can configure multiple ledgers:\nLeading Ledger (0L): Typically assigned for legal valuation.\nAdditional Ledgers: Defined for group and profit center valuation.\nMulti-Currency Support: Each ledger can support up to five currencies (company code, group, hard, index-based, global company).\nThis configuration enables powerful multi-dimensional financial reporting and enhances compliance with global accounting standards.\n6. Event-Based Costing in UPA\n6.1 Event-Based WIP and Variance Setup\nWith Event-Based Posting (EBP) activated:\nWIP and Variance: Posted in real time as production progresses.\nValuation Areas: Defined for each ledger.\nAutomatic Account Determination: Ensures postings are routed to the correct accounts.\nEvent-Based Costing Sheet: Calculates overhead instantly, replacing conventional period-end calculations.\nThis approach enhances cost accuracy and provides real-time insights into production performance.\n6.2 Costing Variant Setup in UPA\nCosting variants are designed per valuation view to support legal, group, and profit center reporting. Each variant includes:\nCosting Type: Standard or planned cost.\nValuation Variant: Governs how material costs, activity prices, and subcontracting values are determined.\nOverhead Costing Rules: Configured per ledger.\nThis ensures that cost estimates and actual costs reflect the appropriate valuation logic for each ledger.\n7. Material Ledger with Multiple Currencies and Valuations\n7.1 Multi-Currency and Multi-Valuation Support\nUPA requires the Material Ledger (ML) to be enabled, supporting up to five parallel currencies:\n10: Company Code Currency\n30: Group Currency\n40: Hard Currency\n50: Index-Based Currency\n60: Global Company Currency\nEach currency is mapped with corresponding valuation types such as Legal, Group, and Profit Center, enabling:\nMulti-GAAP Reporting: Simultaneous reporting across different accounting standards.\nReal-Time Inventory Valuation: Accurate, up-to-date inventory values in all relevant currencies and valuation views.\n7.2 Ledger-Specific CKMLCP Runs\nMaterial Ledger closing (CKMLCP) is performed per ledger:\nCKMLCP–0L: For IFRS (0L)\nCKMLCP–2L: For Local GAAP (2L)\nThis ensures correct Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM) and inventory valuation per ledger.\n8. Asset Accounting with Ledger-Specific Valuation\n8.1 Ledger-Specific Asset Valuation\nUPA introduces ledger-specific Asset Accounting, where each ledger uses its own:\nDepreciation Area\nDepreciation Key\nUseful Life\nExample:\nAsset in 0L: 10 years (IFRS) with Depreciation Key - LINS\nAsset in 2L: 10 years (LOGA) with Depreciation Key - S150\nValues are posted to ACDOCA per ledger and flow into cost centers/orders, enabling event-based capitalization and depreciation.\n9. Universal Allocation\n9.1 Replacing Classic Allocation Cycles\nUPA replaces old allocation cycles (KSU5, KSV5, etc.) with Universal Allocation, which supports:\nLedger-Specific Cost Allocations: Costs are allocated differently in each ledger based on accounting logic.\nReal-Time Allocation: Costs to production and actual activity rates are posted immediately.\nEnhanced Auditability: All allocations are fully traceable and transparent.\nExample: Cost center allocations post differently in 0L vs 2L, reflecting the specific requirements of each accounting standard.\n10. Value Flow to Material Ledger from Asset Accounting and Controlling\n10.1 End-to-End Value Flow\nAsset Acquisition: Capitalized in 0L and 2L separately.\nDepreciation Postings: Flow to cost centers (CO).\nProduction Orders: Absorb asset usage (e.g., machine hours).\nMaterial Ledger: Captures and settles actual costs to inventory via CKMLCP per ledger.\nThis integrated value flow ensures that all costs are accurately captured and reported in the appropriate ledgers.\n11. Event-Based Costing in Different Manufacturing Scenarios\n11.1 Make-to-Stock (MTS) with Product Cost Collector\nProduct Costing by Period: Used in MTS or Repetitive Manufacturing via Product Cost Collectors (PCCs).\nEvent-Based Costing (EBC): Costs are posted in real time at each production event.\nNo Batch Jobs Required: WIP calculation, variance analysis, and overhead posting are all event-driven.\nSimplified Cost Management: PCC-based costing avoids order-by-order tracking in high-volume environments.\n11.2 Make-to-Order (MTO) with Sales Order Costing\nUnified Architecture: ACDOCA captures all postings in real time.\nParallel Ledger Configuration: Each sales order is costed and accounted for in all relevant ledgers.\nEvent-Based Costing Execution: Goods issue, order confirmation, and goods receipt trigger automatic postings.\nImmediate Profitability Analysis: Real-time data supports faster month-end closings and improved accuracy.\n11.3 Co- and By-Product Costing\nCo-Product Handling: Costs are split using equivalence numbers; all co-products are treated as primary outputs.\nBy-Product Handling: Credited to the production order with a reduced value, reducing the total cost of the main product.\nReal-Time Costing: Each product is costed in real time with respect to its valuation view.\nAccurate Profitability Analysis: Real-time postings to multiple ledgers ensure precise allocation and reporting.\n12. Subcontracting Flow in UPA\n12.1 Real-Time Subcontracting Accounting\nComponent Issue to Vendor: Material cost is posted in real time to the appropriate ledgers.\nGoods Receipt from Vendor: Service cost and WIP are posted immediately across all valuation views.\nSubcontracting Charges: Automatically allocated and reported per ledger.\nThis ensures that all subcontracting activities are accurately reflected in financial and controlling reports.\n13. Transfer Pricing Concepts in UPA\n13.1 Intercompany Transfer Pricing\nManages Pricing: For goods and services exchanged between different legal entities within the same corporate group.\nArm’s Length Transactions: Ensures compliance with tax regulations and accurate group reporting.\nMaterial Ledger Tracking: Automatically tracks intercompany flows and valuations.\n13.2 Intracompany Transfer Pricing\nHandles Transactions: Between different profit centers or segments within the same legal entity.\nInternal Profitability Analysis: Enables allocation of costs and measurement of business unit performance.\nConsistency with External Reporting: Maintained through integrated postings.\n14. Integration with Profitability Analysis (COPA)\n14.1 Account-Based COPA Integration\nValuation-Specific Profitability Views: Legal, group, or profit center.\nReal-Time Revenue and Cost Flows: Posted instantly to COPA.\nSegment Profitability Tracking: For co-products and by-products.\nAccurate Margin Analysis: By-product values reduce COGS, influencing segment margins.\n15. Month-End Closing and Reporting in UPA\n15.1 Elimination of Period-End Bottlenecks\nEvent-Based Postings: All cost events are posted at runtime.\nNo Need for Repetitive Closing Steps: Closing becomes a review and adjustment task.\nFaster Close Cycles: Improve stakeholder confidence and reporting accuracy.\n15.2 Enhanced Reporting and Compliance\nLedger-Specific and Valuation-Specific Data: Enables accurate reporting across different accounting standards.\nComparative Profitability Analysis: Across legal entities and business units.\nAutomated Compliance: Supports tax, audit, and intercompany reporting.\n16. Key Benefits of UPA with Event-Based Costing and Asset Accounting\nReal-Time, Ledger-Wise WIP and Variance Posting\nSupport for Multiple Valuation Standards (Local GAAP, IFRS)\nLedger-Specific Depreciation for Improved Asset Control\nUnified Reporting Base Across FI, CO, ML, and AA\nNo Period-End Bottlenecks, Faster Close Processes\nAccurate COGM per Ledger Using CKMLCP\nUniversal Allocation for Transparent Internal Charging\n17. Conclusion: End-to-End Cost Transparency with UPA and Event-Based Costing\nUniversal Parallel Accounting (UPA) in SAP S/4HANA, combined with Event-Based Costing, delivers a future-proof, high-fidelity financial ecosystem.\nKeywords: UPA, Event-Based Costing, SAP S/4HANA CO, Co-Product, By-Product, ACDOCA, Profit Center Valuation, Material Ledger, Real-Time Costing, Account-Based COPA, Universal Allocation, Multi-Ledger, Multi-Currency, Asset Accounting, Transfer Pricing, Subcontracting, Financial Close, Compliance, Reporting.",

By reading a financial statement, you can see all the money that goes and comes into the budget, all the income, and the expenses that a certain company has.\nA financial statement might not have all the information with the deepest details, however, it has a lot of data that can be used in order to understand how the company is doing if you wish to invest or collaborate and partner with it.\nThe topic of Financial statement is huge, therefore needs a lot of time to learn about it. In this course, you will learn the basics first. The focus will be on how to read financial statements, learn what are the components of it, and what do they mean. Since the financial statement document has a lot of information and it seems overwhelming for someone to see it for the first time, this course is focused on simplifying that process.\nThe structure of the course will consist in explaining first what is Financial Statement, the history behind it, and how it progressed to what we know it as today. There are four main tables in a statement, and you will learn about each one of them, what is it, and how to read it. As in all other courses provided by Abdullah, you will analyze the information based on a case study that is a financial statement of a real company, data that can be found publicly. A real example will help correlate better the theory with practicality.\nAt the end of the course, you will also find out beyond the scope of the financial statements, about the other details the companies usually share that are not part of a financial statement, however, is important information to be considered.",

Below is the streamlined process applied to a Sales Order-based Make-to-Order (MTO) scenario using Event-Based Costing by Period.\n1. System Core: Unified Architecture\nACDOCA (Universal Journal) is the single source of truth for all financial and controlling postings.\nReal-time, valuation-specific data is captured in Legal, Group, and Profit Center views.\nResult: No reconciliation needed between FI and CO—everything is integrated instantly.\n2. Parallel Ledger Configuration\nLeading Ledger (0L): Used for statutory/legal valuation.\nNon-Leading Ledgers: Additional ledgers defined for Group and Profit Center Valuation.\nMulti-Currency Setup: Each ledger can have up to 5 currencies (e.g., 10 = Legal, 30 = Group).\nResult: Enables comprehensive reporting across multiple valuation views simultaneously.\n3. Event-Based Costing Execution (EBC)\nCost Events Triggered Automatically:\nGoods Issue\nOrder Confirmation\nGoods Receipt\nAutomatic Calculation & Posting of:\nOverheads\nWIP (Work in Process)\nProduction Variances\nResult: Real-time financial impact of each production event—no need for month-end processing.\n4. Costing Variant per Valuation View\nSeparate Costing Variants maintained for each valuation type (Legal, Group, Profit Center).\nValuation Variant: Determines how material costs are picked.\nOverhead Keys: Applied by valuation view to control cost allocation logic.\nResult: Precise planned vs. actual cost control for each ledger.\n5. Material Ledger: Real-Time Multi-Valuation\nML supports up to 5 currencies and 3 valuation views.\nEvery transaction posts simultaneously in Legal, Group, and Profit Center valuations.\nResult: Inventory and cost transparency across all dimensions (legal, management, and operational).\nConclusion\nIn the MTO scenario under UPA with EBC, each sales order is costed and accounted for in real-time, with valuation-specific tracking and reporting. This leads to:\nFaster month-end closings\nImproved accuracy in profitability analysis\nComplete transparency of cost flows at every level",

From analyzing potential deals and building robust financial models to understanding value creation levers and navigating complex exit strategies, mastering LBOs is critical for success in roles focused on M&A, leveraged finance, and direct investing. Yet, finding comprehensive, practical, and interview-focused training can be challenging.\nThis course, \"Unlock Private Equity Careers: The Complete LBO Bootcamp,\" is your definitive solution. Designed specifically for ambitious finance students and early-career professionals like you, this course provides a concise yet incredibly thorough journey through the entire LBO lifecycle.\nForget scattered resources and theoretical-only approaches; we focus on building the practical skills and conceptual understanding you need to excel both on the job and, crucially, in your interviews.\nWhat will you achieve by taking this course?\nThis isn't just about theory; it's about application. We combine engaging video lectures with detailed real-world case studies, practical exercises, and targeted interview preparation to ensure you can confidently apply what you learn. You will:\nMaster the Fundamentals: Grasp the core mechanics of what an LBO is, why PE firms use leverage, and what makes an ideal target company. We'll demystify the process, covering the typical timeline and the key players involved.\nNavigate Transaction Dynamics: Understand the complete deal lifecycle, from deal sourcing and target identification through rigorous due diligence, complex valuation methods (including DCF, Comps, and Precedents in an LBO context), financing structures, and the intricacies of deal execution and closing. We analyze famous deals like RJR Nabisco, Alliance Boots, and Hilton to see these dynamics in action.\nUnlock Financial Engineering Secrets: Dive deep into capital structure optimisation. Learn how PE firms balance debt and equity, understand the different debt tranches (senior, mezzanine, high-yield), calculate and leverage the strategic value of interest tax shields, and critically evaluate techniques like dividend recapitalizations and refinancing. You'll learn to calculate and interpret key PE return metrics like IRR and MOIC. We explore complex cases like TXU, First Data, and Kinder Morgan.\nDrive Operational Value Creation: Learn how PE firms create value beyond financial engineering. Understand post-acquisition operational improvement strategies, the structure and purpose of a 100-Day Plan, and how effective Management Equity Plans (MEPs) are designed to align incentives and motivate leadership teams, using cases like Dunkin' Brands and Hertz.\nMaster LBO Modelling: Move beyond theory and build practical skills using our five-layer framework. You'll work through guided exercises to construct key components of an LBO model in Excel, including debt schedules, cash flow waterfalls, equity value bridges, and covenant analysis – essential technical skills for any aspiring PE or IB professional.\nStrategize Exits & Manage Risk: Evaluate the various LBO exit strategies – IPO, Strategic Sale, Secondary Buyout – and understand the critical importance of timing and market conditions. Analyze capital structure risk, covenant breaches, and mitigation techniques through case studies like Caesars Entertainment.\nUnderstand the Bigger Picture: Engage with the critical ethical considerations surrounding LBOs, including the impact on employees and other stakeholders, using controversial examples like Toys \"R\" Us to develop a nuanced perspective.\nAce Your Interviews: This course culminates in dedicated interview preparation, providing typical technical and conceptual questions (and model answers) across all key LBO topics, specifically designed to build your confidence and competence for securing roles in Private Equity and Investment Banking.\n\n\nWhy THIS LBO Course?\nComprehensive & Concise: Covers the entire LBO lifecycle and key concepts efficiently without unnecessary fluff.\nCase Study Driven: Learn through analyzing over ten real-world LBO deals – understanding successes and failures from Gibson Greetings to Dollar General.\nPractical Application: Includes hands-on exercises in LBO modelling, 100-Day Plan design, and MEP structuring.\nInterview Focused: Dedicated sections and Q&A practice specifically designed to prepare you for demanding PE/IB recruitment processes.\nStructured Learning: Logical flow, clear explanations, supporting materials (briefing notes, scripts, checklists, model answers, spreadsheets) for every step.\n\n\nThis course is your essential toolkit if you are:\nAn aspiring or current Investment Banking / Private Equity Analyst or Associate needing to solidify your LBO knowledge for interviews and deal work.\nAn MBA or Finance Student targeting competitive roles in high finance.\nA Corporate Development professional seeking to understand PE deal dynamics.\n\n\nStop feeling unprepared for LBO discussions and technical interview questions.\nEnroll in \"Unlock Private Equity Careers: The Complete LBO Bootcamp\" today and gain the critical knowledge and confidence you need to accelerate your finance career!",

      "description": "The concept of leverage is used by both investors and companies. Investors use leverage to significantly increase the returns that can be provided on an investment. They lever their investments by using various instruments, including options, futures, and margin accounts. Companies can use leverage to finance their assets. In other words, instead of issuing stock to raise capital, companies can use debt financing to invest in business operations in an attempt to increase shareholder value. To properly evaluate these statistics, it is important to keep in mind that leverage comes in several varieties, including operating, financial, and combined leverage. Fundamental analysis uses the degree of operating leverage. One can calculate the degree of operating leverage by dividing the percentage change of a company's earnings per share (EPS) by its percentage change in its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) over a period. Similarly, one could calculate the degree of operating leverage by dividing a company's EBIT by EBIT less interest expense. A higher degree of operating leverage shows a higher level of volatility in a company's EPS. In this course, the students will learn:\nConcept of Leverage\nConcept & Calculation of Operating Leverage\nDegree of Operating Leverage\nConcept & Calculation of Financial Leverage\nDegree of Financial Leverage\nConstruction of Income Statement using Leverage",

Prior to that, a bank loan officer or a mortgage company or a credit card company would have to actually review the report manually, whereas now, it is all automated using this FICO credit number.\nLenders, such as banks and credit card companies, use credit scores to assess the possible risk posed by lending money to consumers and to diminish their losses due to bad debt. Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate, and what credit limits. Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue.\nCredit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, employers, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques.\nWe will go over the various scoring systems and how a credit score is affected by late payments and balances.We will also show how various scoring models from FICO to to FICO 10 T can vary. In the model we use, it will vary by 63 points.",

We all know that we should plan, budget and take care of money and our spending. But how many of us do it? We are supposed to rationalise each purchase and think upfront about whether we can afford something and whether we need the item we want to buy. Or is this purchase just a way of satisfying our infinite wants?\n\n\nMost of us wish we learned about money before our 20’s so by the time we are 30 we have some savings, investments and we understand how to manage the money.\n\"We wish we didn’t make so many mistakes, didn’t waste hundreds of pounds on useless purchases. We wish they taught us more about money at school,\" says Lisa.\n\n\nWithout high quality financial education, all young people are at some risk of having poor financial capability. It is particularly important to ensure that the approach to financial education in schools meets the needs of these and all young people.\nThis is why we've created the graduate money course, to educate you about the topics that will help you when it come to personal finance. As the next level up from our 'Teenager Money' course, graduate money will cover more topics and go into more depth over previous topics.\n\n\nUK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) : 10081110.",

      "description": "Welcome to the fascinating world of the time value of money! This concept serves as a cornerstone in the realm of finance, guiding individuals and businesses in making sound investment decisions. At its core, the time value of money underscores the principle that a dollar today holds more worth than a dollar in the future. By understanding this fundamental idea, you can unlock a treasure trove of opportunities to grow your wealth and secure your financial future. Inflation, the gradual increase in the general price level of goods and services, has a profound impact on the purchasing power of currency over time. As prices rise, the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services, thereby diminishing the purchasing power of individuals. This erosion of purchasing power is a crucial consideration when evaluating the time value of money. Understanding how inflation affects purchasing power is essential in assessing the real value of money over time and making informed financial decisions. By grasping these interwoven principles, individuals can navigate the complex landscape of investments, savings, and financial planning with confidence and foresight. Imagine being able to harness the power of compounding interest to watch your savings multiply over time, or strategically investing in assets that appreciate in value to build a robust portfolio. Whether you are a novice investor or a seasoned financial expert, grasping the nuances of the time value of money can pave the way for a prosperous and financially secure tomorrow. Join us on this enlightening journey as we delve deeper into the intricacies of this transformative concept and discover the keys to unlocking a world of financial possibilities.",

Most people would love to save for bigger goals and dreams, but that requires proper saving habits, which in turn demand discipline.\nIn this course, I will share numerous fresh and valuable insights on how to save money while still maintaining a healthy balance on spending for pleasure. It will detail how status and reputation are involved in both selling and buying, and also discusses the happiness that never comes despite how much money you may spend chasing it.\n\nPrioritizing skills instead of self-limiting\nWhile many believe that saving money is about limiting lifestyle and self-repression, I would say that saving is about attaining the necessary skills to sort and prioritize goals, and utilizing the knowledge of how to fulfill your deeper needs. I teach money spending that brings more value, fulfillment, and joy to your life. This course is your path to new shopping behavior, more peace of mind, and stronger skills to prioritize money for activities and things that you genuinely enjoy, as opposed to allowing external forces to guide your spending on autopilot.\nMore freedom not to buy\nYou will have more inner freedom to make different financial decisions than our consumerist society expects of you. You‘ve probably already noticed that a lack of self-control turns into unplanned shopping. I will explain how to gain more self-control, and how to create stronger boundaries that can resist the never-ending stream of advertisements that wash over us daily.\nStop buying just because other people buy\nWe invest a lot of intellectual effort into making our money, but at the end of the day, emotions take over and cause us to lose awareness, seek to please ourselves above all else, and regret our decisions later when it turns out that we‘re still emotionally unsatisfied. I`ll give a detailed explanation of the buying motives and emotions that overtake us when we make our purchase decisions, and explain what fears and insecurities we must overcome when we start changing our money habits.\nWhat money brings to your life\nYou‘ve probably realized that buying more things, and more expensive things, does not necessarily bring you more happiness. Why do our expectations misalign with what we get? We still try to pretend that we are happy just like everybody else, and focus on the false hope that getting more money will bring more happiness to our lives.\nNo shame or guilt feeling because of saving\nDon’t feel stressed anymore because of what others will think or say about your lifestyle. You won’t waste your time in shopping malls looking for entertainment and other voids to pour your hard-earned money into, because you‘ll be occupied with activities bearing actual meaning. This course will help you to set stronger boundaries and cure your sensitivity for the opinions of others.\n\nIt’s also about our common insecurities — which we try to hide under known brands — and about your car that‘s depreciating with each passing day. It’s about designer jeans that cost five times more than regular jeans, and also about psychologists who never advise impulse spending to relieve tension, and the fact that we somehow consistently do the opposite.\nLet’s break down the main benefits:\n1. You will improve your money spending habits.\n2. You will get better control of yourself and your money.\n3. You will feel more comfortable about making financial decisions.\n4. Finally, you will have more money in your pocket.",

Even with a substantial income, an expansive property, or a fleet of vehicles, one can still grapple with financial illiteracy, a pervasive issue impacting individuals and societies, leading to financial struggles.\nInfluences from your environment, family, friends, and society significantly shape your money mindset and approach.

Though not the sole focus of life, money intricately weaves through its essential facets. Hence, fostering financial education and being mindful of your mindset and habits is imperative. Reflecting on who shaped your financial mindset and whether they imparted optimal money-handling strategies is vital.\nIn essence, this course serves as a practical guide for reshaping your money mindset and enhancing personal finances. It aids in pinpointing financial strengths and weaknesses, steering clear of money leaks, and making strategic investments. The overarching goal is to facilitate financial stability and security by laying a robust financial foundation.",

Knowing how to correctly reconcile a fund’s NAV and appraise its accuracy is, therefore, an extremely valuable skill.\nIn this course, you will learn about the basics of a fund’s NAV—what it is, why it matters, and who the users of the NAV are. You will also learn about the six key items that must be reviewed: from reviewing the instrument profit or loss, to reviewing the fund accruals, and raising and resolving queries with the fund accountant. Clearly, the ability to review a NAV accurately and efficiently is advantageous, so automating the reconciliation with the aid of a template is essential, and in this course you will also learn how to build your own NAV reconciliation template.\nAfter completing this course, you will have a solid, basic understanding of what goes into a fund’s valuation and be able to reconcile and sign off on a fund valuation with confidence.",

According to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, small and midsize companies suffer more losses due to fraud than their larger counterparts. Experts estimate that companies lose 5% to 6% of their annual revenue to fraud, so every company should have a comprehensive fraud prevention program. A fraud prevention program is not difficult to implement. It simply consists of education, investigation, and proactive prevention policies. Since employees are the most likely to report issues or any fraudulent activities, you certainly want to give them both the knowledge and the tools to help your company weed out any instances that may be taking place. And while fraud prevention efforts are designed to stop employee fraud, note that any investigations of suspected instances of fraud or employee theft may also act as a deterrent to other employees who may be either committing or contemplating fraud. The bulk of your company's fraud prevention efforts should be focused on the creation and implementation of proactive preventive techniques. This includes establishing internal controls and putting into place policies and procedures that are specifically designed to prevent fraud. One of the best ways to develop prevention policies may include utilizing an experienced anti-fraud professional. Make sure to find one who is experienced and has investigated numerous instances in order to help you to develop the most relevant and most effective anti-fraud controls.",

I now and have many years experience of budgeting and planning my own personal finances. My parents weren't rich and I grew up lower-middle class. I didn't have things given to me growing up and learned the value of a dollar early on in life. I am just a regular guy with extraordinary skills at mastering my own finances.\nMy friends have asked in the past how I can afford to be investing and taking vacations at such a young age. It's not because I make a lot more money than them, it's because I have more financial knowledge than them. I have enjoyed teaching them the basics of personal finance and that is what led me to create this course, my love for teaching others how to take the proper actions to get on top of their finances.

I believe everyone should know how to be the master of their finances, not the other way around. This course is my way of taking action toward that goal.

This is because money invested will give certain return, creating a larger amount of money in the future as interest is added to the sum of money invested at a certain rate of interest based on the risk profile of the investment.\nUnderstanding this concept helps investors and corporates make a rational decision relating to their investments. In time value of money mathematics, one will learn two important concepts compounding value technique (future value technique) and discounting value technique (present value technique).\nThe Future value technique or compounding technique will help understand future value (FV) given the present money and present value (PV) technique or discounting technique helps us in understanding present value of money given future money.\nIn most of the cases in finance, we will be perplexed with a situation where we will be dealing with present cash outflows and future cash inflows. Understanding the time value techniques will help the finance manager to make appropriate decision concerning cash inflows.\nThe time value techniques will help managers in taking prudent decisions relating to financing, investment and dividends.\nWelcome to this wonderful course on TVM and hope this course will give strong foundation in the subject of finance.",

      "description": "This course offers an in-depth exploration of the theoretical underpinnings of strategic investment, focusing on key concepts and principles that guide investment decisions in today's financial markets. It is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of investment, risk management, portfolio theory, market analysis, and the psychological aspects that influence financial decision-making. While the course incorporates real-world examples and theoretical frameworks, its focus remains on delivering a solid foundation in investment theories, providing students with the knowledge to understand and interpret investment strategies from a conceptual standpoint.\nThe course begins by laying the groundwork with an overview of the fundamental concepts of investment. It introduces essential theories on how investments work, the relationship between risk and return, and the importance of aligning investment strategies with individual financial goals. The theoretical discussions around risk-return dynamics emphasize the need to balance potential gains with the risks involved in various investment choices. This initial section sets the stage for further exploration into the intricacies of diversification and portfolio theory, where students will gain a deeper understanding of how to manage and distribute risk across different assets. The focus on portfolio theory encourages students to think critically about asset allocation and diversification as strategies to optimize investment performance over time.\nBuilding on the investment fundamentals, the course delves into market analysis principles, where students will learn how to assess market conditions using various analytical tools and techniques. By understanding how to interpret and evaluate market data, students can gain insights into the factors that drive market movements and shape investment opportunities. Theoretical discussions on historical market trends further enrich this section, as students will explore the implications of past market behaviors on future investment decisions. This knowledge is critical for understanding how markets evolve and for identifying patterns that may inform strategic investment planning.\nThe psychological dimension of investing is an essential yet often overlooked aspect of financial decision-making. This course pays special attention to the role of emotions and cognitive biases in shaping investor behavior. By examining the psychological forces that can affect investment decisions, students will learn to recognize the impact of emotional responses on market outcomes and personal financial choices. The section on cognitive biases explores common mental shortcuts that can lead investors astray, providing strategies to mitigate their effects and make more rational, informed investment decisions. Understanding the psychological influences on investing is key to developing a disciplined approach to managing finances and minimizing errors in judgment.\nThroughout the course, students will be encouraged to think critically about the relationship between theory and practice, allowing them to apply conceptual models to real-world financial scenarios. By focusing on theoretical constructs and their practical implications, this course equips students with the analytical tools needed to interpret and apply investment strategies effectively. This approach ensures that students gain a robust understanding of the forces that drive investment decisions, preparing them for more advanced studies or practical application in the world of finance.",

You’ll start with Python, covering everything from basic syntax to functions, data structures, and file handling. Then you’ll move into data preprocessing — how to clean financial data, handle missing values, remove outliers, and prepare data for analysis.\nAfter that, the course focuses on applied tools used in finance: Pyfolio, MPLFinance, Riskfolio-lib, and others. You’ll use real financial data to build models for portfolio analysis, risk management, and return calculation. No abstract toy datasets — we work with real stock data, fund performance, and economic indicators.\nYou don’t need a background in finance or computer science. The course starts from the beginning and explains every step in a clear and structured way. And if you already know Python, you can skip ahead to the finance and project sections.\nLater updates will include R, MATLAB, and Julia implementations for some of the key projects. This makes the course useful not just for learners, but also for professionals looking to compare tools.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have a working understanding of how to use code in financial workflows — and a set of notebooks you can actually use.",

      "description": "Personal finance is the fundamental principle that everyone should learn. However, it is sometimes overlooked by many people despite the fact that money is always a part of everyone's life. In personal finance, there are four key personal finance principles: 1) wealth creation (how to generate savings), 2) wealth accumulation (what to do with your savings), 3) wealth protection (how to protect your wealth and how to plan for unexpected events), and 4) wealth distribution (how to distribute your wealth after your death. As the name implies, this course is about wealth creation, probably the most critical step in personal finance and the starting point for all subsequent processes.\nWhen we refer to wealth creation, we are talking about personal budgeting and how to manage your income and expenses effectively and hopefully generate positive savings. As this is probably the first time that you think about personal budgeting, this course will outline the four actionable steps in wealth creation: 1) identify what you have, 2) record your revenues and expenses, 3) organize and analyze information, and 4) budget your savings and expenses.\nIn the early stage of the course, you will learn basic accounting principles and how to identify things that you have such assets and liabilities or even something that you may not be aware of.\nIn the middle stage, we will talk about types of people and how each type of people earns their income. You will also learn how you should view your revenues and expenses and organize them in the structured and meaningful way.\nIn the later stage, you will learn special techniques used in personal budgeting and, most importantly, you will be exposed to the personal budgeting framework that you should keep in mind while developing your own budget.\nThroughout the course, I will use one of the most powerful personal financial software, out there in the market, You Need a Budget or \"YNAB\"), to strengthen your understanding of the concepts.\nYou should be able to develop your own effective personal financial budget after taking this course and, more importantly, you will develop a good personal finance mindset that will pay you dividends for the rest of your life.",

      "description": "In S/4 HANA, SAP has made significant enhancements in the area of Material Ledger and Actual Costing, enabling businesses to meet the complexities of parallel accounting principles, such as IFRS and Local GAAP. Let's elaborate on the integration and functioning of CKMLCP and CKMLCPAVR in S/4 HANA, especially in the context of parallel COGM calculation for different accounting principles.\nCKMLCP and CKMLCPAVR in S/4 HANA:\nCKMLCP (Periodic Actual Costing Run): This is the traditional transaction used for executing the Material Ledger's period-end closing activities for actual costing. It typically refers to the standard or leading ledger, often linked to the IFRS accounting principle.\nCKMLCPAVR (Actual Costing Run for Additional Valuations): Introduced to cater to the need for parallel valuations. CKMLCPAVR allows companies to calculate actual costs based on non-leading ledgers which might correspond to local GAAP or other accounting principles.\nParallel Financial Reporting in Controlling:\nDepreciation Considerations:\nDepreciation calculations are a key component of the total cost of manufactured goods. Since IFRS and Local GAAP often have different rules and timelines for asset depreciation, the cost of goods manufactured (COGM) will vary between the two accounting principles.\nIn S/4 HANA, different depreciation areas can be maintained in the asset accounting module. Each depreciation area can have its own set of rules (for example, one for IFRS and another for Local GAAP). This facilitates parallel depreciation calculations.\nParallel Valuation in Material Ledger:\nThe Material Ledger can maintain inventory values in parallel for different accounting principles, with each valuation view being tied to a specific ledger.\nInventory can be carried at different values in the same system, facilitating compliance with both international and local accounting standards.\nExecuting Actual Costing Runs:\nFor IFRS: Execute CKMLCP, which uses the leading ledger.\nFor Local GAAP: Execute CKMLCPAVR, specifying the non-leading ledger associated with the local GAAP accounting principle.\nLinking Accounting Principles to Ledgers:\nAccounting principles are directly linked to specific ledgers. The leading ledger typically represents IFRS, while non-leading ledgers can be linked to local GAAP or other accounting standards.\nBy linking depreciation areas to these ledgers, the system ensures the correct depreciation calculation gets included in the cost component structure and COGM calculations.\nAdvantages of Parallel Reporting in S/4 HANA:\nCompliance & Flexibility: Catering to both international and local reporting standards in a single integrated system reduces reconciliation efforts and ensures compliance.\nTransparency: Clear visibility of how costs (especially depreciation) impact product costing under different accounting principles.\nEfficiency: Streamlined period-end closing activities with consistent and automated calculations.\nIn summary, S/4 HANA's capabilities in the realm of Material Ledger and Actual Costing offer businesses a robust platform to manage parallel financial reporting in controlling seamlessly. By leveraging CKMLCP and CKMLCPAVR, organizations can ensure they meet both global and local financial reporting requirements efficiently.",

So, the professional performing this analysis activity is called a credit research analyst. In technical terms, a credit research analyst is a finance professional proficient in evaluating an individual’s or business’s creditworthiness. Based on the borrower’s financial history and current situation, a credit research analyst determines the likelihood that a borrower will be able to meet the financial obligations and repay the loan.\nCredit analyst performs fundamental credit analysis in a corporate bond, fixed income, and many others. This involves analysis of financial statements and industry overviews. An analyst also provides critical support to portfolio managers. He has to search and collect material, create financial models, and also perform relative value analysis.\nThey have to handle relationships with traders, investors, salespeople, etc.\nOverall, they undertake the risk assessment analysis of lending proposals.\nThe role of credit research analyst/credit research analyst evolved around risk management, where he has to understand the risks and find out the ways to overcome these risks.\nCredit research analyst/credit research analyst jobs are also expected to remain informed about legal activities.",

      "description": "2026 Private Equity\nPrivate Equity or PE is a type of investment fund that invests capital in private companies; or public companies that have financial problems and take them private. In this way, investors with capital in PE funds can take control through shares and make other operational changes to increase capital gains. They can then resell their ownership shares at a higher price.\nPE funds are usually small in size with high-quality personnel. They can invest in many businesses in different industries, regardless of the stage of the business's life cycle. PE funds mainly raise capital by calling for external capital, usually from investment companies or individual investors. The target of PE funds in the Vietnamese market is companies with great growth potential, or companies facing financial difficulties and needing management support.\nAfter investing capital in these companies, PE funds will work closely with management to improve the company's operations, cut unnecessary costs and inefficient work-related issues. Unlike hedge funds, PE funds hold their investments for a long time, up to 10 years, before selling them with the goal of making a profit.\nManagers of private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) firms have the same goal in mind: maximizing returns. Yet PE buyout and VC early-stage funds go about it in very different ways. Many prospective investors fail to appreciate that the two most popular alternative asset classes adopt often antithetical methods to drive performance. PE fund managers do not need to diversify as much as their VC counterparts. There are two main reasons for that:\n· They control a portfolio asset via majority ownership or contractual terms such as supervoting rights. Unlike VCs, they can take resolute decisions without the need to placate management or co-investors.\n· They target mature companies that generally do not face the kind of business and market uncertainty that affects young firms. Consequently, with leveraged buyouts, the probability of failure is much lower.\n\n\nPrivate Equity Certificate\nTopic 1 Private Markets Essentials\nGain essential skills for the private markets, including fixed income securities analysis, financial statement analysis, and financial modeling.

      "description": "This course is designed for students who are having their finance 101 at University and people who are curious in learning the basics of financial mathematics. You will learn how to convert single or multiple cash flows that will be received at different points in time to one number. This enables you to make a rational decision between different assets and determine the value of an asset. In this course, you will learn not only the formulas but also understand the intuition behind the formula and practice with examples.\n\n\nThere are three main sections in this course. We will focus on interest rates, annuities, and bonds valuation in each part. In the first section, you will learn the difference between simple rate and compound rate. You will have the opportunity to go through a few examples of converting compounding rates into different compounding periods to suit the payment periods. This is an important skill and we will apply it throughout the course.\n\n\nIn the second section of the course, we will introduce a type of finance asset called annuity. You will learn the concept of this asset, different types of annuity and apply what you will have learnt in the first section to calculate the value of an annuity.\n\n\nThe third section is the application part of this course. You will combine what you have learnt and apply them to evaluate bonds. You will also learn some key relationships of bonds valuation and handy tips towards the end of the course.\n\n\nFinally, a little background of myself and why I created this course. My name is Qian. I am a qualified Financial Risk Manager(FRM) and a CPA. I have a master degree in Economics from University of Wisconsin - Madison and a master degree of professional accounting from University of Sydney. When facilitating university students in their Finance studies, I found that interest rate is a topic that confuses students a lot. However, it is also an essential part of Finance, either for those who would like to take finance as their career or for those who have to select a Finance course as a compulsory unit. I have seen students suffering from the calculations and some even failed the exams. It’s painful and costly to redo the course for another semester. That’s what motivated me to create this short course. I hope my understanding of finance can make your first steps in Finance firmer.",

In this course, you’ll learn how to shift from reactive credit management to a proactive, performance-driven approach that strengthens your business and preserves customer relationships.\nWe begin by redefining the role of credit control in the wider Order-to-Cash (O2C) cycle. Instead of waiting for problems to appear, you'll learn how to anticipate and address the early signs of payment risk — while maintaining commercial agility. You’ll explore the true cost of blocked orders, discover smarter order release strategies, and implement controls that support sales without compromising risk tolerance.\nYou’ll also take a deeper look at Bad Debts Provisioning — often misunderstood as a mere accounting exercise. This course repositions it as a powerful strategic tool for forecasting, internal control, and smarter credit decisions.\nFrom non-traditional reporting metrics to measuring the true cost of credit services, we’ll introduce frameworks that help you evaluate your credit control's effectiveness across financial, operational, and customer dimensions.\nWhether you're responsible for day-to-day credit decisions, managing credit teams, or driving improvements in financial operations, this course will give you the tools to move from reactive firefighting to structured, proactive credit control — where commercial goals and credit risk management are no longer in conflict.\nTransform your credit function from a bottleneck into a business enabler.",

Nothing is overly complicated, however there are a lot of different algorithms and 'the devil lies in the details'.\nAs the Interest Rate market is very liquid and competitive, any mistake can lead to an arbitrage in your valuation. Your Yield Curve modeling will also have a strong impact on your Risk Management.\nMaster the best practices for Yield Curve Stripping.\nThe Risk Free Rate, Bonds and Swaps and their market conventions\nSimple Stripping of the Yield Curve\nInterpolation of Zero Coupon Rates\nThe concept of Forward Spread\nStep Wise stripping to model central bank behaviour\nStripping with your own funding\nAll the concepts are illustrated in downloadable Excel spreadsheets\nLearn to implement a non arbitrable Yield Curve Model\nWith the introduction by the regulators of the new Risk Free Rates like €ster or SOFR, yield curve pricing model must be even more precise. A proper yield curve stripping must use several different techniques, and all of them must be applied without any mistake.\nAll the algorithm will have a practical, detailed and downloadable example on Excel\nContent and Overview\nThe goal of this course is to compute Discount Factor and Forward Swaps, while having a sound risk management framework.\nThe first part of this course will present the Interest rates, the Central Bank role and the RFR (Risk Free Rate)\nThe Pyramid method will be presented, as it is simple and leads to acceptable result, but it has strong limits.\nThen modern stripping will be applied to a swap curve with its associated risk management, using a simple linear interpolation for Rates.\nBecause linear interpolation is arbitrable, you will be presented with the step spline algorithm. The Risk implications of the interpolation are important and will be seen in detail.\nIn order to cover all products and market specific, advanced techniques will be presented and analyzed in Excel.\nWith all these tools, student will be able to develop their own interest rate stripper, using a object oriented language.",

      "description": "Capital budgeting is a method of generating, evaluating and analyzing substantial future investments and expenditures to determine which ones are most worthwhile. In other words, it’s a process that facilitates the usage of Capital or funds in the most efficient manner in anticipation of  generating returns over a series of years. Each project is ranked by its potential future return, so the company management can choose which one to invest in first. Thus, Capital budgeting is a process of evaluating investments and huge expenses in order to obtain the best returns on investment.\nAn organization is often faced with the challenges of selecting between two projects/investments or the buy vs replace decision. Ideally, an organization would like to invest in all profitable projects but due to the limitation on the availability of capital an organization has to choose between different projects/investments. Capital budgeting as a concept affects our daily lives.\nWhat are the objectives of Capital budgeting?\nCapital expenditures are huge and have a long-term effect. Therefore, while performing a capital budgeting analysis an organization must keep the following objectives in mind:\nSelecting profitable projects\nAn organization comes across various profitable projects frequently. But due to capital restrictions, an organization needs to select the right mix of profitable projects that will increase its shareholders’ wealth.\nCapital expenditure control\nSelecting the most profitable investment is the main objective of capital budgeting. However, controlling capital costs is also an important objective. Forecasting capital expenditure requirements and budgeting for it, and ensuring no investment opportunities are lost is the crux of budgeting.\nFinding the right sources for funds\nDetermining the quantum of funds and the sources for procuring them is another important objective of capital budgeting. Finding the balance between the cost of borrowing and returns on investment is an important goal of Capital Budgeting.\n\n\nThe process of capital budgeting is as follows:\nIdentifying investment opportunities\nAn organization needs to first identify an investment opportunity. An investment opportunity can be anything from a new business line to product expansion to purchasing a new asset. For example, a company finds two new products that they can add to their product line.\nEvaluating investment proposals\nOnce an investment opportunity has been recognized an organization needs to evaluate its options for investment. That is to say, once it is decided that new product/products should be added to the product line, the next step would be deciding on how to acquire these products. There might be multiple ways of acquiring them. Some of these products could be:\nManufactured In-house\nManufactured by Outsourcing manufacturing the process, or\nPurchased from the market\nChoosing a profitable investment\nOnce the investment opportunities are identified and all proposals are evaluated an organization needs to decide the most profitable investment and select it. While selecting a particular project an organization may have to use the technique of capital rationing to rank the projects as per returns and select the best option available. In our example, the company here has to decide what is more profitable for them. Manufacturing or purchasing one or both of the products or scrapping the idea of acquiring both.\nCapital Budgeting and Apportionment\nAfter the project is selected an organization needs to fund this project. To fund the project it needs to identify the sources of funds and allocate it accordingly. The sources of these funds could be reserves, investments, loans or any other available channel.\nPerformance Review\nThe last step in the process of capital budgeting is reviewing the investment. Initially, the organization had selected a particular investment for a predicted return. So now, they will compare the investments expected performance to the actual performance.\nIn our example, when the screening for the most profitable investment happened, an expected return would have been worked out. Once the investment is made, the products are released in the market, the profits earned from its sales should be compared to the set expected returns.

      "description": "This course is designed to provide students with a thorough understanding of the theories and principles underpinning financial risk management. It offers an in-depth exploration of key concepts related to the identification, measurement, and mitigation of financial risk, focusing primarily on the theoretical frameworks that guide these processes. While this course is theoretical in nature, it will offer a broad perspective on how these foundational ideas are applied in practice, giving students a solid grounding in financial risk management strategies that can be adapted to a variety of real-world situations.\nThe course begins by introducing the concept of financial risk and emphasizing its critical role in today’s complex and interconnected global markets. Financial risk management is essential for organizations seeking to safeguard their assets, ensure stability, and promote sustainable growth. Through the exploration of fundamental risk concepts, students will gain an appreciation for the importance of identifying, understanding, and managing financial risks effectively. The introductory sections delve into the basics of financial risk, guiding students through the core principles that form the backbone of risk management theory. By understanding these foundational ideas, students will be able to contextualize the more advanced strategies and methodologies discussed later in the course.\nOne of the key elements of financial risk management is risk identification. The course explores various risk concepts and categories, helping students recognize the different types of risks that organizations face. Identifying risks early is crucial to mitigating their impact, and students will be introduced to various techniques for assessing both quantitative and qualitative risks. By examining the interplay between these different methods, students will develop a more nuanced understanding of how risks are measured, evaluated, and prioritized. This section also emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach to risk measurement, combining both quantitative data and qualitative insights to create a more complete risk profile.\nIn addition to risk identification and measurement, the course covers strategic approaches to risk mitigation. Mitigating financial risks requires a deep understanding of the factors that contribute to these risks and how they can be managed or minimized. Students will explore the fundamentals of risk mitigation, learning how to develop strategies that not only address existing risks but also anticipate future challenges. By understanding the broader strategic implications of risk management, students will be better equipped to implement solutions that are both effective and sustainable in the long term.\nEthics play a pivotal role in financial risk management, particularly as companies navigate complex regulatory environments and societal expectations. This course examines the integration of ethical principles into risk management strategies, highlighting the importance of maintaining a balance between financial objectives and ethical considerations. Students will explore how ethical principles influence decision-making processes, guiding organizations in developing risk mitigation strategies that are aligned with broader societal goals.\nThroughout the course, students will have the opportunity to critically engage with a variety of risk management theories and frameworks. By the end of the course, students will possess a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical foundations of financial risk management, empowering them to analyze and address risks with confidence and ethical foresight. The theoretical knowledge gained will serve as a crucial foundation for those looking to further their expertise in the field of financial risk management, providing a solid base for future studies or practical applications.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Introduction to Finance Course by TSI! This is a course that is designed for complete beginners— no experience is required. If you are interested in finance, then you have come to the right place. We start off by introducing finance as well as clearing up a lot of the common misconceptions people have regarding the field. We then cover money and inflation. Then we cover loans and interest. In this module, we define what a loan is the context of investing, provide an intuitive explanation for what interest is, and explain the two types of interest visually. Afterwards, you will learn fundamental accounting concepts such as the accounting equation, t-charts, the accounting cycle, etc. We then build off these concepts and discuss the financial statement trinity. We discuss the nature of these statements as well as how to analyze them using growth and profitability ratios. The financial statement lectures segue nicely into our next module about securities. In this module, we discuss four types of securities, what differentiates them from one another, and their purposes. Each of these investments/securities come with their own set of risks. In the module succeeding that of securities, we discuss what risk is in detail, the different methods to avoid it, and insurance. Finally, we cover international finance. We begin by discussing the types of advantages, trade barriers, and ways to promote trade. Then we talk about economic development and metrics used to gauge a country's standing. Each of our engaging lectures present an intuitive approach to understanding the fundamental concepts mentioned above. We hope that you take away something from the course and start off strong in your finance journey! Enjoy the course!",

      "description": "Every company faces late payments — but not every company knows how to respond effectively. This course is designed for finance and credit professionals ready to take control of overdue receivables with confidence, structure, and strategic precision. It goes far beyond basic dunning letters and generic reminders.\nIn Trade Credit: Cash Collection and Recovery, you’ll learn how to build and implement a structured, professional, and business-oriented collection process — one that doesn’t just chase payments, but actively reduces overdues, safeguards business relationships, and maximizes recoveries with minimal friction.\nWe start by questioning the conventional view of collection. Is getting paid always the only goal — or can a smarter process reduce the problem itself? Then, we dive into collection methods: from payment reminders and negotiation tactics to third-party strategies. You’ll learn when to be flexible, when to escalate, and how to preserve control at every step.\nThis course also emphasizes the power of assurance and sunning — a preemptive mindset that starts well before the due date — as well as practical negotiation techniques that help you manage even the most challenging overdue cases with confidence.\nFinally, we explore how and when to involve external agencies or legal channels, and how to maintain oversight throughout.\nWhether you're refining an internal process or preparing to outsource, this course equips you with the tools to turn outstanding receivables into recovered cash — efficiently and professionally.",

      "description": "There are many people with a lot of consumer debt, it is time to break free from that group and statistic and take charge of your debt. The first step is to understand debt, as most people are in debt due to a lack of understanding of how some debt facilities work, as well as their long-term impact on your financial future. As the saying goes once you demystify something, by understanding it, it can no longer have a hold on you. After meeting many people struggling with bad debt because they did not understand what they were getting themselves into and unknowingly allowed businesses and banks to dictate to them how much debt they “can” afford, instead of what the individual can comfortably manage. Leading to the individual finding themselves barely able to keep their head above water, so, I felt the obligation to do something about it and create a course on a platform that can be accessed across the world by anyone interested in learning more about debt and have decided to take that first step of living a conscious life where you make intentional and informed decisions about your money. Given the popularity of credit cards, this course is designed to help people understand how credit cards work, to hopefully, assist them to better understand their responsibilities as a card holder, manage their debts well and know how to choose a card that best suits their needs. Enjoy it and I hope you are able to take some points away that you can apply to your life.",

Factors to consider for credit rating of banks\nAsset Quality\nProfitability\nCapitalization\nFunding and Liquidity\nEconomy\nSize and Market Share\n3. What can lead to sudden rating change\nCreditors use a credit score rating scale to assess an individual’s creditworthiness, i.e., a person’s likelihood of whether the company can pay the debt obligation fully on time. Different credit rating agencies provide credit ratings. A rating is given to any issuer, i.e., an individual, corporate, state, or sovereign government seeking to borrow the money. The rating does not say whether an investor should really buy that bond, but it is just one of the most important parameters an investor should consider before investing in any bond. A rating suggests both the present situation and the impact of future events on credit risk. Credit ratings are not constant. They keep changing from time to time as the credit quality of an issue or issuer alters in ways that were not expected when a rating was assigned. For example, consider a new technology that was not expected, which was not considered while assigning a rating to a company. This new technology might lead to a negative impact on the financials of the company. This may impact the downgrading of the current rating.",

I also want my students to understand by making their payments on time can save them the cost of late fees & accrued interests also how this can add up over time. Students will also experience the connection between simply paying their bills by the due date will automatically help their credit score go up. This course will give them more buying power now and in the future.\nI am very passionate about sharing this experience because it will give students a new perspective on how seeing & maintaining your expenses/bill on a spread sheet can actually save a significate amount money over time while strengthen your credit instead of just paying your expenses setting you up for a better future.",

      "description": "Currency, which can be defined as the currencies of foreign countries and used in international trade transactions, is one of the most preferred investment tools today by both large and small investors. In this article, we will briefly touch on the exchange rate, which is one of the concepts that is frequently heard around, and how investors make a profit from foreign currency, especially as the currencies of foreign countries gain and lose their value compared to the Turkish lira.\nWhat is the Exchange Rate?\nThe concept of exchange rate refers to the coefficient that determines the value of a country's currency against other countries' currencies. The price applied to the purchase of foreign currencies is called the buying rate, and the price applied to the sale is called the selling rate. The prominent factors affecting exchange rates; The economic situation of the countries can be counted as political developments and the policies carried out by the central banks. Like every good that can be bought and sold, the prices of currencies in the market are determined according to supply and demand. Therefore, if the foreign currency is high in a country, the exchange rate will be low, and if it is less, it will be high.\nFlexible Market Exchange Rate: It is a flexible system in which the Central Bank allows the exchange rate to fluctuate freely before intervening in the market.\nFixed Exchange Rate System: It is the system in which the Central Bank intervenes in the markets and keeps the exchange rate in balance.\nControlled Exchange Rate System: It is the system that the Central Bank aims to control the fluctuations in exchange rates.\nNow, we'll briefly dive into a few popular and important terms that you might come across if you're more interested in the topic:\nDevaluation - a state intervention in the country's economy, is the devaluation of a country's currency against other countries' currencies.\nRevaluation - The opposite of devaluation, that is, the appreciation of the country's currency against other currencies.\nCross Rate - It can be defined as calculating the exchange rate between different currencies.\nReal Exchange Rate - Also known as the \"terms of trade\", the real exchange rate refers to the purchasing power of a country's currency against a foreign currency.\nFloating Rate - The exchange rate that can fluctuate according to market conditions.\nHow to Invest in Foreign Currency?\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of the article, foreign exchange is a frequently preferred investment method and is seen by many as an effective way to make use of their savings. Investors basically follow the exchange rates and aim to profit from the differences between these exchange rates. In other words, it is possible to make a short or long term profit by buying a currency that will increase in value against the currency of your country and by selling this currency when it is valued. At this point, it is worth noting that currencies change rapidly compared to many other investment instruments. Therefore, before investing, you should know the market well and be able to understand how price movements can change depending on what factors.\nThese types of investments can be realized in more than one way. In the past, exchange offices were frequently preferred in this regard. Today, the deposit accounts of banks and especially the Forex market are more preferred by investors who are considering investing in foreign currency.\nIn this course, you will learn much more, with its sincere expression, from the educators.\nYou can finish the course whenever and wherever you want, with the advantage of stopping where you want and continuing wherever you want.\nWith these opportunities provided by technology, you will receive your certificate when you complete this course.",

Sales and Operations Planning (SOP):\nSOP is an integrated, forward-looking process designed to balance demand and supply while aligning daily operations with corporate strategy. It's a bridge between strategic planning and detailed planning processes:\nMaterial Master Preparation: A detailed record of every item/material in the SAP system. It provides crucial attributes like material type, procurement type, costing data, and so forth.\nBill of Material (BOM) Design: A comprehensive list of components required to produce an item. BOM provides a recipe for production and services.\nWork Center Creation: Represents a machine or group of machines where production operations are performed. It contains data related to capacity, scheduling, and costing.\nRouting Design: It provides a detailed sequence of operations required to produce an item. Along with BOM, it forms the foundation for production planning and execution.\nTransfer Plan to SOP: Demand plans are transferred to SOP, setting the stage for detailed planning. Here, the anticipated sales volumes are translated into feasible production plans.\nChange Sales Plan to Production Plan: Sales plans are adjusted and translated into actionable production schedules.\n2. From SOP to Demand Management:\nTransfer Planning Data to Demand Management: Post-SOP, the data is moved to demand management, which handles detailed production quantities and dates.\nCreate Planning Scenario: Represents a version of the production plan, allowing planners to simulate different production scenarios.\nLong-Term MRP Planning Scenario: Used to anticipate future material requirements based on long-term sales and production plans.\nTransfer Planned Activity Requirements for Production: This is where you push the planned data to work centers for production.\n3. Production and Costing:\nPlanned Activity Reconciliation: Ensures that planned activities are in line with actual production activities. Discrepancies are highlighted for action.\nCost Element/Activity Input Planning: This captures the anticipated cost for various production activities.\nPlan Activity Price Calculation: Here, the system computes the planned activity rate based on cost and activity quantities.\nStandard Cost Estimation and Release: It determines the standard cost of producing goods and services.\nUpdate Standard Cost Result in CO-PA (KEPM Framework): The computed standard costs are updated in CO-PA to provide a profitability perspective.\nPlanned Order Creation: Represents the plan to produce a certain quantity of a product at a particular time.\nConvert Planned Order to Production Order: Translates the plan into an actionable production order, which dictates the production activities.\nGoods Issue, Activity Confirmation, and Goods Receipt with respect to Manufacturing Order: As production progresses, materials are issued, activities are confirmed, and finished goods are received, all of which have financial implications.\nVariance Calculation and Settlement of Manufacturing Order: At the end of production, the system calculates the variance between the planned and actual costs.\nConclusion:\nSAP S/4HANA's integration between CO-PA planning and SOP ensures that the profitability perspective is always considered throughout the operational planning and execution processes. By doing so, it aligns the company's operations with its financial objectives, ensuring profitability is at the forefront of operational decisions.",

Discover the fundamentals of capital budgeting and find out how to create a plan that helps grow your business with smart investments.\nWhat is Capital Budgeting? Capital budgeting in financial management is the process of analyzing potential investments or expenditures that have long-term impacts on a business’s financial health. A project on capital budgeting typically involves forecasting, analyzing, and evaluating future returns from a proposed investment over an extended period of time. When deciding whether to invest in a project, businesses must consider the cost of the investment, any uncertain risks involved, and the expected cash flow generated by the investment.\nThe key to successful capital budgeting is accurately predicting a business’s future cash flows on investments. From there, businesses can decide whether an investment has the potential to generate enough financial benefits in the long-term to make it worthwhile. Capital budgeting uses a variety of methods and tools to evaluate potential investments, such as net present value, internal rate of return, and payback analysis. With these, businesses can more accurately determine the economic feasibility of their investments and proactively manage their finances for maximum profitability.\nThere are several common capital budgeting techniques that businesses use to help them make decisions, such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and discounted cash flow (DCF). These methods provide a more comprehensive way to analyze investment options. By incorporating non-cash items like depreciation and tax into financial models, decision makers can get a clearer picture of the profitability of their investments. By utilizing the capital budgeting system, businesses are better able to assess risk and identify potential opportunities for growth that could lead to the best possible outcome for their company’s bottom line.",

      "description": "2026 Private Markets and Alternative Investments\nA private market is an investment space reserved for qualified investors where they can buy shares in unlisted companies. These companies do not make their financial information public, so only those who are authorized to know how they are doing. Private markets generally have higher transaction costs, a lower number of buyers and sellers, information is not fully disclosed between parties, and prices are often determined by negotiation rather than public markets. These requirements result in a much lower frequency of transactions in Private markets, which means less volatility in asset values. Therefore, volatility is much lower and less likely to occur than in public investments.\nAn alternative investment is a financial asset that does not fall into the traditional investment categories. Traditional investments include stocks, bonds, and currencies. Most alternative investments are held by institutional investors or the ultra-high-net-worth individuals, due to their complexity, poor regulatory status, and high risk. Alternative investments include: private equity funds, venture capital funds, hedge funds, futures funds, art, antiques, commodities, or derivatives. Real estate is also listed as an alternative investment.\nThe Private Markets and Alternative Investments Certificate provides a comprehensive review of critical terminology and concepts.

It has resulted in severe economic hardship for millions of people. People suffered significantly under the first wave. As a temporary measure, the RBI had allowed banks to grant a moratorium for six months’ EMIs, which ended on 31st August 2020.\nSo, to help the borrowers impacted by Covid-19, the RBI had announced guidelines for devising a policy for granting relief to those borrowers on August 6, 2020, under the name “Resolution Framework for COVID-19-related Stress” (“Resolution Framework – 1.0”).\nBut Covid 19 wave didn’t end. It came back on a bigger scale in 2021 - termed as the second wave and it had resulted in lockdowns in several parts of the country. This has once again caused increased financial distress for all.\nSo, in order to support borrowers who are currently reeling under the monetary impact, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on May 5, 2021, came out with a second resolution framework titled\n“Resolution Framework 2.0 for Individuals and Small Businesses” and another “Resolution Framework 2.0 for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises”\nBy enrolling in this course, you will learn, Resolution Framework 2.0 for Individuals and Small Businesses and MSME covering\na) Introduction\nb) Loan Restructuring\nc) Eligibility - Individual & Small Business Borrowers\nd) Period of Moratorium / Extention of Tenor\ne) Invocation of Resolution Process\nf) Permitted features & implementation\ng) Asset classification and provisioning\nh) Working capital support for small businesses where resolution plans were implemented previously\ni) Disclosures and Credit Reporting\nf) Case Studies\ng) MSME Loan Restructuring\nh) Working Capital Term Loan\ni) Funded Interest Term Loan\nThis course is structured in a self-paced learning style.

      "description": "Would you like to receive passive income every month but you don't know how? So I have the solution for you: invest in monthly dividends stocks.\n\n\nOn the stock market, there are several companies capable of paying you a dividend every month. This is very interesting because we all have to pay monthly bills. Investing in such companies will allow you to create income that will not be linked to your salary at all.\n\n\nInvesting in the stock market and especially in dividend paying stocks can be mastered by many people, but few people do it. Investing in the stock master requires a minimum of good practices and to act as a business owner and not a speculator.\n\n\nMy personal mission is to help people achieve financial independence by teaching them about value investing. Learn from my many years of experience as an investor and move forward faster with the knowledge I will share with you.\n\n\nIn this training, I explain you how to:\n- develop a passive stream of income with monthly dividends;\n- analyze companies listed on the stock exchange;\n-select companies and build up a portfolio of stocks;\n-master the key stocks and a dividend investing checklist to get started;\n- And much more!\n\n\nThis course is aimed at beginners. Whether you are a woman or a man, I will give you all the information you need to know to start earning money as soon as you finish this training.\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting to register for this training?",

The course is updated from time to time. The course starts from simple concepts and moves towards advanced concepts. Students are requested to completely study all the concepts and not miss any area.\nThe need for companies’ financial statements to be audited by an independent external auditor has been a cornerstone of confidence in the world’s financial systems. The benefit of an audit is that it provides assurance that management has presented a ‘true and fair’ view of a company’s financial performance and position. An audit underpins the trust and obligation of stewardship between those who manage a company and those who own it or otherwise have a need for a ‘true and fair’ view, the stakeholders\nIn general, an audit consists of evaluation of a subject matter with a view to express an opinion on whether the subject matter is fairly presented. There are different types of audits that can be performed depending on the subject matter under consideration, for example:\nAudit of financial statements\nAudit of internal control over financial reporting\nCompliance audit",

      "description": "The banking sector is the lifeline of any modern economy. It is one of the important financial pillars of the financial sector, which plays a vital role in the functioning of an economy. It is very important for economic development of a country that its financing requirements of trade, industry and agriculture are met with higher degree of commitment and responsibility. Thus, the development of a country is integrally linked with the development of banking. In a modern economy, banks are to be considered not as dealers in money but as the leaders of development. They play an important role in the mobilization of deposits and disbursement of credit to various sectors of the economy. The banking system reflects the economic health of the country. The strength of an economy depends on the strength and efficiency of the financial system, which in turn depends on a sound and solvent banking system. A sound banking system efficiently mobilized savings in productive sectors and a solvent banking system ensures that the bank is capable of meeting its obligation to the depositors.\nIn India, banks are playing a crucial role in socio-economic progress of the country after independence. The banking sector is dominant in India as it accounts for more than half the assets of the financial sector. Indian banks have been going through a fascinating phase through rapid changes brought about by financial sector reforms, which are being implemented in a phased manner. The current process of transformation should be viewed as an opportunity to convert Indian banking into a sound, strong and vibrant system capable of playing its role efficiently and effectively on their own without imposing any burden on government. After the liberalization of the Indian economy, the Government has announced a number of reform measures on the basis of the recommendation of the Narasimhan Committee to make the banking sector economically viable and competitively strong.\nThis course is useful for IBPS PO,CAIIB,JAIIB,CA,CS,CMA,UPSC. This course helps to understand\nThe course also contains practical examples and illustrations to understand the concepts in a better manner. This course captures all the essential features of banking in a bird's eye view.\nPlease go through the course carefully before purchasing",

Going public can be complex and time-consuming and typically involves using investment bankers to underwrite the offering and help the company price the shares. Once the IPO is complete, the stock exchange lists the shares, and they become available for public trading.\nAdvantages of IPO\nRaising Capital: An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is a way for a company to raise additional capital for its business operations. By selling shares of their company to the public, a company can raise a large sum of money quickly.\nIncrease in Business Credibility: A company that goes public must comply with many regulations, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It helps increase the company's credibility with investors, leading to more investments.\nIncreased Liquidity: An IPO increases the liquidity of a company's shares, making it easier for shareholders to buy and sell company shares.\nAccess to Debt Financing: Companies that go public have access to more debt financing than private companies. It can benefit companies that need to finance large projects or acquisitions.\nImproved Brand Image: Going public can help to improve the company's brand image and increase its visibility in the marketplace.\nCapital raising: An IPO is an effective way to raise capital for the company. This capital can fund new projects, expand operations, finance acquisitions, or pay off debt.\nIncreased visibility: When a company goes public, it gains increased visibility and credibility. It can attract more customers, suppliers, and partners.\nImproved corporate governance: A company must adhere to stricter financial reporting and disclosure standards by going public. It can help to improve the company's corporate governance and increase investor confidence.",

      "description": "Capital Budgeting and Working Capital in Corporate Finance\nCorporate Finance is a Financial Management subject that deals with how a corporation reports and addresses long-term funding sources and capital investment decisions which are Capital Budgeting; Finance Decisions, and Dividend Decisions which are Capital structure related and, short-term sources of funding which are Working Capital Finance or Current Assets Management.\nIn this course, Capital Budgeting and Working Capital in Corporate Finance, we discuss Fund flows and Capital Investment Decisions, along with principles of Capital Budgeting Techniques and the different concepts and measurements employed in Capital Budgeting; also discussed fundamentals in Working capital Management.\nIn this course, what is also discussed is, Current Assets Management in Corporate Finance, along with Short Term Assets and Financing of Short run resources of a firm.\nThe management of such assets of a firm is in general called Working Capital Management.\nThere are two different methods followed by any firm, in managing their Fixed Assets and Current Assets.\nIn the case of Fixed Assets, the operational implication is to use discounting and compounding techniques to adjust the value of benefits accruing from such assets over a period of time.\nHowever, in the case of Current Assets Management, the time factor remains not crucial as a decision variable.\nHence, in Current Assets Management, the stock-in-trade of working capital is short-term assets that lose its identity fairly quickly, usually within an operating cycle of less than an year.\nThere is also a question of Profitability versus Liquidity and Risk that the firm encounters while dealing with Working Capital or in Current Assets Management.\nCurrent Assets Management hence should aim at striking a balanced view such that there exists an optimum amount of short-term assets, at the same time, solving any impending Working Capital Management issues.\nWhat is discussed, hence, is\n* Theory of Working Capital,\n* Basic Concepts, Policies, and Strategies employed in Working Capital Management,\n* Financing of Working Capital,\n* Components of Working Capital as well as\n* Cash, Marketable Securities, Inventories, and Receivables Management.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Behavioral Finance course by Uplatz.\n\n\nBehavioral Finance is a field of study that combines psychology and economics to explain why and how people make irrational financial decisions. It challenges the traditional economic theory, which assumes that individuals are rational actors who always make decisions to maximize their utility. Behavioral finance recognizes that cognitive biases, emotions, and social influences can lead to deviations from rational behavior.\nBehavioral finance seeks to better understand these and other phenomena by integrating insights from psychology into economic models, thereby providing a more comprehensive view of how financial markets operate and how investors make decisions.\n\n\nKey aspects of behavioral finance include:\nCognitive Biases: Systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, such as overconfidence, anchoring, and hindsight bias.\nEmotional Influence: Emotions like fear, greed, and regret significantly impact financial decision-making, often leading to suboptimal choices.\nHeuristics: Mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that simplify decision-making but can lead to biases and errors.\nProspect Theory: Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, this theory describes how people choose between probabilistic alternatives and evaluate potential losses and gains, highlighting that losses are often perceived as more significant than gains of the same size.\nMarket Anomalies: Observations that cannot be explained by traditional financial theories, such as stock market bubbles, crashes, and the excess volatility of stock prices.\nFraming Effects: The way information is presented can significantly affect decisions. For example, people may react differently to a choice framed in terms of potential gains versus potential losses.\nOverreaction and Underreaction: Investors might overreact to new information, causing excessive price movements, or underreact, leading to slower adjustments in stock prices.\nHerd Behavior: Investors tend to follow the crowd, which can lead to market trends and bubbles.\n\n\nLearning about behavioral finance is valuable for several reasons:\nImproved Decision-Making: Understanding the psychological factors that influence financial decisions can help individuals and professionals make more informed and rational choices, reducing the impact of biases and emotional reactions.\nEnhanced Investment Strategies: Knowledge of behavioral finance can lead to better investment strategies by recognizing common pitfalls such as overconfidence, herd behavior, and loss aversion, which can adversely affect portfolio performance.\nRisk Management: By understanding how emotions and cognitive biases affect risk perception and tolerance, individuals can develop more effective risk management strategies, leading to more stable and resilient financial planning.\nMarket Insights: Behavioral finance provides insights into market anomalies and trends that traditional financial theories cannot explain. This can be particularly useful for identifying opportunities and threats in financial markets.\nClient Relations: For financial advisors and professionals, knowledge of behavioral finance can enhance client interactions by providing deeper insights into clients' behaviors and attitudes toward money, enabling more personalized and effective advice.\nPolicy Making: Policymakers can use behavioral finance principles to design better financial regulations and policies that take into account the actual behavior of individuals and markets, leading to more effective outcomes.\nPersonal Finance Management: Individuals can apply behavioral finance concepts to their personal finance management, leading to better budgeting, saving, and spending habits, and ultimately achieving their financial goals.\nAcademic and Professional Growth: For students and professionals in finance, economics, and related fields, expertise in behavioral finance can be a valuable addition to their skill set, opening up opportunities for advanced research and career advancement.\n\n\nBehavioral Finance - Course Curriculum\n1.

      "description": "Join the course while enrollment is still open!\n\n\nLet Dolan Ingraham (financial literacy instructor, taught by multi-millionaire Paul Orfalea) teach you how to manage your finances, grow your wealth, and have your money work for you – even if you're starting out with little or no money or knowledge.\n\n\nThe truth is, most of us are starved for time, freedom, or security, because of a lack of money.\n\n\nThat is, we have enough to get by – but only because we have to work 9-5 jobs, doing what a boss tells us to do, selling our time, so we can earn a living. (Or doing pretty much the same thing while in school – just not getting paid for it. Does that sound about right?)\n\n\nAll this, when we'd rather be spending time with loved ones, or pursuing our passions.\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, it's not your fault. I'm speaking particularly to any students right now, when I say this:\n\n\nOur school system is a relic from an industrial economy, where our society needed to churn out factory workers with basic skills, that followed directions and worked long hours.\n\n\nIn other words – and I cannot emphasize this enough – our school system did not teach you to be financially successful.\n\n\n(Sorry if that sounds harsh.)\n\n\nMaybe a part of you already suspected that. I hate to say it, but it's the truth.\n\n\n\n\nSo that's where I come in.\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, you’ll learn powerful financial concepts that weren’t taught to you at school, but probably should have been.\n\n\n\n\nBefore I get into specifics (in about 5 seconds), let me pose one question – particularly for any young adults out there – for you to ponder:\nWould you like to have the option to not have to work for your money?\n\n\n\n\n(To be able to keep working if you want, but always have enough wealth to the point where you could walk away from your job at any time?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this class, I'm going to equip you with every skill I have, to make that a reality.\nYou’ll not only have your own portfolio growing and compounding, but you’ll also be savvy with regard to:\n\n\nBanking (earning many times the interest most people make in their savings accounts)\n\n\nCredit cards – and how to ethically “hack” your credit score and beat credit companies at their own game – and why it's so important\n\n\nBudgeting (designed to be extremely user-friendly for those who hate budgeting)\n\n\nMindset shifts regarding money that are short and simple yet highly effective, designed to increase your wealth\n\n\nInvesting – including stocks and tactics to greatly reduce your risk, as well as how to ACTUALLY get started NOW, even if you don't think you have enough money or knowledge to be an \"investor\"\n\n\nBONUS: Exclusive, Lifetime Group Member Access to me and to other members of the course, so we can all continue to help each other out, long after you finish the course\n\n\nAnd More  – from specific tips of how your accounts should flow to investments that you should avoid\n\n\nI want to equip you with the foundations to achieve financial security, and ultimately financial freedom (having enough money to the point where you don't HAVE to work, if you don't want to).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow if you're anything like me, a few seconds ago you read the word \"investing\" and immediately thought \"nope, that can't be for me.\" Immediate knee-jerk thoughts are usually something like:\n\n\n\"I don't have enough money; don't you have to have money to make money?\"\n\"I don't know enough – where on earth would I even start?\"\n\"what if I don't get enough guidance and I mess up and lose money???\"\n\n\nHere's the deal.\n\n\nFIRST of all, the entire game of investing has changed over the past few years. Today, you DON'T need to have more than a few dollars to start, you DON'T need a \"stock broker,\" and you can do it all from your phone, so it's never been easier for anyone to get started.\n\n\nAnd SECOND: I personally promise to hold your hand – and walk you through – each step of the way.\n\n\nI mean, even if you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the topic right now, I will walk you through each tiny little baby step and make it extremely easy for you to get started. This is my personal promise to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Honestly, I HATE when teachers leave me with unanswered questions, don't walk me through everything, or in any way leave me feeling stupid. Has that ever happened to you? That teacher's doing a bad job. And that's unacceptable.)\n\n\n\n\nI will never do that to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally promise to be here for you every step of the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, you can do this. You can literally have your money start making money for you, in a few days.\n\n\n\n\nBut some people have this fear:\n\n\n\"WHAT IF I LOSE MONEY??\"\n\n\nMost of us don't really know what we're doing when it comes to managing our money... So sometimes people are worried that if they try to learn themselves, they'll somehow \"mess it all up.\"\n\n\nThat's a scary thought. When we worry, we tend to jump to the worst possible thing that could happen....\n\n\nAnd then we do nothing.\n\n\n(Which, when it comes to investing, is NOT A GOOD MOVE.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the truth: while all investing carries risk, this course is going to make it a lot safer than you might think.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two reasons I can say this confidently:\n\n\n\n\nONE – I'll teach you exactly how to put as much of your money as you want into absolutely safe investments.\n\n\n(You get to choose how aggressive you want to be. You get to CHOOSE how much risk you want to take on.)\n\n\nIf you want to play it safe, and be assured to lose nothing – you can do that.\n\n\nIf you want to take on a bit more risk, and use a little bit of your money to seek higher returns – you can do that as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTWO – There is a section of the course purely devoted to teaching risk mitigation techniques – so if you do choose to take on a bit more risk, I'll teach you how to manage that risk.\n\n\nAs Warren Buffet put it, regarding investing: \"Rule number 1: Don't lose money. Rule number 2: See rule number 1.\"\n\n\nI'm going to help you follow that advice.\n\n\n\n\nGot it? You're absolutely going to be overall better off for knowing this stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAND I'LL SAY THIS RIGHT NOW:\n\n\nIf for any reason you try this course, and feel it's not a good fit for you, you can just return it.\n\n\nEasily.\n\n\nI mean really easily.\n\n\nFor a full refund.\n\n\nIt is super simple to return courses on Udemy. If you don't absolutely LOVE this course, then I want you to return it. Simple as that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot it? Good.\n\n\nNow I'm going to make what will sound like a huge promise:\n\n\nBut due to compounding, the investment knowledge contained here (when used diligently and consistently over the course of you lifetime), has a very high probability of gaining you tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.\n\n\n\n\nSo keep in mind: this course is an investment in yourself, that has a very long term, very high payout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guarantee that by the end of this course you’ll be very glad you took it – and if you don’t feel that way, please, just return it, for a full refund.\n\n\n\n\nCheck it out, join everyone who’s learning these concepts, and let me walk you through it – step by step.",

      "description": "The integration of the \"Material Ledger with Inter (Cross) and Intra-company transactions\" provides an enhanced insight into the valuation and transfer pricing mechanisms within SAP S/4 HANA. Here's an elaboration on the two scenarios you've pointed out:\n1) Inter (Cross) Company Transactions with Markup by Additive Cost\nScenario Overview: This involves transferring materials across two different company codes (intercompany). Typically, such transfers may carry a markup to reflect the profit margin of the selling entity.\nSteps and Considerations:\na) Delta Cost Component - Company Code: This is the additional cost or markup that gets added during intercompany sales. This delta captures the difference between the manufacturing cost and the sales price.\nb) Costing Type and Costing Variant: You'd need to define a specific costing type for intercompany markups and associate it with a costing variant. This allows for the proper capture of the additive costs during cost estimates.\nc) Special Procurement Key: It's crucial to set up a special procurement type for intercompany transfers. This ensures the system knows how to treat these transactions during MRP (Material Requirement Planning) runs.\nd) Additive Cost Creation: This is the step where you'd define the markup or additional cost. It's typically a percentage over the cost of production or a fixed amount.\n\n\n2) Intra (Within) Company Transactions with Markup by Transfer Price\nScenario Overview: This involves transferring materials between plants within the same company code. Transfer pricing comes into play when these plants are treated as profit centers.\nSteps and Considerations:\na) Delta Cost Component - Profit Center: Just like in the intercompany scenario, here too, we have a delta, but it's linked to the profit center to capture the transfer price between plants.\nb) Costing Type and Costing Variant: You'd need a specific costing type for intracompany transfers. It would be associated with a costing variant to capture the transfer pricing during cost estimates.\nc) Special Procurement Key: This would be for intracompany stock transfers, helping in recognizing the transaction type and ensuring proper treatment during MRP runs.\nd) Transfer Price: This is the price at which one plant sells the material to another plant within the same company code. It's often used to evaluate the performance of different segments of the business (profit centers).\n\n\nIn Conclusion:\nBoth intercompany and intracompany transactions play a crucial role in modern organizations that are spread across regions and have multiple manufacturing units. With the Material Ledger, SAP S/4 HANA provides a comprehensive tool to capture these transactions with the necessary valuation layers, thereby offering greater transparency and accuracy in financial reporting",

The actual cost at the actual activity is compared with the budgeted cost at the time of preparing a flexible budget. Flexibility recognizes the concept of variability.\nFlexible budget helps in assessing the performance of departments in relation to the activity level achieved. Cost ascertainment is possible at different levels of activities. It is also useful in fixation of price and preparation of quotations.\nFlexible Budget is useful in:\nthe new organizations where it is difficult to foresee,\nthe firms where activity level changes due to seasonal nature or change in demand,\nthe industries based on change of fashion,\nthe units which keep on introducing new products, and\nthe firms which are engaged in ship-building business.",

The video content is less than 2 hours, so if you can spare a full day you can easily get through the course. If you don't have a full day, then you can tackle it over a week in half hour sessions.\n\n\nEach section has 4 tutorial videos followed by a multiple choice quiz, where you can test your knowledge.\n\n\nIn the final section, there's a full course summary and a A-Z PDF of all the accounting terms covered.\n\n\nThe course is based on UK financial reporting, but it will still be beneficial to students in other parts of the world.",

Learn what qualifies you to have an HSA, FSA (Flex Savings Account), or how to pair an HSA with a LPFSA (Limited Purpose Flex Saving Account). Learn how to compare HSA provider/bank options and what documentation you need to keep. See the potential with real-life examples.\nThe basics of health and life insurance will be discussed, as well as their purposes and importance. What should you do if you've been denied life or other insurance coverage? There are plenty of options, and a great one is opening an HSA. There is a medical expense tracking log included in the materials, and LOTS of tips and tricks on saving money along the way.\nLearn how HSAs integrate perfectly into costs we all will face later in life, whether related to health care, long-term care, Medicare premiums, medications, or even over the counter treatments.

      "description": "SAP S/4HANA CO: Universal Parallel Accounting (UPA) with Event-Based Costing for Co- and By-Product Costing\nIntroduction\nUniversal Parallel Accounting (UPA) in SAP S/4HANA revolutionizes the way organizations manage financial and management accounting by offering comprehensive, real-time valuation capabilities across multiple accounting principles. When combined with event-based costing, UPA delivers a streamlined, transparent, and automated accounting framework that is particularly powerful in manufacturing environments involving co-products and by-products. This document explores how UPA, event-based costing, and the costing of co-/by-products interact within the SAP S/4HANA CO module.\n1. Core System Architecture: The Foundation of UPA\nThe backbone of UPA is SAP's Universal Journal, also known as ACDOCA. It consolidates all financial and controlling data into a single line-item table. Every cost-related transaction, whether from Financial Accounting (FI), Controlling (CO), or the Material Ledger (ML), flows into ACDOCA.\nKey Advantages:\nUnified structure simplifies data model.\nFI and CO integration eliminates redundancy.\nImmediate availability of real-time, valuation-specific data.\nCross-module reporting becomes seamless due to the common data foundation.\nACDOCA ensures that all postings—whether legal, group, or profit center valuation—are captured simultaneously with complete auditability.\n2. Ledger-Based Valuation Management\nUPA supports multiple ledgers, enabling parallel valuation according to statutory (legal), group, and management accounting requirements.\nLedger Setup:\nLeading Ledger (0L): Captures postings based on local GAAP.\nNon-Leading Ledgers: Configured for group IFRS, management, or internal cost view.\nCurrency Settings: Each ledger can support up to five currencies, enabling multidimensional reporting.\nThis setup ensures that businesses can comply with local and global reporting standards while also facilitating internal profitability and performance evaluations.\n3. Event-Based Costing (EBC): Redefining Costing Logic\nUnlike traditional period-end processing, event-based costing (EBC) posts cost-related entries immediately as business events occur. This allows for dynamic cost tracking and more agile financial decision-making.\nTrigger Events in Production Process:\nGoods Issue (GI): Material consumption recorded instantly with associated costs.\nOrder Confirmation: Labor and machine activity costs captured automatically.\nGoods Receipt (GR): Finished goods valuation posted at standard or actual cost.\n\n\nAutomatic Calculations Include:\nOverhead Application\nWork-In-Process (WIP) Posting\nProduction Variance Split (Input, Output, Price, etc.)\nEvent-based postings drastically reduce reliance on month-end costing runs while improving financial transparency and responsiveness.\n4. Co-Product and By-Product Costing in Event-Based Environment\nManufacturing processes often yield multiple outputs—main products, co-products (intentional), and by-products (secondary).\nCo-Product Handling:\nCosts are split using equivalence numbers.\nAll co-products are treated as primary outputs.\nValuation is typically based on standard cost, actual cost, or planned equivalence ratios.\nBy-Product Handling:\nTypically credited to the production order with a reduced value.\nCan be valued at scrap or market price depending on business need.\nReduces total cost of the main product proportionally.\nImpact in UPA and EBC:\nEach product (co-/by-) is costed in real-time with respect to its valuation view.\nReal-time postings to multiple ledgers ensure visibility into how costs are distributed and recovered.\nProfitability analysis is more accurate due to the allocation precision.\n5. Costing Variant Strategy for Multiple Valuation Views\nUnder UPA, distinct costing variants are configured for each valuation view—ensuring cost components and valuation logic remain consistent within the defined ledger.\nVariant Configuration Includes:\nCosting Type: Legal, Group, or Profit Center.\nValuation Variant: Controls pricing logic (Standard, Planned, Moving Average).\nOverhead Key: Allocates indirect costs like admin, utilities, etc.\nCredit Key: For co-/by-product split valuation.\nThis configuration enables the system to segregate costs based on the intended reporting requirement, thus enhancing traceability and audit readiness.\n6. Material Ledger: Real-Time Inventory Valuation and Actual Costing\nThe Material Ledger (ML) is activated mandatorily under UPA. It enables:\nMulti-currency and multi-valuation inventory tracking.\nActual costing per period or event.\nAutomatic revaluation of stock and consumption post period-end.\nFor co- and by-products:\nActual cost distribution is visible at a granular level.\nVariance allocation (input, output, price) is transparent and audit-compliant.\nML records are automatically updated with every production-related posting, ensuring complete alignment between stock values and cost of goods manufactured.\n7. Production Variances and Real-Time Analytics\nUPA enhances variance analysis by offering:\nReal-time classification and posting of production variances.\nLedger-specific variance postings for each valuation view.\n\n\nThis granularity is invaluable when managing complex manufacturing involving co- and by-products, as it helps identify inefficiencies and enables immediate corrective action.\n8. Integration with Profitability Analysis (COPA)\nAccount-Based COPA is fully integrated with UPA and ACDOCA, making it suitable for organizations operating in real-time costing environments.\nFeatures:\nProfitability views can be valuation-specific (Legal, Group, or Profit Center).\nRevenue and cost flows are posted in real time.\nCharacteristics from sales orders and production orders can be mapped to COPA.\nEnables segment profitability tracking for co-products.\nBy-product values are credited to reduce COGS, thereby influencing segment margins more accurately.\n9. Month-End Closing Becomes a Non-Issue\nTraditionally, cost accounting processes like WIP settlement, variance calculation, and inventory valuation were deferred until month-end. Under UPA and EBC:\nAll cost events are posted at runtime.\nNo need for repetitive closing steps.\nClosing becomes a review and adjustment task rather than a calculation-intensive process.\nFaster close cycles improve stakeholder confidence.\n10. Enhanced Reporting and Compliance Readiness\nWith ledger-specific and valuation-specific data, businesses can now:\nGenerate accurate reports across different accounting standards.\nPerform comparative profitability analysis across legal entities.\nFulfill compliance requirements like IFRS, GAAP, or internal audit.\nAutomate tax, audit, and intercompany reporting effortlessly.\nEach co-product or by-product can be reported on from various angles—financial (legal), group (consolidated), or management (profit center level).\nConclusion: End-to-End Cost Transparency with UPA and EBC\nThe combination of Universal Parallel Accounting and Event-Based Costing in SAP S/4HANA creates a future-proof, high-fidelity financial ecosystem. Specifically, for manufacturing processes involving co-products and by-products, this setup:\nProvides instantaneous and accurate cost attribution.\nAllows valuation-specific reporting for internal and external stakeholders.\nEliminates the dependency on time-consuming month-end activities.\nFacilitates proactive decision-making through real-time data.\nUltimately, businesses gain full transparency into their cost flows and margin structures, supporting more informed strategic and operational planning.\nKeywords: UPA, Event-Based Costing, SAP S/4HANA CO, Co-Product, By-Product, ACDOCA, Profit Center Valuation, Material Ledger, Real-Time Costing, Account-Based COPA.",

      "description": "Welcome to Financial Data Analysis & Business Analysis with SQL course. This is a comprehensive data analysis course where you will learn step by step on how to perform financial analysis, customer segmentation analysis, profitability analysis, budget allocation, and financial growth projection using SQL. This course is a perfect combination between finance and data analytics, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your SQL skills while improving your technical knowledge. In the introduction session, you will learn the basics fundamentals of structured query language, such as getting to know its core functions, use cases, and several examples of relational database management systems. Then, in the next section, you will learn basic SQL queries like select, insert, update, and delete, which are essential for interacting with the database. You will also learn how to filter, sort, and aggregate data, allowing you to extract meaningful insights from financial data. Before starting the project, we will set up the SQLite Online which is the IDE that we will use, in addition, we will also find and download the financial dataset from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, we will begin cleaning the data by handling missing values and converting data types as needed, the objective is to ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis. Afterward, we will conduct more detailed analyses, such as examining sales revenue by country to identify the most profitable markets and exploring sales revenue by product to understand which items contribute the most to total revenue. We will also analyze the impact of discounts on overall sales to determine the effectiveness of different pricing strategies. Following these initial analyses, we will delve into more advanced topics, including budget allocation to optimize expenditure, expense tracking to monitor spending patterns, profitability analysis by product to identify high-performing products, customer segmentation analysis to understand buying behavior, and financial growth projections to forecast future financial performance. This project will enable you to build a comprehensive understanding of financial analysis and budgeting. Last but not least, at the end of the course, we will use an AI text to SQL generator to automatically translate business questions into SQL queries, streamlining the analysis process and enhancing your ability to extract insights quickly and efficiently.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question, why should we learn about SQL, why should we analyze financial data using SQL? Well, here is my answer, SQL is essential because it allows us to efficiently retrieve, analyze, and organize large datasets, providing a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making. By analyzing financial data with SQL, you can identify trends, track key metrics, and make informed decisions that drive business growth and profitability. Mastering SQL will help you transform complex financial data into actionable insights that improve budgeting, forecasting, and overall financial strategy. Additionally, SQL is often preferred over Python or R for data analysis because it is specifically designed for querying and managing large datasets directly within databases, making it faster and more efficient for handling structured financial data.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of Structured Query Language, SQL use cases, SQL core functions, and relational database management system\nLearn how to clean data by removing missing values and duplicates\nLearn how to reformat data using SQL\nLearn about basic SQL queries like select statement, order by clause, where clause, insert, update, delete, group by clause, and aggregate functions\nLearn how to analyse total sales revenue by country using SQL\nLearn how to analyse total sales revenue by product using SQL\nLearn how to do profit margin analysis for each product with SQL\nLearn how to analyse discount impact on sales revenue and profitability with SQL\nLearn how to simulate budget allocation for manufacturing using SQL\nLearn how to do customer segmentation analysis with SQL\nLearn how to analyse monthly sales performance with SQL\nLearn how to identify products with high COGS and low profit with SQL\nLearn how to do financial growth projection and forecast sales using historical data\nLearn how to generate SQL queries using AI",

      "description": "Strategic budgeting is a cornerstone of financial management, playing a pivotal role in ensuring that an organization's resources are allocated effectively to achieve its long-term objectives. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of strategic budgeting, while also offering insights into the practical frameworks that drive sound financial planning and control. By focusing on the concepts and techniques that form the foundation of strategic budgeting, students will develop a thorough understanding of how organizations can align financial decisions with broader business goals. The course’s approach is theory-based, providing the essential knowledge needed to apply strategic budgeting principles in various organizational contexts.\nThe course begins by introducing the fundamental principles of strategic budgeting, helping students grasp the importance of developing a comprehensive budget framework. Strategic budgeting goes beyond simple financial planning; it involves creating a dynamic system that allows organizations to be flexible and responsive to changes in their financial environment. This dynamic approach ensures that budgeting is not merely an administrative task but a strategic tool that can drive innovation, efficiency, and long-term success. Throughout the course, students will explore how theoretical frameworks help organizations forecast future financial needs and respond to unexpected challenges.\nOne of the key aspects of strategic budgeting is building a comprehensive budget framework. A solid framework integrates various financial elements to provide a clear picture of an organization's financial health. Students will learn how to develop such frameworks by understanding core budgeting techniques and tools that ensure consistency and accuracy in financial planning. Through this process, they will also explore the importance of aligning budget frameworks with an organization’s strategic goals, reinforcing the idea that successful financial planning cannot occur in isolation but must be integrated into broader business objectives.\nAs students progress, they will explore the critical aspect of implementing and monitoring budget strategies. Implementing a strategic budget requires careful planning, execution, and ongoing review to ensure that the organization stays on track. Monitoring budget strategies is equally important, as it helps organizations identify variances between planned and actual performance and make necessary adjustments. Students will gain a theoretical understanding of various financial control methods, including how to use financial statements and ratios to monitor and guide strategic budgeting decisions. By mastering these techniques, students will be better equipped to ensure that their strategic budgeting efforts contribute to sustainable financial health and organizational growth.\nFinancial planning and control are essential components of strategic budgeting, and this course provides students with the tools to understand and apply these concepts. Financial planning involves forecasting future financial needs, setting goals, and developing a roadmap to achieve those goals. In contrast, financial control focuses on monitoring and adjusting financial activities to ensure that an organization remains on track. Students will learn about various financial statements and ratios, which serve as crucial tools for assessing financial performance and guiding decision-making processes. By understanding these theoretical frameworks, students will be able to apply financial control techniques effectively in their own budgeting processes.\nLastly, this course emphasizes the importance of integrating budgeting with organizational strategic goals. Students will explore the relationship between financial planning and an organization’s overall strategic direction, learning how to align budgeting processes with key business objectives. This approach ensures that financial planning is not only focused on short-term gains but also supports long-term growth and sustainability. By understanding the theoretical frameworks behind integrated budgeting strategies, students will be able to develop financial plans that are aligned with the broader goals of their organizations.\nThrough this course, students will gain a strong theoretical foundation in strategic budgeting, learning how to apply key concepts and frameworks to real-world financial planning and control scenarios. By the end of the course, they will be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute effectively to their organization's strategic financial decision-making processes.",

      "description": "Hello everyone! I'm Chen Xiaoyun, a student of Master Zhou Wenqiang, a mentor in Chinese financial intelligence. I'm very happy to welcome you to this Financial Intelligence Training Camp.\nThis training camp is a practical course specially designed for Master Zhou’s students. I’ll be sharing the original teachings from Master Zhou and guiding you step by step as we learn about financial intelligence together.\nMaster Zhou calls this camp “The 24 Most Amazing Lessons in Financial Intelligence in the World.” Why? Because there was once a book that changed his life completely — it’s called “The Master Key System.” Master Zhou sold hundreds of thousands of copies of this book through live streaming on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok).\nThis book is even known as “the banned book of Silicon Valley.” When it first came out, many billionaires in Silicon Valley bought up all the copies and destroyed them, trying to keep its secrets for themselves. For over 100 years, no one could read it, because it revealed deep secrets about building wealth.\nSo why did Master Zhou decide to start this training camp? Let me briefly explain. During the pandemic, his offline courses were delayed. But Master Zhou has made it his life mission to help millions of families achieve financial freedom and live healthier, happier lives.\nYears ago, Master Zhou was just a poor boy from the countryside in Xinxiang, Henan. At age 15, his father went bankrupt. He had to drop out of school and take on jobs in factories, on construction sites, and even sell things on the street. Back then, he felt like a stray dog, lost and hopeless.\nBut then, one book changed everything — “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” by Robert Kiyosaki.\nImagine a 17-year-old boy with big dreams, living in small, cheap rental rooms in cities like Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Beijing. Every time he faced setbacks, he would turn to that book. It became his belief, his strength, and his guide.\nAt 17, after reading the book, he dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur and investor. His goal was to achieve financial freedom in 28 years. But he did it in just 8.\nAnd instead of living a luxurious life after his success, he remembered a promise he made to himself at 17:\n“If Rich Dad, Poor Dad can change my life and help me gain financial freedom, then I will dedicate my life to financial education and help others who also want to start from scratch.”\nThat’s why we now have the chance to learn these 24 incredible lessons in financial intelligence.",

Retail banking is a way for individual consumers to manage their money, have access to credit, and deposit their money in a secure manner.\nRetail banking is a banking facility that offers financial services to the general population rather than companies. It certainly helps retail customers conduct their daily financial dealings more effectively and safely.\nThere are 3 types of retail banks – small, large, and online. Moreover, they collect funds through service charges, overdraft charges, monthly maintenance fees, and modest fees.\nCorporate banking refers to the aspect of banking that deals with corporate customers. Commercial banks make loans that enable businesses to grow and hire people, contributing to the expansion of the economy. Both types of banks offer various products and services.\nCorporate banking (also called institutional banking) is a division in a bank responsible for putting together loans to corporations, financial institutions, and governments.\nCorporate banking is a very important division within many large commercial and bulge bracket banks; this team serves as a critical link between the commercial banking group and the capital markets/investment banking teams.\nPlease read the contents of the course before purchasing",

Let us say minimum 10 shares to be bought and sold).\nFeatures of forward contract & future Contracts:\n1. Forward contract are contract between 2 parties and hence there is risk of non-performance of obligation by either of the party. Such risk is not there in future contracts as they are standardized by exchanges.\n2. Each contract is designed between 2 parties and hence they are unique in terms of asset type, quantity, Contract size, expiration date etc.\n3. In forward contract, one party agrees to buy (Long in finance terms) an asset and other party agrees to sell (Short in finance terms) the same asset at the same date for same specified price. In future contract same thing happens only thing is that contracts need to be entered into lot of quantities as discussed above.\n4. In forward market, the contract has to be settled by delivery of the asset on expiration date however in future contracts they are cash settled.\n5. In forward contract initial money is not required to enter the contract commonly called as margin money but same is required for future contracts.\n6. Forward contracts are settled on expiry while future contracts are daily settled.\n\n\nSo Lets learn how risk less profits can be earned through forward and future contracts. Also we can learn how it can be used as hedging tool.",

The lectures cover the basics of corporate action, providing a clear overview of how financial decisions can reshape the structure of an organization.\nSection 2: Management Buyout (MBO)\nIn this section, students will dive into the management buyout (MBO) process. They will learn about different types of buyouts, the structure and funding of MBOs, and the criteria for a successful buyout.

Students will explore concepts such as financial distress, insolvency, and the steps involved in filing for bankruptcy. The course delves into liquidation processes, including numerical calculations and the use of models like the Z-score to predict bankruptcy. Learners will also analyze the legal framework surrounding bankruptcy, understanding concepts such as the absolute priority rule and flow-based insolvency.\nSection 4: Funding Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)\nHere, students will study the key financial aspects of mergers and acquisitions, focusing on different methods of payment, stock swaps, share exchange ratios, and the effects on earnings per share (EPS). The section also explores various financing decisions and how external commercial borrowings impact mergers and acquisitions, giving students a complete understanding of the financial mechanisms involved in corporate consolidation.\nSection 5: Case Study - HP and Compaq Merger\nThis section uses the HP and Compaq merger as a case study to illustrate the practical application of M&A concepts.

The lectures will cover the impact of cash payments on capital structures and provide valuable lessons on handling large-scale corporate mergers.\nSection 6: Leveraged Recapitalization\nLeveraged recapitalization is a financial strategy where a company restructures its balance sheet to increase debt and reduce equity.

Through diagrams and case studies (e.g., Sealed Air Corporation), learners will gain a clear understanding of how these techniques are employed to restructure companies and enhance shareholder value.\nSection 7: Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)\nIn this section, students will explore deeper concepts of M&A. Key topics include horizontal and vertical mergers, characteristics of conglomerate mergers, and understanding bootstrap earnings. Various examples will illustrate how companies create synergy and value through mergers, highlighting the role of competition metrics such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.\nSection 8: Cash Flow and Comparable Company Analysis\nUnderstanding the importance of free cash flow and analyzing comparable companies is key to valuation in mergers and acquisitions. Students will learn how to calculate and interpret negative cash flow, as well as conduct a comparable company analysis (CCA) to identify acquisition opportunities and their associated costs.\nSection 9: Goodwill and Acquisitions\nHere, students will delve into the concept of goodwill in the context of acquisitions.

Real-life examples will illustrate the practical applications of these concepts.\nSection 12: Types of Corporate Restructuring\nStudents will explore various types of corporate restructuring, both financial and operational.

      "description": "Corporate finance plays a central role in shaping the strategic direction and value of any business. In this course, students will explore the theoretical foundations behind the key elements of corporate finance, understanding how finance professionals evaluate and make decisions that directly impact a company’s financial health and long-term sustainability. The course provides an in-depth look into financial principles, with a focus on understanding corporate finance through a theoretical lens and analytical case studies. This approach will provide learners with the tools to navigate and interpret complex financial landscapes, making it ideal for those seeking a strong conceptual understanding of how finance drives value within organizations.\nThe course begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of corporate finance. Students will first learn the essential principles that form the bedrock of this field, such as capital structure, debt financing, and risk mitigation strategies. These concepts are critical for understanding how companies balance their financial needs with strategic growth initiatives, and students will gain insights into the role of financial planning in organizational success. The emphasis here is on the theoretical frameworks that underpin financial strategies, helping students build a strong foundation to assess financial situations from an analytical perspective.\nFinancial statements are the cornerstone of financial decision-making, offering a snapshot of a company’s financial health at any given moment. In this course, learners will explore the importance of these statements, diving into how they are used to assess performance and predict future outcomes. Understanding financial statements requires more than just familiarity with numbers—it involves the ability to interpret data and apply it to broader financial strategies. Students will focus on the importance of reading, analyzing, and understanding financial documents such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow reports. By focusing on these elements, learners will develop the analytical skills necessary to evaluate a company’s financial position.\nValuation techniques are a key focus of the course, offering students a comprehensive view of how value is created and maintained within an organization. Through an examination of various valuation methods, such as discounted cash flow analysis and market-based approaches, learners will gain an understanding of how businesses assess their worth and make decisions that drive value creation. This section also integrates risk management concepts, helping students understand how risk influences valuation and how strategic decisions are made to mitigate potential financial setbacks. By exploring the interplay between risk and valuation, students will learn how to approach financial problems holistically, considering multiple factors before reaching a conclusion.\nFinancial decision-making is a crucial aspect of corporate finance, and the course will guide students through the principles that shape these decisions. From investment analysis to capital allocation, financial professionals must constantly evaluate how to use resources effectively to maximize value. Learners will explore the theoretical frameworks that inform these decisions, developing a critical eye for assessing which financial strategies will generate the best outcomes for a company. This section emphasizes the need for a structured approach to decision-making, one that considers both financial and ethical factors, ensuring that decisions not only benefit the company but align with broader societal values.\nFinally, the course covers risk management and valuation integration, essential for maintaining corporate value in an ever-changing market. Students will learn how to identify potential risks and use valuation techniques to address them, ensuring that value is not only created but sustained over time. By focusing on the theoretical aspects of risk management, learners will develop the skills necessary to evaluate and respond to risks proactively, integrating these considerations into their financial decision-making process.\nThis course offers a well-rounded exploration of corporate finance, with a particular emphasis on theoretical understanding. It equips students with the necessary knowledge to approach financial challenges with confidence and skill, ensuring they can contribute to value creation and risk management in any corporate setting.",

      "description": "This course is based on my 42 years of experience as a Head of Credit and Chief Risk Officer and chairman of credit committees in top international banks. I have prepared, supervised and approved over 90 different M&A projects and very large number of corporate relationships in different industries around the world. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 1000 relationship managers, financial analysts, and credit managers who now are senior managers in banks.\nThis course is one of many courses I prepared concentrating on credit to industries, such as contracting, trading, manufacturing, mining, shipping , Agribusiness, etc…and my courses are taken by bank managers, financial credit analysts and entrepreneurs.\nIn the course you will learn:\nWhat are the various types of M&A\nCharacteristics of each type of acquisition, advantages and disadvantages\nWhat kind of due diligence is carried out before acquisition and what happens after the acquisition.\nHow to analyze the financial statements of a target company, and the financials of the acquiring company.\nThe development of M&A over the year sand future trends.\nHow to put the pieces together and presenting the proposal to the credit committee to secure a credit approval.\n\n\nI teach through fundamentals and practical case studies as they happen in banks. So, you will have a lot of lectures presented from banks perspective. To every lecture you will find attached as a resource the lesson itself, the summary of that lesson, the discussion raising questions and issues to think over and analyze, in addition to quizzes and answers for those quizzes. It is crucial that you try to understand the question and give the answer before you scroll down to the actual correct answers. In addition you will find additional videos provided just to let you get wider view and understanding of the financial world around you.\n\n\nWhy this course?\n\n\nM&A projects are demanding and move quickly, requiring significant effort and dedication. You must also become proficient in financial analysis and ratios, particularly in areas such as liquidity, capitalization and profitability, market research, synergy identification, and pinpointing potential improvements.\nBecause of that this course will enable you understand the concepts, techniques used by analysts, and provide you with the knowledge using real life situations and how banks actually deal with these scenarios. The course will enable you to understand the legal implication of a firm organization seeking to acquire or being a target to be acquired, and use financial analysis and the ratios system to analyze, interpret the financial statements of target companies, and reach a valuation for that target company. The course is condensed with information supported by cool graphics to explain each concept visually.\n\n\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that to excel as a top-tier credit manager or as an Analyst, you need a solid grasp of M&A projects and the analysis involved. This is why I strongly recommend this course, particularly for junior credit Managers, Consultants or Business Analysts and owners who haven't attended business school or studied Economics. This course will equip you with the expertise in M&A analysis comparable to that of professionals at top international banks.",

There, private equity investors often syndicate (i.e. a group of private equity investors) but the lead financier needs to structure the syndicate in such a manner that conflicts of interests are minimised. This can be done by taking a higher equity stake in order to reduce moral hazard problems but also to signal the quality of the target firm (i.e. an adverse selection problem). If this is done properly, the impact on target performance is beneficial.",

      "description": "This course includes content generated with AI.\nAre you tired of feeling like you're a step behind with your finances? Overwhelmed by conflicting advice and frustrated by economic barriers that seem designed to hold you back? This comprehensive course was developed with advanced AI assistance to ensure you get the most current, evidence-based financial education available.\nMaster Your Financial Psychology and Build Lasting Wealth\nEliminate debt forever using the scientifically-proven snowball method that guarantees momentum\nBuild an unshakeable emergency fund that protects you from life's unexpected events\nCreate a diversified investment portfolio with low-cost ETFs and index funds\nOvercome loss aversion and other psychological biases sabotaging your financial decisions\nDesign a personalized budgeting system that actually works for your lifestyle\nNavigate systemic barriers like housing costs and student debt with strategic planning\nMaster the fundamentals of behavioral finance to make smarter money choices\nThe difference is in the approach: we tackle both your mindset and your money.\nWhy Financial Literacy Matters More Than Ever\nRecent studies show that 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, while only 57% of adults are financially literate. The traditional financial advice industry has failed because it focuses solely on tactics while ignoring the psychological and systemic forces that truly shape wealth. Meanwhile, housing prices have outpaced wage growth by 340% over the past 40 years, and student debt has reached crisis levels, creating unprecedented barriers for young adults.\nThe financial landscape has fundamentally changed. Generic advice like \"just save more\" doesn't account for behavioral economics research showing that loss aversion makes us fear losing $100 twice as much as we enjoy gaining $100. This course addresses both the practical tools and the mental frameworks you need to succeed.\nWhat You'll Learn\nThis isn't theory – it's a complete action plan. You'll master the behavioral psychology behind money decisions, learning why traditional budgeting fails and how to design systems that work with your brain, not against it. We cover everything from zero-based budgeting to advanced portfolio construction, with real-world examples from multiple countries including Germany's 70/30 world portfolio strategy and Brazil's Tesouro Direto system.\nThe investing section goes beyond basic stock picking to teach you evidence-based passive investing strategies. You'll understand why academic research consistently shows that 85% of actively managed funds underperform their benchmarks over 15-year periods, and how to build a globally diversified portfolio using low-cost index funds and ETFs.\nWho This Course Is For\nComplete beginners who want to build financial confidence from the ground up\nYoung professionals struggling with student debt and high living costs\nMid-career individuals ready to get serious about long-term wealth building\nAnyone who's tried budgeting before but couldn't stick with it\nYou Don't Need Experience\nMany people assume they need extensive financial knowledge or large amounts of money to start investing. The truth is, you can begin building wealth with as little as $100 and basic arithmetic skills. This course is designed for real people with real constraints – those dealing with student loans, high rent, and the psychological challenges that come with financial stress.\nEvidence-Based Methods That Actually Work\nYou might think debt elimination is just about willpower, but research from Northwestern Kellogg School of Management proves otherwise. Their landmark 2021 study of over 6,000 participants showed that the debt snowball method – paying off smallest balances first – led to 13% higher completion rates than the mathematically \"optimal\" avalanche method. Why? Because psychology matters more than optimization.\nYour Complete Financial Education\nModule 1-2: Master the psychology of money and understand how cultural and systemic factors impact your wealth-building journey.\nModule 3-4: Build your financial foundation with emergency funds, credit optimization, and science-backed debt elimination strategies.\nModule 5-6: Learn investing fundamentals, from risk and return relationships to building a globally diversified portfolio with ETFs.\nModule 7: Explore advanced concepts including factor investing, alternative investments, and geopolitical risk assessment.\nExtra Materials: Global tax-advantaged accounts guide, geopolitical risk framework and modern approaches to valuing intangible assets.\nEach module includes practical exercises, real-world case studies, and actionable worksheets. You'll also get access to portfolio templates and budgeting spreadsheets used by financial advisors.\nReady to Take Control of Your Financial Future?\nStop letting financial stress control your life. This course provides everything you need to build lasting wealth, from psychological insights that prevent self-sabotage to practical investment strategies used by institutional investors.\nEnroll Now and start building your financial freedom blueprint today.",

By effectively managing debt, individuals and organizations can avoid the pitfalls of financial distress, achieve greater financial freedom, and work towards long-term financial goals, such as homeownership, retirement, or business growth.\nMany people often take the positive part of their debt without thinking about how debt can destroy their life. However, if you learn to understand the role of 'debt and borrowing', you will understand how to control it and only benefit from it, and how to create a strategy to get rid of debt.\nTherefore, I suggest... go through this course to familiarize yourself with the nature / character of money and debt, what you can get and what you can lose. And when you understand that, it will be easier to control it and turn it to your advantage\nDebt can be your friend and make your life beautiful, but it can also be a cunning enemy and determine your life paths in a direction you don't want to go.\nIt is usually said - debt is short-term joy and long-term pain.",

      "description": "Introduction\nFIRE – is a mash-up of two phrases FI – Stands for Financial Independence, RE – Stands for Retire Early.\nFIRE is now a movement and more and more people are embracing it. One of the key driver is the desire to live the best life you can without having to participate in the rat race. The internet is riddled with dozens of blogs and forums that are very insightful. I myself have learnt a great deal from them.\nOne of the problems is that the material that is available out there is spread out into multiple sources and is difficult to filter the content into what is actually quality and what is simply a sales pitch. Another issue is the fact that many of the Blogs and Forums assume that the reader has above average level of understanding of Finance.\nThrough this course I have tried to solve these two problems.\nI have structured the course in such a way that the essential, distilled, practical contents from a vast amount of sources is presented in an easy to understand way. In addition, the course does not assume any prior knowledge of Finance. In fact we literally start from the foundational idea of ‘What is Money?’.\nThe Course also has spreadsheets that are provided as a takeaway and can be used/modified according to your needs.\nThe ultimate goal of the course is to help you achieve Financial Independence the Easy, Fast and Safe way.\nDisclaimer  - In this course I do not provide a 'Buy this stock, it will make you rich' kind of information but a way to invest for the long term. Using the analogy of buying a Mobile Phone - I do not say buy the iPhone 11 Pro, its the best, rather, I teach you how to choose the right Phone for your needs.\n\n\nCourse Structure and Organization\nThe course is structured into 5 Sections with Multiple Modules under each section. Each Module is further divided into Chapters.\nSection 1 – Spark of FIRE\nIn this section we will Define and Clarify the meaning of FIRE through answering the key questions of What and Why FIRE. By answering these questions you will be able to know with clarity as to what FIRE is and what it is not.\nSection 2 – Building Blocks of FIRE\nIn this course I do not assume that you have any level of knowledge about Finance. In case you are confident about the basics of Finance then I would recommend you to skip this section. If you think you need to revisit some of the concepts that you do not feel too confident about, then I would recommend you to quickly skim through this Section with a focus on your weak areas.\nIn case you have no prior knowledge in Finance then I think this section is a prerequisite to be able to understand the contents of the next upcoming sections. Worry not, the contents of this section are not scary academic, I don’t like those either. The good news is that you don’t have to be a Harvard Economist to be able to FIRE.\nModule 1 – Economics\nIn this Module we start off from the very basics of Money. We will address questions like ‘What is Money?’ , ‘How can a piece of paper have so much value?’ etc. We will also learn about interest rates and more importantly the miraculous powers of compound interest rates. We will learn how to think about money in 2-Dimensions rather than in the 1-Dimensional way in which we usually think. This shift in thinking itself is of immense value to you.\nWe will also understand the intuition behind Inflation and Credit Cycles and what the implications of these to FIRE.\nThis module has accompanying spreadsheets that can be used to further strengthen your understanding of the concepts presented here.\nModule 2 – Capital Markets\nStocks, Shares, Bonds, Funds, ETFs etc. We will understand the foundational basics of all these types of investment choices. I use easy to understand intuitive examples to demystify these seemingly ‘complex’ things also called Financial Instruments.\nBy the end of this module, you would have a strong foundation in the concepts behind these Instruments.\nModule 3 – Statistics\nWe all are faced with choices in Life. Making choices is hard but making Financial Choices need not be hard. We will learn about the tools and techniques that are used by Big Companies in their Sales and Procurement Offices and apply them to examples that we all face in our everyday life.\nWe use the worksheets that accompany this Module to make optimal choices on scenarios like a) Two Job Offers but with slightly different Bonus structures b) An opportunity to invest in a rental property vs Investing in a fixed deposit etc.\nModule 4 – Accounting\nThis is the last module in this section and acts as a connecting link between this section and the next section which is the ‘How to’ of FIRE. If achieving FIRE is a journey then this course is like a Map. A Map is only useful if you know your location on the Map. This Module allows you to find your Financial Location on the Map.\nWe will go through the concepts of Networth, Net Income and Tax. More importantly we will understand the importance of Net Income over Networth and the way these two are related.\nThrough the accompanying worksheets we will work out how to calculate Networth and Net Incomes.\nSection 3 – Starting the FIRE\nModule 1 – Step 0\nDebt is the Enemy! Before we start off on the journey of FIRE we should get our Debts under control. Not all debts are bad, some can be good like a Mortgage other can be bad like Credit Card debt due to lifestyle choices.\nWe will learn about Debt in detail and apply the concepts of Compound Interest which we learnt in the previous section to get a realistic view on how debt can become a burden.\nWe will learn one of the most popular methods of tackling debt called the ‘Snow-ball Method’ using real-life examples.\nModule 2 – Step 1\nAll the stuff we have gone through so far is the prep work before we take our very first step on the journey of FIRE. In this Module you will be able to set your own personal Vision of FIRE by answering personal questions on what FIRE really means to you? How does a post FIRE life really look like? Etc.\n\nOnce you have a clear understanding of your personal Vision of FIRE we will use the Vision you developed as an input to derive some key numbers that ultimately give you an estimate on the Income that you need to sustain your post FIRE life. We will then learn about Passive Income.\nWe will apply strict criteria to check if any given income source is Passive or not. Finally we will learn the simple yet the most important equation of FIRE.\nModule 3 – Step 2\nIn this Module we will further extend our understanding of Passive Income. We will look at the FIRE journey in its entirety i.e the pre-FIRE life, post-FIRE life and beyond. Considering these stages is important to get the calculation right so as to achieve FIRE ‘Early’.\nIn this Module you will learn the corner-stone of FIRE which is the Trinity study, also known as the 4% Rule. We will understand the intuition behind this rule and also apply it using our worksheets and ‘fact-check’ with few other reputable external public resources.\nModule 4 – Step 3\nThis Module is by-far the most technical that this course would ever get. It is not required to know all the contents of this module to understand how to FIRE. The main purpose of this module is to give you the evidence behind all the claims and suggestions that I have presented in the course so far so that you feel confident about the concepts that you have invested your time and money to learn.\nI have used the life-lessons and advice from Gurus like Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham and Jack Bogle to build the case for the suggested methodology in this course.\nSection 4 – Maintaining FIRE\nIt is important to FIRE but it is more important to stay FIREd. In this Module we will talk about the three components that are needed to maintain FIRE – Risk Management, Portfolio Management and Lifestyle Design.\nWe will go into the details behind each of the components and understand how they contribute to help you maintain your FIRE. We will look at the practical solutions available to cover each of the components of FIRE as well.\nSection 5 – Accelerating FIRE – The Big 3\nThe basic needs of human beings of Shelter, Transport and Food have not changed for Hundreds of years. What has changed however is the way in which we fulfill these basic needs.\nThese three needs are called the BIG 3 within the FIRE movement.\nIn this module we will dive deep into understanding each one of them. For shelter, we address the question of Buying vs Renting. We use a simple yet powerful heuristic model implemented in the worksheet that accompanies this course to help you make a judgement on this difficult decision.\nWe look into the various aspects of transportation and how transportation choices are closely linked to housing choices. We will explore the pros and cons of Buying a Car.\nWhen it comes to Food, we discuss the benefit of how simple acts like meal-prep can help you accumulate wealth faster.\nThis module includes an additional item which is a rapidly growing phenomenon ‘ Subscriptions’. We will use worksheets to reverse engineer the subscription models developed by Marketing people and put them into the real context so that you can make informed choices when it comes to subscriptions.\n\n2022 Jan Update\nCrypto in FIRE\nIn this module update you will learn about Why should you include Crypto in your FIRE portfolio? Which Crypto to choose among the thousands of choices out there? You will also learn about the best practices and the common mistakes when it comes to buying and storing crypto.\nThis module concludes with the structuring of your FIRE portfolio so that it has exposure to Crypto.",

      "description": "Corporate governance deals with the complex set of relationships between the corporation and its stakeholder such as the board of directors, management, shareholders etc. In the recent years, with growth in finance scandals the regulators and legislators have deepened their focus on how businesses are being run. They are trying to create a prototype for new corporate governance and disclosure measures, which would be constructive for both the stakeholders and controllers.\nThrough this tutorial we are going to learn the key aspects about corporate governance.\nThe training will include the following;\nIntroduction\nFundamentals of Corporate Governance\nKey Stakeholders\n4 Ps of Corporate Governance\nPrinciples on Corporate Governance in Banks by BSBS\nThe US Corporate Governance System\nThe Enron Scandal\nThe WorldCom Scandal\nThe Influence of SOX on Corporate Governance\nConclusion\nSelf-evaluation\nCorporate Governance refers to the way in which companies are governed and to what purpose. It identifies who has power and accountability, and who makes decisions. It is, in essence, a toolkit that enables management and the board to deal more effectively with the challenges of running a company. Corporate governance ensures that businesses have appropriate decision-making processes and controls in place so that the interests of all stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the community) are balanced. Good corporate governance can benefit investors and other stakeholders, while bad governance can lead to scandal and ruin. Governance refers to the set of rules, controls, policies, and resolutions put in place to direct corporate behavior. A board of directors is pivotal in governance, while proxy advisors and shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance. Communicating a company's corporate governance is a key component of community and investor relations. For instance, Apple Inc.'s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of incorporation. Most successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance. For many shareholders, it is not enough for a company to be profitable; it also must demonstrate good corporate citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behavior, and other sound corporate governance practices.",

      "description": "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y). It assumes a linear relationship between the two variables and aims to find the best-fitting straight line that represents this relationship.\nThe equation for a simple linear regression model is:\ny = ax + b\nWhere:\ny is the dependent variable (the variable we want to predict).\nx is the independent variable (the variable used to make predictions).\na is the slope of the line, representing the rate of change of y with respect to x.\nb is the y-intercept, representing the value of y when x is zero.\nWhile simple linear regression is a statistical technique, it can also be considered as a machine learning algorithm. In machine learning, the goal is to build models that can learn from data and make predictions. Linear regression fits this framework because it learns the relationship between x and y from a given dataset and uses this learned relationship to make predictions for new data points. As neural networks learn the best non-linear relationships between data by finding the weights that best fit the data, linear regression aims to find the best values of a and b that best describe the linear relationship between variables.\nIn this course, our aim is to build a linear regression model in mql5 that seeks to predict the closing prices of a currency pair given its specific bar index. We shall start by creating a linear regression model on a spread sheet to basically explain the calculations involved in creating a linear regression model. We shall then develop our linear regression model as an mql5 indicator by coding it using the mql5 programming language. After that, we shall develop our trading strategy as an mql5 expert advisor coded using the mql5 algorithmic trading language. We shall use the linear regression model we created as an indicator to analyze data and find patterns we can use to profit from the market. We shall base our trading logic on the fact that if price goes beyond one or two standard deviations from its predicted or expected price, it has to reverse and go back to its expected price. Hence our strategy will be a mean reversion type of strategy.\nFor those that are still finding their way with MQL5, as long as you understand the basics of MQL5, this course is for you. We will patiently guide you through every step of the strategy development process and walk you through every line of code we shall craft. Hopefully, by the end of the course, you will have gained the necessary skills to code similar models and trading strategies and be able to appreciate how linear regression models can be an asset in developing your own trading ideas based on the ideas that shared in this course.\nSo hit hard on that enroll button now and join me in this incredible journey of coding a linear regression model using the mql5 algorithmic trading language.",

Yet we all use it every day in some way or another.\nHi my name is Christo van Zyl. I made my first million before I turned 30 - and then lost it all. I discovered my father and grandfather were millionaires also! Yet, they left no book, no course and no instructions on how to make money, keep money, grow money - or how money works...\nI have spent more than 13 years learning every single thing about money I could find my hands on. I read books, I listened to audio, I interrogated my life, my fathers and grandfathers' lives.

Asset Accounting with Ledger-Specific Valuation (Highlighted)\nUPA introduces ledger-specific Asset Accounting.\nEach ledger uses its own:\nDepreciation Area\nDepreciation Key\nUseful Life\nExample:\nAsset in 0L = 10 years (IFRS) with Depreciation Key - LINS\nAsset in 2L = 10 years (LOGA) with Depreciation Key- S150\nValues post to ACDOCA per ledger and flow into cost centers/orders, enabling event-based capitalization and depreciation.\n7. Universal Allocation (Highlighted)\n\n\nReplaces old cycles (KSU5, KSV5, etc.) with Universal Allocation.\nSupports ledger-specific cost allocations.\nReal-time allocation of:\ncosts to production\nActual activity rates\nExample:\nCost center allocations post differently in 0L vs 2L based on accounting logic.\nEnhances auditability and transparency.\n8. Value Flow to ML from AA and CO\nAsset Acquisition → Capitalized in 0L and 2L separately.\nDepreciation postings flow to Cost Centers (CO).\nProduction Orders absorb asset usage, Machine.\nFinally, Material Ledger captures and settles actual costs to inventory via CKMLCP per ledger.\n9. Key Benefits of UPA with EBC and AA\na) Real-time, ledger-wise WIP and variance posting\nb) Supports multiple valuation standards (Local GAAP, IFRS)\nc) Depreciation handled ledger-specifically, improving asset control\nd) FI-CO-ML-AA integration provides a unified reporting base\ne) No period-end bottlenecks, better close processes\nf) Accurate COGM per ledger using CKMLCP-OL and CKMLCP-2L\ng) Universal Allocation improves clarity of internal charging\nConclusion:\nUniversal Parallel Accounting with Event-Based Costing, Asset Accounting, and Material Ledger integration enables end-to-end value flow with ledger-specific accuracy. Organizations can now comply with global accounting standards, improve real-time visibility, and automate costing processes, empowering both finance and operations for strategic decision-making.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Private Equity & Venture Capital course. I don't want to start with the introduction of the course. The course is based on four different parts that cover a lot of topics related to private equity and venture capital. The first part is related to discovering the taxonomy of a private equity and venture capital. That means to discover a lot of business behind the definition of private equity and venture capital. The second part is devoted to legal issues and taxation. In finance, legal issues and taxation are really fundamental because it means to deal with the vehicle you are going to use to invest in private equity and venture capital. But it also means to discover the mechanism announcing performance. The third part is related to the so-called managerial process. That means to understand all the fundamental activities and topics related to private equity and venture capital entities investing money of investors. And the last part is related to company valuation and deal making.\nEvery time you're going to invest in private equity and venture capital you have to valuate the company, but the valuation is completely different in the different deals of private equity and venture capital. Let's imagine, for example, an IPO, or the financing of a startup or a structure of a company. In all cases you are talking about private equity and venture capital, but the deals are completely different. The last aspect is related to the pay off. I do believe in whatever kind of course, the payoff is fundamental; and the payoff of this course is related to the fact you are going to understand all the secrets, all the relevant mechanisms behind the private equity and venture capital industry.\nAnd that's relevant for a very huge audience which is made by students, by managers, by consultants, by entrepreneurs, by young entrepreneurs willing to launch a startup, but also by analysts belonging to the financial industry, and people and practitioners working in the private equity and venture capital industry.",

Mergers and acquisitions analysts support these complex deals by evaluating financial reports, studying company operations, and deciding how a company will fit within another business or as part of a larger portfolio.\nMergers and acquisitions analysts do most of the preliminary legwork for potential deals. They analyze industry prospects by gathering information about growth, competitors, and market share possibilities. They also review company fundamentals and financial statements. The analyst will then build a mosaic to help upper-level managers make decisions on a deal. This work is done over many months, but during certain periods analysts can work very long hours—up to 18 hour days. It is an extremely stressful and high-pressured job.\nEntry-level analysts can join mergers and acquisitions teams at small, mid-sized, and large banks or investment firms. At smaller firms, the analyst works hand-in-hand with senior executives and can find being involved in more aspects of a deal to be rewarding. The downside to a small firm is the analyst will be responsible for more of the research and due diligence in a deal. At a large bank, analysts may have a slightly lighter workload as there will be more people specializing in each task. The analyst will likely also specialize in a task and see less variation in duties. A large bank will have more resources for gathering data and information.\n\n\nM&A ANALYST COURSE STRUCTURE AND LOS\nTopic 1: Fundamentals of Mergers & Acquisitions\nLearning Outcomes\nExplain the strategic rationale behind mergers and acquisitions.\nDifferentiate between types of M&A transactions (horizontal, vertical, conglomerate).\nDescribe common deal structures (asset purchase, stock purchase, merger).\nIdentify the roles of buyers, sellers, advisors, and regulators in M&A deals.\nAssess key drivers that create or destroy value in M&A.\nRecognize the impact of industry trends on M&A activity.\nApply key M&A terminology in professional contexts.\nInterpret the typical timeline and phases of an M&A process.\nTopic 2: Financial Analysis & Valuation in M&A\nIn the end, learner can be able to understand:\nConduct financial statement analysis of target companies.\nBuild discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models for M&A.\nApply trading comparables and transaction comparables in valuation.\nEvaluate synergies and their impact on valuation.\nAnalyze the effects of financing choices (debt vs. equity) on deal value.\nPerform accretion/dilution analysis to assess deal impact on EPS.\nInterpret valuation multiples across industries.\nTopic 3: Due Diligence & Risk Assessment\nIn the end, learner can be able to understand:\nOutline the scope and objectives of financial, legal, tax, and operational due diligence.\nIdentify red flags during due diligence that may affect deal viability.\nAssess cultural and organizational risks in integration planning.\nEvaluate regulatory and compliance considerations in cross-border M&A.\nDevelop risk mitigation strategies for identified issues.\nInterpret due diligence findings to adjust purchase price or deal terms.\nTopic 4: Deal Structuring & Negotiation\nIn the end, learner can be able to understand:\nDifferentiate between share purchase and asset purchase agreements.\nExplain earn-outs, contingent payments, and price adjustment mechanisms.\nAnalyze the role of financing arrangements in deal structuring.\nApply negotiation tactics in buyer-seller discussions.\nEvaluate the use of representations, warranties, and indemnities in contracts.\nAssess antitrust and competition law considerations in structuring deals.\nInterpret term sheets and letters of intent (LOI).\nTopic 5: Post-Merger Integration (PMI) & Value Creation\nIn the end, learner can be able to understand:\nExplain the importance of integration planning before deal closure.\nIdentify key drivers of successful post-merger integration.\nEvaluate cultural integration challenges in cross-border M&A.\nDevelop strategies for realizing operational and financial synergies.\nMonitor and measure performance against integration goals.\nAnalyze change management practices in M&A integration.\nApply communication strategies to align stakeholders during PMI.\nAssess long-term value creation and risks post-transaction.",

My course is designed to take the stress out of figuring out how to pay for your nursing education and give you the skills and confidence to make the most out of your money.\nWith this course, you'll get access to comprehensive scholarship and loan forgiveness options and learn how to pay for nursing school without breaking the bank.\nAs a highly qualified healthcare professional, I completed my Master’s degree in Public Health prior to completing my accelerated Bachelors of Nursing degree.

I learned how to negotiate financial aid, and got my nursing school to pay for my last semester at over $20,000. I have employed these negotiation skills to triple my salary in my 2+ years being out of nursing school; using the extra income to create my own debt payoff plan.\nMy education and experience have equipped me with the financial management skills needed to excel in my field. That's why I created my course, How to Pay for Nursing School, to teach you these skills. Additionally, you will learn how to:\nMinimize debt: Learn how to pay for nursing school with minimal debt.\nIncrease income: Discover strategies to increase your income as a nursing student during and after school.\nSecure your future: Gain the skills and resources to prepare for a successful career as a new graduate.\nNursing school is stressful enough.

If you are VERY new to finance, this is the one to start with and its also why we listed it first.\nSaaSy, Inc - SaaSy, Inc is all about subscriptions models.  These types of business models have become VERY popular not just with software but with everything because recurring revenue is the best kind of revenue.  Although we'll use software for this particular financial modeling exercise, you can use this lab to conceptualize ANY business that will use a recurring revenue model, more commonly called a subscription model. SaaSy, Inc is a software company that is looking to help people simplify how they stand up eCommerce websites.  Similar to the Lemonade, Inc. lab, we'll start small and build all the way to a full five year financial model.  And, we'll hit as many fun topics along the way.",

In fact, I've committed my career to making that happen, and now I've put everything I've learned into this course so that you can get the kinds of results my clients have been getting:\n- Going from the verge of divorce to being best friends again\n- Buying dream homes, paying off homes, and purchasing second homes to build generational wealth\n- Negotiating raises\n- Paying off 5 figures of credit card debt...and much more!\n\n\nBottom Line: If you want financial clarity, stability, peace of mind, and partnership...then you're in the right place!\n---\nWhat You Will Get\n- Everything you need to overcome financial overwhelm and get clarity and confidence around your money\n- The skills and knowledge to transform your money mindset & habits so that you can build a stable and secure financial future - even in the midst of a pandemic\n- Customizable tools for easily tracking spending, prioritizing debts, and more\n- All the key skills and tools you need to have healthy money talks (this will give you a stronger, more intimate relationship overall, too!)\n- A Financial Prosperity Plan that honors both your individual AND shared goals\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nMany couples never get on the same page about finances, and it costs them intimacy, partnership, money, and sometimes the relationship itself.\nIf you could save several years of struggle, anxiety, and resentment, and replace it with more love, teamwork, and money, would that be worth it to you?\n---\nYou'll learn and apply the exact same concepts that Adam uses to get client results like these:\nAdam helped us through our salary negotiations, which resulted in raises for each of us, with a combined gross salary increase of over 20% per year -- and in my case, a promotion as well -- with our current employers.\n\nMore importantly, Adam helped get us on the same page as a couple when it came to our financial goals and money mindset.\n\nAdam is a former tax attorney, certified mediator, and life coach with a compassionate and non-judgmental communication style.\n\nI highly recommend him to couples seeking financial clarity and peace of mind.\nPatricia and Jonathan, Professionals & Parents of 2\n---\nThis is for couples who:\n- Struggle to manage money together and/or have healthy money conversations\n- May not know where to start but are ready to get on the same page about money once and for all\n- Desire more financial clarity, stability, intimacy, and peace of mind!\n- Want the ability to execute on their long-term vision and goals\n\n\nThis is not for couples who:\nX - Want a magic bullet, overnight fix, or financial plan simply handed to them\nX - Prefer to make financial decisions + plans completely separately\nX - Are unwilling to work on improving communication + opening up to each other\n---\nWhat's Included\nModule 1) Your Money & Relationships Story (the key to self-awareness)\nModule 2) The 4 Essentials (you must know these to make any real progress)\nModule 3) Your Future and Your Top Priorities (individually and together)\nModule 4) Values-Based Budgeting\nModule 5) Accounts: Joint, Separate, or Mixed (this one's not what you think!)\nModule 6) Create and Protect Your Future: Family, Retirement, Insurance & Legacy\nModule 7) Sustaining Your Progress: Roles, Structures, and Ongoing Education (how to make your plan really stick)\n---\nEach Module Contains:\n-- Videos detailing essential financial concepts & knowledge\n-- Written activities to help you get clarity around your money mindset, your partner, your finances, and your future\n-- A supplemental presentation packed with powerful, experiential exercises to help you create financial intimacy and get on the same page\n---\nFAQs:\nTHIS SOUNDS GREAT, BUT HOW DO I GET MY PARTNER ON BOARD?\nTry this model to get the conversation started: \"I've been thinking about our finances lately and feeling [nervous, uncertain, etc.]. I think we could [share goals that excited both of you] even more effectively if we got on the same page. When's a good time to talk about this more?\" From there, you can share about this program.\nHOW MUCH TIME WILL THIS TAKE?\nThe program consists of 7 modules designed to be completed over 12 weeks. While the time needed varies, expect for each module around 15-45 minutes between activities and videos. (Module 2 may take more.) Beyond that, it's up to you how much time you dedicate to practicing and implementing these tools, skills, and concepts.\nDO I NEED TO UNDERSTAND PERSONAL FINANCE TO DO THIS PROGRAM?\nNope! Whatever knowledge you bring is great, and also I'll show you everything you need to know from the ground up!\n\n\n2% of all revenues are donated to an organization supporting domestic abuse survivors, as financial abuse co-occurs 99% of the time with domestic abuse.\n\n\nFor any questions, don't hesitate to message me.
