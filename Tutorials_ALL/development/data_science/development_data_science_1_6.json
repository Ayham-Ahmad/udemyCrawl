      "description": "Reinforcement learning is one of the most exciting areas in machine learning, and the best way to learn it is by working on projects. This course is designed to give you practical, step-by-step experience with reinforcement learning using Python. Instead of only focusing on theory, we’ll build working solutions that you can run, test, and extend.\nWe begin with a classic example, the Blackjack game, to introduce the core ideas of agents, rewards, and policies. From there, the course moves into optimization and decision-making problems. You’ll explore the Traveling Salesman Problem with simulated annealing, and then see how reinforcement learning can be applied in real applications such as recommendation systems, inventory management, and resource allocation.\nThe course also covers more advanced use cases. We’ll look at CNC machining parameter optimization with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), chemical batch process optimization with Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and network optimization in two parts. In the final section, we’ll introduce safe reinforcement learning, which has become increasingly important in real-world systems where safety constraints must be respected.\nBy the end of this course, you will have implemented a range of reinforcement learning projects in Python and gained a deeper understanding of how these methods can be applied across different domains. The course is suitable for learners who already have some Python experience and want to strengthen their knowledge of machine learning through practice.\nIf you’re looking for a hands-on way to learn reinforcement learning and see it applied in diverse problems, this course will guide you through each step.",

Video solutions for each challenge are provided so that you can see exactly how Ted thinks about the problem.\nTed Petrou is a world-renowned pandas expert having written the books Pandas Cookbook and Master Data Analysis with Python. Ted has also answered more than 400 pandas questions on Stack Overflow and taught thousands of students both in-person and online. With this experience, he has developed hundreds of exercises that aim to teach the most efficient and effective ways at using the pandas library.\nThe pandas library is one of the most powerful and popular tools today for analyzing data with Python. Although it is widely used, it takes a long time to master. There are often multiple ways of solving the same problem and unfortunately many of these solutions are poor and ineffective. Ted has developed these challenges to teach you the very best practices for doing data analysis with pandas.\nDo you have what it takes to solve these challenges?",

Designed for beginners and those with some statistical background, this course will guide you through the core principles of Bayesian analysis, allowing you to understand and apply these methods to real-world data.\nCourse Structure\nLecture 1: Why Bayes? Introduction and Welcome\nWe start with a fundamental question: Why Bayesian statistics? This lecture introduces the advantages of Bayesian thinking, contrasting it with frequentist methods to highlight how Bayesian analysis provides a flexible, intuitive approach to data. This session sets the stage for understanding the Bayesian perspective and what you can expect to gain from this course.\nLecture 2: R Setup for Bayesian Statistics\nIn this session, we’ll set up R for Bayesian analysis, covering essential packages and libraries, and walk through basic commands for data manipulation and visualization. By the end, you'll be equipped with the tools needed to dive into Bayesian modeling.\nLecture 3: The Bayesian Trinity: Priors, Likelihood, and Posteriors\nHere, we explore the three central components of Bayesian analysis: priors, likelihood, and posteriors. We’ll discuss how these elements interact to shape Bayesian inference and will use R to visualize how prior beliefs combine with data to form posterior distributions.\nLecture 4: Bayesian Regression in R\nThis lecture delves into Bayesian regression, covering linear models in a Bayesian framework. You'll learn how to specify priors, compute posterior distributions, and interpret results, building on classical regression knowledge to gain a Bayesian perspective.\nLecture 5: Logistic Regression and Predictions\nExpanding on regression techniques, this session introduces Bayesian logistic regression, ideal for binary outcomes and classification. You’ll learn to make probabilistic predictions and understand uncertainty, essential for interpreting results in Bayesian analysis.\nLecture 6: Diagnostics and Visualization\nDiagnostics are critical for ensuring model reliability. This lecture covers methods for evaluating model fit, assessing convergence, and visualizing posterior distributions. We’ll use R’s plotting tools to gain insight into model behavior, helping you detect and address potential issues.\nLecture 7: Practical Tips and Conclusions\nIn our final lecture, we’ll discuss practical tips for successful Bayesian analysis, including choosing priors, understanding model limitations, and interpreting results. We’ll review key takeaways and best practices, equipping you with a well-rounded foundation to apply Bayesian methods confidently.\nThis course is designed to be interactive, providing hands-on exercises to reinforce concepts and develop practical skills in Bayesian statistics using R.

      "description": "Are you trying to improve a product, process, or system but unsure how to experiment effectively? This course demystifies Design of Experiments (DOE)—a powerful statistical approach used by professionals across industries to identify key factors, quantify their effects, and optimize performance.\nIn today’s data-driven world, trial-and-error just doesn’t cut it. Whether you're optimizing a chemical process, improving a product design, or tuning a machine learning model, Design of Experiments (DOE) provides a structured, scientific approach to experimentation that saves time, resources, and frustration.\nThis comprehensive course teaches you how to plan, run, analyze, and optimize experiments using practical examples, real datasets, and hands-on tools. You'll begin by building a strong foundation in DOE principles: learning why experiments are so powerful, understanding the language of factors and outcomes, and seeing how experimental data leads to actionable insights.\nFrom there, you'll manually analyze two- and three-factor experiments, learning how to calculate main effects and interaction effects by hand. This builds your intuition and gives you a deep understanding of what's happening behind the software tools.\nOnce you’ve mastered the basics, we take it up a notch with software-based analysis. You’ll learn how to build and solve least-squares models using R, automatically generate coded values, and create powerful visualizations like cube plots, contour plots, and Pareto charts to interpret the results.\nYou’ll also dive into fractional factorial designs, a must-know for anyone working with multiple factors. Learn how to run fewer experiments without losing essential information, and explore critical concepts like aliasing, confounding, blocking, and covariates. Understand when and why to randomize, and how to protect your experiments from noise and disturbance.\nThe final section of the course introduces the game-changing field of Response Surface Methods (RSM). You'll discover why varying one factor at a time (OFAT) is inefficient—and even misleading—and instead learn how to systematically approach the optimum of a system using coded variables and real-world context. Whether you're optimizing one variable or navigating a multi-dimensional design space, RSM gives you a clear path forward.\nWith each concept, you’ll walk through real case studies that show how these tools are applied in engineering, manufacturing, product development, and research.\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to:\nConfidently design and analyze structured experiments\nMake data-driven decisions using statistical models\nOptimize systems while minimizing cost and complexity\nInterpret visual tools like cube plots, contour plots, and Pareto charts\nAvoid common traps in experimentation like OFAT and uncontrolled variables\nWhether you're an engineer, analyst, researcher, or student, this course will help you unlock the full potential of DOE to improve systems and solve real-world problems—smarter and faster.

A primary objective is to apply graphical EDA techniques to representative data sets using the RStudio platform.\n\n\nI have incorporated datasets from the NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods into this course and adopted their fundamental approach of Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n\nWe use scatter plots to examine relationships between two variables, determine if there is a linear or non-linear relationship, analyze variations of the dependent variable, and determine if there are outliers in the dataset.\n\n\nOf course, we need to remember that causality implies association and that association does NOT imply causality.\n\n\nWe will summarise the distribution of a dataset graphically using histograms. This tool can quickly show us the location and spread of the data, and give us a good indication if the data follows a normal distribution, is skewed, has multiple modes or outliers.\n\n\nAn underused, complementary technique to histograms is the probability plot. We will construct probability plots by plotting the data against a theoretical normal distribution. If the data follows a normal distribution, the plot will form a straight line. We will use the normal probability plot to assess whether or not our examples follow a normal distribution.\n\n\nFinally, we will use box plots to view the variation between different groups within the data.\n\n\nAside from scatterplots, most spreadsheet programs do not support these methods, so learning how to do this fundamental analysis in R can improve your ability to explore your data.",

The specific class of impractical or exponential measures of complexity against the polynomial ones is also discussed – for this case we divide these classes according to the discrete numbers which are known to the present time. We also present the approximate algorithm for the classical NP-complete problem like Traveling Salesman using the memory construction. The question of P and NP equality is important in decision-making algorithms which commonly decide inequality of these classes – we define the memory factor which is exponential and space consumption is non-deterministic. The memory consumption problem within the memorization principle or dynamic programming can be of varying nature giving us the decision to build the approximation methods like it’s shown on the example of Traveling Salesman problem. We also give the notion of the past work in theory of complexity which, in our opinion, is of the same consideration in most cases when the functional part is omitted or even isn’t taken into account. The model theorem with its proof of the equality of classes over congruent function is also given in the end of this article.\nIn this continued series of work, we present the theoretical and practical results towards reasoning with modern methods of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We justify our methodology with help of illustrative examples from Computer Science relying on the regular expression matching algorithm and application of the proposed solution for the task of identifying files consistency according to the unknown format. We will also give several notable proofs to the classical theorems which in some sense are coherent to the terms like AI and algorithmic complexity, however, or at least, nowadays they’re solved involving the huge amount of hardware resources and together constitute the new formation in the modern age with help of specifically crafter hardware modules – we’re still about to represent the model in more classical understanding from the point of view of computational complexity, concise reasoning and computer logic within the classical models, theorems and proofs as the base approach of estimating the costs needed to build Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) or Machine Learning (ML) data.",

Was there something deeply flawed with it, and are there still potential problems?\nIt is less well-known that PyTorch is backed by another Internet giant, Facebook (specifically, the Facebook AI Research Lab - FAIR). So if you want a popular deep learning library backed by billion dollar companies and lots of community support, you can't go wrong with PyTorch. And maybe it's a bonus that the library won't completely ruin all your old code when it advances to the next version. ;)\nOn the flip side, it is very well-known that all the top AI shops (ex. OpenAI, Apple, and JPMorgan Chase) use PyTorch. OpenAI just recently switched to PyTorch in 2022, a strong sign that PyTorch is picking up steam.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn everything you need to know to get started with Pytorch, including:\nNumPy\nPandas\nTensors with PyTorch\nNeural Network Theory\nPerceptrons\nNetworks\nActivation Functions\nCost/Loss Functions\nBackpropagation\nGradients\nArtificial Neural Networks\nConvolutional Neural Networks\nRecurrent Neural Networks\nand much more!\nBy the end of this course you will be able to create a wide variety of deep learning models to solve your own problems with your own data sets.\nSo what are you waiting for?

This course offers a mix of 600+ carefully crafted questions across six high-quality mock tests that mimic real-world interviews. Every topic is supported by scenario-based questions, algorithm walkthroughs, mathematical explanations, and tool-based problem solving to help you think and respond like a top-tier machine learning engineer.\n\n\nWe start with the Foundations of Machine Learning, covering all three core paradigms—supervised learning (classification and regression), unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning. You'll get hands-on with algorithms like linear/logistic regression, decision trees, SVMs, K-means, PCA, and Q-learning—all commonly tested in interviews.\n\n\nMathematics for Machine Learning is essential to crack algorithm design, optimization, and model selection questions. You’ll revise key concepts in linear algebra (matrices, eigenvectors), probability and statistics (Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing), and calculus and optimization (gradient descent, Adam, RMSprop). These foundations support every ML model you’ll work with.\n\n\nWe then focus on Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering, which often appears in case studies and practical coding rounds. Topics include handling missing values, outlier detection, feature scaling, encoding techniques, and dimensionality reduction using PCA and recursive feature elimination—critical for real-world model performance.\n\n\nIn Machine Learning Algorithms, you’ll deep dive into linear models, tree-based models, and ensemble methods such as random forests, XGBoost, and stacking. The module also introduces neural networks and multilayer perceptrons—commonly used for classification and regression tasks in modern pipelines.\n\n\nDeep Learning continues from there, diving into activation functions, backpropagation, and popular architectures. You’ll cover CNNs for image data, RNNs and LSTMs for sequences, and transformers for NLP—including the mechanisms that power models like BERT and GPT.\n\n\nNext comes Model Evaluation and Tuning, a key topic in interview take-home tasks and whiteboard sessions. This includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC metrics, along with cross-validation, grid/random search, and strategies to avoid overfitting like dropout and early stopping.\n\n\nTo round out your tooling, the course covers Machine Learning Tools and Frameworks, including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras for model building; Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation; and Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly for visualization.\n\n\nDeployment and production-readiness are tested increasingly in ML job interviews. In Deployment and Productionization, you’ll explore building REST APIs using Flask and FastAPI, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, monitoring model drift, and applying MLOps principles like MLflow and CI/CD for ML systems.\n\n\nSpecialized modules include Natural Language Processing (NLP), where you’ll cover text cleaning, embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and models like BERT, GPT, and Computer Vision, which dives into image processing, CNNs like ResNet and VGG, and object detection using YOLO and Faster R-CNN.\n\n\nYou’ll also explore Big Data and Distributed ML, learning how to work with large datasets using Spark and Dask, and scale training with TensorFlow/PyTorch Distributed—a must-have skill in enterprise environments.\n\n\nThe course ends with Ethics and Fairness in AI, which is now a standard part of top interviews and system design questions. This includes understanding and mitigating bias, applying fairness metrics, and ensuring AI compliance and privacy.\n\n\nWhether you're aiming for a role in a startup or at a tech giant, this course is designed to simulate the real challenges of ML interview rounds—ensuring you’re not just prepared, but confident.",

      "description": "80+% Student Passed Exam After Only Studying These Questions. Pass yours, enroll now!\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nAs the lead engineer for PeakScale Innovations' Core Infra Team, you're tasked with ensuring the always-on availability of their critical customer-facing applications. You need to implement a highly resilient autohealing mechanism for the Core Infra Team's distributed fleet of application servers, which are managed under a network load balancer across multiple zones, with the goal of minimizing configuration effort. Specifically, you must ensure that any virtual machine that becomes unresponsive is automatically recreated after failing three consecutive health checks, each with a 10-second timeout. What is the most efficient way to achieve this?\n\n\nA. Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Set the health check to healthy (HTTP)\nB. Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Define a balancing mode and set the maximum RPS to 10.\nC. Create a managed instance group. Set the Autohealing health check to healthy (HTTP)\nD. Create a managed instance group. Verify that the autoscaling setting is on.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nThe key requirement of the question is to \"configure re-creation of VMs if they are unresponsive\". This functionality is known as autohealing.\n1. Autohealing is a feature of Managed Instance Groups (MIGs). It is the only mechanism in Google Cloud that automatically detects failed instances based on a health check and recreates them to maintain the desired number of running instances.\n2. Load Balancer Health Checks vs. Autohealing Health Checks: It is crucial to understand the difference.\n* A load balancer's health check is used to direct traffic. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the load balancer stops sending new traffic to it but does *not* recreate the instance.\n* An autohealing health check, configured on the MIG itself, is used specifically to determine if an instance has failed and needs to be recreated.\n3. Evaluating the Options:\n* A and B are incorrect because they propose using a load balancer's health check. This would only stop traffic from going to the unresponsive VM; it would not recreate it as required.\n* D is incorrect because it confuses autoscaling with autohealing. Autoscaling adds or removes instances based on load (e.g., CPU utilization), while autohealing replaces failed instances to maintain a set size. The question asks for instance replacement, not scaling.\n* C is the correct answer. It correctly identifies that you need a Managed Instance Group and must configure its autohealing policy with a health check. This directly addresses the requirement to recreate unresponsive VMs. The specific parameters (3 attempts, 10 seconds each) would be configured within this autohealing health check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nYour company, NovaTech Solutions, relies on Cloud Storage to safeguard its critical application backup files for disaster recovery, and you need to ensure compliance with Google's best practices. Which storage option should you select?\n\n\nA. Multi-Regional Storage\nB. Regional Storage\nC. Nearline Storage\nD. Coldline Storage\n\n\nCorrect Answer: D\nExplanation:\nThe question asks for the best storage option for application backup files for disaster recovery purposes, following Google's recommended practices. While Multi-Regional Storage offers the highest availability and durability, it's generally recommended for data that is frequently accessed or needs to be served globally. For disaster recovery backups, where the data is accessed infrequently (only in the event of a disaster), Coldline Storage is the most cost-effective and suitable option. Coldline Storage is designed for data that is accessed less than once a year and provides a good balance between low storage costs and relatively quick retrieval times when needed for disaster recovery. Nearline storage is for data accessed less than once a month. While Archive Storage is even more cost-effective for very long-term archival, Coldline Storage is a more appropriate choice for disaster recovery backups due to its faster retrieval times compared to Archive, which can be critical in a disaster scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nAt CloudSphere Solutions, all employees utilize Google accounts for corporate access. The CloudOps Team is responsible for managing a large fleet of Compute Engine instances, and every member of this team requires administrative-level access specifically to these servers, but nothing more. To meet security mandates from the InfrastructureGuard team, the method for deploying credentials must be operationally streamlined, and it must be possible to clearly identify which team member accessed any specific instance. What should you do?\n\n\nA. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key in the metadata of each instance.\nB. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to send you their public key. Use a configuration management tool to deploy those keys on each instance.\nC. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to add the public key to their Google account. Grant the ג €compute.osAdminLogin ג € role to the Google group corresponding to this team.\nD. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key as a project- wide public SSH key in your Cloud Platform project and allow project-wide public SSH keys on each instance.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nThis question tests your knowledge of managing instance access securely and efficiently for a team. Let's break down why option C is the best solution.\n* Requirement 1: Administrative Access: The `roles/compute.osAdminLogin` IAM role is specifically designed to grant users administrative (sudo/administrator) permissions on a Compute Engine instance when OS Login is enabled.\n* Requirement 2: Operational Efficiency: Managing access through a Google Group is highly efficient. When a new person joins the team, you add them to the group. When they leave, you remove them. Access is automatically granted or revoked across all relevant instances without needing to manually update each machine. This is far more scalable than manually distributing keys (Option B).\n* Requirement 3: Auditing: The core problem with sharing a single key (Options A and D) is the lack of individual accountability. If a shared key is used, you cannot determine *which person* performed an action. By having each user associate their own public SSH key with their Google Account, the OS Login feature ties every login event back to a specific Google identity, making auditing clear and effective.\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n* A and D: Sharing a private key is a major security anti-pattern. Private keys must remain private to the individual. Sharing a key eliminates individual accountability, making it impossible to meet the security team's auditing requirement.\n* B: While using individual keys is correct, managing them with a configuration management tool is operationally inefficient. You would need to constantly update the configuration and run it on all instances whenever the team composition changes. The OS Login feature (used in Option C) automates this process by leveraging IAM.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Choose Our Certification Exam Prep Courses?\nWhen it comes to passing your certification exam—whether it’s AWS, Microsoft, or Oracle—quality training makes all the difference.

If you are a Singaporean, you are eligible for the CITREP+ funding scheme, terms and conditions apply.\n---------------\nThis course is about the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence. This topic is getting very hot nowadays because these learning algorithms can be used in several fields from software engineering to investment banking. Learning algorithms can recognize patterns which can help detect cancer for example. We may construct algorithms that can have a very  very good guess about stocks movement in the market.\nIn the first chapter we are going to talk about the basic graph algorithms. Several advanced algorithms can be solved with the help of graphs, so as far as I am concerned these algorithms are the first steps.\nSecond chapter is about local search: finding minimum and maximum or global optimum in the main. These searches are used frequently when we use regression for example and want to find the parameters for the fit. We will consider basic concepts as well as the more advanced algorithms: heuristics and meta-heuristics.\nThe last topic will be about minimax algorithm and how to use these technique in games such as chess or tic-tac-toe, how to build and construct a game tree, how to analyze these kinds of tree like structures and so on. We will implement the tic-tac-toe game together in the end.\nLAST UPDATE OF THE COURSE: 2016 october",

We begin with perceptrons and multilayer perceptrons, the foundation of neural network models. From there, we move step by step into training fundamentals such as weight initialization methods (Xavier and He), loss functions, and optimization strategies. Regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization are also covered to help you understand how to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.\nOnce the fundamentals are in place, we expand into deep feedforward networks, residual connections, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). You will see how CNNs are applied both in theory and in practice with PyTorch, as well as how similar architectures can be implemented in Julia and MATLAB. The course then progresses into recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTMs, GRUs, and temporal models, preparing you to handle sequence data and forecasting problems.\nIn later sections, we cover attention mechanisms and transformers, which are now standard tools in natural language processing and computer vision. We also explore autoencoders, variational autoencoders, probabilistic models such as Bayesian neural networks, and self-organizing approaches like Kohonen networks. The course includes topics on graph neural networks (GNNs) and other specialized architectures like echo state networks and neural ODEs, ensuring you gain exposure to a wide range of techniques.\nThroughout the course, the focus remains on both intuition and application. You will see mathematical formulas explained step by step, and then see how they are implemented in code. By the end of this course, you will not only understand how neural networks are built and trained but also be able to experiment with them confidently in your own projects.",

Each concept is explained in plain language, and mathematical expressions are read out naturally, for example, ‘three x plus two y is less than or equal to one hundred.’\nAfter understanding the basics, you will move into Python implementation. We use libraries that make it easy to define and solve optimization problems. You will learn how to translate a real situation into a mathematical model, write it in Python, and interpret the solution. Along the way, we will address common mistakes and clarify points that usually confuse beginners.\nBy the end of this course, you will have the ability to set up your own optimization models, test them with data, and use Python to find the best solutions.

Python for beginners has the second largest number of job postings relative to all other languages. So it will earn you a lot of money and will bring a great change in your resume.\n\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\n\n\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in data science , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\n\n\n\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too.

Text analysis has become essential across fields such as social science, marketing, and academia, where unstructured data—like reviews, social media posts, and survey responses—holds valuable information. This course aims to demystify text analysis techniques and equip participants with practical R skills to get started.\nWe begin by exploring the basics of text pre-processing, a crucial step that prepares raw text data for analysis. Participants will learn how to transform text by tokenizing it into individual words, removing common “stop words,” converting text to lowercase, and handling other formatting steps to ensure consistency in the data.\nFrom there, the course moves to word frequency analysis, where participants will calculate and visualize the most frequently used words in a dataset. Using R’s ggplot2 package, we’ll create simple yet insightful visualizations, such as bar charts and word clouds, to reveal the key terms and concepts in a body of text.\nAdditionally, the course covers bigram analysis to identify frequently co-occurring word pairs (e.g., “data science”). This technique provides a deeper view of common themes and associations within the text, allowing students to see how words relate and form patterns.\nFinally, we’ll conduct a basic sentiment analysis, using sentiment lexicons to classify words and text snippets as positive, negative, or neutral. By quantifying sentiment, participants gain a high-level view of the emotions or attitudes within text data.\nBy the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of core text analysis techniques and be ready to apply these skills to real-world textual data.

      "description": "iOS Machine Learning Deployment with Core ML and Vapor is a comprehensive, hands-on course designed to bridge the gap between Python-based machine learning and Swift-based deployment. This course is ideal for developers who want to move beyond just training models and learn how to integrate them into real-world iOS applications — all while using modern tools and best practices.\nWe begin by diving into Python, where you'll work with real-world data sourced from Kaggle. You’ll learn how to clean and preprocess this data, fix incorrectly formatted columns, handle missing values, and apply essential data transformation techniques such as standardization and label encoding. These foundational skills ensure your model is robust, reliable, and production-ready.\nOnce your data is properly prepared, you'll train a machine learning model using scikit-learn, one of Python’s most widely used ML libraries. You'll then convert the model into Apple’s Core ML format using Core ML Tools, preparing it for smooth integration into iOS apps.\nBut we don’t stop there. The second half of the course focuses on real-world deployment. You’ll embed your Core ML model into a SwiftUI-based iOS application, learning how to design an intuitive user interface and make real-time predictions using your trained model. You’ll also learn how to send and receive data from the model in a user-friendly way.\nTo complete the full-stack experience, we introduce Vapor, Apple’s open-source server-side Swift framework. You'll learn how to host your Core ML model on a Vapor server and build a RESTful API that iOS apps can communicate with. This demonstrates how to turn your machine learning models into live, accessible services — an essential skill in today's data-driven app development landscape.\nHow This Course Will Benefit You\nEnd-to-End Knowledge: Gain the complete pipeline experience — from data preprocessing and model training to mobile integration and backend deployment.\nCross-Disciplinary Skills: Learn how to combine Python-based data science with Swift-based mobile and server development — a powerful, rare skill set in the job market.\nPortfolio-Ready Project: Walk away with a fully functional iOS app backed by a deployed machine learning model — perfect to showcase in job interviews or on your GitHub.\nProduction-Grade Deployment: Understand how to build scalable, real-time ML applications that can serve predictions via API endpoints.\nBoost Your Career: Whether you're a Python developer exploring mobile development, or an iOS developer stepping into ML, this course will add significant value to your toolkit and resume.\nFuture-Proof Skills: With AI becoming central to modern apps, knowing how to build and deploy ML-powered features is becoming a must-have skill.\nWhether you’re a data scientist looking to bring your models to iOS or a Swift developer aiming to expand into machine learning, this course will give you the tools and confidence to build and deploy smarter, production-ready applications.",

      "description": "Fake news is now viewed as one of the greatest threats to democracy, journalism, and freedom of expression. The reach of fake news was best highlighted during the critical months of the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. During that period, the top twenty frequently-discussed fake election stories generated 8.7M shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook, ironically, more than the 7.4M for the top twenty most-discussed election stories posted by 19 major news websites. Research has shown that compared to the truth, fake news on Twitter is typically retweeted by many more users and spreads far more rapidly, especially for political news. Our economies are not immune to the spread of fake news either, with fake news being connected to stock market fluctuations and large trades. For example, fake news claiming that Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, was injured in an explosion wiped out $130 billion in stock value in 2017. These events and losses have motivated fake news research and sparked the discussion around fake news, as observed by skyrocketing usage of terms such as “post-truth” – selected as the international word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries in 2016.\n\n\nThe many perspectives on what fake news is, what characteristics and nature fake news or those who disseminate it share, and how fake news can be detected motivate the need for a comprehensive introduction and in-depth analysis, which this course aims to develop. This course is divided into three sections.\n\n\nIn the first section, I will introduce fake new detection, and discuss topics like \"what is fake news and related areas\", \"how to manually identify fake news\", \"why detect fake news\" and \"efforts by various organisations towards fighting fake news\". In the second section we will focus on various types of fake news detection methods. Specifically I will talk about four different fake news detection methods which are knowledge based fake news detection, style based fake news detection, propagation based fake news detection and credibility based fake news detection. Lastly in the third section I'll talk about other perspectives and topics related to fake news detection including fake news detection datasets, explainable fake news detection, concerns around fake news detection and research opportunities.\n\n\nHope you will enjoy this course and find the ideas useful for your work.",

For three months I hid from my wife and responsibilities, slaving away making this course so that you could learn Python Pandas. In this course, I cover topics like\nImporting and installing pandas\nSeries\nDataFrames\nIndexes (including MultiIndexes)\nReading and writing to CSV\nMerge, Reshape, Aggregation operations\nDates & times\nMissing values\nStrings\nCategoricals\nincluding tons of examples, animations, and practice problems with detailed solutions. But rather than me drone on about the course, check out some of my free lectures in the course curriculum to see it for yourself!\nNeed help?\nIf you buy this course, you'll have a commitment from me to help you understand any Pandas topics you might struggle with. I'm usually pretty quick to reply to questions.\nNotes\nThis course was developed using Python 3.9.1 and Pandas version 1.2.0. If you're on a later version, don't worry - most of what I teach  is unlikely to break.\nThroughout this course, I use Google Colab as my IDE. You don't need to use Google Colab, but if you want to, it's a fantastic way to execute Python directly from your browser.\nAlso, you could take this course without knowing NumPy, but pre-existing knowledge of NumPy is preferred. After all, Pandas is built on top of it. And if you don't know NumPy, check out my course Python NumPy For Your Grandma.",

The idea was to create a simpler way to run TensorFlow jobs on Kubernetes. So, Kubeflow was created as a way to run TensorFlow, based on a pipeline called TensorFlow Extended and then ultimately extended to support multiple architectures and multiple clouds so it could be used as a framework to run entire machine learning pipelines. The Kubeflow open source project (licensed Apache 2.0) was formally announced at the end of 2017.\nIn a nutshell, Kubeflow is the machine learning toolkit that runs on top of Kubernetes. Kubeflow’s combined components allow both data scientists and DevOps to manage data, train models, tune and serve them, as well as monitor them.\nFor whom is the “Introduction to Kubeflow” training and certification series of courses for?\nData scientists, machine learning developers, DevOps engineers and infrastructure operators who have little or no experience with Kubeflow and want to build their knowledge step-by-step, plus test their knowledge and earn certificates along the way.\nWhat are the prerequisites for this course?\nA basic understanding of cloud computing, Kubernetes and machine learning concepts is very helpful.",

Statistics and Probability:\nQuestion: What is the significance of a p-value in hypothesis testing?\nA) The probability of the hypothesis being true.\nB) The likelihood of observing the test statistic under the null hypothesis.\nC) The probability of making a Type I error.\nD) The ratio of the variance between two data sets.\nCorrect Answer: B) The likelihood of observing the test statistic under the null hypothesis.\nExplanation: In hypothesis testing, the p-value measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A lower p-value indicates that the observed data is unlikely under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. It's not the probability of the hypothesis being true or the probability of making an error. Rather, it's about how extreme the observed data is, assuming the null hypothesis is correct.\n2. Machine Learning:\nQuestion: Which of the following is an example of unsupervised learning?\nA) Linear Regression\nB) Decision Trees\nC) K-Means Clustering\nD) Logistic Regression\nCorrect Answer: C) K-Means Clustering\nExplanation: Unsupervised learning involves models that identify patterns in data without reference to known, labeled outcomes. K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering unlabeled data, whereas Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression are examples of supervised learning where the model is trained with labeled data.\n3. Data Processing and Analysis:\nQuestion: Which technique is used for reducing the number of input variables in a dataset?\nA) One-hot encoding\nB) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nC) Overfitting\nD) Cross-validation\nCorrect Answer: B) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nExplanation: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset by transforming them into a new set of variables, the principal components, which are uncorrelated and which retain most of the variation present in the original dataset. The other options, like one-hot encoding, are used for different purposes.\n4. Programming and Algorithms:\nQuestion: In Python, what is the output of the following code: print(\"Data Science\"[::-1])?\nA) \"Data Science\"\nB) \"ecneicS ataD\"\nC) An error message\nD) \"ecnecS ataD\"\nCorrect Answer: B) \"ecneicS ataD\"\nExplanation: In Python, the slicing operation [::-1] is used to reverse the order of characters in a string. Therefore, the given code snippet will print \"Data Science\" in reverse, resulting in \"ecneicS ataD\".\n5. AI and Advanced Topics:\nQuestion: In Natural Language Processing (NLP), what is the purpose of tokenization?\nA) To convert text into binary format.\nB) To reduce the size of the text data.\nC) To split text into sentences or words.\nD) To transform unstructured text into a structured form.\nCorrect Answer: C) To split text into sentences or words.\nExplanation: Tokenization in NLP is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or sentences. This is an essential step in text preprocessing as it helps in understanding the context or frequency of certain words or phrases within the text. Tokenization is not about converting text into binary format or reducing its size, but rather about structuring it for further analysis.\n\n\nThese sample questions provide a glimpse into the depth and quality of our practice tests. Each question is designed to challenge your understanding and is accompanied by a detailed explanation to reinforce learning and comprehension.\nEnroll now in \"Mastering Data Science: Ultimate Practice Tests for Interview Success\" and take the first step towards acing your data science interviews and tests.

      "description": "Ready to level up your Power BI data modeling skills and write DAX like a pro? This course is your step-by-step guide to mastering intermediate DAX techniques — the kind that transform reports from functional to exceptional and enhance your data modeling workflow.\nIn this hands-on, business-focused course, you’ll move beyond basic measures and calculated columns to discover how DAX can drive intelligent, responsive, and personalised Power BI experiences. Across six structured chapters, you’ll explore the full breadth of intermediate DAX capabilities — from dynamic titles and user-aware filters to row-level security, advanced logic, iterators, rankings, formatting, and time intelligence.\nWe begin with dynamic report elements, showing you how to use functions like SELECTEDVALUE, USERPRINCIPALNAME, and FORMAT to generate titles, search URLs, and personal commentary that adapt to the user and context. You’ll then master logical patterns with nested IF statements, compound conditions, and the powerful SWITCH(TRUE()) structure — making your measures flexible and context-aware.\nNext, we take a deep dive into iterator functions like MAXX, MINX, and CONCATENATEX, before demystifying EARLIER and its modern replacement using VAR. These lessons will deepen your understanding of row context and strengthen your grasp of effective data modeling techniques in Power BI.\nIn the ranking section, you’ll build sophisticated comparisons using RANKX, TOPN, and optional arguments that control ties and sort order — all vital tools for leaderboard-style reports. You’ll also learn how to apply conditional formatting and visual storytelling using UNICHAR, RAG status logic, and dynamic KPIs.\nFinally, we dedicate a full chapter to DAX time intelligence: running totals, prior period comparisons, and calendar-aware measures using DATEADD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, DATESYTD, and more. You’ll understand how to build and customise your own calendar tables and apply time-based filters to uncover trends and seasonality.\nBy the end of the course, you won’t just be writing better DAX — you’ll be building smarter data models, designing user-responsive reports, and confidently applying best practices that scale. This is the course that turns competent Power BI users into powerful DAX creators.",

It covered several instances of 'what is happening', 'what it means' and 'how you fix it'. I was impressed.\"  Steve\nWelcome to The Top 5 Machine Learning Libraries in Python.  This is an introductory course on the process of building supervised machine learning models and then using libraries in a computer programming language called Python.\nWhat’s the top career in the world? Doctor? Lawyer? Teacher? Nope. None of those.\nThe top career in the world is the data scientist. Great. What’s a data scientist?\nThe area of study which involves extracting knowledge from data is called Data Science and people practicing in this field are called as Data Scientists.\nBusiness generate a huge amount of data.  The data has tremendous value but there so much of it where do you begin to look for value that is actionable? That’s where the data scientist comes in.  The job of the data scientist is to create predictive models that can find hidden patterns in data that will give the business a competitive advantage in their space.\nDon’t I need a PhD?  Nope. Some data scientists do have PhDs but it’s not a requirement.  A similar career to that of the data scientist is the machine learning engineer.\nA machine learning engineer is a person who builds predictive models, scores them and then puts them into production so that others in the company can consume or use their model.  They are usually skilled programmers that have a solid background in data mining or other data related professions and they have learned predictive modeling.\nIn the course we are going to take a look at what machine learning engineers do. We are going to learn about the process of building supervised predictive models and build several using the most widely used programming language for machine learning. Python. There are literally hundreds of libraries we can import into Python that are machine learning related.\nA library is simply a group of code that lives outside the core language. We “import it” into our work space when we need to use its functionality. We can mix and match these libraries like Lego blocks.\nThanks for your interest in the The Top 5 Machine Learning Libraries in Python and we will see you in the course.",

Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human like tasks. Most Artificial Intelligence examples that you hear about today like chess playing computers, roboadvisors and self-driving cars rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data. Artificial Intelligence technology is important as it enables human understanding, reasoning, planning, communication and perception  to be undertaken by software increasingly effectively. The automation of these abilities creates new opportunities in most business sectors and consumer applications. But who will automate these abilities? It's for sure human beings.\nArtificial Intelligence assisted education is also becoming more common today which helps teachers and educational institutions to assess children and personalise teaching methodologies to each child. They can also help increase the efficiency of administration tasks to allow teachers to sway more towards understanding and adaptability. By using the best characteristics of machines and teachers, we can hope for the best outcome in AI and ML in education.",

      "description": "This course focuses on applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to real problems in manufacturing. Reinforcement learning is different from traditional optimization or machine learning approaches because it is designed to learn by interacting with environments that change over time. That makes it a natural fit for factories, warehouses, and production systems, where conditions are dynamic and decisions need to be adapted continuously.\nWe start by reviewing the basic ideas of reinforcement learning: states, actions, rewards, and policies. From there, we move into projects that reflect challenges faced in manufacturing industries. For example, balancing production lines, optimizing chemical batch processes, tuning CNC machining parameters, and similar cases that show how RL can be connected to industrial practice. Each section contains both explanation and step-by-step Python implementations so you can follow along, experiment, and adapt the methods to your own problems.\nThe main goal is to show you how reinforcement learning is not only an academic subject, but also a practical tool for industrial engineering and operations research. By the end of the course, you will be able to model manufacturing problems as reinforcement learning environments, train agents to make decisions, and evaluate their performance.\nThis course is intended for learners with some background in Python programming who want to see how RL can be applied beyond games and into real-world systems. Whether you are an engineer, researcher, or practitioner in operations and production, you will find a direct connection between reinforcement learning and the challenges of manufacturing.",

These systems empower people to find practical applications of the data, which businesses can use to thrive.\nCompanies of all sizes have huge amounts of disparate data to comb through to answer critical business questions. Data engineering is designed to support the process, making it possible for consumers of data, such as analysts, data scientists and executives, to reliably, quickly and securely inspect all of the data available.\nAbout a decade back, the data analysis was merely on the structured data available on the a Relational data base or in ERP system and any decision was made based on analysis of the  historic data and tools like ETL (extract, Tranform & load) was used for datawarehousing system. However in this dynamic ever changing world, non relational data base information need to used for quick analysis.\nSo apart from transactions in database, the other source of web information from CSV, webhooks, http & MQTT need to taken care as appropriate.\nFurther more, the process of ETL as evolved into Data pipelines. A data pipeline is a method in which raw data is ingested from various data sources and then ported to data store,  like a data lake or data warehouse, for analysis. In data pipe line task dependency can be build with different task. These task can be also based on some events happening like Order booked or Issues raise which can trigger a task. For this concepts of Webhooks are used.\nPrefect is one such newly evolved data pipeline or workflow tool, in which one can build not only static task dependency, but these task dependency can be built based on some event happeningas well.\nThis course uses the cloud version Prefect worflow tool which can be invoked from a cloud based virtual machine. Knowledge of Python & shell scripting is essential.\nThis course covers following topic:\n•Difference between Data Engineering Vs Data Analysis Vs Data Science\n•An Overview about Data Science, Machine Learning & Data Science.\n•Extract, Transform, Load vs Data pipeline.\n•Provisioning Oracle Linux Virtual machine On Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n•Prefect Cloud Data pipeline and Client VM Set up.\n•Documentation reference - Prefect Workflow / Data pipelines.\n•Hands-on Demonstration of Perfect Flow with Tasks dependency.\n•Building Prefect dataflow pipeline for Oracle Database extract using Python.\n•Introduction to Webhooks and Hands-on Demonstration with Prefect & Github.\n•Career Path for Data Engineers\n\n\nHappy Learning!",

      "description": "Welcome to the Data Science in a Business Context course!\nBecoming an accomplished and successful Data Scientist today not only requires one to sharpen their technical skills, but also—and more importantly—to be able to respond to a business' needs in an effective, value-generating way. Being able to extract value from a Machine Learning model is generally what differentiates Data Science from other sciences. Yet Data Scientists focus too little on this point, often adopting an academic, machine learning-oriented approach to solving problems in their daily life. This often results in underperforming Data Science teams, non-captured or belatedly-captured value for the companies they work for, and slow career progression for Data Scientists themselves.\nIn this course I will teach you how to maximise value generation of your Data Science models. I will introduce a few core principles that an effective and productive Data Scientist should keep in mind to perform their job in a value-oriented way, and based on those principle, I will introduce a framework that you can apply in your everyday life when solving Data Science problems in a business context. I will finally show you a case study example to demonstrate how the framework works in practice.\nWhat you will learn\n\nAfter the course you will be able to:\nUnderstand the current stage of the Data Science field and Data Scientist job\nDefine the characteristics of an effective Data Scientist in a business context\nApply a framework to guide the development of a Data Science project in a business- and value-oriented way\nDerive a link between a machine learning metric and a business metric\nIncrease your productivity and value generation as a Data Scientist\nWho is this course for\nJunior and less experienced Data Scientists will quickly learn how to perform their job in a business context, making the impact with the industry world much smoother, and dramatically increasing their probability of success and their productivity\nAspiring Data Scientist will understand what is needed from a Data Scientist in a business context, which will prepare them much better to the next interviews\nMid-Senior and Senior Data Scientists will learn to adopt a new perspective during the development phase, which can radically improve their productivity level\nData Science Mangers can find inspiration and material to have their teams work in a uniform way\n\n\nRequirements\nSection 1, 2, 3: no requirements! Just your desire of becoming a better, more performing Data Scientist\nSection 4, 5: basic familiarity with Python, Jupyter notebooks and simple Machine Learning concepts (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, train/test split, cross validation)",

      "description": "1400+ AI Research Scientist Interview Questions Practice Test\nAI Research Scientist Interview Questions and Answers Practice Test | Freshers to Experienced | Detailed Explanations\nStop guessing what interviewers will ask. Prepare with confidence for your next AI Research Scientist role with the most comprehensive practice test on Udemy, designed exclusively for candidates targeting research-driven positions at top tech firms, academia, and AI labs. This course delivers 1,400+ meticulously crafted multiple-choice questions spanning foundational theory, cutting-edge research, and ethical dilemmas – all backed by detailed explanations to transform your understanding. Whether you’re a fresh graduate or an experienced engineer, this test simulates real interview scenarios to expose knowledge gaps, sharpen critical thinking, and ensure you stand out in competitive hiring processes.\nWhy This Course?\nTargeted Rigor: Questions mirror actual interviews at Google Research, OpenAI, DeepMind, and FAIR – focusing on why over rote memorization.\nZero Fluff: Every question includes a step-by-step explanation dissecting correct/incorrect answers, citing research papers (e.g., \"Attention Is All You Need\"), and clarifying industry best practices.\nStructured Mastery: Divided into 6 critical sections (250 questions each) covering the full AI research spectrum – from neural network architectures to ethical deployment.\nReal-World Relevance: Practice with scenarios on debugging model bias, optimizing transformer training, and designing reproducible experiments – exactly what hiring managers evaluate.\nWhat You’ll Master: The 6 Core Sections\n\nMachine Learning Fundamentals\nSupervised/Unsupervised Learning, Evaluation Metrics, Reinforcement Learning, Emerging Techniques\nSample Question:\nQ: In a class-imbalanced medical diagnosis task (1% positive cases), why is accuracy a poor metric?\nA) It overemphasizes false negatives\nB) It ignores precision-recall tradeoffs\nC) High accuracy can be achieved by always predicting \"negative\"\nD) It conflates Type I/II errors\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation: Accuracy measures overall correctness. If 99% of cases are negative, a model predicting \"all negative\" achieves 99% accuracy but fails to detect any disease (high false negatives). Precision-recall curves or F1-score are superior for imbalance.\n\nDeep Learning and Neural Networks\nCNNs, RNNs, GANs, Transformers, Neural Architecture Search\nSample Question:\nQ: Why do Transformers outperform RNNs in long-sequence tasks?\nA) RNNs cannot handle sequences >100 tokens\nB) Transformers use parallelizable self-attention, avoiding RNNs’ sequential bottleneck\nC) RNNs lack positional encoding\nD) Transformers require less training data\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: RNNs process tokens sequentially, causing slow training and vanishing gradients for long sequences. Transformers’ self-attention computes relationships between all tokens in parallel, enabling efficient long-range dependency modeling.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nLanguage Models, Tokenization, Transformers, Text Generation, NLP Applications\nSample Question:\nQ: BERT uses bidirectional context, but GPT is unidirectional. What is a key consequence?\nA) BERT excels at text generation; GPT at classification\nB) GPT cannot capture left-context dependencies\nC) BERT is unsuitable for generation tasks due to masked tokens\nD) GPT requires more positional embeddings\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation: BERT’s [MASK] tokens during pretraining create a train-test mismatch for generation (e.g., filling missing words). GPT’s causal (left-to-right) modeling avoids this, making it natively suited for generation.\n\nComputer Vision and Image Processing\nImage Classification, Object Detection, Segmentation, Face Recognition, Video Analysis\nSample Question:\nQ: Why does Mask R-CNN add a branch for pixel-wise segmentation to Faster R-CNN?\nA) To reduce false positives in object detection\nB) To enable instance segmentation without region warping artifacts\nC) To replace ROI pooling with bilinear interpolation\nD) To accelerate inference speed\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: Faster R-CNN’s ROI pooling warps regions to fixed sizes, losing pixel alignment. Mask R-CNN’s parallel mask branch uses ROI Align for precise per-pixel predictions, critical for segmentation accuracy.\n\nAI Ethics and Responsible AI\nBias/Fairness, Explainability, Privacy, Ethical Deployment, Regulatory Compliance\nSample Question:\nQ: A facial recognition system shows 20% higher error rates for darker-skinned females. Which mitigation is most effective?\nA) Collecting more data from underrepresented groups\nB) Using adversarial debiasing during training\nC) Applying post-hoc calibration\nD) All of the above\nCorrect Answer: D\nExplanation: Bias mitigation requires multi-pronged strategies: diverse data (A) addresses representation gaps, adversarial training (B) reduces correlation with sensitive attributes, and calibration (C) adjusts output distributions. No single solution suffices.\n\nResearch Methodology and Experimental Design (250 Questions)\nHypothesis Testing, Experimental Setup, Data Preprocessing, Reproducibility, Publishing\nSample Question:\nQ: In an A/B test comparing two recommendation models, why is a t-test insufficient for significance?\nA) User interactions are non-i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed)\nB) T-tests assume normal distributions, which click data violates\nC) Both A and B\nD) T-tests require larger sample sizes than online tests allow\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation: User behavior exhibits clustering (non-i.i.d.) and click-through rates follow skewed distributions. Methods like bootstrap resampling or mixed-effects models are preferred for valid inference.\n\n\nKey Features\n1,400+ High-Yield MCQs: Weighted by topic prevalence in real interviews (e.g., 30% on Deep Learning/NLP).\nDetailed Explanations: Each answer includes:\nCore Concept (e.g., \"Transformer self-attention\")\nWhy Correct? (with equations/code snippets where relevant)\nWhy Others Fail? (common misconceptions)\nResearch Context (e.g., \"This mirrors Section 3.2.1 in the ViT paper\")\nProgress Tracking: Timed tests, section-wise scores, and weak-area diagnostics.\nAlways Updated: New questions added quarterly reflecting latest research (e.g., LLM safety, multimodal models).\nPrepare Like a Research Pro\nDon’t rely on fragmented YouTube tutorials or outdated textbooks. This course distills years of AI research interview patterns into one rigorous practice suite. Enroll now to transform uncertainty into expertise – and walk into your interview ready to discuss why your solution is optimal, not just what it is.\nEnroll today. Your breakthrough in AI research starts here.",

Special cameras collect remotely sensed images, which help researchers \"sense\" things about the Earth. Some examples are:\nCameras on satellites and airplanes take images of large areas on the Earth's surface, allowing us to see much more than we can see when standing on the ground.\nSonar systems on ships can be used to create images of the ocean floor without needing to travel to the bottom of the ocean.\nCameras on satellites can be used to make images of temperature changes in the oceans.\nSome specific uses of remotely sensed images of the Earth include:\nLarge forest fires can be mapped from space, allowing rangers to see a much larger area than from the ground.\nTracking clouds to help predict the weather watching erupting volcanoes, and help watching for dust storms.\nTracking the growth of a city and changes in farmland or forests over several years or decades.\nDiscovery and mapping of the rugged topography of the ocean floor (e.g., huge mountain ranges, deep canyons, and the “magnetic striping” on the ocean floor). #AulaGEO\n\n\nLEVEL II - REMOTE SENSING USING ArcGIS Pro\nThis is a course on applications of Remote Sensing using ESRI Products.

The images, ingested on a daily basis, are then made available for global-scale data mining.\nEarth Engine also provides APIs and other tools to enable the analysis of large datasets.\nGoogle Earth enables you to travel, explore, and learn about the world by interacting with a virtual globe. You can view satellite imagery, maps, terrain, 3D buildings, and much more.\nEarth Engine, on the other hand, is a tool for analyzing geospatial information. You can analyze forest and water coverage, land use change, or assess the health of agricultural fields, among many other possible analyses.\nWhile the two tools rely on some of the same data, only some of Google Earth's imagery and data are available for analysis in Earth Engine.",

To normalize the output of neurons\nB. To introduce non-linearity into the model\nC. To reduce the computational complexity\nD. To prevent the vanishing gradient problem\nCorrect Answer: B. To introduce non-linearity into the model\nExplanation:\nThe Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is widely used in deep learning models due to its simplicity and effectiveness in introducing non-linearity. While linear activation functions can only solve linear problems, non-linear functions like ReLU allow neural networks to learn complex patterns in the data. ReLU achieves this by outputting the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. This simple mechanism helps to model non-linear relationships without significantly increasing computational complexity. Although ReLU can help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem to some extent because it does not saturate in the positive domain, its primary purpose is not to prevent vanishing gradients but to introduce non-linearity. Moreover, ReLU does not normalize the output of neurons nor specifically aims to reduce computational complexity, although its simplicity does contribute to computational efficiency.\n\n\nQuestion 2: In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), what is the role of pooling layers?\nOptions:\nA. To increase the network's sensitivity to the exact location of features\nB. To reduce the spatial dimensions of the input volume\nC. To replace the need for convolutional layers\nD. To introduce non-linearity into the network\nCorrect Answer: B. To reduce the spatial dimensions of the input volume\nExplanation:\nPooling layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) serve to reduce the spatial dimensions (i.e., width and height) of the input volume for the subsequent layers. This dimensionality reduction is crucial for several reasons: it decreases the computational load and the number of parameters in the network, thus helping to mitigate overfitting by providing an abstracted form of the representation. Pooling layers achieve this by aggregating the inputs in their receptive field (e.g., taking the maximum or average), effectively downsampling the feature maps. This process does not aim to increase sensitivity to the exact location of features. On the contrary, it makes the network more invariant to small translations of the input. Pooling layers do not introduce non-linearity (that's the role of activation functions like ReLU) nor replace convolutional layers; instead, they complement convolutional layers by summarizing the features extracted by them.\n\n\nQuestion 3: What is the primary advantage of using dropout in a deep learning model?\nOptions:\nA. To speed up the training process\nB. To prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training\nC. To increase the accuracy on the training dataset\nD. To ensure that the model uses all of its neurons\nCorrect Answer: B. To prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training\nExplanation:\nDropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. During the training phase, dropout randomly \"drops\" or deactivates a subset of neurons (units) in a layer according to a predefined probability. This process forces the network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons. By doing so, dropout reduces the model's reliance on any single neuron, promoting a more distributed and generalized representation of the data. This technique does not speed up the training process; in fact, it might slightly extend it due to the need for more epochs for convergence due to the reduced effective capacity of the network at each iteration. Dropout aims to improve generalization to unseen data, rather than increasing accuracy on the training dataset or ensuring all neurons are used. In fact, by design, it ensures not all neurons are used together at any given training step.\n\n\nQuestion 4: Why are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks particularly well-suited for processing time series data?\nOptions:\nA. They can only process data in a linear sequence\nB. They can handle long-term dependencies thanks to their gating mechanisms\nC. They completely eliminate the vanishing gradient problem\nD. They require less computational power than traditional RNNs\nCorrect Answer: B. They can handle long-term dependencies thanks to their gating mechanisms\nExplanation:\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are particularly well-suited for processing time series data due to their ability to learn long-term dependencies. This capability is primarily attributed to their unique architecture, which includes several gates (input, forget, and output gates). These gates regulate the flow of information, allowing the network to remember or forget information over long periods. This mechanism addresses the limitations of traditional RNNs, which struggle to capture long-term dependencies in sequences due to the vanishing gradient problem. While LSTMs do not completely eliminate the vanishing gradient problem, they significantly mitigate its effects, making them more effective for tasks involving long sequences. Contrary to requiring less computational power, LSTMs often require more computational resources than simple RNNs due to their complex architecture. However, this complexity is what enables them to perform exceptionally well on tasks with temporal dependencies.\n\n\nQuestion 5: In the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), what is the role of the discriminator?\nOptions:\nA. To generate new data samples\nB. To classify samples as real or generated\nC. To train the generator without supervision\nD. To increase the diversity of generated samples\nCorrect Answer: B. To classify samples as real or generated\nExplanation:\nIn Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the discriminator plays a critical role in the training process by classifying samples as either real (from the dataset) or generated (by the generator). The GAN framework consists of two competing neural network models: the generator, which learns to generate new data samples, and the discriminator, which learns to distinguish between real and generated samples. This adversarial process drives the generator to produce increasingly realistic samples to \"fool\" the discriminator, while the discriminator becomes better at identifying the subtle differences between real and fake samples. The discriminator does not generate new data samples; that is the role of the generator. Nor does it train the generator directly; rather, it provides a signal (via its classification loss) that is used to update the generator's weights indirectly through backpropagation. The aim is not specifically to increase the diversity of generated samples, although a well-trained generator may indeed produce a diverse set of realistic samples. The primary role of the discriminator is to guide the generator towards producing realistic outputs that are indistinguishable from actual data.\n\n\nEnroll Now\nJoin us on this journey to mastering deep learning.

This approach addresses the root cause of bias rather than symptoms, making it the most effective solution for demographic fairness in production systems.\n\nSECTION 2: MATHEMATICS & STATISTICS FOR AI\nCritical quantitative foundation for advanced AI roles\nLinear Algebra (eigenvalue applications in dimensionality reduction)\nCalculus (gradient mechanics in optimization)\nProbability Theory (Bayesian inference, uncertainty quantification)\nStatistical Methods (hypothesis testing, regression analysis)\nSample Question:\nQ: Why does the Hessian matrix matter in second-order optimization methods?\nA) It calculates gradient direction\nB) It determines step size in SGD\nC) It provides curvature information for faster convergence\nD) It normalizes input features\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation: The Hessian matrix (C) contains second-order partial derivatives that describe the local curvature of the loss function. This curvature information allows optimization algorithms like Newton's method to take larger, more informed steps toward minima compared to first-order methods, significantly accelerating convergence in well-behaved convex problems.\n\nSECTION 3: PROGRAMMING & TOOLS\nPractical skills for implementation and deployment\nPython for AI (NumPy, Pandas, debugging techniques)\nMachine Learning Libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch implementation details)\nDeployment & MLOps (Docker, Kubernetes, model serving pipelines)\n\nSample Question:\nQ: Why might this PyTorch DataLoader configuration cause memory overflow?\nloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=64, num_workers=16)\nA) Batch size too large\nB) Excessive num_workers overwhelming system resources\nC) Incorrect dataset normalization\nD) Missing .pin_memory() call\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: Setting num_workers=16 creates 16 separate processes, each duplicating memory resources. The optimal value typically matches available CPU cores (usually 4-8). This represents a common production issue where improper resource allocation leads to system failures during model training.\n\nSECTION 4: MACHINE LEARNING CORE\nFoundational ML concepts tested in technical interviews\nSupervised & Unsupervised Learning (algorithm selection criteria)\nDeep Learning Architectures (CNNs, RNNs, transformer mechanics)\nModel Evaluation (metric selection, interpretation pitfalls)\nInterpretability Techniques (SHAP, LIME applications)\n\nSample Question:\nQ: When would precision be prioritized over recall in a medical diagnosis model?\nA) Screening for rare diseases\nB) Confirming critical conditions with costly treatments\nC) Early-stage cancer detection\nD) Population health monitoring\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: Precision (B) should be prioritized when false positives carry high costs – such as confirming critical conditions requiring invasive treatments. High precision minimizes false alarms, ensuring only truly positive cases receive risky interventions. Recall would be prioritized in screening scenarios (A/C/D) where missing cases is unacceptable.\n\nSECTION 5: SPECIALIZED AI DOMAINS\nDomain-specific expertise for targeted roles\nNatural Language Processing (tokenization, transformer fine-tuning)\nComputer Vision (object detection, segmentation techniques)\nGenerative AI (GANs, diffusion models, VAE implementations)\nMultimodal Systems (vision-language model integration)\n\nSample Question:\nQ: In diffusion models, why is the \"variance schedule\" critical for image quality?\nA) Controls learning rate decay\nB) Determines noise addition/removal progression during sampling\nC) Optimizes GPU memory usage\nD) Reduces tokenization errors\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: The variance schedule (B) defines the precise amount of noise added or removed at each timestep. An improperly configured schedule causes artifacts like checkerboard patterns or blurry outputs. Understanding this mechanism demonstrates deep knowledge of generative model behavior – a key differentiator in advanced AI engineering interviews.\n\nSECTION 6: ADVANCED TOPICS & APPLICATIONS\nDifferentiators for senior engineering positions\nAI Safety & Robustness (adversarial defense mechanisms)\nProduction Challenges (model monitoring, drift detection)\nEmerging Technologies (quantum machine learning concepts)\nReal-World Case Studies (cross-industry implementation patterns)\n\nSample Question:\nQ: Which technique BEST mitigates model drift in production NLP systems?\nA) Increasing model size\nB) Periodic full retraining on historical data\nC) Continuous monitoring with concept drift detection\nD) Using higher-precision floating-point numbers\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation: Continuous monitoring with concept drift detection (C) enables proactive intervention by identifying statistical deviations in input data distributions. While retraining (B) is necessary, it's reactive and resource-intensive.

      "description": "This course provides an introduction to using Python to learn linear algebra. It is designed for people who have no (or little) previous exposure to Python or to linear algebra.\nWhat is linear algebra?\nLinear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with vectors and matrices. A vector is a list of numbers, and a matrix is a spreadsheet of numbers.\nThat sounds really simple, but linear algebra is at the heart of nearly all applied mathematics, including statistics, machine learning, AI, deep learning, image processing, telecommunications, video games, computer graphics, biomedical signal processing, and the list goes on and on...\n\n\nWhy use Python to learn linear algebra?\nMany people find math difficult but coding easier. You will be amazed at how much better you can learn math by using Python as a tool.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\nYou will learn the basics of getting started with using Python and with using Python to learn mathematics. You'll see an overview of the major topics in linear algebra, although I do not go into a lot of depth on any particular topic.\nBy the end of this course, you will know enough to decide whether you want to learn more about Python and math.\n\n\nWhat do you need to know before enrolling?\nWell, you need to know how to use a computer. But you don't need to know anything about computer programming or linear algebra. The only thing you really *need* for this course is the willingness to dedicate 2-3 hours of your time to learning something new.\n\n\nWhat do you have to lose?\nThe entire course takes 2-3 hours to complete (2 hours of video content, and about an hour to complete the practice problems). This is a great way to see whether you want to continue studying Python for math and linear algebra. And if you decide that this isn't right for you, then you only spent a few hours on it, rather than investing in tens of hours and money. Really, you have nothing to lose!\n\n\nWho is your instructor?\nI have been teaching data analysis, scientific programming, statistics, and signal processing for almost 20 years. I have several best-seller courses here on Udemy and my courses have well over 10,000 high-ranked reviews (don't believe me -- check out the reviews on this and my other courses!). I take online teaching seriously (although I let a few jokes slip through now and then...), and I remain actively involved in making sure my courses are high quality and up-to-date.",

      "description": "Welcome to Building Machine Learning & NLP Models for Cyber Security course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn how to build intrusion detection system, predict vulnerability score, and classify cyber threat using machine learning models like Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, MLP Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, KNN, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, and K Means Clustering. This course is a perfect combination between machine learning and cyber security, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in system security. In the introduction session, you will learn about machine learning and natural language processing applications in cyber security, specifically how it can help to enhance risk management and strengthen overall security. Then, in the next section, we will learn how intrusion detection models work. This section will cover data collections, data preprocessing, feature selection, splitting data into training and testing sets, model selection, model training, detecting intrusion, model evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Afterward, we will download cyber security datasets from Kaggle, it is a platform that offers many high quality datasets from various sectors. Once everything is all set, then, we will start the project, firstly, we will clean the dataset by removing all missing values and duplicates, after we make sure the data is clean and ready to use, we will start exploratory data analysis, firstly we are going to analyze the relationship between protocol type and intrusion, which will enable us to understand how different communication protocols contribute to intrusion risk, following that, we are also going to analyze intrusion rate for each browser type, which will allow us to uncover potential vulnerabilities associated with specific browsers, then, we are going to calculate the average login attempts and failed logins for both normal and intrusion cases, which will help us to identify suspicious authentication patterns. In the next section, we are going to conduct feature importance analysis, specifically, we will rank the features with the strongest correlation to the target variable, and create a heatmap to visualize their relationships. Then, in the next section, we will start building machine learning models. In the first project, we are going to build intrusion detection models using Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression, which will allow us to detect unauthorized access attempts and prevent potential breaches in the system. In the second project, we are going to build multiclass cyber threat classification models using K Nearest Neighbour and XGBoost, which will enable us to identify different types of cyber attacks and take the right preventive measures. Meanwhile, in the third project, we are going to predict vulnerability scores using Multi Layer Perceptron Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor, which will help us to assess the severity of system weaknesses. Then, in the fourth project, we are going to detect phishing emails using natural language processing, specifically we will use the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, which will allow us to recognize malicious email content. In the fifth project, we are going to analyze user behavior using unsupervised machine learning, specifically we will use K Means clustering, which will enable us to detect unusual activity patterns. Lastly, at the end of the course, we are going to test the machine learning model in a real time simulation where every five seconds new synthetic login data is generated, which will allow us to observe how the system responds by blocking access when intrusion is detected and approving access when the session is normal.\nBefore getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we use machine learning to enhance cyber security? Well, here is my answer. From a technical perspective, machine learning can quickly analyze large volumes of security data, detect hidden patterns, and identify potential threats. From a business perspective, it helps businesses reduce risk, prevent costly security breaches, and make faster decisions to protect their digital assets.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn about machine learning and natural language processing applications in cyber security\nLearn how intrusion detection models work. This section covers data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection, splitting data into training and testing sets, model selection, model training, detecting intrusion, model evaluation, deployment, and monitoring\nLearn how to clean dataset by removing missing values and duplicates\nLearn how to conduct exploratory data analysis\nLearn how to perform features selection using Random Forest\nLearn how to build intrusion detection model using Random Forest Classifier\nLearn how to build intrusion detection model using Logistic Regression\nLearn how to detect cyber threat using K Nearest Neighbour\nLearn how to detect cyber threat using XGBoost\nLearn how to predict vulnerability score using MLP Regressor\nLearn how to predict vulnerability score using Decision Tree Regressor\nLearn how to detect phishing email using NLP and Naive Bayes\nLearn how to analyze user behaviour using unsupervised machine learning and K Means Clustering\nLearn how to test machine learning model in real time simulation",

It’s a game-changing interface that will supercharge your Machine Learning toolkit.\n\n\nCheck out what’s in store for you when you enroll:\nPart 1: Data Preprocessing\nImporting the dataset\nSplitting the dataset into the training set and test set\nPart 2: Building an ANN\nInitializing the ANN\nAdding the input layer and the first hidden layer\nAdding the output layer\nCompiling the ANN\nPart 3: Training the ANN\nTraining the ANN model on the training set\nPredicting the results of the test set\n\n\nMore about Combined-Cycle Power Plants\nA combined-cycle power plant is an electrical power plant in which a Gas Turbine (GT) and a Steam Turbine (ST) are used in combination to produce more electrical energy from the same fuel than that would be possible from a single cycle power plant.\nThe gas turbine compresses air and mixes it with a fuel heated to a very high temperature. The hot air-fuel mixture moves through the blades, making them spin. The fast-spinning gas turbine drives a generator to generate electricity. The exhaust (waste) heat escaped through the exhaust stack of the gas turbine is utilized by a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HSRG) system to produce steam that spins a steam turbine. This steam turbine drives a generator to produce additional electricity. CCCP is assumed to produce 50% more energy than a single power plant.",

We need to ensure that all people involved in the project have a common understanding of what is required, how the process works, and that we have a realistic view of what is possible with the tools at hand. To boil down all this to its core components we could consider a few important rules:\ncreate a common ground of understanding, this will ensure the right mindset\nstate early how progress should be measured\ncommunicate clearly how different machine learning concepts works\nacknowledge and consider the inherited uncertainty, it is part of the process\nIn order to define AI, we must first define the concept of intelligence in general. A paraphrased definition based on Wikipedia is:\nIntelligence can be generally described as the ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.\nWhile there are many different definitions of intelligence, they all essentially involve learning, understanding, and the application of the knowledge learned to achieve one or more goals.\nIs this course for me?\nBy taking this course, you will gain the tools you need to continue improving yourself in the field of app development. You will be able to apply what you learned to further experience in making your own apps able to perform more.\nNo experience necessary. Even if you’ve never coded before, you can take this course. One of the best features is that you can watch the tutorials at any speed you want. This means you can speed up or slow down the video if you want to!\nWhen your learning to code, you often find yourself following along with a tutor without really knowing why you're doing certain things. In this course, I will demonstrate correct coding as well as mistakes I often see and how to avoid them.",

Whether it's changes in APIs, the introduction of new features, or shifts in best practices, our course evolves to ensure you're always prepared with the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge. Regular updates not only keep the course fresh but also provide you with ongoing learning opportunities, ensuring your skills remain sharp and competitive.\nSample Practice Test Questions\nTo give you a taste of what our course offers, here are five sample questions. Each question is followed by multiple-choice options and a detailed explanation that not only justifies the correct answer but also offers valuable insights into the concept.\nWhat is the primary function of the Catalyst Optimizer in Spark SQL?\nA) To manage Spark's streaming data\nB) To optimize logical and physical query plans\nC) To serialize and deserialize data\nD) To allocate resources dynamically in Spark\nExplanation: The Catalyst Optimizer is a key component of Spark SQL that optimizes both logical and physical query plans. This optimization process involves translating user-written queries into an execution plan that can be efficiently executed across a distributed system. Catalyst uses advanced programming features to build an extensible query optimization framework. Unlike options A, C, and D, which pertain to other aspects of Spark, the Catalyst Optimizer specifically focuses on enhancing the performance and efficiency of SQL queries in Spark.\nHow does Spark ensure data reliability and fault tolerance in its operations?\nA) By using a write-ahead log (WAL)\nB) Through regular data backups\nC) By replicating data across multiple nodes\nD) All of the above\nExplanation: Spark ensures data reliability and fault tolerance primarily through data replication across multiple nodes, which is a characteristic of its underlying RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets). While a write-ahead log (WAL) is used in Spark Streaming for fault tolerance, it's not the primary method for regular Spark operations. Regular data backups are not a built-in feature of Spark's operations. Therefore, while options A and B are relevant in certain contexts, the most comprehensive and accurate answer is C, as data replication is fundamental to Spark's design for fault tolerance.\nIn Spark Streaming, what is the primary difference between stateful and stateless operations?\nA) Stateful operations consider only the current batch of data, while stateless operations consider the entire dataset.\nB) Stateful operations require checkpointing, while stateless operations do not.\nC) Stateful operations track data across multiple batches, while stateless operations process each batch independently.\nD) Stateful operations are used for windowed computations, while stateless operations are not.\nExplanation: The primary difference between stateful and stateless operations in Spark Streaming lies in how they process data. Stateful operations keep track of data across multiple batches of streamed data, allowing them to provide insights based on historical data along with the current batch. This is essential for operations like running counts or windowed computations. In contrast, stateless operations process each batch independently, without any knowledge of the previous batches. While checkpointing (option B) is often associated with stateful operations, and windowed computations (option D) can be a part of stateful processing, the most defining characteristic is the tracking of data across batches, as stated in option C.\nWhich of the following best describes the function of a custom partitioner in Spark?\nA) It enhances the security of data stored in RDDs.\nB) It optimizes the physical distribution of data across the cluster.\nC) It converts data into a serialized format for storage.\nD) It schedules jobs and allocates resources in Spark.\nExplanation: A custom partitioner in Spark plays a critical role in optimizing the physical distribution of data across the cluster. By customizing how data is partitioned, developers can ensure that related data is processed together, minimizing data shuffling across the nodes and thereby improving the performance of Spark applications. This is particularly important in large-scale data processing where efficient data distribution can significantly affect performance. While options A, C, and D pertain to other functionalities within Spark, option B accurately captures the essence of what a custom partitioner does.\nIn the context of Spark's deployment modes, what is the primary role of YARN?\nA) To provide a distributed storage system for Spark\nB) To manage and schedule resources for Spark applications\nC) To optimize Spark SQL queries\nD) To handle streaming data in Spark\nExplanation: YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) serves as a resource manager and job scheduler for Spark applications when Spark is deployed in a YARN mode. It allocates resources (like CPU and memory) to various applications, including Spark, and schedules jobs for execution. This integration allows Spark to effectively run alongside other applications in a shared cluster environment, making efficient use of resources. While Spark has capabilities for handling storage (option A), optimizing SQL queries (option C), and processing streaming data (option D), YARN's specific role in a Spark ecosystem is to manage and schedule resources, as described in option B.\nThese sample questions and their thorough explanations demonstrate the depth and quality of content students can expect from the full course. By engaging with these practice tests, students can significantly enhance their understanding and preparedness for Spark-related interviews.\nEnroll now to take your Apache Spark skills to the next level and ace your upcoming interviews with confidence.

      "description": "80+% Student Passed Exam After Only Studying These Questions. Pass yours, enroll now!\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nThe Platform Engineering team at QuantumLeap AI is onboarding a new, unmodifiable third-party application to their GKE cluster, which uses Google Cloud's operations suite for monitoring. The application writes its logs to a file at /var/log/app_messages.log instead of standard output. To ensure observability, you must ingest these file-based logs into Cloud Logging. What should you do?\n\n\nA. Use the default Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring agent configuration.\nB. Deploy a Fluentd daemonset to GK\nC. Then create a customized input and output configuration to tail the log file in the application's pods and write to Stackdriver Logging.\nD. Install Kubernetes on Google Compute Engine (GCE) and redeploy your applications. Then customize the built-in Stackdriver Logging configuration to tail the log file in the application's pods and write to Stackdriver Logging.\nE. Write a script to tail the log file within the pod and write entries to standard output. Run the script as a sidecar container with the application's pod. Configure a shared volume between the containers to allow the script to have read access to /var/log in the application container.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation:\nThe core of the problem is that a new, unmodifiable application writes its logs to a file within its container (`/var/log/app_messages.log`), not to the standard output (`stdout`) or standard error (`stderr`) streams.\n* A. Use the default Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring agent configuration. This is incorrect. The default logging agent in GKE is configured to collect logs only from `stdout` and `stderr`. It will not read arbitrary files from within containers.\n* B. Deploy a Fluentd daemonset to GKE... This is the correct answer. The standard way to collect logs from files inside containers on GKE is to customize the logging agent. The agent runs as a DaemonSet on each node. By deploying your own customized Fluentd DaemonSet, you can configure an input plugin (like `in_tail`) to watch for and read from specific file paths. The container's log file is accessible on the node's filesystem (typically under `/var/log/pods/...`), so the node-level Fluentd agent can be configured to access it. This provides a scalable, cluster-level solution for this logging requirement.\n* C. Install Kubernetes on Google Compute Engine (GCE)... This is incorrect. Moving from a managed service like GKE to a self-managed Kubernetes cluster on GCE is a drastic and unnecessary step that adds significant operational overhead. GKE provides the necessary mechanisms to solve this problem.\n* D. Write a script to tail the log file... Run the script as a sidecar container... This describes the \"sidecar\" pattern. While this pattern is a valid technical solution, it is often considered an application-level workaround rather than a robust infrastructure-level solution. It requires modifying every application's deployment manifest to add the sidecar and a shared volume, increasing resource usage per pod. Option B provides a more centralized and cleaner infrastructure solution by customizing the behavior of the logging agent itself, which is a common practice for a DevOps Engineer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nTo integrate with a new monitoring platform, the DevOps team at OrbitCloud needs to send an HTTP POST with build information from their multi-step Cloud Build pipeline to a third-party webhook, and they must accomplish this with minimal development effort. What should you do?\n\n\nA. Add logic to each Cloud Build step to HTTP POST the build information to a webhook.\nB. Add a new step at the end of the pipeline in Cloud Build to HTTP POST the build information to a webhook.\nC. Use Stackdriver Logging to create a logs-based metric from the Cloud Build logs. Create an Alert with a Webhook notification type.\nD. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub push subscription to the Cloud Build cloud-builds PubSub topic to HTTP POST the build information to a webhook.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: D\nExplanation:\nThe goal is to send Cloud Build status information to a third-party webhook with minimal effort.\n* A. Add logic to each Cloud Build step to HTTP POST the build information to a webhook. This is incorrect because it is highly inefficient and creates significant maintenance overhead. You would be duplicating the notification logic in every step of your pipeline.\n* B. Add a new step at the end of the pipeline in Cloud Build to HTTP POST the build information to a webhook. This is not the best solution. A significant drawback is that this step will only execute if all preceding build steps are successful. If the build fails, the webhook notification step will never run, and your monitoring platform will not be notified of the failure.\n* C. Use Stackdriver Logging to create a logs-based metric from the Cloud Build logs. Create an Alert with a Webhook notification type. This approach is overly complex for this requirement. It involves configuring multiple services (Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Alerting) just to send a notification. This does not align with the \"minimize development effort\" constraint.\n* D. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub push subscription to the Cloud Build cloud-builds Pub/Sub topic to HTTP POST the build information to a webhook. This is the correct answer. Cloud Build automatically publishes messages with build status updates (e.g., success, failure, timeout) to a dedicated Pub/Sub topic named `cloud-builds`. By creating a push subscription to this topic and setting the endpoint to your third-party webhook URL, Pub/Sub will automatically forward these status updates via an HTTP POST. This is a purely declarative approach that requires minimal configuration, handles all build completion states (including failures), and completely decouples the notification logic from the build pipeline itself, making it the most efficient and robust solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nAs an engineer at FinSecure, you need to share a newly created CPU utilization chart with the SRE team for performance monitoring, but you must follow the principle of least privilege. What should you do?\n\n\nA. Share the workspace Project ID with the SRE team. Assign the SRE team the Monitoring Viewer IAM role in the workspace project.\nB. Share the workspace Project ID with the SRE team. Assign the SRE team the Dashboard Viewer IAM role in the workspace project.\nC. Click ג €Share chart by URL ג € and provide the URL to the SRE team. Assign the SRE team the Monitoring Viewer IAM role in the workspace project.\nD. Click ג €Share chart by URL ג € and provide the URL to the SRE team. Assign the SRE team the Dashboard Viewer IAM role in the workspace project.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nThe goal is to share a specific chart with the SRE team while adhering to the principle of least privilege. Let's analyze the options:\n1. Sharing the Chart: The most direct way to share a single chart is by providing a direct URL to it. This focuses the SRE team's access on the specific resource you want them to see, rather than having them navigate through the entire Monitoring console. This makes options C and D preferable to A and B.\n2. Assigning Permissions: Even with a direct URL, the user must have the appropriate IAM permissions to view the data presented in the chart. We need to choose the role that grants the minimum necessary permissions.\n* Monitoring Viewer (`roles/monitoring.viewer`): This role grants read-only access to all monitoring data, including metrics, dashboards, and alerting policies. A user needs this role to see the time-series data displayed in a chart.\n* Dashboard Viewer (`roles/monitoring.dashboardViewer`): This is a misleading name in the options. The actual predefined role is \"Monitoring Dashboard Configuration Viewer\" (`roles/monitoring.dashboardConfigurationViewer`). This role only allows a user to view the *configuration* of a dashboard (e.g., which charts are on it, how they are arranged), but it does *not* grant permission to see the actual metric data within the charts.\nConclusion:\n* Option A is too broad. It gives access to all monitoring data but doesn't direct the SRE team to the specific chart.\n* Option B is incorrect because the \"Dashboard Viewer\" role does not allow viewing the chart's data.\n* Option D is incorrect for the same reason as B; the \"Dashboard Viewer\" role is insufficient.\n* Option C is the correct answer. It combines the most specific method of sharing (a direct URL to the chart) with the minimum required IAM role (`Monitoring Viewer`) necessary to actually view the data in that chart. Although the `Monitoring Viewer` role grants access to more than just one chart, it is the least privileged predefined role that fulfills the requirement of viewing the chart's data.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Choose Our Certification Exam Prep Courses?\nWhen it comes to passing your certification exam—whether it’s AWS, Microsoft, or Oracle—quality training makes all the difference.

Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\n\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. The language model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including articles, social media posts, essays, code and emails.ChatGPT is a form of generative AI -- a tool that lets users enter prompts to receive humanlike images, text or videos that are created by AI.\n\n\nWhat is EDA?\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.EDA helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. Originally developed by American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used method in the data discovery process today.\n\n\nFresh content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate New tools are released every day, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge for being a better security specialist\n\n\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nWe offer full support, answering any questions\n\n\nSee you in the \"\"Data Science & EDA: Global Conflict Project from Scratch\" course.\nMaster Data Science Skills, Analyze Global Conflicts, cluster & visualize real-world crisis data with Python & ChatGPT",

Optimization is at the heart of decision-making in production, logistics, scheduling, and many areas of data-driven business. In this course, we’ll not only cover the mathematical foundations but also show how to implement the algorithms in two of the most widely used programming languages in industry: Python and Java.\nWhy Python and Java? In practice, Python is often used for prototyping, data analysis, and building optimization models quickly thanks to its large ecosystem of libraries. Java, on the other hand, is still widely adopted in enterprise systems, especially when optimization needs to be integrated into larger applications. By learning both, you’ll be better prepared for what companies actually use in real-life projects.\nThe course begins with the basics: linear programming, simplex method, and how to formulate problems correctly. From there, we move on to applied cases such as vehicle routing, production planning, and Bayesian optimization. You’ll also work with heuristic methods like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing, learning how they provide solutions when exact methods are not feasible.\nAll the lectures come with coding examples, step-by-step explanations, and clear connections between theory and application. By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of optimization algorithms, the ability to code them in Python and Java, and the confidence to apply them in your own projects or professional work.",

      "description": "For many years, and for good reason, Excel has been a staple for working professionals. It is essential in all facets of business, education, finance, and research due to its extensive capabilities and simplicity of use.\nOver the past few years, python programming language has become more popular. According to one study, the demand for Python expertise has grown by 27.6 % over the past year and shows no indications of slowing down. Python has been a pioneer in web development, data analysis, and infrastructure management since it was first developed as a tool to construct scripts that \"automate the boring stuff.\"\nWhy python is important for automation?\nConsider being required to create accounts on a website for 10,000 employees. What do you think? Performing this operation manually and frequently will eventually drive you crazy. It will also take too long, which is not a good idea.\nTry to consider what it's like for data entry workers. They take the data from tables (like those in Excel or Google Sheets) and insert it elsewhere.\nThey read various magazines and websites, get the data there, and then enter it into the database. Additionally, they must perform the calculations for the entries.\nIn general, this job's performance determines how much money is made. Greater entry volume, more pay (of course, everyone wants a higher salary in their job).\nHowever, don't you find doing the same thing over and over boring?\nThe question is now, \"How can I accomplish it quickly?\"\nHow to automate my work?\nSpend an hour coding and automating these kinds of chores to make your life simpler rather than performing these kinds of things by hand. By just writing fewer lines of Python code, you can automate your strenuous activity.\nThe course covers following topics:\n1. Excel basics\n2. Excel Functions\n3. Excel Visualizations\n4. Excel Case study (Financial Statements)\n5. Python numpy and pandas\n6. Python Implementations of Excel functions\n7. Python matplotlib and pandas visualizations\nThe evidence suggests that both Excel and Python have their place with certain applications. Excel is a great entry-level tool and is a quick-and-easy way to analyze a dataset.\nBut for the modern era, with large datasets and more complex analytics and automation, Python provides the tools, techniques and processing power that Excel, in many instances, lacks. After all, Python is more powerful, faster, capable of better data analysis and it benefits from a more inclusive, collaborative support system.\nPython is a must-have skill for aspiring data analysts, data scientist and anyone in the field of science, and now is the time to learn.",

      "description": "80+% Student Passed Exam After Only Studying These Questions. Pass yours, enroll now!\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nInnovateCorp's API Gateway Team is launching a major revision of their developer API, requiring the old API version to remain available while new customers and testers can access the new API through the existing SSL and DNS records. What approach should they implement?\n\n\nA. Configure a new load balancer for the new version of the API\nB. Reconfigure old clients to use a new endpoint for the new API\nC. Have the old API forward traffic to the new API based on the path\nD. Use separate backend pools for each API path behind the load balancer\n\n\nCorrect Answer: D\nExplanation:\nThe core requirement is to keep the same SSL and DNS records while serving both the old and new API versions. This implies using a single entry point (IP address, DNS name, SSL certificate) that can intelligently route requests to different backend services.\n* Option D: Use separate backend pools for each API path behind the load balancer.\n* Rationale: An HTTP(S) Load Balancer on Google Cloud allows you to define multiple backend services (which can be backed by instance groups, GKE services, serverless NEGs, etc.). It supports URL maps that can route incoming requests to different backend services based on the request path (e.g., `/v1/*` goes to the old API's backend pool, `/v2/*` goes to the new API's backend pool). This setup uses a single external IP address, a single DNS record pointing to that IP, and a single SSL certificate managed by the load balancer, perfectly meeting the requirement to keep the same SSL and DNS records. It also ensures both API versions remain available and allows for independent deployment and scaling.\n* Option A: Configure a new load balancer for the new version of the API.\n* Rationale: This would likely result in a new external IP address and would necessitate new DNS records or changes to existing ones to point to the new load balancer, directly contradicting the requirement to \"keep the same SSL and DNS records in place.\"\n* Option B: Reconfigure old clients to use a new endpoint for the new API.\n* Rationale: The question states the company needs to \"keep the old version of the API available and deployable\" and allow \"new customers and testers to try out the new API.\" Reconfiguring old clients means disrupting existing users or requiring them to update, which goes against the intent of keeping the old API available without disruption. It also implies a new endpoint, which might involve new DNS records.\n* Option C: Have the old API forward traffic to the new API based on the path.\n* Rationale: While path-based logic is involved, having the *old API itself* perform the forwarding is an inefficient and brittle solution. It means the old API backend would still receive all traffic, adding unnecessary load and complexity to its application logic. It couples the deployment of the new API to the old API's configuration and code, making independent management harder. A load balancer is designed for this type of traffic routing at the network edge, providing better performance, scalability, and separation of concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nThe Arkham Solutions team is migrating an existing corporate application from their on-premises data center to Google Cloud Platform, requiring minimal user disruption and adherence to strict security policies regarding password storage. What authentication strategy should they use?\n\n\nA. Use G Suite Password Sync to replicate passwords into Google\nB. Federate authentication via SAML 2.0 to the existing Identity Provider\nC. Provision users in Google using the Google Cloud Directory Sync tool\nD. Ask users to set their Google password to match their corporate password\n\n\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation:\nThe most suitable authentication strategy, considering minimal user disruption and strict security requirements for password storage, is to federate authentication via SAML 2.0 to the existing Identity Provider.\nHere's the rationale:\n1. Minimal User Disruption: Federated authentication (like SAML 2.0) allows users to leverage their existing corporate credentials to access applications in Google Cloud Platform. They don't need to remember new usernames or passwords, nor do they need to undergo a password reset or synchronization process. This provides a seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) experience, significantly reducing user friction.\n2. Strict Security Requirements for Password Storage: This is the most critical constraint. When you federate identity, the actual user passwords remain securely within your organization's existing Identity Provider (IdP) (e.g., Active Directory, Okta, Ping Identity). Google Cloud (or any service provider) never directly stores or sees the user's password. Instead, the IdP handles the authentication, and upon successful authentication, it sends an assertion (a cryptographically signed token like a SAML assertion) to Google Cloud, indicating that the user is authenticated. This approach meets the highest security standards for password handling as passwords never leave the on-premises secure environment.\nWhy other options are not suitable:\n* A. Use G Suite Password Sync to replicate passwords into Google: G Suite Password Sync (now part of Google Cloud Directory Sync for specific configurations) *can* synchronize hashed passwords from an on-premises Active Directory to Google. However, this means Google would be storing a copy of the hashed passwords, which might violate \"strict security team requirements for storing passwords\" if the requirement is that passwords *never* leave the on-premises environment or are never stored by a third party. Federation is generally preferred for the highest security posture regarding password custody.\n* C. Provision users in Google using the Google Cloud Directory Sync tool: Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) is primarily used to synchronize user accounts, groups, and contacts from an on-premises LDAP directory (like Active Directory) to Google Cloud Identity. While it populates the user identities in Google Cloud, it typically does *not* synchronize passwords by default, especially in a way that allows password authentication directly against Google's stores if the original source is Active Directory (due to Active Directory's write-only password storage). If GCDS *were* configured for password sync (as in option A), it would still involve Google storing hashed passwords. The main purpose of GCDS is user *provisioning*, not a standalone authentication strategy that addresses the password storage constraint directly. Without federation, users provisioned via GCDS might still need to set up a new Google-specific password, causing user disruption.\n* D. Ask users to set their Google password to match their corporate password: This is a terrible security practice. It encourages users to reuse passwords across different systems, which significantly increases the risk if one system is compromised. It also creates manual overhead for users if passwords need to be changed and provides no automated synchronization, leading to high user disruption and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nThe DevOps team at NexusHost Solutions aims to further reduce unplanned rollbacks of erroneous production deployments for their web hosting platform, having already achieved an 80% reduction through improved QA/Test processes. Which additional two approaches can they take to further reduce these rollbacks? (Choose two.)\n\n\nA. Introduce a green-blue deployment model\nB. Replace the QA environment with canary releases\nC. Fragment the monolithic platform into microservices\nD. Reduce the platform's dependency on relational database systems\nE. Replace the platform's relational database systems with a NoSQL database\n\n\nCorrect Answer: A C\nExplanation:\nTo further reduce unplanned rollbacks of erroneous production deployments, beyond improvements in QA/Test processes, the focus should be on deployment strategies and architectural decomposition that minimize risk and scope of change.\nHere's the rationale for the correct choices:\n* A. Introduce a green-blue deployment model: This approach involves maintaining two identical production environments: \"green\" (current live version) and \"blue\" (new version). The new version is deployed to the \"blue\" environment, thoroughly tested there, and then traffic is switched from \"green\" to \"blue.\" If any issues arise with the \"blue\" environment, traffic can be immediately switched back to \"green,\" effectively performing an instantaneous and low-risk rollback. This significantly reduces the impact and frequency of disruptive unplanned rollbacks by providing a safe and rapid reversion mechanism.\n* C. Fragment the monolithic platform into microservices: A monolithic application means that even a small change requires deploying the entire application, increasing the risk of introducing bugs across a wide surface area and making rollbacks complex and impactful. By breaking the monolith into smaller, independently deployable microservices, the scope of each deployment is significantly reduced. If an error occurs in a single microservice, only that specific service needs to be rolled back or addressed, not the entire platform. This limits the blast radius of errors and reduces the overall number of full platform rollbacks, making deployments more frequent but less risky.\nWhy other options are not ideal:\n* B. Replace the QA environment with canary releases: While canary releases are an excellent strategy for detecting issues in production early (by rolling out to a small subset of users before a full release) and can help prevent widespread impact, suggesting they *replace* the QA environment is problematic. QA environments are crucial for comprehensive pre-production testing (functional, integration, performance, security, etc.) in a controlled setting. Canary releases are a production deployment strategy that helps validate in a live environment, but they don't substitute for the rigorous testing performed in a dedicated QA environment, which is already credited with an 80% reduction in rollbacks.\n* D. Reduce the platform's dependency on relational database systems: This is an architectural decision related to data storage and scalability patterns. While certain database choices might offer different performance or consistency characteristics, reducing dependency on relational databases itself does not directly address the *process of reducing unplanned application rollbacks* due to erroneous deployments.\n* E. Replace the platform's relational database systems with a NoSQL database: Similar to option D, this is a specific technology choice for data storage. Migrating databases can be a complex and risky endeavor itself, potentially *introducing* new points of failure rather than inherently reducing application deployment rollbacks. It does not directly contribute to safer deployment practices or architectural changes that reduce deployment scope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Choose Our Certification Exam Prep Courses?\nWhen it comes to passing your certification exam—whether it’s AWS, Microsoft, or Oracle—quality training makes all the difference.

      "description": "UPDATE: As of Nov 22, 2018, this course is now free! Many thanks to all my existing students who made it possible for the wider audience to benefit from the course material :-)\nWith \"Introduction to R\", you will gain a solid grounding of the fundamentals of the R language!\nThis course has about 90 videos and 140+ exercise questions, over 10 chapters. To begin with, you will learn to Download and Install R (and R studio) on your computer. Then I show you some basic things in your first R session.\nFrom there, you will review topics in increasing order of difficulty, starting with Data/Object Types and Operations, Importing into R, and Loops and Conditions.\nNext, you will be introduced to the use of R in Analytics, where you will learn a little about each object type in R and use that in Data Mining/Analytical Operations.\nAfter that, you will learn the use of R in Statistics, where you will see about using R to evaluate Descriptive Statistics, Probability Distributions, Hypothesis Testing, Linear Modeling, Generalized Linear Models, Non-Linear Regression, and Trees.\nFollowing that, the next topic will be Graphics, where you will learn to create 2-dimensional Univariate and Multi-variate plots. You will also learn about formatting various parts of a plot, covering a range of topics like Plot Layout, Region, Points, Lines, Axes, Text, Color and so on.\nAt that point, the course finishes off with two topics: Exporting out of R, and Creating Functions.\nEach chapter is designed to teach you several concepts, and these have been grouped into sub-sections. A sub-section usually has the following:\nA Concept Video\nAn Exercise Sheet\nAn Exercise Video (with answers)\n\n\nWhy take a course to learn R?\nWhen I look to advancing my R knowledge today, I still face the same sort of situation as when I originally started to use R. Back when I was learning R, my approach was learn by doing. There was a lot of free material out there (and I refer to that early in the course) that gave me a framework, but the wording was highly technical in nature. Even with the R help and the free material, it took me up to a couple of months of experimentation to gain a certain level of proficiency. What I would have liked at that time was a way to learn the fundamentals quicker. I have designed this course with exactly that in mind.\nWhy my course?\nFor those of you that are new to R, this course will cover enough breadth/depth in R to give you a solid grounding. I use simple language to explain the concepts. Also, I give you 140+ exercise questions many of which are based on real world data for practice to get you up and running quickly, all in a single package. This course is designed to get you functional with R in little over a week.\nFor those beginners with some experience that have learnt R through experimentation, this course is designed to complement what you know, and round out your understanding of the same.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Generative AI with LLMs, Prompting, Automation & Agents course by Uplatz.\n\n\nGenerative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new content—such as text, images, audio, code, and more—rather than simply analyzing existing data. It mimics human creativity by learning from large datasets and generating outputs that resemble original, human-made content.\n\n\nWhat It Does\nTraditional AI systems are good at recognizing patterns or making predictions based on existing data. Generative AI goes a step further by actually producing new data that didn't exist before. For example:\nWriting articles or stories\nCreating images or artwork\nComposing music\nWriting code\nDesigning products or layouts\n\n\nHow It Works\nGenerative AI typically relies on advanced machine learning techniques, especially deep learning models such as:\nTransformers – used in models like GPT (text) or T5\nDiffusion models – used in image generation (like DALL·E or Stable Diffusion)\nGANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) – used for creating realistic media\n\n\nA simplified breakdown of the process:\n\n\nTraining\nThe model is trained on massive datasets (e.g., books, websites, images, code).\nIt learns statistical patterns, styles, and relationships in the data.\nLearning Probabilities\nInstead of memorizing, the model learns the probability of what should come next in a sequence (next word, next pixel, etc.).\nGeneration (Inference)\nWhen you give it a prompt, it generates new content based on what it has learned.\nFor instance, if you type a sentence, a text model will complete it or write a full article.\nIf you input a concept, an image model can generate an image matching that description.\nFine-Tuning\nThe base model can be refined using reinforcement learning or task-specific data to make it more accurate, aligned, or safer.\n\n\nGenerative AI with LLMs, Prompting, Automation & Agents - Course Curriculum\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) - part 1 to 21\nCoding of Transformers and LLMs - part 1 to 41\nPrompt Engineering for Generative AI - part 1 to 19\nAI Workflow Automation - part 1 to 24\nAI Agents with Python - part 1 to 15\nRAG for Generative AI - part 1 to 5\n\n\nCommon Applications of Generative AI\n1.

      "description": "JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology for developing Webpages that supports dynamic content. This helps developers insert java code in HTML pages by making use of special JSP tags, most of which start with <% and end with %>.\nA JavaServer Pages component is a type of Java servlet that is designed to fulfill the role of a user interface for a Java web application. Web developers write JSPs as text files that combine HTML or XHTML code, XML elements, and embedded JSP actions and commands.\nUsing JSP, you can collect input from users through Webpage forms, present records from a database or another source, and create Webpages dynamically.\nJSP tags can be used for a variety of purposes, such as retrieving information from a database or registering user preferences, accessing JavaBeans components, passing control between pages, and sharing information between requests, pages etc.\nWhy Use JSP?\nJavaServer Pages often serve the same purpose as programs implemented using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). But JSP offers several advantages in comparison with the CGI.\nPerformance is significantly better because JSP allows embedding Dynamic Elements in HTML Pages itself instead of having separate CGI files.\nJSP are always compiled before they are processed by the server unlike CGI/Perl which requires the server to load an interpreter and the target script each time the page is requested.\nJavaServer Pages are built on top of the Java Servlets API, so like Servlets, JSP also has access to all the powerful Enterprise Java APIs, including JDBC, JNDI, EJB, JAXP, etc.\nJSP pages can be used in combination with servlets that handle the business logic, the model supported by Java servlet template engines.\nFinally, JSP is an integral part of Java EE, a complete platform for enterprise class applications. This means that JSP can play a part in the simplest applications to the most complex and demanding.",

The Comprehensive Data Manipulation course offers a deep dive into the world of data manipulation using five potent tools: Python, Pandas, R, SQL, and Alteryx. Whether you're a beginner just embarking on a career in data analysis, or a seasoned professional looking to expand your skillset, this course offers a robust foundation and advanced techniques in data manipulation.\nThis course adopts a project-based approach, reinforcing learning through practical application. Starting with an overview of data manipulation and its role in data analysis, the course progresses to an in-depth exploration of each tool, covering their installation, setup, features, and unique strengths.\nPython, a versatile language renowned for its readability, is the first tool we tackle. Here, you'll learn the basics of Python programming for data manipulation, moving onto mastering the use of Python's powerful library, Pandas. With Pandas, you'll explore data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. Handling missing data, converting data types, parsing dates, and more become straightforward with this handy library.\nNext, we delve into SQL, a standard language for managing data held in relational databases. Through this section, you'll grasp SQL commands and functions, enabling you to interact with databases, retrieve, and manipulate data with precision.\nWe then transition to R, another popular language for data analysis, with a focus on dplyr and tidyr packages. These packages allow for efficient data transformation, reshaping, and overall manipulation.\nFinally, we introduce Alteryx, a platform that provides advanced data blending, spatial analysis, and enables the creation of repeatable workflows. The Alteryx section covers all these features and includes how to handle missing data, format data, and perform time series analysis.\nWhile each of these tools is powerful in its own right, their true strength comes from their integration. The course culminates in a real-world data manipulation project requiring the use of Python, Pandas, R, SQL, and Alteryx in a unified workflow. This capstone project, focusing on the analysis and prediction of energy consumption, allows you to apply the learned skills in real-time and gives you a taste of real-world data manipulation challenges.\nWith this comprehensive course, you'll not only learn the mechanics of each tool but also when and how to use them most effectively. You'll develop a systematic and strategic approach to handle large datasets, write efficient and reusable code, and understand ethical considerations in data manipulation. By the end of the course, you'll be well-equipped to tackle any data manipulation task, thereby opening new avenues in your data analysis or data science career.",

      "description": "This is Advanced Python for Data Science!\nToday, most people enter the world of Data Science through the buzz and allure of “AI.” We tackle Kaggle challenges, voraciously consume Stack Overflow, and eat, live, and breathe through the Jupyter Notebook. Python, along with its “killer app” of Machine Learning, has done nothing short of revolutionize the way we “do data science,” and the world is a more interesting place because of it!\nMost of the time, your impact as a Data Scientist is limited by your ability to enact your ideas - not by the ideas themselves. You can train a model on ‘clean’ data using Scikit Learn or FastAI, or run an ANOVA, in a notebook. Enacting that idea means getting to the data in the first place. It means knowing how to store it. It means processing your data at scale. It means running your processing script, reliably, every day on fresh data. It means testing that script. It means collaborating on that script with a coworker - or 10 - as the project scales. It means curating a library and building tools to solve the same problem for 5 new projects. It means packaging a model up for distribution - sharing with another data scientist, or deploying it as a service.\nIt means changing the way you think about problems by adopting new paradigms that accelerate you - and your work - across your organization. It means building an approach to data science within the broader python ecosystem.\nThis is a course about how to be an Advanced Data Science Programmer, leveraging tools and techniques from the broader Python ecosystem. In this introductory course of the Advanced Python for MLOps and Data Science series, we will introduce you to the HEROS concept, and focus on Higher-Levels of coding.\nYou will learn how to treat your code as data, which is one of the most important ways to leverage Higher Levels of coding, and understand why repetitive code is a good opportunity to refactor into two parts - the purely “logical” part of your code, and the details - or “data”. We will then deep dive into real-world examples and see how we can produce many different outcomes, whether there are reports, analysis or models - with just few lines of logical code.\nSo, are you ready to take your next step in the MLOps and Advanced Python for Data Science Journey?\nBuckle up, and let's get coding!",

We will explore various techniques for batching data and discuss why certain batching methods are better than others. We will also cover how to preprocess and clean the data to ensure that it is suitable for training our model.\nAfter loading and preprocessing the data, we will delve into the process of training a model. We will learn about the architecture of a typical text generation model and the different types of layers that can be used. We will also cover topics such as loss functions and optimization algorithms and explore the impact that these have on our model's performance.\nOnce we have trained our model, we will move on to generating text using our newly trained text generator. We will explore various approaches for generating text, such as random sampling, greedy decoding, and beam search. We will also discuss how to tune the hyperparameters of our model to achieve better results.\nFinally, we will create a small app that can run in the browser to showcase our text generator. We will discuss various front-end frameworks such as React and Vue.js and explore how to integrate our model into a web application.\nOverall, this course will provide us with a comprehensive understanding of how to build a text generator from scratch and the tools and techniques required to accomplish this task.",

      "description": "L'Intelligenza Artificiale sta facendo progressi esponenziali, avanzando come nessuna tecnologia aveva mai fatto prima nella storia dell'uomo, e il merito è di un solo e unico campo: il Deep Learning.\nIl Deep Learning è l'insieme di metodi utilizzati per addestrare le Reti Neurali Artificiali, un particolare modello del Machine Learning che hanno rivoluzionato l'intero settore.\nApplicazione pratiche di Deep Learning e Reti Neurali Artificiali sono già intorno a noi:\nLe self-driving cars che cambieranno come mai prima d'ora la mobilità urbana.\nGli assistenti virtuali come Alexa di Amazon e Google Home che sono sempre più presenti all'interno delle nostre abitazioni.\nSistemi intelligenti come IBM Watson che ogni giorno aiutano medici a fare diagnosi migliori salvando vite umane.\nIn questo corso esploreremo il funzionamento del Deep Learning e impareremo insieme a creare i nostri modelli di Reti Neurali Artificiali utilizzando Python e Keras su Tensorflow per risolvere problemi differenti, come:\nIdentificare tumori maligni.\nRiconoscere capi di abbigliamento nelle foto.\nClassificare recensioni come positive o negative.\n\nHai già seguito il nostro primo corso sul Machine Learning con Python o hai già esperienza con il Machine Learning ?\nAllora sei pronto per addentrarti più in profondità con lo studio del Deep Learning e delle Reti Neurali Artificiali.\n\nNon hai mai avuto a che fare con il Machine Learning prima d'ora ?\nNon temere, abbiamo pensato anche a te, all'interno del corso troverai delle sezioni specifiche in cui ti verranno forniti tutti i prerequisiti sul Machine Learning necessari per poterti cimentare con le Reti Neurali Artificiali.\n\nNon sai (ancora) programmare e non conosci il linguaggio Python ? Non preoccuparti, ti insegneremo tutto noi durante il corso ! L'unica cosa di cui hai bisogno per affrontare questo corso è qualche base di matematica da scuola superiore.\n\nCosa faremo durante il corso ?\nNella prima sezione osserveremo a cosa serve esattamente il Deep Learning e alcune delle sue applicazioni più importanti. Vedremo insieme quali sono i linguaggi più popolari per il Deep Learning e quali sono le librerie per Python che ci permettono di creare Reti Neurali Artificiali.\nDopo questa breve introduzione inizieremo subito a sporcarci le mani, osservando il funzionamento di una rete neurale artificiale per poi crearne una insieme, al fine di riconoscere tumori maligni partendo da informazioni estratte da degli esami radiologici.\nProseguiremo il corso studiando tutte le principali tecniche utilizzate per addestrare una rete neurale artificiale, come:\nGradient descent, nelle sue varianti Full batch, Mini Batch e Stochastic.\nL'utilizzo di Momentum e Nesterov Momentum.\nAdaGrad.\nRMSprop.\nAdaDelta.\nAdam, Nadam e Adamax\n\nUtilizzeremo le informazioni acquisite per addestrare una rete neurale artificiale in grado di riconoscere calzature, capi di abbigliamento e accessori nelle fotografie, utilizzando il dataset Fashion-MNIST.\n\nNella sezione seguente introdurremo il problema dell'overfitting nelle reti neurali artificiali e vedremo come contrastarlo con tecniche generiche come regolarizzazione L1 e L2 e specifiche per le reti neurali come il Dropout. Qui sfrutteremo il dataset delle recensioni di film dell'Internet Movie Database (IMDB) per creare una rete neurale in grado di comprendere in maniera autonoma se una recensione è positiva o negativa.\n\nIl processo di addestramento di una Rete Neurale Artificiale può essere molto dispendioso, in termini di tempo e risorse di calcolo, per questo abbiamo creato una sezione apposita per mostrarti come velocizzare il processo sfruttando la parallelizzazione delle GPUs e servizi in Cloud come Google Colaboratory e Amazon AWS.\nProseguiremo il corso vendendo insieme una tipologia di reti neurali artificiali che hanno totalmente rivoluzionato il settore della Computer Vision, rendendo obsolete tutte le tecniche usate in precedenza, ovvero le Reti Neurali Convoluzionali.\n\n\nIn seguito vedremo un'altra tipologia di reti neurali utilissima  se il nostri dati sono una sequenza, come testi, audio, video e serie storiche, cioè le Reti Neurali Ricorrenti nelle varianti Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network, Long short-term memory (LSTM) e Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Inoltre vedremo come creare rappresentazioni vettoriali di testi utilizzando il Word Embedding.\n\n\nNell'ultima sezione pratica combineremo strati convoluzionali e ricorrenti per creare una Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network.\n\nAl termine del corso ti verranno forniti alcuni consigli su come proseguire la tua avventura nel campo del Deep Learning, sia sotto un punto di vista pratico che teorico.\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Machine Learning e Deep Learning sono in continua evoluzione, quindi dopo l'ultima sezione non considerare questo corso concluso, perché verrà aggiornato costantemente con nuovi contenuti. Ad ogni nuovo aggiornamento riceverai una notifica tramite email.\n\nI contenuti in programma per il prossimo aggiornamento sono:\n\n\nEseguire predizioni su serie storiche utilizzando le reti neurali ricorrenti.\nTecniche di dataset augmentation e generatori di immagini",

You’ll learn how to craft prompts that produce consistent outputs, control model behavior (temperature, top_p, tokens, penalties), evaluate and A/B-test prompt variants, chain prompts into multi-step pipelines, and move from manual experimentation into reliable automation using APIs and tooling like LangChain and PromptLayer. The course emphasizes safety, cost-efficiency, and measurable outcomes so you can deploy prompt-based features in production with confidence.\nKey skills you’ll walk away with\nExpert-level chatgpt prompt engineering techniques: system/user/assistant role design, few-shot teaching, and format enforcement.\nRobust experiment practices: hypothesis design, A/B testing, logging, and quantitative metrics (accuracy, F1 proxies, user satisfaction).\nProduction patterns: prompt chaining, map-reduce strategies, validation layers, caching, and failover/human-in-the-loop design.\nCost & performance optimization: token compression, reuse strategies, and measurable latency/cost tradeoffs.\nSafety & compliance: anti-hallucination patterns, refusal design, PII handling, and legal/privacy considerations.\nTool integration: how to operationalize prompts via API, Playground, LangChain, and prompt logging/versioning with PromptLayer.\nWho this course is for\nThis course is built for a broad set of learners who want practical impact from AI:\nProduct managers and engineers building AI features.\nContent creators and marketers automating workflows with LLMs.\nSupport leaders automating first-line responses and triage.\nEntrepreneurs and founders integrating LLMs into SaaS products.\nData and ML practitioners looking to operationalize LLM prompts\nNo prior deep ML knowledge required — but basic familiarity with ChatGPT or similar LLMs and comfort with simple tooling will help you move faster.\nCourse structure & what we cover (module highlights)\nThe curriculum is organized into short, focused modules that combine lecture, demo, and hands-on exercises.\nModule 0 — Welcome & Setup: tools, account setup, course roadmap, and how to get the most from the exercises and capstone.\nModule 1 — Fundamentals: LLM behavior, system/user/assistant anatomy, token economics, and live demos that reveal how small prompt changes shift outputs.\nModule 2 — Core Patterns & Templates: instruction clarity, output format enforcement (JSON/CSV), few-shot examples, and reusable template libraries for common tasks.\nModule 3 — Use-Case Deep Dives (Content, Code, Data): real workflows for article generation, unit-testable code generation, and structured data extraction from messy text.\nModule 4 — Evaluation & A/B Testing: practical metrics, experiment design, sampling, and prompt versioning to scale improvements.\nModule 5 — Chaining & Automation: design patterns (map-reduce, critic loops), LangChain demos, building a simple end-to-end pipeline and validators.\nModule 6 — Safety & Hallucinations: why hallucinations happen, grounding strategies, refusal prompts, and legal/privacy guardrails.\nModule 7 — Production Readiness: logging, caching, token optimization, rate limits, monitoring, and disaster recovery patterns.\nModule 8 — Advanced Topics: RAG basics, prompt tuning vs instruction tuning, multimodal prompts, and human-in-the-loop design.\nModule 9 — Capstone: choose from a Customer Support Assistant, Content Studio, or Code Helper — design, prototype, test, and present a deployable prompt-driven project.\nEach module contains short lectures, demos, exercises, and downloadable templates you can reuse immediately. The capstone is a project-based assessment where you bring together prompt design, evaluation, and production tooling.\nTeaching approach & project-based learning\nThis course uses an iterative, experiment-driven methodology: for every concept you’ll write a hypothesis, run prompt variants (A/B), log results, and document decisions. The emphasis is on reproducibility — we’ll give you a “prompt lab” template for versioning and metrics so your improvements are measurable and repeatable. Real code snippets, API call examples, and working templates are provided so you can replicate everything in your own environment.\nWhy this course is different\nDeeply practical: templates, checklists, and production-ready patterns, not just slides.\nMeasurement-first: you’ll learn metrics that matter and how to A/B test prompts like product features.\nSafety and compliance integrated: we teach you how to prevent, detect, and mitigate hallucinations and sensitive-data leaks.\nTool-agnostic but pragmatic: covers ChatGPT & Playground fundamentals while showing how to integrate into LangChain and PromptLayer for scale.\nOutcomes — what you will be able to do\nBy course end you will be able to:\nDesign prompts that consistently produce the format and quality you need.\nImplement chatgpt prompt engineering best practices to reduce hallucinations and improve reliability.\nRun structured experiments to measure prompt impact and choose winners.\nBuild chained workflows and integrate prompts into APIs and simple orchestrations.\nOptimize prompts for cost and latency while maintaining output quality.\nApply legal, privacy, and ethical guardrails for real-world deployments.\nPractical requirements & resources provided\nYou’ll need a web-enabled computer, a ChatGPT account (free works for experiments; Plus/Pro recommended for advanced models), and an API key for production exercises. The course includes downloadable PPTs, prompt templates (JSON/CSV), prompt-lab logging templates, code examples for API integration, and a rubric for capstone assessment.",

      "description": "Artificial intelligence is one of the fastest growing fields of computer science today and the demand for excellent AI Engineers is increasing day in and day out. This course will help you stay competitive in the AI job market by teaching you how to create a Deep Learning End-to-End product on your own.\nMost courses focus on the basics of Deep Learning and teach you about the very basics of different models. In this course, however, you will learn how to write a whole End-to-End pipeline, from data preprocessing across choosing the right hyper-parameters, to showing your users results in a browser.\nThe case that we will tackle in this course is an engine for Image to Image Search.\nWhy should you take this course?\nThis course is not focused on teaching you Neural Networks (ANNs, CNNs, RNNs…), but teaching you how to apply them in real world cases.\nIf you haven’t worked on a product that uses Deep Learning before, this is the perfect course for you! Throughout the course we will work together on the Image to Image Search engine, starting from ground zero - image preprocessing, creating a model, training it, then testing. After that we will create a simple web application and use it to serve our model in production.\nAnother cool thing about this course is that we will use multiple programming languages to create the whole application around the model itself. This will make you not only a better AI Engineer but also get you on the path towards becoming a Full stack AI Engineer.\nAfter taking this course you will guarantee yourself to be one step closer to landing your dream job as an AI/ML Engineer by having your own AI product/project in your portfolio.\nLibraries/Tools used in the course:\nThe whole Deep learning back-end of our pipeline will be built using Tensorflow 1.10.0. For some image preprocessing task we will use some basic functionality from OpenCV, the most important Python library for image processing tasks!\nFor the app's back-end (model handling, image uploading, page navigation, etc.) we will use the Flask python framework.\nAnd for our interactive, front-end we are going to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Jinja templating language. So at the end of the course you will have full stack working application.\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nAs you can see the course is meant to teach you how to create your own Deep Learning product from scratch.\nIf you are just starting out with Deep Learning, this course might be too hard for you. But if you like challenges, I do recommend following it. Although I will not be explaining the meat of Neural Networks (ANNs, CNNs), I will explain most concepts in great detail, so even if you are a total beginner you should be able to follow with the help of your peers or my help through the comments section.\nIf you have Deep Learning experience and want to move it to the next level you will find this course very useful! You can consider it as a level up for your skills by putting your already great skills to new use. At the end of the course you will not only have learned how to create a working End-to-End pipeline, but also hold proof of your skills for potential employers!\n\n\nSummary\nThe conclusion is this - this is very rare opportunity, not only to learn Deep Learning concepts, but also how to apply that knowledge and create your own web application (as a complete product) from scratch.\nI hope to see you in class!\nLuka",

      "description": "A Estatística proporciona os meios e as ferramentas para encontrar estrutura em dados com o objetivo de fornecer insights sobre as informações mais profundas ali escondidas. Medidas estatísticas como média, mediana, moda, desvio padrão e distribuição servem para descrever o comportamento das variáveis de uma base de dados, assim como identificar anomalias. Em outras palavras, é preciso conhecer a “matéria-prima” com que se está trabalhando por meio de características que nos servem de resumo sobre sua natureza. Esse é o objetivo da Estatística! Se os algoritmos de machine learning são as ferramentas que os cientistas de dados operam, a Estatística é o conhecimento sobre como e porquê essas ferramentas funcionam, permitindo escolher as ferramentas mais adequadas para tirar o melhor proveito delas.\nExiste um ditado atribuído a Josh Wills, ex-funcionário do Google e do Cloudera e atualmente presidente de Engenharia de Dados do Slack: um cientista de dados é um programador melhor do que qualquer estatístico e um estatístico melhor do que qualquer programador. Sem um bom conhecimento estatístico, o cientista de dados é como um soldado cego com um arsenal poderoso. O domínio estatístico torna seu trabalho mais direcionado, eficiente e robusto, e permite uma utilização mais ativa dos modelos de machine learning já estabelecidos, uma vez que ele tem o conhecimento necessário para investigar as bases teóricas que fundamentam esses modelos.\nBaseado nisso, neste curso você terá uma visão teórica e principalmente prática passo a passo sobre os principais conceitos de Estatística, bem como sua ligação com a Ciência de Dados e a Aprendizagem de Máquina (Machine Learning). Você aprenderá a teoria, os cálculos passo a passo, implementará os cálculos utilizando a linguagem de programação Python e também utilizará bibliotecas prontas! O diferencial deste curso é que além de aprender estatística, você aprenderá como utilizá-la em aprendizagem de máquina. O conteúdo está dividido em nove partes: (i) população e amostra, (ii) dados relativos e absolutos, (iii) distribuição de frequência, (iv) medidas de posição e dispersão, (v) distribuições estatísticas, (vi) probabilidade, (vii) intervalos de confiança e testes de hipóteses, (viii) correlação e regressão e (ix) visualização. Confira abaixo alguns dos tópicos que você aprenderá, integrando os conceitos estatísticos com aprendizagem de máquina e ciência de dados:\nUso de amostragem para trabalhar com dados desbalanceados em classificação ou regressão (undersampling e oversampling)\nCálculos de distribuição de frequência para aplicação de regras de associação\nAvaliação de algoritmos de classificação utilizando medidas de posição e dispersão\nSeleção de atributos utilizando cálculos de variância\nPreenchimento de valores faltantes em bases de dados utilizando medidas de posição\nCálculo de padronização (z-score) aplicado em machine learning\nTratamento de dados enviesados em machine learning\nUso de distribuições estatísticas para inicialização de pesos em redes neurais artificiais\nAlgoritmo Naïve Bayes utilizando as distribuições de Bernoulli e Multinomial\nPrevisões com probabilidade em machine learning\nUso das técnicas ANOVA e Qui Quadrado para seleção de atributos em bases de dados\nTestes de hipóteses paramétricos e não paramétricos, aplicados na avaliação de algoritmos\nPrevisão do preço de casas utilizando regressão linear\nCriação de gráficos e mapas para ajudar na interpretação de dados\nEste é o curso ideal caso você queira aumentar significativamente seus conhecimentos em Estatística, Ciência de Dados e Machine Learning, mais de 160 aulas com exercícios resolvidos! O curso é para todos os níveis de conhecimento, ou seja, se você é iniciante ou de nível avançado conseguirá aproveitar o conteúdo.",

Essas técnicas também podem ser utilizadas para detectar praticamente qualquer tipo de objeto em imagens ou vídeos, como por exemplo: relógios, placas de veículos, animais, faces de pessoas, celulares, logo de empresas dentre vários outros! Em resumo, você pode treinar um classificador para qualquer tipo de cenário!\nE para levar você até essa área, neste curso você aprenderá na prática como construir classificadores personalizados para deteção de objetos, utilizando a linguagem Python e a técnica de haarcascade da biblioteca OpenCV! Você desenvolverá passo a passo dois classificadores para detectar canecas e logos de empresas! No decorrer do curso você também aprenderá as vantagens e desvantagens de utilizar essa técnica, bem como saberá quais são suas principais limitações. Além disso, você terá algumas aulas de bônus sobre o download automático de imagens e também sobre a coleta de imagens para o treinamento do detector.

      "description": "This course is tailored for the beginner and intermediate learners. NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which is a part of Computer Science, Human language, and Artificial Intelligence. It is the technology that is used by machines to understand, analyze, manipulate, and interpret human's languages. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) helps the machine to understand and analyze human language by extracting the metadata from content such as concepts, entities, keywords, emotion, relations, and semantic roles. Even though NLP is not a new domain, it catches attention of significant researches all over the world. Natural languages are usually used by human for verbal or written communication such as English, Marathi, Spanish etc. . NLP has its roots in 8th decade of previous century. It is branch of Artificial Intelligence which deals with processing of natural languages, specifically for some pragmatics. Its significance lies in applications developed by developers to make lives of common man easy and comfortable. Now a days this is one of the domain of research. There are typical phases of NLP such as morphological analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, discourse analysis, pragmatic analysis and phonological analysis if required in an application. This course is tailored for the beginner and intermediate learners. Welcome to the course!!! I will count on your active participation and feedback. Journey of course includes Introduction to NLP, Applications of NLP , Phases of NL, Syntax Analysis, Simple top down parser, bottom up chart parser, top down chart parser.",

Compared to their counterpart Data Structures, they provide many benefits, be it:\nFaster processing\nCompact memory usage\nEasy access to data elements, or\nSimpler operations with less coding effort\nTo give you some context, if you have worked on Pandas DataFrames, which is a special case of 2 Dimensional Arrays, you would know what different operations you can perform and how you can handle datasets more effectively. Well with Arrays you can do most of that and much more and for that very reason they are used as the preferred Data Containers to run Machine Learning algorithms (in Modules such as Scipy and Scikit-learn).\nTo simply put, \"A good command on Arrays will take your understanding of Data Structures and their use to the next level\", and this is exactly where this course comes in. Even if you've not worked on Arrays earlier, you can use this course to develop your understanding grounds-up.\nHere we cover, \"Arrays as Data Structures and how they get applied in Python\". Below are the key areas that this course addresses :\nIntuition of Arrays as Data Containers\nVisualizing 2D/3D and higher dimensional Arrays\nArray Indexing and Slicing - 2D/3D Arrays\nPerforming basic operations using Numpy Arrays\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to use Arrays in common data operations and data analysis. This will also give you a platform and confidence to quickly scale up to learn more advanced topics related to Numpy.",

It basically wishes your friend on their birthday using Instagram messager.\nThe structure of this course teaches you how to simulate web clicks using python. First, it teaches you how to open any url using python, then it shows how to simulate a login on Instagram, then sending messages on Instagram, and lastly teaching you how to read an Excel sheet using python. This course acts just as a guide and there are so many more things that you can do. For example, sending pictures/ videos using Instagram. Creating custom birthday messages, feel free to add your own features to this project. And if you like an extra challenge try creating one for other platforms for example Facebook or Linkedin!\nLibraries that I would be using in this course are Selenium ( for simulating web clicks), pandas ( to read an Excel sheet that basically acts as a database. You are also welcome to try different ways of storing your data for example using SQL. By the end of this course you would be able to gain a basic understanding of the Selenium library and pursue your own projects that simulate web clicks using Selenium.\nAnd please give me a rating as well, I would really appreciate it!",

O curso aborda alguns conceitos de Machine Learning com o objetivo de demonstrar algumas aplicações de Python em Machine Learning.\nTodas as aulas são explicadas passo a passo, aumentando o nível de dificuldade gradativamente e utilizando projetos reais para exemplificar as análises dos dados com profundidade, portanto, o curso é destinado tanto para iniciantes como para pessoas com conhecimentos prévios na linguagem Python e em análise de dados. Os projetos são trabalhados desde a aquisição dos conjuntos de dados no repositório de dados, até análises estatísticas descritivas detalhadas e criações de gráficos estruturados no Matplotlib, Seaborn e Plotly.\nO curso é dividido basicamente em quatro partes:\n1) Domínio do uso da linguagem Python, com o Google Colaboratory, desde os conceitos fundamentais até conceitos mais avançados para análise e manipulação de dados.\n2) Desenvolvimento de uma análise de um projeto real focado na limpeza, organização, estruturação, manipulação dos dados e análises estatísticas.\n3) Desenvolvimento de uma análise de outro projeto real focado na análise e criação de gráficos, aplicando anteriormente todo o tratamento aprendido no primeiro projeto.\n4) Conceitos básicos e criação de dois algoritmos simples de Machine Learning no Google Colaboratory.\nSão disponibilizados todos os slides das aulas teóricas, todos os scripts das aulas práticas no Python e todos os arquivos com os datasets.\nÉ um curso riquíssimo em informações e com explicações claras e objetivas, ilustrando o fantástico mundo da Linguagem Python para Análises de Dados. Uma observação importante: o curso não é Estático, isto é, qualquer necessidade apontada pelos alunos poderá ser acrescida ao curso e, sempre que tiver alguma alteração, atualização ou inclusão de conteúdo, todos serão comunicados por email.",
