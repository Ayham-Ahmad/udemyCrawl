      "description": "It’s been a few years since Marc Andreessen, the found of Mosaic and Netscape -  coined the phrase software is eating the world. But indeed it is true today.  , the idea that “every company needs to become a software company” is considered almost a cliché. No matter your industry, you’re expected to be reimagining your business to make sure you’re not the next local taxi company or hotel chain caught completely off guard by your equivalent of Uber or Airbnb.\nDoing business in the 21st century means embracing a world where software quite literally powers everything—from televisions to cars, and from social media to banking systems.\n\nIn the mean time Software development has seen a paradigm shift in the last few decades.\n\nFrom the beginning of computing era in the 1960s up to late 1990s, the software was built by relatively small teams. These teams used large monolithic software stacks to build relatively simple and smaller applications which were used by 1 to a few tens of people. These applications were deployed on a central network server which the users connected to via their terminals and used the application.\n\nThe current era is all about ubiquitous connectivity and ever increasing adoption of mobile computing. To cater to these demands - the modern mobile apps and web applications are reaching global scale and billions of users. These app and web applications are built by larger teams which are geographically distributed. They build those large applications by stitching together a collection of services, APIs or microservices.\n\nThese services use a variety of stacks and are independent of each other. The services run on clusters spanning thousands or tens of thousands of servers or nodes. And the consumers use these applications over the cloud and the public internet using their mobile, tablet and desktop devices.\n\nDeployment, management and operationalizing these large complex infrastructures is a daunting task. Containerization of the apps and services help to simplify these tasks. But even containers leave A bulk of administration tasks for deploying the latest application code, upgrading the servers, mapping the service end points, etc. to the user and DevOps engineers.\n\nWon't it be great if we were able to aggregate and combine all the computing power available to us in our datacenter and treat it as one large computer?\n\nWhat if we had a smart operating system which could manage our entire data center just like Linux or MacOS or Windows can manage our personal computers. Whether we are managing two virtual nodes or 10,000 Of them - Wouldn’t it be nice just to instruct our collection of servers or our datacenter – hey datacenter I want to run a web application and a database? Here is the code – and here are the commands to run these applications – please figure out which nodes can run these applications; deploy them and run them. By the way, if any of those nodes die – please make sure you move my application to another healthy node so that the end users do not experience any disruption.\nThen based on the requirement of a particular app, a scheduler can dynamically allocate resources to the application. This will make the whole system much more efficient. We will be able to free up resources and drive the utilization up. This methodology has all kinds of benefits from saved costs to more uptime of the application and less administrative overhead.\n\nThis is exactly what Docker, Apache Mesos, and DC/OS provide.\n\nDocker is open source engine that can help you automate the deployment of applications inside software containers. Is was released in March 2013 and has been gaining popularity ever since. It has over 100 million downloads, and over 75000 applications are running as dockerized applications – that is a LOT!\n\nApache Mesos is an open source cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications or frameworks.\n\nMesosphere DC/OS is an enterprise grade datacenter-scale operating system, providing a single platform for running containers, big data, and distributed apps in production.\n\nDC/OS is built on the Apache Mesos core and provides newer technology including the native container-orchestration, Marathon application platform, intuitive user interfaces and much much more.\n\nKnowledge and experience about Docker, Apache Mesos and DC/OS could be very valuable for your career. The latest stats and figures show some amazing numbers like jobs requiring these skill sets pay higher than most of the jobs posted on public job boards within the US and annual salaries for professionals could be as high as $120,000. That is the exact reason why you must enroll in this course and take your career to the next level.\nAs the title suggests – this course aims to provide you enough knowledge about Docker, Apache Mesos, and DC/OS so that you can run and operate your own data center using these components together. But specifically:\nYou will learn about containerization of apps, the plethora of benefits and leverages offered by containers and Docker.\nYou will also be able to able to install and run your Docker instances and run your containerized apps on it.\nWith the prospect of making software deployment faster and increase user reach, you will be able to employ DC/OS to manage your data centers better.\nYou will learn about running your application and services within DC/OS in a load balanced manner.\nYou will be able to install new services and packages to deploy complex applications within your DC/OS cluster\nYou will learn about administrative tasks and operational utilities you can use to manage your DC/OS cluster.\nUsing  Docker, Apache Mesos & DCOS you will be able to make your business operations effective and efficient. These tools will result in optimized resource utilization, automated self-healing and scalability and ultimately real and tangible cost savings.\nWith more effectiveness and efficiency, in turn, you will be able to muster depth, scalability, and expanse in your software/ App projects.",

      "description": "Many of you as network engineers have been requested to install a complete wireless network in a hotel, mall or exhibitions so the Wi-Fi covers the whole area to allow users to enjoy the wireless internet connectivity. In such a complex network, you require 10's and sometimes 100's of Wireless Access Points (APs) to provide the full coverage.\n\nThose APs require configuration to let them work, so if you have for example 100 APs to configure then you need to configure them one by one and this takes a lot of time.\nIn our case, we can use MikroTik CAPsMAN so all MikroTik AP's can be controlled from one device and all settings on the Wireless can be changed from the CAPsMAN MikroTik Router - and this is the mission of this course.\nIn this course, I will show you how you can connect all APs to the CAPsMAN and how you can control everything from the CAPsMAN itself. With a real LAB scenario, I will show you step by step how you can configure everything at the CAPsMAN then we will connect to the wireless and see that it is going to be working without any problem.\nTopics that will be covered in this course are:\nInitial Configuration on the CAPsMAN\nConnect the CAPs to the CAPsMAN with and without certificates\nCreate Channels in CAPsMAN\nCreate Security profiles in CAPsMAN\nCreate Configuration containers in the CAPsMAN\nCreate Datapaths in CAPsMAN\nMake Provisioning in the CAPsMAN\nConfigure VLAN's on CAPsMAN\nCreate Access lists\nMake a backup CAPsMAN for failover\nMikroTik CAPsMAN is very required and information about how to configure it is not very clear, so this course can be like a reference for you to understand in details with LABS how to make MikroTik CAPsMAN works.\nI hope that you will enjoy my course.",

      "description": "Did you know that you could infect your computer just by opening a pdf or microsoft office document? If that came as a shocker for you then you need to take this course. Documents are one of the main vector of attacks for malware authors because of their widespread use. Everyone uses documents to create reports, memos and articles. In fact everything we do for communication involves the use of documents. That is why this is a very popular way to infect computers. Documents are used as the first stage of a malware attack. Embedded in documents are scripts that will download a second stage payload consisting of additional malware, eg ransomware, remote access tools and more.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to check and analyze malicious pdf and office documents for signs of malicious artifacts and indicators of compromise. This is a beginners course and targeted to those who are absolutely new to this field. I will take you from zero to proficient level in analyzing malicious documents. You will learn using plenty of practical walk-throughs. We will learn the basic knowledge and skills in analyzing documents. All the needed tools and where to download them will be provided. By the end of this course, you will have the fundamentals of malware analysis of documents under your belt to further your studies in this field. Even if you do not intend to take up malware analysis as a career, still the knowledge and skills gained would enable you to check documents for dangers and protect yourself from these attacks.\n\n\nWe will use remnux and windows virtual machine. Remnux is a Debian-based linux distribution that contains all the necessary tools for malware analysis. Some background on linux would be helpful but not strictly necessary. We will also install document debuggers in a windows virtual machine. Then, I will show you how to get started with the very basic tools in remnux and windows. All the essential theory will be covered but kept to the minimum. The emphasis is on practicals and lab exercises.\nGo ahead and enroll now and I will see you inside.",

Shouldn't you find out why?\nI've been working in the hacking, cyber security, disaster recovery and business continuity industry since 1995.\nIn that time I've come across too many incidents of Trojans being installed on users' computers and allowing hackers into private networks and more importantly user's computers.\nThis course has been created to show you exactly how hackers use Trojans to infiltrate computers.\nThis course has been designed purely for information purposes only. In fact some material had to be blurred out and quite a bit of material had to be omitted as it was deemed too dangerous to include in this course.\nYou will learn what Trojans are. You will also be introduced to the different types of trojans and the types of damage they can do. Then you will be shown what remote administration tools are and will be shown how these are used by hackers. Discover how hackers create a \"Stub\", a small piece of code, that they then install secretly on unsuspecting user's computers. You will see first hand how these files are combined with legitimate files like picture files, pdf documents or any type of file that most users would not even suspect that a trojan has been installed.\nSee what hackers can do to a user's computer! Hackers gain complete access to an infected computer - open and close cd-rom drives, turn on or turn off computers, copy / delete / modify infected computer files, and even spy on the user's activity (webcam, recording audio, keystroke monitoring, desktop mirroring and much more!)\nThis course is strictly for information purposes and this course is purely to inform you of what hackers can do!

      "description": "It's not about the Knowledge, or Skills. But do you have the ability to use them in the real industry?\nThis course... gives you that much required ability!\nThere are many courses teaching basics of ethical hacking but this course will give you the actual professional know-how that you need to learn in order to do a real job or security testing project.\nGet answers to every single question you have related to the learning you do in this course including setting up Kali Linux, using VMware, basics of Linux, Nmap, Metasploit, privilege escalation, known vulnerabilities, SQL injections, pivoting, cracking passwords, and more topics that are added every month!\nLearn a real life published corporate methodology and prepare an Industry Grade Report. Unlike Traditional Education methods, more than 50% of the course is reserved exclusively for hands-on lab time.\nIf you are like me, you are reading more now because you want to know for sure whether this course is worth taking before you invest your money and time in it. More than 32,000 people have already completed the process of deciding to take this course and I hope sharing a few of their experiences can prove useful for you here. Here are what three recent students had to say in the reviews in their own words.\nThis Course Hops Directly Into Step By Step Pentesting Without Any Extra Long Talks by Sadaf Bhatti July 12, 2021.\nI like the ease with which the instructor takes you thru everything step by step. I have had some training but this was like a quick review with no extra long talking building up to it. He included basic commands and the background that is bare minimum required. I have a bit more to go but he is still building more lectures on firewalls and evasion so I'm looking forward to that and it was good to see burp suite and cms as part of this and now firewalls and anti-virus. I think as a security plus learner this was very good material range covered. Thank you.\nBrilliant Course with Extremely Wide Coverage of PenTesting Topics by Safak Keskin July 16, 2021.\nSo far I think this course is pretty brilliant as it provides and suggests many different tools to use, how to use them and how to elevate or improve the understanding or varieties and effectiveness on tools. I have yet to reach the pen testing chapters but so far so good. one down side for some users might be that they would need to do their own research on things like ports (TCP/IP UDP etc) functionalities and networking in general. a good place to look like be the network+ certificate pdfs that can be easily googled.\n5-Star Course Containing Clear Explanations & Engagement for Exactly What I Needed by Kamal Mohamed July 15, 2021.\nAmazing course, just what I was looking for, clear instruction and more engaging style... MOST USEFUL INFO ON UDEMY!! Must Enroll course!!\n\n\nIf you are still aren't sure, This One Last Review Should Give You A Clear Yes Or No!\n\nOne of The Best  & Most Realistic Courses to Start In This Field; Brilliant Methodology (Translated from Spanish) by Daniel González Aug 19, 2021\nThe way of explaining and the agenda created is very attached to the real world, so it will be one of the best courses to start in the field. Making mistakes and exposing them on video is excellent to know how to solve them and its methodology in my opinion has been the best I have taken.\nWhat you can see from reading these three reviews is that students love the way I teach things in a clear and engaging style, providing exactly what you need. The lectures themselves are helpful and will inspire you to try actually doing what you see I do. Then when you try to learn and have problems, you experience the greatest value of the course which is access to the instructor for help. You can ask anything related to the course and I will give you a thoughtful answer which will consistently help you solve the problems you are having in learning ethical hacking and penetration testing.\nThank you very much for reading so much of the description for this course! The fact that you have spent some of your very valuable time here already reading this course leads me to believe that you will enjoy being a student in the course a lot! Find the \"Buy Now\" or \"Play free preview\" button up on the page to give the course a try today!\n\nIf you want to know a bit more about what you are going to learn in this course, here's a deep list for you:-\nBuilding the Cyber Range\nThis section will teach you how to install VMware and what to do to create the virtual environment that contains both our hacker machine and the target labs. You also learn Basic Linux Terminal Commands that you will use often during the course.\n\n\nInformation Gathering\nStart hacking from this second section itself! Learn how to do advanced information gathering and reconnaissance in both active and passive modes as well as get the required templates and guides which explain you how to store the data which you have gathered in a professional way.\n\n\nVulnerability Analysis\nTake the data which was gathered in the previous section and use to it conduct vulnerability assessments. Learn to Identify, Analyze and Rank Vulnerabilities in a pure manual way and then leverage the power of automated tools like Nessus, Vega and Nmap to do things automatically for you and generate awesome reports that your clients will love! All configurations of these automated tools are shown in the exact way you would do it in a real business environment.\n\n\nExploitation\nExploit the found vulnerabilities and Gain access to your first target machine in the course! First understand how the whole hacking process including Footprinting, Scanning and Enumeration fits into hacking a single target and then Learn how to use Metasploit Framework to ease the process of exploitation for you but also without neglecting the way to exploit things manually.\n\n\nWebsite Hacking\nFor the first time in the course, Go specifically deep into hacking Web Technologies, Applications and Servers. Understand how a website can be hacked and what's the full process to do it. Start by exploiting web technologies in a lab where you need to hack a CMS and then in another lab where you would do it for normal applications. During the process, learn various tools like WhatWeb, Uniscan, Skipfish, Dirb, Wpsan, THC Hyrda, Burp Suite, Metasploit in-depth.\nNext, learn how to beat the security of custom websites having specific vulnerabilities like SQL Injection,  Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Unrestricted File Uploads, Command Injection and Brute Forcing.\nFinally, learn what to do for hacking the whole web server, sitting behind the scenes. Be able to exploit the web services and abuse risky HTTP PUT and DELETE method operations to gain a graphical shell access to the server.\n\n\nNetwork PenTesting\nUnderstand the Core of Network Services Penetration Testing and learn the professional methodology to do a full network test for a client. Get to know about discovering live hosts, scanning TCP and UDP ports, enumerating the network services, identifying vulnerabilities and exploiting them in many ways in order to gain access to the target.\nAlso, Learn Post Exploitation with and without Metasploit Framework as well as know many manual methods to do privilege escalation on a target, to move from a standard user access to a full root/admin level shell!\n\n\nSecurity Controls Evasion -\nLearn how to evade scan time and runtime antiviruses for lifetime using the little-known secret techniques I have for this purpose as well as to bypass firewalls / IDS / IPS and other security systems which prove to be an obstacle to you as a hacker with the use of tools such as Nmap.\n\n\nIndustry Grade Report Writing -\nSee how I organize my penetration testing notes properly in a project database and how you can use this method too for making the next step: Writing the Report easier than ever!\nLearn how a REAL PENTEST REPORT looks like that is Industry Grade, Professional and Clear. In other words, a report which can easily be used in an expensive world-class penetration test. You will also get the template in its editable form so that you can experiment on it too.\nAfter enrolling, you get unlimited lifetime access to this course which already has 10+ hours of instructional hacking HD video tutorials sharing everything you need to be a penetration testing expert and professional ethical hacker!\nPlus, When I learn something new I add it to the course - at no additional cost to you! This is a course that will continue to add more and more to every aspect of your life. If you are still not sure, here are three questions you can use to make the final decision!\nDo you want to learn how to penetrate networks, exploit computers, test websites and bypass antiviruses and firewalls?\nWhat if you can experience the fun of working from home and earning money by helping companies to test their security and suggesting them measures to strengthen their security?\nHow would you feel if you could become the special person in the room with knowledge of cyber security about which nobody else knows as much as you? Or would you like applying this skillset to what you already know to greatly advance your present career if you are a system administrator, network specialist or freelancer online?\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, I would guess based on my experience teaching 50,000+ students on Udemy that you might enjoy this course. If for any reason I am wrong, you have 30 days to ask Udemy for a refund. I can guess the odds of you enjoying this course are very high! Thank you very much for reading all of this!

These are the hackers and crackers who cross lines and get away with it.\nIt's been around for a long time. There are entire generations of hackers that merely know how to utilize exploits; So what is an exploit?\nIn the security software industry, an exploit is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized).\nIn simple terms: A vulnerability is a bug in code that can be triggered by an attacker and an exploit is the method used to trigger the bug.\nA vulnerability on its own is just a potential risk. It must be exploited before it becomes a problem. For example, having your car broken into is not good, but having your car broken into and then your laptop stolen is very bad indeed.\nThis course teaches you the basics of exploits and how to apply them (to Ubuntu Linux). It is a beginners course and requires no programming knowledge (we won't do programming in this course). You will apply some exploits, one of which will even make you a root user (administrator) on Ubuntu Linux 20.04.",

It uses a link state routing algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols, operating within a single autonomous system.\nI have used GNS3 tool to run all of the Labs in OSPF- It's very easy for you to Practice and rehearse all of its Labs.\nI have added over 20 lectures in this - Almost covered all of its aspects. Good Thing is I will be adding more videos and lectures so that Students get the complete Benefit out of this.\nThis course is over 3 hours. It has been structured well so that you will slowly move On towards more complex Labs.\nYou would find OSPF being used in Most of the Banks and Companies due to its Hierarchical structure and area based approach and which makes it complex protocol.\nBut It has been made EASY now.

This includes your computer, your network, your programs, and your data. There are a lot of different ways to do this, from using strong passwords to installing security software. But the most important thing is to be aware of the latest threats and to take steps to protect yourself.\nFor example, you should use strong passwords that are different for each account. You should also be careful about what links you click on and what emails you open. And you should install and keep up to date with security software.\nCyber security awareness is all about knowing how to protect yourself from cyber threats. It's important for everyone, from individuals to businesses to governments, to be cyber security aware.\nThere are many different ways to improve your cyber security awareness. You can take training courses, read online resources, or even just talk to your friends and family about cyber security.\nOne of the most important things you can do to improve your cyber security awareness is to be careful about what you click on. Don't click on links in emails or on websites unless you're sure they're safe. And make sure you have strong passwords for all of your accounts.\nIn the rapidly evolving digital landscape, cyber security plays a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive information and systems from malicious threats. As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, professionals with expertise in cybersecurity are in high demand. Completing a comprehensive cyber security course equips individuals with the necessary skills to tackle diverse challenges, from network security and ethical hacking to penetration testing and information security. Ethical hacking and penetration testing are ethical approaches to identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening defenses. Certification programs like CISSP, CompTIA Security+, and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) validate one's proficiency in this field. Familiarity with tools like Kali Linux and Cisco CCNA also adds value to a cyber security specialist's repertoire. Furthermore, being aware of cyber security risks and the dark web is essential, along with mastering security operations, web security, and social engineering techniques. The continuous pursuit of knowledge in this domain ensures the establishment of robust cyber security measures for organizations and individuals alike.\nCyber security awareness is an ongoing process. By staying informed about the latest cyber security threats and best practices, you can help to keep yourself and your organization safe.\nIn this master course, I would like to teach the 7 major topics:\n1. Introduction and importance of cyber security and cyber security awareness\n2. Types, layers and stages of cyber security\n3. How to create a cyber security awareness among the organization\n4.Cyber security in Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and SAP\n5. Cyber security analyst skills and how to become a cyber security analyst\n6.

      "description": "Welcome to the world’s one of the most advance course on Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking. Everyone is trying to learn How to design website or how to build networks or products. But you are different from others; you have chosen a path where you will learn to protect those products from intrusion of Hackers. We would like to salute your decision.\n\nAttacks by Hackers are not a new story now days, you hear about it every other day. And the reason is obvious; no one bothers about security. Think about the last web development course that talks about SQL Injection or XSS attack. When you learn about Information security and that too at such a practical level, you can offer your skills to big and small companies get hired there or work as a free lancer. This penetration-testing course also talks about getting payment via BUG BOUNTIES too.\nEvery major company like Google, Apple, PayPal etc. have a security division which requires security experts like you, not even an official degree is required for it. All they ask for is your skills that this covers up. World require so many security professionals but we are not able to produce even the fractions of requirement.\nThis course is designed very carefully so that everyone can learn from it, even non-programmers. Also this course is very crisp in covering topics, this means we will not be wasting 3-4 hours just on installation or learning jargon terms.\nMac, Linux or Windows is not at all a problem. We only use tools that are cross platform. Our strategy is to take students from all operating system and merge them on same platform like Kali Linux and Parrot OS, so that it gives best learning experience.\nWe will introduce you to most advance topics in Pentesting as well as teach you that how you can learn by yourself, without reading any book or taking any course in future. Along with course, we will point you towards dedication and free resources that will make you subject expert.\nAlso we will install our custom vulnerable test beds and attack on them. This will   washes out the worry of legal issues. Also there are few challenges for you that will push you little hard to use your capabilities at the fullest.\nJump in the course and Welcome to the world of Information Security, Penetration Testing, Ethical hacking and Bug Bounties\nImportant note: Support of windows XP is dropped by Microsoft, we have used it in few lectures. Regardless, you can either skip those couple lectures or just watch them, as concept goes same.",

      "description": "If you like playing games or reverse engineering, then this course is for you.\nTraditionally, reverse engineering has been done using familiar tools such as x64dbg, OllyDbg and IDA. This course will introduce you to another powerful tool commonly used in game hacking - called Cheat Engine (CE).  This tool will allow you to modify in-game Health, Ammo, Position and more.\nAlthough youtube has plenty of tuts on Cheat Engine, they typically lack beginner-friendly explanation and personal guidance. In this course, I will take you by the hand as a complete beginner to become familiar with what is game hacking and reverse engineering. You will learn the difference between memory values vs. pointers, data structures, how to scan memory to tamper with it to become invincible plus have unlimited ammo, create Cheat Tables (shareable hacks), pointer scanning, writing scripts to inject code into process memory and more...\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to apply your basic skills to hack an open source free game called Assault Cube - a 3D First Person Shooter (FPS) game. I have chosen this game because, it can be used as a standalone game - where you play against bots - and also because the game is totally free  and open source - and is the standard game to use when first learning game hacking.\nDifference between memory hacking and file patching.\nIn traditional reverse engineering, after we have managed to reverse it, we would patch the program file. However, not all programs can be patched, eg, packed programs cannot be patched. Here, Cheat Engine shines. Cheat Engine does not rely on patching programs, its main strength lies in memory hacking (process hacking). In Cheat Engine, we allow the program to be loaded into RAM memory first, then we hack it there. This course introduces you to the basics of Cheat Engine - so that you will be familiar with memory hacking using Cheat Engine.\nThroughout this course, I will be there for you - to answer all your questions and to guide and mentor you in game hacking and reverse engineering. Thank you and see you inside.",

      "description": "What is SD-WAN ?  Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) is an overlay architecture that overcomes the biggest drawbacks of traditional  WAN. SD-WAN builds a secure, unified connectivity over any transport (MPLS, Broadband, LTE, VSAT etc.) and provides simplified operations with centralized management, policy control and application visibility  across the enterprise.\nSignificance of Viptela\nThe Most Deployed SD-WAN in Global 1000 Companies . With SD-WAN built on the Viptela Fabric, enterprises can provide secure connectivity everywhere, deploy new services and applications faster, and drastically simplify operational complexity in the WAN.\nIn this course you will find explanation of Viptela controllers and nice and easy way to learn core components of SDWAN.\n\n\nSD-WAN is a software-defined approach to managing the WAN.\nKey advantages include:\nReducing costs with transport independence across MPLS, 4G/5G LTE, and other connection types.\nImproving application performance and increasing agility.\nOptimizing user experience and efficiency for software-as-a-service (SaaS) and public-cloud applications.\nSimplifying operations with automation and cloud-based management.\n\n\nWhy now for SD-WAN?\nThe traditional WAN\nThe traditional WAN (wide-area network) function was to connect users at the branch or campus to applications hosted on servers in the data center. Typically, dedicated MPLS circuits were used to help ensure security and reliable connectivity. This doesn't work in a cloud-centric world.\nToday's IT challenges\nTimes have changed. As businesses adopt the use of SaaS and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) applications in multiple clouds, IT is realizing that the user application experience is poor. That is because WANs designed for a different era are not ready for the unprecedented explosion of WAN traffic that cloud adoption brings. That traffic causes management complexity, application-performance unpredictability, and data vulnerability.\nFurther, opening the enterprise to the Internet and the cloud exposes major threat and compliance issues. It is extremely challenging to protect the critical assets of an enterprise when applications are accessed by a diverse workforce, including employees, partners, contractors, vendors, and guests. Enabling broadband on the WAN makes the security requirements more acute, creating challenges for IT in balancing user experience, security, and complexity.\nThe new WAN\nNew business models drive the need for a new network model.\nSD-WAN addresses the current IT challenges. This new approach to network connectivity can lower operational costs and improve resource usage for multisite deployments. Network administrators can use bandwidth more efficiently and can help ensure high levels of performance for critical applications without sacrificing security or data privacy.\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of SD-WAN?\nThe traditional WAN architecture was limited to enterprise, branch, and data center. Once an organization adopts cloud-based applications in the form of SaaS and IaaS, its WAN architecture experiences an explosion of traffic accessing applications distributed across the globe.\n\nThese changes have multiple implications for IT. Employee productivity may be compromised by SaaS-application performance problems. WAN expenses can rise with inefficient use of dedicated and backup circuits. IT fights a daily, complex battle of connecting multiple types of users with multiple types of devices to multiple cloud environments.\n\nWith SD-WAN, IT can deliver routing, threat protection, efficient offloading of expensive circuits, and simplification of WAN network management. Business benefits can include the following:\nBetter application experience\nHigh availability, with predictable service, for all critical enterprise applications\nMultiple hybrid active-active links for all network scenarios\nDynamically routed application traffic with application-aware routing, for efficient delivery and improved user experience\nImproved OpEx, replacing expensive Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) services with more economical and flexible broadband (including secure VPN connections)\nMore security\nApplication-aware policies with end-to-end segmentation and real-time access control\nIntegrated threat protection enforced at the right place\nSecure traffic across broadband Internet and into the cloud\nDistribute security to the branch and remote endpoints with NGFW, DNS security, and NGAV\nOptimized cloud connectivity\nSeamless extension of the WAN to multiple public clouds\nReal-time optimized performance for Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, and other major SaaS applications\nOptimized workflows for cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure\nSimplified management\nA single, centralized, cloud-delivered management dashboard for configuration and management of WAN, cloud, and security\nTemplate-based, zero-touch provisioning for all locations: branch, campus, and cloud\nDetailed reporting of application and WAN performance for business analytics and bandwidth forcasting",

You may have heard that Cisco is refactoring their certification program, and with it the 200-310 exam will be retired.\nThe CCDA certification was retired February 24th, 2020. This course still contains valid information, however the exam that this course was created to prepare for is no longer available from Cisco.\n\n\nThe CCDA adds design theory and best practice information on top of the CCNA level of knowledge to allow you to not only maintain devices in a network but design new networks. Study time for the CCDA is expected to be ~2-4 weeks.\nSo you have plenty of time! Get your CCDA and add that certification under your belt because employers are looking for it!\n\n\n**June 2023 Update: technical fixes to course lectures for audio and video**\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest and happy learning!",

When I started in Cybersecurity I had nowhere to turn. I created this course for the person who wants to take their first step or the next step in becoming a Cyber Security Professional.\n\n\nActive directory! This is becoming a hot topic within the world of ethical hacking due to the recent change in the OSCP exam. If you are looking to gain the ability to confidently enumerate and exploit active directory this will be the place for you to start. We will exploit three AD systems and cover the most common tools used.\nBuffer Overflow! Fear no more. We will cover the buffer overflow with ONLY the information that is need to perform the exploit. Many courses make buffer overflow seem scary by giving WAY more information than what is needed. In this course we will exploit the buffer overflow and it will be easy. Become confident in exploiting buffer overflows!\n\n\nThis course is designed to be highly practical with lots of hands on practice to obtain and become confident in the skills you are learning.\n\n\nWe will start by enumerating and finding vulnerabilities in Web Applications. These skills are very relevant in all areas of cyber security. We will cover all the most common web vulnerabilities including those that lead to Remote Code Execution. Then we will turn to network enumeration. This is when we will begin gaining access to the vulnerable servers. We will learn to gain access to the servers through network enumeration and through vulnerable web applications.",

We will not hack at the operating system (OS) level, but instead on the application level. This is not a WiFi hacking course, instead what you learn in this course is hacking computers inside the network. If you have computers in your network, they most likely can be hacked.\nIt's recommended that you have some Linux knowledge before starting this course. You should have Kali Linux at hands. Kali Linux is a Linux system that has many Computer Security and Ethical Hacking tools. Some of these tools are command-line only and others are full desktop apps.

The process is designed to identify and mitigate any potential threats. This hands-on process enables analysts to understand malware functionality, purpose, and potential impact. To achieve this, security teams use malware analysis tools. They typically rate and score specific malware samples in a closed environment called a sandbox.\nMalware analysis is the study or process of determining the function, origin, and potential impact of a particular malware sample, such as a virus, worm, Trojan horse, rootkit, or backdoor. Malware, or malicious software, is any computer software designed to impair the operation of a host computer, steal a system, or steal sensitive data from a user, organization, or company. Malware may include software that collects user information without permission.\nIn this course you will learn the basics of malware analysis. It's a course for total beginners, not for people already familiar with cyber security concepts. If you are interested in Cyber Security, but don't know where to start, this course is for you. You will learn the basics of malware analysis. Given any file, you will be able to say if it is potential malware or not. You will understand how virus scanners find malware.",

      "description": "If you have been using debuggers to reverse engineer programs but wished you had more understanding of Assembly Language, then this course is for you. We will cover enough assembly language to allow you to understand how to modify exe files to insert your own code or, to modify existing exe files to do things which it was not intended to do.\nTraditionally, assembly language programming is taught using an assemblers like NASM or FASM. But learning it that way will not give you the skills to understand reverse engineered programs. There is a missing link (knowledge gap) of how to apply your assembly knowledge to modify programs. This course fills that knowledge gap.\nInstead of using an assembler, we will directly use the x64dbg debugger to learn assembly language. That is right, we will write our own assembly code inside the x64dbg debugger itself.  You will learn Assembly Language from the ground up with zero knowledge as a complete beginner.\nWe will use techniques that allow you to:\n\n\nmodify existing code\noverwrite existing code\nmodify memory segments to insert data\ncreate new functions\nexploit code caves\nadd new functionality to existing programs\nand more...\n\n\nThis black art is not widely taught and there are no existing courses elsewhere that puts together coherently all the knowledge of assembly and reverse engineering. Mostly what you will find are separate courses on Assembly and Reverse Engineering. Many courses on Reverse Engineering don't cover the background assembly language from a software hacker's perspective. And almost all Assembly Language courses teach you how to write programs from scratch, instead of how to modify existing programs to add new functionality with your own code using a debugger like x64dbg.\n\n\nThe knowledge you gain will be your added advantage either as a security researcher, or, malware analyst, or student of software security. It will also benefit programmers who want to know how programs run internally and how to extend program functionality if you do not have the source code.\n\n\nGo ahead and enroll now and I will see you inside!",

involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing on Udemy:\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results\nRequirements\nCPU: 64-bit Intel i5/i7 (4th generation +) - x64

This is specifically catered to anyone who is interested in or is learning cybersecurity, especially if you are scared of coding! A good number of software vulnerabilities have \"input validation and error handling\" as mitigation and by the time you are done with my course, you will fully understand what that means.\n\n\nAlso, there is no way that you can actually learn python without coding and building your own things. This is why I have several coding exercises ready for you to do! Although I do encourage you to do something on your own that you are capable of each step of the way. Don't be scared to run into walls because only them can you send them crashing down!\n\n\nI also have another course called \"Cybersecurity Prep Course for Absolute Beginners\" so please do check that out if you are trying to get into cybersecurity as well.\nWhy do I take this approach to teach Python? One thing is that unless a program is interactive it is boring. Another thing is that most applications, especially ones that are attacked, are interactive. User input is one of the most popular ways to exploit a program. You will learn exactly why that is.\nYou may have also heard of an API. You will learn exactly what this is and we will be using Python to interact with it. This will allow you to understand the security concepts behind this. This is vital given that most web applications use at least one third-party API for things like handling payments, sending text messages or emails, etc.\n\n\nFinally, I will show you the low level of how servers work because we are going to code our very own by teaching you how to use the sockets library!!",

Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing :\n\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The

After taking this course, you will have a better understanding of the approaches (reverse engineering, exploit development) that bug hunters use to find security vulnerabilities. You will learn how to exploit Buffer Overflows on Windows systems. This is an initial course and begins from the very basics of exploitation and is beginner-friendly.\nThe difficulty is that most IT professionals do not have the general software development background required to begin the subject of buffer overflow. This course cuts down the technical subjects of computer memory management, controlling code, and data inside of a working program, and exploiting poor quality software into terms that IT people with no software development knowledge can understand.\n\n\nA buffer overflow is a popular software coding error that an intruder could use to take control over your system. To efficiently decrease buffer overflow vulnerabilities, it is necessary to understand what buffer overflows are, what threats they act to your applications, and what methods attackers use to successfully exploit these vulnerabilities.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to use different tools such as Immunity Debugger, Mona library for Immunity Debugger, Metasploit, msfvenom, Spike, File Fuzz and much more. This course is intended to be practical.\n\n\nIn this course, we will answer the following questions:\nWhat is Buffer Overflow?\nHow do buffer overflow attacks work?\nHow to find buffer overflow vulnerabilities?\nHow to write a buffer overflow exploit?\n\n\nSyllabus:\nReverse engineering.\nFuzzing applications.\nUsing a debugger to examine the crash.\nIdentifying error conditions using debugging.\nTargeting the EIP register.\nIdentifying bad characters.\nLocating the vulnerable module.\nCreating final exploit code.\nExploit development.\nGain Remote Code Execution on Windows.\n\n\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 10 hours.\n\n\nNOTE: This course is created for educational purposes only.",

      "description": "Welcome to this most comprehensive course on Ethical Hacking. Hacking is not always a rewarding activity but it is one of the most fun profession where you can use your knowledge to make yours and others system secured. This course will try to turn you into a person who can check for the vulnerability in the system and make your own payload to pen-test that system and evaluate proper security measures that needs to be adopted. We'll try to make payloads and test systems from section one, Thus this course is highly practical. We (Bit4Stack Tech Inc.) assumes that you have no prior knowledge in these topics, So we will provide some theory related to networking at the beginning and hands on examples with it.\nWe will cover three modules in this course. Every module will have rich contents related to Hacking. First module covers about Kali Linux and its Hacking Applications. We will go through most of the applications that are available in Kali Linux like airodump-ng, mitmf, wireshark, veil framework, beef framework and lots more. Second module covers Python programming and pen testing machines with it. First of all we will learn about basics of python and we will make applications like mac changer, port scanner and crawler with python. We will have dedicated section to write malware and backdoor with python. Third module covers about JavaScript and its use in web pen-testing. We will make our own payload to find vulnerability in test and live websites. Attacks like XSS, URL redirection, HTML Injection and Host Header Injection.\nHighlights of Course:\nKali Linux:\nLinux Commands\nBasic File System commands\nUpgrade packaging commands\npermission commands\nInstalling Victim and Hacker Machine in Virtual Box\nInstalling test windows 10 on Virtual Box\nInformation Gathering\nUsing netdiscover and nmap to uncover IP addresses and mac addresses\nWPA/WPS attacks\nUsing airodump-ng to sniff packets\nUsing Handshake protocols\nUsing aireplay-ng to deauth clients\nMan In the Middle Framework\nARP Spoofing\nPlugins to take screenshot and inject js-url and jskeylogger\nWireShark\nAnalyzing packets flow\nVeil Framework\nCreating undetectable backdoor\nCreate reverse shell\nBeef Framework\nBrowser Exploitation\nRunning multiple Hook commands\nPython:\nPython Crash Course\nVariable and Statements\nValues and types\nFlow controls\nFunctions\nObject Oriented Programming\nRegular Expression\nThreading and many more..\nPort Scanner and Nmap\nScan for IP, mac addresses and Open Port of machine\nUDP, TCP and Comprehensive scan\nMac changer\nUsing subprocess\nWriting a Keylogger\npynput keylogger\npyperclip keylogger\nWriting a Malware and Backdoor\nUndetectable backdoor and malware\nCaptures screenshot, Locks PC, Opens Web browser, Hijacks Saved Passwords\nHack cmd of window client\nWriting a web Crawler\nWrite crawler to find subdomains and links\nUsing BeautifulSoup\nJavaScript:\nIntroduction to BurpSuite\nBurpsuite: Repeater, Audit and Crawl, Intruder\nCross Site Scripting Attacks\nMake custom payloads\nHijack Events\nrun multiple payloads to test for XSS in live websites\nURL Redirection\nURL Path Fragment\nURL path redirection\nHTML injection\nHost Header Injection\nXML External Entity attack\nAnonymous:\nTOR network\nHost .onion website\nVPN\nProxy Chains\nMac Changer\nand many more!\nMisc topics:\nBasics of network hacking / penetration testing.\nChanging MAC address & bypassing filtering.\nNetwork mapping.\nARP Spoofing - redirect the flow of packets in a network.\nSpying on any client connected to the network - see usernames, passwords, visited urls ....etc.\nInject code in pages loaded by any computer connected to the same network.\nReplace files on the fly as they get downloaded by any computer on the same network.\n\n\nPython/JavaScript:\nCreate malware for Windows, OS X and Linux.\nHack Windows, OS X and Linux using custom backdoor.\nBypass Anti-Virus programs.\nUse fake login prompt to steal credentials.\nDisplay fake updates.\nUse own keylogger to spy on everything typed on a Windows or OS X computer.\nLearn the basics of website hacking / penetration testing.\nDiscover subdomains.\nDiscover hidden files and directories in a website.\nDiscover and exploit XSS vulnerabilities, XXE and HTMLI.\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nAll tutorials and videos have been made using our own routers, servers, websites and other resources, they do not contain any illegal activity.

We look at all media types starting with twisted pair, power line, radio frequency up to internet protocol.\nOnce we understand the media types, we take a closer look at the various components and device types. We take a look at sensors, actuators and system components.\nIn order for a KNX network to function at all, we first have to get an overview of the topology, i.e. the network structure. Therefore we devote a separate section to topology.\nAs soon as the topology is understood, we can already look at the digital structure of KNX. This includes physical addresses, group addresses and communication objects.\nNow that we have an overview of the KNX protocol, we start working together in the ETS5. First we get an overview of the different functions. Later in the course, we then parameterize all the important functions together in the ETS5 and then test them live on devices.",

      "description": "web enumeration is a techniques hackers use when targeting web servers and web sites. When attempting to hack an application with a vulnerabilty, you first have to find out what files, subdomains or directories the applications are vulnerable to. On top of that, you may find hidden files that could give you access to the file server. Perhaps you can access SSH keys, pdfs or find hidden directories. It might be there is a vulnerable app running on one of the sub domains. There are many ways the server could be accessible and web enumeration is the first step.\nIn this course you will learn how to scan for directories, files, subdomains but also how to scan blogs made with wordpress for vulnerabilities. While you can do manual scanning, that quickly becomes cumbersome. In this course we explain how you can do automated scans on your target server.\nThis is a beginners course for those interested in Ethical Hacking or Cyber Security. You don't need any prior knowledge when doing this course, but you should have Kali Linux at hands. Kali Linux is a computer system that contains many hacking tools, sometimes it's simply called Kali. It can be downloaded for free as a Live USB or Virtualbox image, there's also a cloud option. While you can install the tools manually, there are so many hacking tools that it's easier to use a dedicated Linux system like Kali.",

The course is based on our years of experience of breaking Windows and AD environments and research.\nWhen it comes to AD security, there is a large gap of knowledge which security professionals and administrators struggle to fill. Over the years, I have taken numerous world trainings on AD security and always found that there is a lack of quality material and specially, a lack of good walkthrough and explanation.\nThe course simulate real world attack and defense scenarios and we start with a non-admin user account in the domain and we work our way up to enterprise admin. The focus is on exploiting the variety of overlooked domain features and not just software vulnerabilities.\nWe cover topics like AD enumeration, tools to use, domain privilege escalation, domain persistence, Kerberos based attacks (Golden ticket, Silver ticket and more), ACL issues, SQL server trusts, and bypasses of defenses.\nAttacking and Hacking Active Directory With Kali Linux Full Course - Read Team Hacking Pentesting",

Get alerts for unauthorized configuration changes.\nPhysical & Virtual Server Monitoring Monitor Windows, Linux, Unix, VMware, Hyper-V & Xen servers for CPU, Memory & Disk utilization. Also, monitor Windows services, TCP services, processes, events and more.\nFirewall Log Management Collect, archive and analyze firewall logs for security and compliance. Monitor and edit firewall policies to track user behavior and enhance network security.\nIP Address & Switch Port Management Manage IP addresses (IPv4 & IPv6) and Switch Ports for space, availability and history.\nApplications Monitoring Ensures high uptime and optimal performance of business-critical applications, both within the data center and on the cloud. Provides monitoring support for popular applications and their underlying infrastructure components from a single monitoring console\n\n\nHow Can I Monitor My Network?\nThe first step in getting started with your network monitoring is to identify which devices need to be monitored. You’ll also want to decide on what performance metrics you’ll be measuring.\nHere are some baseline metrics you’ll want to monitor:\nBandwidth usage: You’ll want your network to be sending as much data as it can without being overloaded. Your network monitoring tool can identify how much bandwidth is typically used versus how much is currently being used.\nThroughput: This measures the percentage of data packets that are actually being sent.\nLatency: This is the time it takes between requesting data and receiving that data. Performance issues can be almost too small to recognize, so it’s important to have a monitoring tool in place.\nPacket loss: This is the number of data packets that are lost during data transmissions.\nRetransmission: This is a measure of how often data packets are lost and need to be retransmitted to complete a request for data.\nNetwork availability/Uptime: This lets you know if your network is currently available. Your network monitoring tools can alert you when the network goes down, and how often.\nConnectivity: You’ll want to make sure your network connection is operating at top performance at all times.\n3 Benefits of Network Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring of your network helps you to troubleshoot not just hard failures but slowdowns as well. Metrics such as throughput, latency, packet reordering, and jitters can be used to measure your network's health.\nTroubleshooting issues early ensures business continuity and fewer or no downtimes, including network monitoring benefits like:\n1. Identifying Issues Anywhere in the Network\nNetwork monitoring and assessment is a way to quickly locate a problem in the network. Monitoring your network's performance can show you the cause and source of a network problem, where and when it occurred. It can also tell you who needs to fix it. When you actively monitor your network, you can detect any performance changes that could be problematic to users before they occur.\n2. Better Use of IT Resources with Network Monitoring\nIT teams are feeling more burnt out as a result of the pandemic. With 72% of IT professionals having taken on new responsibilities since the outset of the pandemic, a network outage could be a productivity killer. For example, an under-resourced IT manager would be required to divert attention from one business critical project to another with little notice or preparation.\nThe tools in network monitoring systems reduce manual work for IT teams. This gives back valuable time to an IT team to instead allocate to more critical projects.\n3. Providing Historical and Baseline Data with Network Monitoring\nWith the availability of baseline data, network monitoring tools can continually and automatically compare data. In case of performance degradation, an alert is sent to you, and you can immediately solve the problem. Historical data gives you a comparison point to determine optimal network performance or identify poor performance. It enables you to troubleshoot network problems of past events.\n\n\nPS: Check the Free Preview videos to know more about the course and to be sure you can get accustomed to my accent\n\n\nOPManager Plus Training Course includes:\n7:30 hours of practical and condensed knowledge\nImmediate access to the entire collection of videos and files\nQ&A support\nDownloadable installation Media\nValuable links and resources\nFAQ:\nQ: Can I download OPManager training files?\nYes.

Hence, network monitoring is very crucial for any business. Today, networks span globally, having multiple links established between geographically separated data centers, public and private clouds. This creates multifold challenges in network management. Network admins need to be more proactive and agile in monitoring network performance. However, this is easier said than done.\nIntroducing ManageEngine OpManager, an easy-to-use, and affordable network monitoring solution. It monitors network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, wireless LAN controllers, servers, VMs, printers, storage devices, and everything that has an IP and is connected to the network. ManageEngine OpManager continuously monitors the network and provides in-depth visibility and control over it. In case of a fault, you can easily drill down to the root cause and eliminate it before operations are affected.\nMost IT shops use multiple network monitoring tools to monitor and manage network operations.

      "description": "Welcome to this comprehensive Ethical Hacking course! This course assumes you have no prior knowledge in hacking and cyber networking, and by the end of it, you'll be able to hack systems like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts.\n\n\nThis course is efficient and practical but won't neglect the theory. We'll start with ethical hacking basics, break down the different penetration testing fields, and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X). We'll dive straight into hacking. You'll learn everything by example, by analyzing and exploiting different systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites, etc., so we'll never have any boring dry lectures.\n\n\nThe course is divided into several sections, each covering a penetration testing/hacking field, networking protocols, and network security. In each section, you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to practically exploit these weaknesses to hack into this system. Not only that, but you'll also learn how to secure systems from the discussed attacks. By the end of the course, you will have a strong foundation in most hacking or penetration testing fields.\n\n\nTo learn hacking, it is most important to know network security and protocols.\n\n\nThe course is divided into four main sections:\n\n\n1. Network Hacking: This section will teach you how to test the security of both wired and wireless networks. First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub-sections:\n- Pre-connection attacks: Learn several attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without needing the network password. You'll learn how to gather information about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections (deny/allow devices from connecting to networks).\n- Gaining Access: Learn how to crack the key and get the password to your target network, whether it uses WEP, WPA, or WPA2.\n- Post Connection attacks: Learn several powerful techniques that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices.\n\n\n2. Gaining Access: Learn two main approaches to gaining full control or hacking computer systems:\n- Server-Side Attacks: Gain full access to computer systems without user interaction. Learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as its operating system, open ports, and installed services. Discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities and exploit them to gain full control over the target.\n- Client-Side Attacks: Learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without realizing it, through techniques like hijacking software updates or backdooring downloaded files. Learn how to use social engineering to hack into secure systems.\n\n\n3. Post Exploitation: Learn how to interact with the systems you have compromised so far. Access the file system (read/write/upload/execute), maintain your access, spy on the target (capture keystrokes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots, etc.), and even use the target computer as a pivot to hack other systems. Learn about sniffing, spoofing, scanning, and phishing.\n\n\n4. Website/Web Application Hacking: Learn how websites work, how to gather information about a target website, and how to discover and exploit vulnerabilities to hack into websites, including file upload, code execution, local file inclusion, remote file inclusion, and SQL injection.\n\n\nAt the end of each section, you will learn how to detect, prevent, and secure systems and yourself from the discussed attacks.\n\n\nAll the techniques in this course are practical and work against real systems. You'll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you'll learn how to use it to hack into the target system. By the end of the course, you'll be able to modify these techniques to launch more powerful attacks and adapt them to suit different situations and scenarios.\n\n\nWith this course, you'll get 24x7 support. If you have any questions, you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\n**Notes:**\nThis course is created for educational purposes only. All the attacks are launched in my lab or against systems that I have permission to test. This course is a product of Edu-Mark India and no other organization is associated with it or a certification exam. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, no other organization is involved.",

Led by certified instructors, students gain essential knowledge of the principles for network security and risk management with competency in the following:\nOrganizational security\nSystem security\nAccess controls\nNetwork infrastructure\nThe S+ certification by CompTIA is an internationally recognized credential ensuring ground-level security proficiency as well as skills for organization and security professionals to provide information, infrastructure, application and operational security. These courses prepare the student for the CompTIA S+ Certification Exam SY0-401.\nWhat You Will Learn\nThe curriculum for CompTIA’s S+ Certification Course begins with supplemental material covering pre-requisites to complete the SY0-401 exam course work. After a thorough breakdown of what Security and Information are, we discuss Attacks and Defenses as well as Information Security Careers and the Security+ Certification to give students a wealth of background knowledge before diving into Systems Threats and Risks. This section covers Software-Based Attacks as well as Hardware-Based Attacks and Attacks on Virtual Systems. Once an understanding of various attacks are developed, we look at Protecting Systems by Hardening The Operating System and Preventing Attacks That Target the Web Browser; studying Network Vulnerabilities, Categories of Attacks, Methods of Network Attacks, and Other Attacks and Frauds leads us to Network Security. In the Network Security section, students learn how to Craft a Secure Network and Apply Network Security Devices. Following similar study formats about Wireless Network Security and Access Control Fundamentals brings us to more practical subjects such as Authentication, Performing Vulnerability Assessments and Conducting Security Audits. We finish the course with comprehensive overviews of Cryptography, Business Continuity and, finally, Security Policies and Training. At the end of this course, a student walks away having had practical experience and comprehensive knowledge allowing confident execution of the CompTIA S+ SY0-401 exam.",

The course covers the entire process of network based ethical hacking from a professional penetration testers point of view.\nThe introductory areas cover the ethics and jurisdictional points surrounding penetration testing a client network. The next sections include integral passive and active information gathering functions when conducting a client engagement.\nThe course then looks into the various exploitation techniques a hacker would use and accompanies detailed demonstrations of how to find and exploit such issues. Once exploited, the course then looks at post exploitation methods. This includes ways in which an attacker can further exploit the client to gain access to other areas of the network as well as maintain access once exploited.\nFinally the course focuses on additional techniques an ethical hacker would take once they have already gained control of a client network and therefore use perspectives such as networking tools similar to Wireshark or TCPDump. In addition other entry points would include hardware tools that can be used for exploitation such as WiFi related hacking, which is only covered from a theoretical point of view within this course.\nThis course is perfect for anyone who is looking for a primer for more expensive ethical hacking certifications such as OSCP, CEH, and the technical element of CISSP.",

I started to work with it because I think nobody will buy IDA Pro unless it is paid by your employer. Radare 2 is a perfect free alternative, its only disadvantage is that it could be hard to start using it. This is where this course comes in. My goal was to get you over the hard part as fast as possible. So that you can get comfortable with Radare 2.\n\n\nThese are the things you will learn in this course:\nSetting up Radare\nUnderstanding its syntax\nUnderstanding its config\nInformation gathering about the binary\nNavigation in the binary\nCross references\nRun-time debugging\nPatching the binary\nHowever there are a few things that are not goals of this course:\nWe are going to focus on the tool and not on assembly, so this is not an assembly course. You can follow along without understanding everything in assembly and that is fine, but don’t expect that you can learn assembly in a few hours.\nWe will learn some reverse engineering techniques but it is not our goal to learn everything.\nHowever what you are definitely will learn is how to use Radare 2, and after this course if you need to analyse a binary you will be able to pull out radare from your sleeves anytime you need it.\n\n\nAll exercises are hand-on, so you are expected to repeat the exercises yourself. I have done quite a lot of trainings myself, live or online, and I can tell you that without practicing they won't stick. This is a really practical training so I encourage you to try everything yourself, because just watching the videos will only give you the illusion that you learnt something, 80% of the learning happens when you do the exercises.",

Examining the curriculum content is going to help you understand the coverage.\nSo far, I've covered:\nAnnex A Control: Teleworking\nAnnex A Control: Asset Management\nAnnex A Control: Cryptography\nAnnex A Control: Communication Security\nThis standard is about creating an Information Management System. The goal of an ISMS is to protect the confidentiality & integrity of data while ensuring availability. You can apply this system to any type of organization of any size. It's based on the same core high-level structure as other management systems. The main clauses include:\nContext of the organization\nLeadership\nPlanning\nSupport\nOperation\nPerformance Evaluation\nImprovement\nThe second part of the standard is about controls. They are listed in Annex A, and are grouped into different categories. They provide organizations with a set of tools that can be used to achieve the objectives of their management system. The list is not exhaustive and more controls do exist and can be implemented. Regardless, it's important to understand the controls mentioned in Annex A and determine if they are applicable or useful to your organization.",

It is the underlying building block of many defense mechanisms, systems, and protocols.  Without crypto, we will not be able to safely conduct many things on the Internet, such as web browsing, online banking, working remotely, etc. Without crypto, blockchain and cryptocurrency will not exist.\nIn this course, we systematically study the basic principles of cryptography.  In particular, we focus on the three essential pillars of cryptography, including secret-key encryption, one-way hash function, and public-key cryptography. We study how they work and how they are used in the real-world applications. We also look at the risks they face, and how these risks are mitigated in the real world. Furthermore, we study the common mistakes people make when using crypto algorithms and protocols. We show how these mistakes can be exploited in attacks.\nThe course emphasizes hands-on learning. For each topic covered, students not only learn the theory, they also get to work on the hands-on exercises developed by the instructor. These exercises are called SEED labs, and they are being used by over 1000 institutes worldwide. The course is based on the widely-adopted textbook written by the instructor. The title of the book is \"Computer & Internet Security: A Hands-on Approach\".",

That's why I have created a guide that I think comprehensively covers this whole process. Pentesting is an art form and I'd like to teach how to do it.\nWhat is this course?\nThis course takes you through 10 modules, each having it's own objective with a capstone assignment that will guide you through network pen-testing, web, and even API pen-testing. I've created practical labs to guide you through the process so you are not just theoretically richer after completing this course.\nWho am I?\nLet's start with the obligated section about who I am first. My name is Wesley Thijs and i have been an instructor and public figure for about 4 years, garnering 100 000+ students in my time doing it. Recently, however, I wanted to expand my business and I included pen testing as a service we offer. This means we also sometimes get requests for hundreds of hours of testing and this is impossible to do alone. I manage a team of several highly skilled cybersecurity professionals I have been able to pick out over the years I have been training.\nMy team needed a standard way of testing and a standard education however so I created this plan to teach them how to pentest, how to handle clients, and everything involved in successfully completing an assignment from start to finish.",

The course topics include:\n\n\nAn explanation of the key differences between malware analysis and incident response.\nAn overview of different malware types, including viruses, worms, fileless malware, and trojans.\nTechniques for analyzing known malware, including online file analysis and tools for examining running processes.\nStrategies for identifying unknown malware using heuristic activity detection and vulnerability analysis.\nMethods for preventing incidents, such as securing removable storage and utilizing email filtering and analysis tools.\nEffective incident response methods, including escalation procedures and setting service priorities.\nIn the real world, protecting against and reacting to security incidents varies for each organization, depending on its size and service priorities. For instance, a company that hosts internal websites may prioritize restoring these services before addressing internal staff issues, or vice versa.\nIt is crucial to ensure that any changes to your organization’s network align with company policies. This approach guarantees that incidents are resolved smoothly, minimizing downtime and inconvenience to end users. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of both proactive and reactive measures to enhance your organization’s IT security posture.\nJoin us to gain the essential skills needed to safeguard your network and respond effectively to security threats.\n\n\nIn the disaster recovery portion of this course, we'll be covering the basics surrounding DR and BCP planning, as well as some different types of disasters and the best ways to mitigate against them.\n\n\nTopics on this course are as follows:\n* Overview of Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning (BCP)\n* Mitigating against different types of disasters and maximising the chances of data recovery\n* Common issues than can occur during a DR test or real world disaster\n* Assessing the impact of a DR test or disaster on your business\n* Maintaining data protection compliance during a disaster situation\n* Implications of allowing Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)\n* Security considerations of any recovery strategies, i.e. ensuring the same level of physical and logical security as you would at a primary business premises.\n\n\nAlso included on the course are some examples of how a DR plan would be implemented in the real world, for example having key members of staff available throughout testing and having a way to contact them quickly should a real world disaster occur.\nWhilst it is, of course, impossible to plan for every situation, a good analysis of the potential impact of a disaster will go a long way in ensuring continuity of service within your organisation and allow the minimum possible level of inconvenience to customers.",

The Cisco Packet Tracer and/or VIRAL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab) are Cisco proprietary software and can only be obtained through Cisco. It is up to each student to obtain the simulator/emulator of their choice to study along with this course.\n\nStudents will get a thorough understanding of OSPF and how we would implement it in a real world environment.\nWe will discuss the following concepts OSPF terminology; process ID’s, LSA, DBD, LDB’s and much more. We will be configuring OSPF in a point-to-point and broadcast type of network and understand the differences between them. Analyze the election process of DR and BDR using loopback addresses, priority numbers or putting in the router id manually.\nOnce you get an understanding of how OSPF works and it’s configurations we will then go into explaining and creating multiple area OSPF and OSPFV3 and analyze them as well.\nThis is a lecture based course using the Touch-IT Technology Smart board, which will make learning very interactive and engaging. Hands on labs will be used to drill down the concepts learned in each lecture using Cisco’s Packet Tracer.\nMy method will make you feel like you are sitting in a classroom environment and give the most needed hands on experience!\nHandouts will be available to facilitate learning and practice.\nThis course will help the student become familiar with OSPF routing using various methods and how to implement them in your environment…but it will also help in preparing for any networking certification or Computer Science Degree; not to mention the fact that for those already in the field, it will further improve routing decisions in their particular networks.",

You will learn how to install, manage,  configure and troubleshoot Cisco's latest Wireless Lan Controller 9800-CL.\n\n\nFirst of all, we will learn how to download and install VMware Workstation Pro, after that we will go over the steps of how to install WLC 9800-CL and we will introduce ourselves with its GUI then we will learn how to configure WLC 9800 Ethernet Ports. After these introductory chapters, we will learn how to create a location and add a PSK WLAN on WLC 9800. We will continue learning to provision an AP on WLC 9800 and how to connect with a client. We will end this WLAN configuration section with adding a new WLAN with 802.1x Flexconnect options. Next section will start with location configuration and ap provisioning with different options and we will continue while creating policies and tags for flex location. AP switchport configuration and ssh configuration on APs will be the last part of this section. Next, we will focus on WLC configuration such as SNMP, managing via CLI and VLANs. After going over general configuration steps, we will deal with policies on our WLC. We will configure 802.1X policy tags and profiles and then we will create policy tags on APs. In the last sections, we will learn more about packet captures and troubleshooting steps. Configuring packet captures on our WLC and investigating those captures and traces will be our main goal. We will finish the course with two cases that are focusing on different troubleshooting steps on WLAN SSIDs.\n\n\nVMware Workstation Pro\n9800-CL Installation\nWLC 9800 GUI Introduction\nWLC 9800 Ethernet Port Configuration Overview\nHow To Create A Location and Add A PSK WLAN on WLC 9800\nHow To Provision An AP on WLC 9800 and Connect With A Client\nHow To Add A New WLAN With 8021X Flexconnect Options\nLocation Configuration and AP Provisioning\nCreating Policies and Tags For Flex Location\nAP Switchport Configuration and Configuring SSH on AP\nConfiguring SNMP on WLC\nCommand Line Interface on WLC 9800\nConfiguring VLANs on WLC\nConfiguring WLAN with 8021X Policy Tags and Profiles\nConfiguring Policy Tags on APs\nConfiguring WLC to Capture Packets\nConfiguring WLC to Capture Packets of AP Join Process\nConfiguring Radioactive Trace on WLC to Capture Client Authentication\nInvestigating Radioactive Trace Capture Output File\nInvestigating ISE Logs and Capture Output File\nTroubleshooting WLAN SSID Connectivity Case 1\nTroubleshooting WLAN SSID Connectivity Case 2\nThank You",

Tools, techniques, setting up a virtual lab, and how to protect yourself. This is a comprehensive course that will be using free open source tools to investigate people and companies. No matter if you are totally new to the fascinating world of OSINT and hacking or have some experience, this course will walk you through how both hackers and investigators use these tools and why.\nWhile I do have 2 other OSINT courses on Udemy at the moment, I came to realize that there may be certain situations that an investigator is unable to use a Linux machine (which is preferred to be honest). That is why I decided to make the Windows edition to help out.\nIn this course we will be focusing on the Windows OS for OSINT, utilizing the various tools that are available to us, ways to minimize our risks using this OS, and more.\n\n\nGet stuck or have a question? Always feel free to send me a message and I will do my best to help you out!\n\n\n***WARNING***\nIf you have already enrolled in the OSINT For hackers, investigators, and everyone else or the OSINT Level 2 course that I have posted I do not recommend buying this course as it will be largely a repeat of what you already learned.\n\n\nFYI, a reminder: I not anyone that is a part of DGS has any affiliation with any of the vendors, software manufactures, or programmers in this course.",

Python is for business applications and engineering. Not for me! I hack on the command-line.”\nAhem, I see what you did there: cute. But I have news for you: python is a great language to start learning now. Why? Because it’s becoming one of the most popular languages in the world, and there are thousands of libraries written in it for you to use. Plus, it’s easy to learn, powerful enough to handle complicated projects, runs everywhere, is one of the most popular languages today (literally!), and allows you to get things done quickly with great code that’s readable.\nIn this course you will build several Python programs that investigate the attack surface like a subdomain scanner, directory scanner, port scanner and others. You will also use Python scripts that do SSH brute forcing and keyloggers.\nIf you are a beginner and interested in Python or Hacking, this course is for you. You don't need any prior knowledge to starting this course, not even of Python. It should be a lot of fun, so what are you waiting for?",

      "description": "Learn network scanning, port scanning, and service enumeration. This course will teach you everything you need to know to master Nmap for penetration testing.\nNetwork Scanning & Enumeration have become an increasingly important aspect of penetration tests over the last couple of years. Organizations now have a complex network of assets storing sensitive and valuable data. These assets are exposed to potential threats from inside as well as from outside the organization network. To get an overview of the security posture of the organization, conducting an effective network scanning and enumeration of an organization's network is paramount. This course is designed to take you from a beginner to an expert with Nmap (Network Mapper). Nmap is a free and open-source network scanner that is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.\nIf you are looking to get started with Nmap and you want to know if this course is for you or worth taking. Take a look at the reviews and testimonials from students that have already taken the course. Here are some of the most recent reviews from our students:\n\n\nGreatest course I have taken on Udemy - Nicolas MARCHEWKA\nOne of the greatest courses I've taken on Udemy! Very clear explanations and comprehensive in-depth guide to Nmap usage.\nGreat Nmap reference - Jason Hameister\nGreat course for refining map use. It gave me a much better understanding of how to use the application to the best of my ability.\nGreat examples and scenarios - Chris Dailey\nThis course was great! I specifically like how multiple examples/scenarios were used with the various switches.\n\n\nThis course aims to teach beginners everything that is needed to learn and master Nmap and is carefully tailored and structured to ensure validation of what is being taught, every lecture involves student interaction, where students will be required to follow along with the instructor and will also include assessments and projects that will further test and advance the students knowledge of the subject.",

      "description": "Antivirus software is a type of security software that monitors and removes malicious or unwanted programs from your computer. These programs are also called virus, malware, Trojan horse and spyware. In addition, anti-virus software is essential to protect personal computers from online threats such as identity theft and fraud. In other words, without anti-virus software, your computer will become a platform for hackers to target and steal sensitive information from unsuspecting users.\nHow does anti-virus software work? To monitor your computer and find viruses, anti-virus software creates an index of all the files on your system. Based on this index, anti-virus software can identify suspicious files and create a list of malicious or unwanted programs for removal. In addition, anti-viral software can also delete viruses immediately before they cause any damage to your system. These functions make anti-virus software an indispensable tool for today’s tech savvy individuals.\nIn this course you will learn how anti-virus software works and create your own anti-virus software. You will learn the various techniques that are used by anti-virus vendors and increase your cyber security.\nThis is a beginners course, you don't need any prior knowledge except for the chapter where you create your own anti-virus software (Python programming knowledge required).",

      "description": "Mastering Cybersecurity Ransomware Incident Response (101)\nIn today's digital age, the threat of ransomware looms large over organizations of all sizes and across various industries. Ransomware attacks can be catastrophic, resulting in data loss, financial damages, and reputational harm. To effectively combat this growing menace, professionals in the field of cybersecurity need to be well-prepared with the right knowledge and skills. That's where the \"Master Course: Cybersecurity Ransomware Incident Response\" comes into play.\nCybersecurity incident response, particularly in the context of ransomware attacks, is critically important for several reasons:\nFinancial Impact: Ransomware attacks can result in significant financial losses. Organizations may be required to pay a ransom to regain access to their data, and even if they choose not to pay, they still face costs associated with investigating the incident, restoring systems, and implementing security improvements to prevent future attacks.\nData Loss: Ransomware can lead to the loss of sensitive and critical data. Without a robust incident response plan, organizations may struggle to recover their data or face permanent data loss, which can have serious consequences for their operations.\nReputation Damage: Data breaches and ransomware incidents can seriously damage an organization's reputation. If customers, partners, or the public lose trust in an organization's ability to protect their data, it can lead to a loss of business and credibility.\nLegal and Regulatory Consequences: Many countries have data protection laws and regulations that require organizations to take reasonable steps to protect sensitive data. Failing to respond effectively to a ransomware incident can result in legal and regulatory penalties.\nOperational Disruption: Ransomware attacks can disrupt an organization's operations, leading to downtime, loss of productivity, and increased operational costs. An effective incident response plan can help minimize these disruptions and facilitate a quicker recovery.\nSecurity Improvement: Incident response provides an opportunity for organizations to learn from the attack and improve their cybersecurity defenses. By analyzing how the attack occurred and what vulnerabilities were exploited, organizations can implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\nContainment and Mitigation: A well-executed incident response plan can help contain the spread of ransomware within an organization's network, preventing further damage and data encryption. Quick containment can limit the extent of the breach and reduce the impact.\nLegal and Ethical Considerations: Organizations need to consider the ethical and legal implications of paying ransoms. An incident response plan should include a strategy for making these difficult decisions, taking into account the potential consequences and compliance requirements.\nPreparedness for Future Attacks: Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and organizations need to be prepared for future incidents. Having a well-documented incident response plan in place can help organizations respond more effectively when the next attack occurs.\nIn summary, cybersecurity incident response, especially in the case of ransomware, is crucial because it helps organizations minimize financial losses, protect their reputation, comply with legal requirements, and improve their overall security posture. Being prepared for and effectively responding to ransomware incidents is essential in today's cybersecurity landscape.\nRansomware attacks are a persistent and evolving threat in today's digital landscape. The \"Master Course: Cybersecurity Ransomware Incident Response\" equips you with the essential knowledge and skills to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from ransomware incidents and this course is your key to staying ahead of cybercriminals and protecting your organization's valuable assets.

      "description": "This course teaches more than just reverse engineering because as a malware analyst you need a variety of other skills. You will learn how to classify samples into malware types, how to identify malware families and how to determine file verdicts like clean, malicious, potentially unwanted programs, junk, grayware, or corrupt. Additionally, you will learn how malware persists, how to identify malicious autostart entries and clean infected systems.\nThe course aims to dispel common myths such as \"trojan in a detection name means the file is a trojan horse\" or \"antivirus detection names are a malware classification\".\nAs a malware analyst with experience working at an antivirus company since 2015, I have trained many beginners in the field. I understand the usual pitfalls and the concepts that you need to grasp to become proficient. I focus on building strong foundations that make you flexible in the face of new malware advancements, rather than providing shortcuts with step-by-step recipes.\nI will teach you how to differentiate between different types of files, including installers, wrappers, packed files, non-packed files, hybrid, and native compiled files. You will learn which tools to apply in which situations and how to analyse samples efficiently. To do that I give you example approaches that work for most situations.\nThis course is ideal for you if you already have some IT background, such as hobby or professional programmers, computer enthusiasts, administrators, computer science students, or gamers with an interest in the inner workings of software or IT security.\nIf you have a strong interest in the topic but lack the necessary IT background, I recommend that you learn programming first. Please refer to the course requirements for more information.\nTools\nAll the tools and web services that we use during the course are free:\nGhidra\nx64dbg\nVirtualBox\nSysInternals Suite\nPortexAnalyzer CLI and GUI\nVirusTotal (without account)\nSpeakeasy by Mandiant\nAPI Monitor\nCyberChef\nEXIFTool\nMeld\nVBinDiff\nAnalyzePESig\nDnSpy\nC# Online Compiler programwiz\nTriD\nDetect-it-Easy\nReNamer\n7zip\nNotepad++\nHxD\nMalpedia\nlnk_parser\nRequirements\nYou should have a strong understanding of at least one programming language, such as Python, C, C++, Java, or C#. This is a crucial requirement for the course, not only because we create small scripts during the course but because reverse engineering needs an understanding of software as foundation. The specific language does not matter, as you cannot learn every language you may encounter during analysis anyways. The concepts of programming must be clear, though.\nIf you are not there yet, you should not buy this course and start learning C instead. C is great because it is low-level and will integrate well with x86 assembly language.\nAdditionally, you must be able to read (not write) x86 assembly to understand everything in the course. Without assembly you will only be able to understand two-thirds of the content. So if you consider starting this course right away and learning assembly alongside it, that should work fine.\nDuring this course we look at samples that use the following execution environments:\nx86, x64 assembly\n.NET\nBatch\nPowerShell\nNullsoft scripts\nHowever, you do not need to learn all of these languages. Because an analyst encounters new languages all the time, your skillset is rather in using the available documentation, manuals and help provided for those environments and languages. I also show you during the course how to use the documentation for ,e.g., PowerShell.\nOut of scope\nMalware analysis is a broad field, so there are inevitably topics that I will not teach during this course because they would rather require their own course. Some of these topics are: assembly language, programming, how computers work, URL and website analysis, networks, analysis of malware for other platforms than Windows, mobile malware, IoT malware.",

More and more content will be added from time to time just like my other courses . Modules upto Python Fundamentals were recorded year ago so they contain my bad english but from then onwards there will be no problem in watching videos .\n\n\nThis paragraph tells you essence of cybersecurity\nUse of cyberspace, i.e. computer, internet, cellphone, other technical devices, etc., to commit a crime by an individual or organized group is called cyber-crime. Cyber attackers use numerous software and codes in cyberspace to commit cybercrime. They exploit the weaknesses in the software and hardware design through the use of malware. Hacking is a common way of piercing the defenses of protected computer systems and interfering with their functioning. Identity theft is also common. Cybercrimes may occur directly i.e, targeting the computers directly by spreading computer viruses. Other forms include DoS attack. It is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. It suspends services of a host connected to the internet which may be temporary or permanent.\nMalware is a software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. It usually appears in the form of code, scripts, active content, and other software. ‘Malware’ refers to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, for example, Trojan Horses, rootkits, worms, adware, etc.",

You can think of this as part 2 of my other course which has a similar name. This lecture will provide an overview of what you can expect for the remainder of this course.\nFirst of all, this course is extremely hands-on. This means we're not going to be doing much talking about the theory of penetration testing, we're going to be diving into hands on technical application right away. We'll be using VirtualBox as a software hypervisor to build a host-only lab environment. Not only will this help you gain insight into penetration testing, but will give you the skills and resources to create your own environment to test and research beyond what you learn in this course.\nThe lab is going to consist of Kali Linux, and a variety of intentionally vulnerable Linux and Windows VMs. Some of the things we'll be covering are enumeration and vulnerability scanning and local and remote exploitation with industry standard penetration testing tools such as nmap, dirb, and nikto, Metasploit and standalone exploits. We're also going to focus upon exploit development, covering in detail how to craft a buffer overflow exploit for a custom Linux and Windows binary.\nIn order to accomplish this goal of buffer over flow exploit development and debugging, we're going to be creating a Windows 7 analysis and attack machine. This will have industry standard tools for exploit dev such as Immunity Debugger. We're also going to learn how to use Kali Linux's built in gnu debugger for this purpose.\nThe technology and methodology used is in this course is current at the time of this recording, which is January 2019. If you're watching this after the stated date, don't be worried too much, as this content should still be highly relevant for aspiring penetration testers.\nI will also be introducing you to several free training platforms which I've found to be extremely helpful prior to earning my many hands-on penetration testing certs including OSCP and eWPT. This training has also helped sky rocket my progress as a skilled senior penetration tester and subject matter expert.\nI truly hope that you enjoy my course and I'm very excited to be working with all of you. If you have any trouble, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via the Q&A system or by direct message. However, please make sure you include a detailed and specific question, not something like \"I can't get it to work\".\nAlso, I highly encourage independent research and attempting to find answers on your own. This is the single most important skill as a penetration tester, the ability to find solutions to problems you haven't yet encountered.\nI ask you to please go through the majority of this course prior to leaving a review so that you can accurately measure the course's quality in entirety. I always appreciate constructive feedback, and encourage students to reach out to me if they think anything valuable could be added to the coursework.\nThanks, and have fun!",

Its aim is to “accelerate innovation and commercialization in RAN domain with multi-vendor interoperable products and solutions that are easy to integrate in the operator’s network and are verified for different deployment scenarios.”\n\n\nOpen RAN is a radio access network where hardware from any equipment supplier can be used with software, API, source code, interface etc. from other different suppliers. Shift from Proprietary to COTS (Commercial off the shelf).\n\n\nOpen RAN split key RAN functions among different nodes to manage different services and applications (real time and non-real time). Open RAN is also known as Disaggregated RAN. Baseband functionality is split between central unit (CU) and distributed unit (DU).\n\n\nOpen RAN is broadly a Software enabled Network. Open RAN enables RAN flexibility and development velocity with simultaneous reduction in capital and operating expenses through the adoption of open-source software and continuous evolution through CI/CD. Virtualization decouples infrastructure and extracts required functions (such as CU and DU) virtually. Orchestration coordinates the lifecycle of virtual network functions to realize required service (e.g., slicing).\n\n\nCloudification is an integral part of Open RAN. Cloud platform enables convenient, on demand access to shared pool of configurable resources in the radio access network through virtualization in Open RAN. Cloudification can be done for CU, DU and near real time RIC nodes.\n\n\nAs RAN is disaggregating and moving away from proprietary system, there is an innovation happening by leveraging machine learning (ML) to enable more efficiency as compared to conventional RAN by introducing intelligent controllers known as Radio Intelligent controllers (RIC), which can work for real and non-real time services. ML can also help to optimize the features and parameters in the network to make it more efficient. It is a part of self-organizing network feature (SON).\n\n\nSoftware defined network (SDN) helps to enable traffic engineering for access networks.\n\n\nMulti access edge computing (MEC) helps to move network resources and functions closer to the users and enable multiple emerging applications having stringent requirement of roundtrip time and processing of huge amount of data at edge.\n\n\nRobust transport connectivity is prerequisite to connect disaggregated Open Radio access network.",

After taking this course for over a month, I'm much more familiar and comfortable with the terms and techniques and plan to use them soon in bug bounties.\n\nFAQ regarding Ethical Hacking on Udemy:\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network. An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals.\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system. An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement. An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer. They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them. With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles.\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk. For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks. When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing on Udemy:\n\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched. Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack.\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results.\n\nHi there,\n\nAre you ready to gain new cybersecurity skills to improve your career opportunities?\nAre you looking for a career in penetration testing?\nIf you are planning an Ethical Hacking career and if this is something that interests you then you are at the right place.\nOAK Academy wants you to know we’re here to help.\nNetwork Security\nethical\nEthical Intelligence\nnmap nessus\nnmap course\nnmap metaspolit\nComplete nmap\nKali linux nmap\nethical hacking\npenetration testing\nbug bounty\nhack\ncyber security\nkali linux\nandroid hacking\nnetwork security\nhacking\nsecurity\nsecurity testing\nnmap\nmetasploit\nmetasploit framework\npenetration testing\noscp\nsecurity testing\nwindows hacking\nexploit\nbug bounty\nbug bounty hunting\nwebsite hacking\nweb hacking\npentest+\npentest plus\nOSINT (Open Source Intelligent )\nsocial engineering\nphishing\nsocial engineering tool kit\nethical hacking metasploit password cracking penetration testing hacking cracking ethical hacking and penetration testing phishing oak academy crack complete ethical hacking nessus web hacking ethical hacking course white hat hacker web penetration testing complete ethical hack the complete ethical hacking course antivirus evasion password hack white hat hacking password hacking hacking course nmap metasploit shodan kali linux penetration hack web penetration web security complete ethical hacking course certified ethical hacking ruby burp armitage hacker cve nmap course\nethical hacking hacking become ethical hacker oak academy ethical hacking 2021 penetration testing ethical hacker in 15 hours hacking 2021 become ethical hacker in 15 ethical hacking in 15 hours hacker ethical hacking and penetration testing ethical become ethical hacker in 15 hours 2021 malware become ethical hacker in 15 hour password cracking nessus ethical hacker 15 ethical hacker ethical hacker 15 hours become an ethical hacker ethical hacking 15 hours black hat hacking become ethical hacker in ethical hacking social media android hacking penetration learn ethical hacking hack 2021 javascript hacking shodan msfconsole passwordhack become a hacker ethical hacking metasploit password cracking\nLast year, Penetration Testers ranked as one of the 3 most in-demand jobs in the growing cybersecurity job market, and with our guided learning you’ll gain real-world, hands-on experience with the latest technologies.

I will guide you through all of the concepts that you need to know and advise you on the level of knowledge that you need to get comfortable with.\nThere are over four hours of video content plus course notes based on information from my book: Cloud Guardians.\nWe will explore the basics of Governance, Risk management and Compliance and how the cloud affects it in a business.\nA solid understanding of the definition of cloud, its deployment models and service categories will be gained through these videos.\nAn exploration of the threats to the cloud today is in this course. Those controls need to be verified and we use common criteria or ISO 15408. It is also necessary to explore the verification of the physical security with cryptography related products such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPM). That verification is done using FIPS 140-2/-3.\nWe finish this domain with an exploration of the technologies that are related to the cloud and benefit greatly from all of its offerings.\nThis domain is the cloud concepts, architecture and design.\nThe details that are included in (ISC)2's exam outline of encryption and access controls are in Domain 2.\nThe details from their exam outline about network and virtualization security is in Domains 3 and 5.\nThe BCP details are in Domain 5.\nI cover DevSecOps in Domain 4 - Cloud Application security",

Did you want to be a professional hacker for as long as you remember? If so, then you have come to the right place - in this course, you will learn all about ethical hacking and penetration testing. You’ll get the best of both worlds - you’ll be able to live out your dream of becoming a hacker while not doing anything illegal that could get you fined or - even worse - locked behind bars. But in order to learn how to hack, you must first know what is ethical hacking and penetration testing.\nWhat is Penetration Testing?\nIf you’ve never heard about ethical hacking and all of the other terms associated with it, you might be quite confused. Here I am, talking about hacking people and not being punished for it like it’s the easiest concept in the world. As a matter of fact, however - it actually is! Ethical hacking and penetration testing have been the go-to terms of every network administrator for the longest time now. This type of hacking is legal because it is concerned about with advancing network security, rather than breaking it down and breaching it.\nAny and all IT-based, network activity-oriented companies do require ethical hackers as employees to test out if the network is properly secured or not. This is where penetration testing comes in - the network is bombarded with various different attacks to see if it will break, and if it will, then which of the attacks will be the successful one. This type of a job is perfect for people who want to learn how to hack and are super interested in the topic, yet don’t want to get in trouble while practicing / actually doing it. This way, you are able to exercise your passion and even get paid for doing so.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn??\nYou might be thinking - Why should I take this course to learn penetration testing? Why should I even bother  there are so many free tutorials online! Although that is true as a statement, I offer you a very simple reason to motivate your choice in picking this course as your source of knowledge and information on network security maintenance - experience. The course is based on my own personal experience as a network security researcher. Having already spent some time in the industry, I was able to distinguish the varying trends and requirements for ethical hacking professionals. This course is centered around Android - you’ll learn Android penetration testing, how to create and test keyloggers, how to use Ubuntu and so on.\nThe only requirements for the course are for you to be familiar with Android (having used it before) and some very basic knowledge on how IT works, in general. Everything else will be provided within the course. Also, ready your passion for learning a new skill - if you’re a true IT enthusiast, you will surely appreciate ethical hacking (both from practical and philosophical standpoints) and all of the sub-topics that surround it. So, don’t hesitate - dive straight on in and I’ll see you on the other side!\n\n\nNOTE: This course is created for educational purposes only and all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against devices that I have permission to test.",

The output of the analysis aids in the detection and mitigation of the potential threat.\nThe key benefit of malware analysis is that it helps incident responders and security analysts:\nPragmatically triage incidents by level of severity\nUncover hidden indicators of compromise (IOCs) that should be blocked\nImprove the efficacy of IOC alerts and notifications\nEnrich context when threat hunting\nThe analysis may be conducted in a manner that is static, dynamic or a hybrid of the two.\nStatic Analysis\nBasic static analysis does not require that the code is actually run. Instead, static analysis examines the file for signs of malicious intent. It can be useful to identify malicious infrastructure, libraries or packed files.\nTechnical indicators are identified such as file names, hashes, strings such as IP addresses, domains, and file header data can be used to determine whether that file is malicious. In addition, tools like disassemblers and network analyzers can be used to observe the malware without actually running it in order to collect information on how the malware works.\nDynamic Analysis\nDynamic malware analysis executes suspected malicious code in a safe environment called a sandbox. This closed system enables security professionals to watch the malware in action without the risk of letting it infect their system or escape into the enterprise network.\nDynamic analysis provides threat hunters and incident responders with deeper visibility, allowing them to uncover the true nature of a threat. As a secondary benefit, automated sandboxing eliminates the time it would take to reverse engineer a file to discover the malicious code.\nThis course aims to point out the security essentials for any given IT organization. The course enables students to setup a secure base from scratch or review an existing security skeleton for their IT environments. The course targets the IT security beginners as well as professionals to enrich their knowledge about cyber security and to pursue their career in such field.",

Most of network engineers don't like programming - that's a fact. But programming skills is required if you want to keep working as a network engineer. The most used programming language for network automation nowadays is called Python. For this reason, I have designed this course to show you how you can run scripts on Python to interact with MikroTik devices so you can configure them by just one click no matter how big is the number of the MikroTik devices, and to avoid human errors that happen a lot.\nIn this course I am not going to explain everything about Python. I am just going to take the scripts that we needed as network engineers and explain them then apply them to see how the network automation on MikroTik routers can work.\nBottom line, this course is an essence for all MikroTik network engineers and I am glad to be the 1st trainer doing a course about network automation on MikroTik using Python.",

But the question that may be asked: are you using the whole features that MikroTik is providing to you so you can provide add-on solutions to your customers?\nFor this reason, I have decided to build up this course and show you how you can build a core network of an ISP using MikroTik routers. I will go through configuring the ISP from scratch as following:\nSetting up BGP peers with the uplink ISP\nPublishing the public IP subnet, configuring VLAN's between all core routers\nSetting up OSPF in the core network\nProvide customers which public IP addresses allow them to go to the internet\nProviding intranet solution using MPLS/VPLS\nAssigning bandwidth speed to each customer\nReaching each customer router using a management VLAN\nAll those topics will be configured in this course. Please note, I will not explain the theory behind each of those protocols, so I assume that if you are taking this course, you know how all those protocols work.\nThis course will be only LABS, and I will be using 7 MikroTik routers on GNS3 with CHR image. You can run the same scenario on real MikroTik equipment if you like to.\nFinally, I hope that this course can guide you to run a stable core network in your ISP, and I look forward to see you inside.",

This class will not use slides to teach, it is a very interactive class with actual examples and ways to implement them. You will actually see how to implement IP addresses and subnets.\nIp addressing\nIp addressing, also known as internet protocol addressing, is the way that a computer is located on the internet. It is a system of numbers used to identify a device on a network. This is what is used to tell the computer where to send information it is sending or receiving from the internet.\nClass A allows a network of 16,777,216 host devices.\nClass B allows a network of 65,536 host devices.\nClass C permits only 254 host devices.\n\n\nHow do we calculate IP addressing?\n\nIPv4 is the addressing scheme we use today. It’s the one that most of us learned in school. You probably know that an IP address is made up of four numbers between 0 and 255. But how do we calculate those numbers? It all starts with a 32-bit number created by the combination of a network address and a host address.\n\n\nWhy ISP provides an Ip address ?\nImagine you are an internet service provider (ISP) like Verizon or AT&T, and you offer internet access to your customers. You need a way to track the internet traffic that goes in and out of your network so that you can bill your customers for their internet usage. You also want to make sure that your customers are only able to access the internet resources that you approve. This means you need to have some sort of system for managing the IP addresses (a unique number that is assigned to each device on a network and used for routing information) that are being used by your customers.\nWhat is a subnet?\nA subnet is a particular logical division of an IP address space. The IP address space is made up of private and public addresses, with the private addresses being used on private intranets and the public addresses being used for the Internet. The subnet mask defines which part of an IP address is used for the network address and which part is used for the host address. The remaining parts of the IP address are used for defining the subnet.\n\n\nAtul Sharma who worked with many TOP companies took one online workshop few days back. These are the videos of that workshop. Learn CCNA Interview Questions directly from an expert.\nWhere many students got their desired job.\nWith my 11 years of experience in Industry.

The traffic is segregated from source to destination through MPLS Cloud, which uses MP-BGP.\nVRF Lite\nVRF Lite is a subset of VRF but without MPLS and MP-BGP. In Cisco’s terminology, the deployment of VRFs without MPLS is VRF Lite. It is mainly used for enterprises having networks with overlapping IP addresses. Each routed interface belongs to exactly one VRF, making VRF Lite very simple.\nIn light of the success of the VRF, the VRF Lite was accepted with open arms in Data Center and enterprise LAN environments.",

It lies behind the most of encryption, key exchange and digital signature applications today. It guarantees same security with other public key algorithms such as RSA or Diffie Hellman whereas it can handle the security with smaller keys also in faster way. Today, even bitcoin and other blockchain based cryptocurrencies are based on ECC!\nIn this course, we will mention on both the math behind elliptic curve cryptography and gain hands on experience in Java. In other words, the course covers both theory and practice deeply. On the other hand, everything will be developed in java from scratch. Also, no out-of-the-box of feature of any language will be used. Elliptic curves in Weierstrass, Koblitz and Edwards form (or shortly Edwards Curves) will be covered. Then, we will focus on  Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman key (ECDH) exchange, Elliptic Curve ElGamal asymmetric encryption & decryption, digital signatures with elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA).\nFinally, you can have your own elliptic curve cryptography API when you enrolled the course, and no need to consume any other 3rd party dependency. No matter how deep java knowledge you have, being cryptography enthusiastic is enough to enroll this course.",

Splunk processes data in three stages:\nData Input – Splunk ingests the raw data stream from the source, breaks it into 64K blocks, and adds metadata keys, including hostname, source, character encoding, and the index the data should be stored in.\nData Storage – Splunk parses log data, by breaking it into lines, identifying timestamps, creating individual events and annotating them with metadata keys. It then transforms event data using transformation rules defined by the operator. Finally, Splunk writes the parsed events to disk, pointing to them from an index file which enables fast search across huge data volumes.\nData Search – at this stage Splunk enables users to query, view and use the event data. Based on the user’s reporting needs, it creates objects like reports, dashboards and alerts.\nHands-on practical videos on Enterprise Splunk Security: ES1, ES2, ES3 & ES4 will help you master Splunk!",

You will learn about hashing, how to crack windows password hashes, how to crack linux hashes and about cryptography. Hashing is a process of converting a given input into a fixed-size alphanumeric string. The output of a hash function is often referred to as a message digest or simply, a hash. A good hash function satisfies the following properties: it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message, it is infeasible to generate two different messages that result in the same hash value, it is infeasible to modify a message without changing its hash value, and it is infeasible to determine the original message from its hash value.\n\nWhen used properly, hashing can be an effective way to store sensitive data such as passwords while keeping them safe from prying eyes. This is because even if someone were to obtain the hash value of a password, they would still need to brute force guess the actual password which would be incredibly time consuming (if not impossible) with today's computing power.\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to crack the passwords hashes from a Windows and Linux computer and find all users passwords using hash cracking tools. You will also be able to verify data integrity and understand basic crypto.",

      "description": "In this course we are going to learn about each and every aspect of wireless networks what is a wireless network? How it works? What are the weakness of wireless network? We have setup this course in a way in which you can understand the core concept of wireless. We will start each section by understanding how different Protocol works so you will have complete understanding of each Protocol and you don’t become script kiddies. We will start with very basic how wireless network works we will learn about different Bands, Channels and Frequencies. We will also learn about different wireless adapters and different modes of wireless adapter like monitor mode and managed mode after that we will dive into more advanced concepts like Packet sniffing and Target sniffing. We will also look the difference between 2.4GHz & 5GHz frequencies and packet sniffing on 5GHz network. Then we will look into how to discover Hidden Networks. After that we will see how to maximize the power of wireless adapter.  Then we will try to understand WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) Protocol and see its weakness. After that we will try to pentest WEP based network. After doing that we will learn about WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) and how we can hack into this protocol. Then we will learn and understand about the most secure protocol WPA/WPA2 Personal and see how this protocol works and why it's so much secure we also try and understand about 4-way handshake. Then we will pentest WPA/WPA2 Personal network as well and see how we can hack these types of networks using Dictionary Attack. After that we will try to pentest WPA/WPA2 with Evil Twin Attacks. Then we will see how Captive Portals work. Nowadays Captive Portals are used in Hotels, Coffee shops and Malls etc. We will also see how we hack networks which are based on Captive Portals. Then we will look into WPA2 Enterprise networks and first try to understand its protocol then we will pentest WPA2 Enterprise network and see how we can get access to these networks.\nAfter understanding all Protocols and their weakness we will look some special hacking scenarios and to solve those scenarios we will create a hacking hardware with Raspberry PI. If you don't know anything about Raspberry PI don’t worry we are going to explain each and every thing about it. Starting from what Raspberry PI is? How we can use it in penetration testing what tools and software we going to install on it. We are going to cover all these in a separate section in this course. After getting good understanding of Raspberry PI we will use it in penetration testing WPS enabled networks. After that we will use Raspberry PI in WPA/WPA2 penetration testing. After covering all the aspects of wireless hacking we will see how we can overcome all the weakness in each of the protocol and see how we can make wireless networks more secure.",

If you didn't break a sweat during Part 1's One-Byte challenge, in which we exploited a single byte overflow, I've built a single null-byte overflow challenge for you to test your skills against. We'll also be learning about the tcache, the Tcache Dup technique, some more obscure malloc internals such as the glibc tunables, and plenty more besides. Check out the primary learning objectives for further details.\nIf you already have an exploit development environment set up from Part 1, you'll be able to start right away.

Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They can improve the security footprint to withstand attacks better or divert them.\n\n\nThe company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers to perform such activities in order to test the system’s defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more importantly, legal.\n\n\nEthical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the system/network/applications. By doing so, they can improve the security footprint so that it can better withstand attacks or divert them.\n\n\nEthical hackers are hired by organizations to look into the vulnerabilities of their systems and networks and develop solutions to prevent data breaches. Consider it a high-tech permutation of the old saying “It takes a thief to catch a thief.”\n\n\nThey check for key vulnerabilities include but are not limited to:\nInjection attacks\nChanges in security settings\nExposure of sensitive data\nBreach in authentication protocols\nComponents used in the system or network that may be used as access points",

      "description": "Welcome to the \"Introduction to Encryption\" course. Encryption is an important part of cybersecurity because it can protect data from unauthorized access.\n\n\nCOURSE LAUNCHED IN FEBRUARY 2023\n\n\nBeginners welcome: no need to know anything about Encryption!\nThe \"Introduction to Encryption\" course is your first step into encryption if you want to better secure your data and identity. If you've never had anything to do with encryption before, then this is the course for you.\n\n\nThis course \"Introduction to Encryption\" is one of 4 courses available in the Encryption Academy for Beginners and you will learn three important topics already here. And we'll take a look at these now.\n\n\nIn the \"Introduction to Encryption\" course you will get an introduction to three important topics to better secure your data:\n\"Hard- and Softwareencryption\"\nNowadays we store important data on our notebooks and often we use portable USB devices to transport data. What happens if you lose these devices? Encryption can protect you from others being able to use your data. I will give you a short introduction to what encryption means and how it works in general. In the practical exercises, I will show you how to use a few small tools to encrypt your data quickly and easily.\n\n\n\"Digital Signature\"\nThe second big topic is digital signature. For example, when you send emails to your customers, how do they actually know that your emails are authentic? Any email format can be copied these days. In the SPAM folder we often get emails that look like they were sent by real companies but were created by hackers.\nHow do your recipients know that your emails are really from you?\nIn the course \"Introduction to Encryption\" you will learn how a digital signature works and how any data can be protected against manipulation.\nIn the practical exercise I already show you in the first course how you can calculate hash values over any files.\nIn this course I will also show you how to protect your PDF documents in Adobe Reader with a signed timestamp. With a timestamp you can have your document signed and thereby prove that your document existed at that time. I'll show you how to do that in this tutorial.\n\n\n\"Digital Certificate\"\nThe third major topic you will learn in this academy is called \"Digital Certificate\". How can you actually protect your digital identity? When you sign your e-mails or documents, for example, you need a confirmed digital identity. Each of us has an ID card, which we use to authenticate ourselves in the analog world. In the digital world, we can legitimize ourselves with digital certificates.\nIn the course \"Introdcution to Encryption\" I explain briefly how a digital certificate works. In the practical exercises I already show you how you can get a free digital certificate quickly and easily. This certificate is only for testing purposes. But you will already learn what is actually contained in it. You should already understand what information about you is secured. Additionally, I will show you how to sign a PDF document in Adobe Acrobat with this certificate.\n\n\nBonus: \"Password based Authentication\" and \"2-Factor Authentication\"\nAs a bonus, I added the topics \"Password based Authentication\" and \"2-Factor Authentication\" in the first course. When we digitally authenticate ourselves on the Internet, we usually use a password. In this course I show you the disadvantages of passwordbased authentication and how a second factor can improve the security of your access.\nIn the practical exercise, I will show you the USB device YubiKey, which can be used for 2-factor authentication.\nBut the Yubikey can do even more. I'll show you how to store your certificate with key material on it, for example, to digitally sign a PDF document in Adobe Acrobat.\n-----------------------------------\nEncryption Academy for Beginners\nThis course \"Introduction to Encryption\" is one of 4 courses available in the Encryption Academy for Beginners. The other courses will be available soon.\n-----------------------------------\nInstructor\nI'm Mike Kurtze, an engineer from Germany and a senior software developer in the area of encryption since 2005. With my Encryption Academy for Beginners I want to show you with my knowledge and experience how encryption works and which tools you can use to protect your sensitive data.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nThis course also comes with:\nLifetime access to all future updates\nA responsive instructor in the Q&A Section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nA 30 Day \"No Questions Asked\" Money Back Guarantee!\nJoin me in this course if you want to learn how encryption works and and which tools you can use to protect your sensitive data.",

This module will explain every type of translation:  Static NAT, Static PAT, Dynamic PAT, and Dynamic NAT. You'll learn about each of these in a way that is completely vendor agnostic -- the concepts you learn here will apply to any vendor and any platform. You'll then learn how these four types of translations are used in Policy NAT and Twice NAT.\nThe second module will teach you the Syntax and Configuration of every type of NAT. There are two ways to configure NAT on a Cisco ASA and ASAx Firewall, and those two ways are Auto NAT and Manual NAT. Both of these methods require the use of objects, so this module starts with by defining and configuring objects. Then we discuss Auto NAT, when to use it and how to configure it. Then we talk through Manual NAT and provide configuration examples of every type of NAT it can configure. That leads us into an illustration of NAT Exemption. Finally, we finally wrap up with a discussion on NAT precedence and the order in which NAT statements are evaluated by the ASA..\nLastly, the third module will circle back to the concepts learned in the first module, and actually prove and demonstrate every claim that was made about NAT. The goal of this course is not only to tell you how NAT works, but also to prove it to you so you can see it for yourself.",

      "description": "vPC is a virtualization technology that presents paired or two Nexus devices as a unique Layer 2 logical node to the access layer devices or endpoints. vPC belongs to Multi chassis EtherChannel [MCEC] family of technology. A virtual port channel (vPC) allows links that are physically connected to two different Cisco Nexus 7000/5000/9000 Series devices to appear as a single port channel to a third device. The third device can be a switch, server, firewall, load balancer or any other networking device that supports link aggregation technology.\nVPC or Virtual Port Channel is a Cisco proprietary feature available on the Nexus platform. Two switches of the same model can be combined into a VPC pair, which can establish a single EtherChannel, also known as a link aggregate or a port channel, across both switches to a third switch or server. This peering device doesn’t know that it is connected to two different switches, and it just needs to support link aggregation either statically or using Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP).\nMultiChassis EtherChannel (MCEC) or MultiChassis Link Aggregation (MLAG) terms refer to the technique of bundling links across more than 1 device. VPC is Cisco’s implementation of MCEC/MLAG on the Nexus line of switches. Similarly, Cisco Catalyst switches support Virtual Switching System (VSS) or StackWise-based MLAGs.",

You can follow the course using any fresh instance of Ubuntu 20.04LTS in your selected VPS provider. Everything will be done from scratch and step by step, without relying on additional features from exclusive services.\n\n\nInstall and deploy a complete system with Linux/Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Cloudflare, Let's Encrypt, Certbot, Nginx y MySQL; also as an additional bonus, there is additional content on how to deploy and publish popular projects such as WordPress, Laravel and more that will be added over time.\n\n\nWhy take this course?\nBecause it uses the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Ubuntu, which is Ubuntu 20.04LTS. You won't have to worry about switching to another version for at least two long years.\n\n\nBecause there is no other online course that explains with this level of detail each step to be taken, because Let's Encrypt is a novelty, along with the use of Cloudflare as a protection service, and you will not find content that teaches you to use it in the way that It is done in this course (the correct and simple way).\n\n\nBecause you will learn the best standards to obtain the highest security rating (A+) in the sites that you secure while following the course.\n\n\nBecause, nowadays the main browsers are demanding secure HTTPS connections in any online site or service, and by following the course, you will be able to secure all your systems for free through Nginx, Let's Encrypt, Certbot and Cloudflare.\n\n\nBecause you will have the flexibility to deploy any kind of project, and the course already includes specific steps to deploy popular PHP projects like WordPress and Laravel (and more to come).\n\n\nWhat will you learn and obtain by following and finishing the course?\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to deploy your own VPS server and your own services on it, shortly and eadily. All under the best security measures and with the protection of Cloudflare to increase the security and speed of your sites.\nYou will have your own projects online without additional costs because, no matter how many domains, sub-domains or projects you put in your VPS, the cost will remain the same.\nAt the end of all the classes, you will have all your projects under a completely secure server, with HTTPS/TLS connections completely free through Letsencrypt and with an A+ rating on the secured sites.\n\n\nBut... What exactly will you learn?\nHere you have everything you can get from this course:\nCreate your own VPS server with DigitalOcean or any provider you choose\nHave a safe and friendly system with Linux/Ubuntu using its most recent LTS version (Ubuntu 20.04)\nDeploy an Nginx web server in a few minutes and with the best security settings\nDeploy a MySQL database server completely secure\nEstablish secure remote connections to your database with SSH tunnels\nEasily configure and use Git to deploy the different projects on your VPS via SSH\nLearn alternative tools such as SCP and WGet to synchronize content with your VPS\nObtain external packages and install them globally (Composer, Certbot, WP-CLI)\nCreate and configure your domain and all sub-domains, without having to pay extra\nPoint your domain to your VPS server by configuring the DNS entries\nSecure your services and projects with the DDoS protection along with security and speed enhancements from Cloudflare\nConnect to your VPS remotely, quickly and securely using SSH keys\nManage user accounts and prevent automated and external systems from accessing privileges (root)\nLearn to use the essential commands (cd, systemctl, cp, sudo, mv, rm, mkdir, reboot, and many more)\nLearn how to manage VPS packages with apt easily\nAssign permissions on folders and files in the correct way\nConfigure secure and mandatory non-password connections with SSH\nForget about insecure passwords for all the users and use SSH keys (more secure and fast)\nCreate and handle users correctly with administrative permissions (sudo)\nDeploy any kind of projects (not only PHP) in secured and protected domains and connections\nIf you use PHP, deploy different PHP projects like WordPress and Laravel on their own independent sites\nIt won't be PHP only, use and deploy any type of project you require (more will come later)\nUnderstand and take advantage of the use of SSH to connect to your VPS or external services\nConnect with third party service through SSH keys correctly\nEasily configure a firewall (UFW) and dramatically increase the security of your VPS\nConfigure your services (Nginx, PHP, MySQL, and anything you need) to make them more secure\nMitigate DoS and DDoS attacks configuring Nginx along with Cloudflare as a protection service\nPrevent automated systems from trying to access your VPS, using Fail2Ban\nEnable the Gzip compression system on your web server\nAvoid CSS/XSS attacks with Nginx\nGet security certificates for HTTPS connections for your projects with Let's Encrypt and Certbot\nInstall the security certificates in Nginx correctly, to obtain an A+ security rating\nUse Certbot to obtain and install the Let's Encrypt security certificates automatically\nCreate, use, and secure all the domains and sub-domains that you require for any project\nEasily deploy any kind of project on your VPS, applying everything you learned\nLearn to deploy and synchronize projects with your VPS in the correct and efficient way\nAnd it does not end there! You will have lifetime access to all classes, which includes new upcoming classes and upgrades. You will also have first-hand access to the system of questions, messages, and answers. I will answer all your questions and comments (I always reply). I will be pleased to help with any problem and doubt you have during the course.\nDo not wait anymore. Learn all these skills now.

      "description": "Why I created these mock exams\nOver the years, I have helped thousands of students prepare for cybersecurity certification exams. Before they spend their hard-earned money on the CISSP exam, I always advise them to solve plenty of multiple-choice questions first. Being able to answer practice questions easily and quickly can demonstrate a strong understanding of concepts, a key trait that helps students ace the CISSP exam.\nHowever, simply solving questions from a variety of sources won’t cut it. For your preparation to be effective, the practice questions must be well-written, challenging, and must test your understanding of concepts at a deeper level. And those are the type of practice questions you’ll find in these mock exams.\nWhat’s new\nI’ve updated the weightages of the mock exams based on the latest CISSP Exam Refresh that came into effect April 15, 2024. The weightages for the mock exam have been updated as follows:\nSecurity and Risk Management: 16%\nAsset Security: 10%\nSecurity Architecture and Engineering: 13%\nCommunication and Network Security: 13%\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM): 13%\nSecurity Assessment and Testing: 12%\nSecurity Operations: 13%\nSoftware Development Security: 10%\nWhat’s Included\nDesigned to help you ace the CISSP CAT exam, you’ll find two comprehensive mock exams, each containing 175 questions. Each mock exam covers all 8 domains with average weights similar to the CAT exam.\nSince the weights for the CAT and Linear exams are similar, these mock exams will help you prepare for both formats.\nIn addition to the mock exams, you will also find two “Rapid Review Sets” designed to help you practice when you don’t have enough time to attempt a full mock exam, which takes around 6-7 hours to complete.\nWhat Makes These Mock Exams Different\nThese CISSP mock exams stand apart from the competition for their meticulous breakdown of questions according to exam weightage. Each question is carefully categorized according to the correct domains specified in the CISSP exam guidelines, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate representation of the exam.\nWhat Makes These Questions Different\nI’ve worked closely with Packt to ensure each question meets the same rigorous quality standards as all of Packt Publishing’s books and courses. Moreover, most of these questions include a unique scenario that tests your understanding of CISSP concepts rather than just checking your knowledge of definitions. Here’s an example question from the mock exam:\nA contractor was brought in to develop a banking application. They are aware that some clients may attempt to withdraw money in excess of that which exists in their accounts. As a security measure, they enforce a code to secure the application. Which type of software testing can they apply to be sure that the application is secure?",

CAN is the protocol on which modern vehicles operate so first we will look at this protocol and see how the protocol works, why we need this protocol and how vehicles operate on this protocol.\nAfter understanding Controller Area Network (CAN) we will install virtual car simulator so virtual simulator is similar to real car and we can do all the basic things on this simulator which we can do on real car so before moving to real vehicle first we will see how we can work on CAN protocol in virtual car. Also this section will be helpful to everyone so those who just want to learn automobile security without touching the real car can learn all the things from a virtual car simulator.\nAfter practicing on a virtual simulator we will move on to a real vehicle so first we will see all the hardware requirements and how to create the device to communicate with the car.\nAfter creating the device we will go into the real car and test the device. Then we will perform vulnerability tests on the real car which we did with a virtual car.\nWe will cover this course on virtual car as well as on real car, so you will have a better understanding of vulnerabilities in automobiles.\nSo this course is for ethical hackers, pentesters and all types of security researchers.",

      "description": "Ethical Hacking is compromising computer systems for assessing security and acting in good faith by informing the vulnerable party. Ethical hacking is a key skill for many job roles related to securing the online assets of an organization. The professionals working on these job roles maintain the organization’s computers, servers, and other components of its infrastructure in working conditions preventing unauthorized access through non-physical channels.\nPeople believe that “hacking” means to hack any website within a minute. This concept comes from watching movies, so they do not even know the original basic concept of what it means to hack or how to do it. To crack passwords or to steal data? No, Ethical Hacking is much more than that. Ethical hacking is to scan vulnerabilities and to find potential threats on a computer or network. An ethical hacker finds the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web applications, or network and reports them to the organization. So, let’s explore the skills required to become an ethical hacker.\nEthical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.\nAlso known as “white hats,” ethical hackers are security experts that perform these assessments. The proactive work they do helps to improve an organization’s security posture. With prior approval from the organization or owner of the IT asset, the mission of ethical hacking is opposite from malicious hacking.\nWhat are the key concepts of ethical hacking?\nHacking experts follow four key protocol concepts:\nStay legal. Obtain proper approval before accessing and performing a security assessment.\nDefine the scope. Determine the scope of the assessment so that the ethical hacker’s work remains legal and within the organization’s approved boundaries.\nReport vulnerabilities. Notify the organization of all vulnerabilities discovered during the assessment. Provide remediation advice for resolving these vulnerabilities.\nRespect data sensitivity. Depending on the data sensitivity, ethical hackers may have to agree to a non-disclosure agreement, in addition to other terms and conditions required by the assessed organization.",

This course is not \"death by PowerPoint\", in fact there is not a single Powerpoint slide in the course.  This course is aimed for intermediate to advanced users who are hungry to know how to discover and exploit novel escalation paths on patched fully patched Windows 10 endpoints.  Everything is carefully, explained - step-by-step.\nAdditionally, although Metasploit is used in some attacks, we will be using less Metasploit and more manual walk-throughs because I wanted to take the time to carefully explain WHY each method works and detail how common misconfigurations happen in enterprise environments.\nWhere Metasploit is used, everything is carefully explained and deconstructed so you can understand why and how it works. Exploits start easy and escalate in difficulty as you progress through the course.\nThe Techniques\nYou will quickly learn and execute the following escalation of privilege techniques across 5 vulnerable machines\nWindows Kernel Exploits\nWeak Registry Permissions\nToken Manipulation\nCVE Exploits\nDPAPI Abuse\nAS-REP Roasting (Four New Lectures Just Added November 2021!)\nThe Tools\nYou will use msfvenom, BC Security PowerShell Empire, CrackMapExec, PSExec, WMIExec, Bloodhound, netcat, smbserver, ldapsearch, smbclient, rpcclient, hashcat, GetNPUsers, evil-winrm, wfuzz, gobuster, dirsearch, sqlmap, Mimikatz, DeepBlueCLI, Burp Suite (advanced features), Python 3, Powershell 7 on Linux and more.   You will learn IIS 10 Server Administration, how to threat hunt for SQLi attacks in web logs and much much more.\nMy dream for you\nBy the end of this course you should be able to use these techniques in:\nYour day to day work\nOSCP preparation\nCTF hacking\nAbout the lab\nThere are 10 vulnerable machines.\nNo lab setup is required as the entire environment is already established in HackTheBox VIP labs\nI wanted to make this course as realistic as possible while removing as many barriers to entry as possible so I've partnered with HackTheBox VIP labs to make it as easy as possible to get started.\nYes, HackTheBox is an additional charge but it offers hundreds of pre-configured vulnerable machines in a lab which is accessible via a VPN connection. This means you can get started right away and don't have to waste time fumbling with VirtualBox and VMWare settings on your local system. Most of the systems are also licensed which provides the best environment for realistic exploitation.\nTip:\nI made these videos so all commands are zoomed in close so you can watch on a mobile phone if desired. I hate watching videos on my smartphone and squinting at the command prompt or terminal.  Never again will that happen.",

A pipeline helps you automate steps in your software delivery process, such as initiating automatic builds and then deploying to Amazon EC2 instances. You will use AWS CodePipeline, a service that builds, tests, and deploys your code every time there is a code change, based on the release process models you define. Use CodePipeline to orchestrate each step in your release process. As part of your setup, you will plug other AWS services into CodePipeline to complete your software delivery pipeline. This guide will show you how to create a very simple pipeline that pulls code from a source repository and automatically deploys it to an Amazon EC2 instance.\n\nDuring the course we are going to be using all this AWS services: Cloudformation, CodeCommit, CodePipeline, EC2 Container Service (ECS) over Docker, CodeDeploy and CodeBuild between other Amazon web services like...\nThis course is totally practical: You will code some shell scripts, build Cloudformation templates from scratch, create and edit Dockerfiles, monitor containers execution over ECS and many more.",

But many people tell me they're confused about how to actually use it.\n\n\nWe've been implementing the Framework with paying customers for over 8 years, so I've seen lots of confusion.\n\n\nIn this course, I'm going to demystify the Framework, show you how to implement it, and give you a straight-forward method along with a free tool for automating the workflow and reporting.\n\n\nYou'll start by learning the basics of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, like who made it and who can use it.\n\n\nThen, you'll dive deeper into the framework to fully understand the Framework Core, the Framework Tiers, and the Implementation Profiles.\n\n\nYou'll also review case studies from diverse organizations across the globe, including a critical infrastructure organization, a large global business, and others.\n\n\nFinally, we'll spend most of our time learning how to implement the framework within your own organization by making a Cyber Risk Management Action Plan (CR-MAP). This CR-MAP of your organization will discover your time five cyber risks and help you to create a mitigation plan to reduce your cyber risk and make your organization more cyber resilient.\n\n\nYou'll also get a free bonus digital workbook that helps you conduct a CR-MAP step-by-step.\n\n\nRemember: Cyber criminals don't care how big or small your organization is. They only care if you're an easy target.\n\n\nThe Framework helps make you a harder target. Let's get going!",

      "description": "Have you ever felt your windows operating system is hung or becoming slow or having a BSOD? Or an application crash or application hang or slow on windows? Have you had to press the restart button of your PC or the windows server to get rid of the problem and had no clue when that issue will happen again? Or you're asked to analyse a memory dump of a compromised system for isolating a malware?. If that bothers you, this training is all about root causing and solving such complicated issues once and for all, among many other topics it covers.\nWindbg is the single most powerful, debugging and reverse engineering tool in windows platform. Windbg is like an x-ray plus mri plus ct scan for programs running on windows operating system, including the operating system itself. It helps us to root cause complicated problems like we discussed in windows ( OS ) and programs running inside the operating system.\nJust like the name implies this training has all the details which you need to master windbg. I have spent all my efforts to make sure this is the best and most complete windbg training available right now and I will keep adding topics to make sure that the statement is true in the future as well.\n\n\nTargeted audience\nDue to any reason, if you are trying to use or learn windbg, you already know what you're doing and there is no better place than this course. If you have been following my youtube series, this course is a complete super set of it. Being said that following are some of the categories of students to whom, I strongly recommend this course.\nSupport engineers\nIf you are a support engineer or Escalation Engineer who is supporting any product on windows, or Windows itself, I definitely recommend this course.\nMalware analyst and cyber security professionals.\nIf you are into core cyber security especially on windows platform this tool should be definitely in your arsenal. When it comes to reverse engineering, I myself don't prefer to compare ida pro or any other similar tool with windbg but I always found windbg is one of the most, if not THE most powerful and productive tool when it comes to reverse engineering along with debugging.\nWindows SysAdmins\nAnother main targeted set of audience is Windows administrators who always can take leverage from tools like this and know more about the product they are working with and troubleshoot problems they face at a totally different level.\nC and C++ Programmers\nLast and not least may be the most important category of students - advanced C and C ++ programmers which includes, driver developers, testers, software maintenance engineers and so on. Are you wondering why your application is crashing, hanging, slow or taking too much resources? That too happens once in a blue moon in production and you have no way to reproduce the issue in your dev environment. Are you asked to debug a problem in a code base you have no clue about? Or you just want to see exactly what that latest feature of cpp 20 is doing behind the scenes? This training is for you.\n\n\nTo summarise, this course is for anyone who wants to study windows internals and advanced production debugging on windows. Post this training you don't have to read every single windows internals and debugging books out there but you will debug whatever you want to know whatever you want to know, rather than reading some abstract result from some books.\nPost this training you will not have to read and learn OS internals from any books but you will debug and understand it as and when you need it.\n\n\nCourse Structure\nThis course has 3 chapters\nIn Chapter 1 we discuss the necessary concepts to get us started and mostly focus on the commands of the debugger.\nIn Chapter 2 we apply what we have learned in Chapter 1 to different debugging scenarios, like crashes, hangs, slowness, leaks and more. We will be using test applications for this chapter and we will have source code of these test applications. First we will discuss User mode issues and then we will go into Kernel mode.\nIn chapter 3 we will use the knowledge gained in Chapter 1 and 2 to troubleshoot real production like or production issues. In this chapter we will discuss analysis of memory dumps which we don't have source code or any idea about. We will start with issues from sysinternals notmyfault and slowly get into true production debugging scenarios. I will keep adding lessons to this chapter if there is enough interest from students on this course. Students also can submit dumps to this chapter and they can get the dumps analyzed for free of cost and share the experience with others.\n\n\nPlease refer to the course content and free preview lesson for more details about the structure and content of the course.",

      "description": "Hello and welcome to The Complete Practical Guide To Blockchain Application Development\n\n\nIf you are going to ask me which is the Information Technology Domain that is going to change the future, without any doubt I would surely say its block chain based decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\n\nPut simply, blockchain is a transaction ledger that maintains identical copies across each member computer within a network. The interesting feature is that, once an information is placed inside a block of the block chain, the tampering or changing of it is impossible.\n\n\nGovernments and financial organizations have already invested millions of dollars into blockchain research and development and most of them have already implemented blockchain in financial services and record keeping.\n\n\nAlso blockchain based smart contracts are replacing the conventional paper contracts and other promissory deeds. Smart contract is an electronic contract that can execute itself after the conditions mentioned in the contact is full-filled. Since its also based in blockchain, once created, it cannot be tampered by anyone.\n\n\nIf you are a technology enthusiast or a programmer who wish to integrate blockchain in your applications, this is the right time to get yourself a thorough knowledge about the practical implementation of blockchain.\n\n\nThere are tons of material and books out there explains, the concepts, nuts and bolts of block chain. But only a very few of them explains how it can be practically implemented.\n\n\nIn this course, I have taken extreme care to keep a 30 / 70 percentage balance between the theoretical concepts and the practical implementation respectively.\n\n\nAfter this course, you will get a clear idea of how and where to implement block chain in your existing software projects as well as your upcoming project ideas.\n\n\nHere is the overview of the list of topics that I have included in this course\n\n\nBefore we proceed with the intense practical sessions, we will have the first few secessions in which we discuss the history and the basic concepts of block chain distributed applications and smart contracts.\n\n\nIn Session 1, we will discuss the history of block chain and distributed applications. Also we will check the basic structure of a block. Which is the building block of the block chain, which is a chain of these blocks.\n\n\nIn session 2, we will understand with the help of demographics, how these blocks are linked to form a block chain and the major security measures in blockchain which makes it this much secure.\n\n\nIn session 3, we will have a small discussion about the types of networks and the concept of crypto currencies like bitcoin which is built based on blockchain technology\n\n\nIn session 4, we will have an overview of what is mean by smart contracts based on blockchain and its working. Also we will discuss the various fields of applications of block chain at present and in the future.\n\n\nAnd once we have enough basics about the concepts, we will jump directly into our first practical blokchain workshop. In which, we will build a working model of a conceptual blockchain out of simple JavaScript and JavaScript runtime called nodejs. Don't worry if you have only basic JavaScript knowledge, I will explain things very clearly that even a novice can understand and follow.\n\n\nIn session 5, we will prepare our computer by installing and configuring node js and visual studio code which will help us in developing the JavaScript blockchain\n\n\nIn sessions 6 we will create the class for a single block, which we will be using to create the block chain.\n\n\nAnd in session 7, we will create our first block in the chain called genesis block.\n\n\nIn session 8, We will and the functionality to add new blocks so that we can create rest of the blocks\n\n\nIn session 9, we will test the block addition mechanism in our in our JavaScript block chain\n\n\nand in session 10, we will implement hash verification, which is the most important security measure inside our block chain.\n\n\nIn the next session 11, we will include an additional security measure called proof of work to prevent the quick tampering attempts of our JavaScript block chain.\n\n\nIn session 12, we will implement the concept of mining rewards for the minors who mines and validate new blocks for our JavaScript block chain.\n\n\nAnd thats all with our simple JavaScript conceptual blockchain application and from the next session on wards we are going to get our hands dirty with some serious business using the actual ethereum block chain network. In the coming sessions, we will create an ethereum based blockchain and deploy our smart contract within the ethereum block chain network. For your information, ethereum is the worlds most popular open source public blockchain platform.\n\n\nSo in session 13, we will be getting our systems ready to build our ethereum block chain by downloading and installing the dependencies which include nodejs, ganache, metamask solidity language, the truffle framework and sublime text editor for coding.\n\n\nIn session 14, we will configure these dependencies and we will do a basic test to make sure everything is ready to proceed with the development.\n\n\nwe will start building our blockchain smart contract project out of solidity and ethereum. This project is a simple contest application, for finding out the best actor, with two contestants Tom and Jerry. We will have to build a block chain based app to find who is getting the maximum viewer support.\n\n\nIn the next session 15, we will create the model and class to use for every contestant in the project and we will include tom and Jerry as contestants and\n\n\nIn session 16, we will fetch the contestant list using web3js, which is the library use to interact with the blockchain.\n\n\nSince smart contract can be created once and cannot be altered, the testing procedure should be done strictly before deploying it into the blockchain network. If any mistake or bug, the only option you will have is to remove the existing contract and deploy the new one instead, which is very time consuming and inconvenient. So In session 17, the block chain will be tested by using the truffle framework's testing environment by emulating the transaction of creating users.\n\n\nTill now, all the block chain interaction happens over the node js command line interface and the truffle framework command line. Now its time to make it appear to our customers or on-line users in an attractive web based front end, using a web page. In order to proceed with that, we will create the html part of the front end application in session 18 and in session 19, we will include the JavaScript part of the simple and beautiful html page we created and we will list the contestants in our best actor contest to the public by running the lite-server which comes along with the truffle framework.\n\n\nIn session 20, in addition to the contestants listing functionality, we will add the voting functionality also to our blockchain smart contract.\n\n\nSince the members and non members of the network may use the voting app, we need to thoroughly check for the conditions and rules we implemented in the smart contract. We will test the functionality till now using the truffle framework testing mechanism in session 21\n\n\nIn session 22, we will include rules and restrictions for our best actor contest. Rules like, a user can vote only once and the user cannot vote for any non existing contestants.\n\n\nTill now the voting can only be done via a command line. In session 22, in our simple web interface, we will include the functionality to cast vote to any contestant from our web page.\n\n\n\n\nAnd in the final session, we will create an event watch which will listen for the event of voting and once the voting done, it will refresh the page and fetch data from the blockchain network so that the winner of the contest can be known every then and there.\n\n\nEven though these are sample projects, it will surely give enough insight to your mind about how the blockchain can be included into your web or mobile projects. This course will also give you enough knowledge to get yourself ahead of others in the blockchain race which have already started.\n\n\nAfter successful completion of the course, we will provide you with a course completion certificate which will add much value to your career as a developer, software engineer or as a software architect.\n\n\nSo lets jump into the future of technology using blockchain. See you soon in the class room. Wishing you a happy learning.",

To provide you with the tools to work as safely and securely as possible in public spaces, we developed a list to help you identify 7 dangers of public WiFi and what you can do to protect yourself.\n1. Theft of Personal Information\nOne of the most serious and common threats concerns theft of personal information. Personal information comes in many forms:\nLogin credentials\nFinancial information\nPersonal data\nPictures\nIf a hacker gets access to your computer or other personal devices through a compromised public WiFi connection, they could have free rein over everything stored. For example, they might get access to your login credentials and log into your bank's or credit card's website.\nOnce hackers obtained your details, they can log in to your personal pages and cause damage to your finances and reputation. If they don't get full access to the data on your computer, they could still intercept information you are sending over the Internet. This threat will be explored in more detail shortly.\n2. Cyber Attacks on Businesses\nBusiness travellers and others who are on the road throughout the day may connect to public WiFi to check their emails, download files, review customers' information, and perform various other tasks that require a network connection.\nMost businesses have security measures in place to reduce the risk of connecting over WiFi, but if you or your colleagues need to log into some sort of security tool to get access to the company's network, there are still risks with using a public connection.\nFor instance, you never know what the WiFi provider might track. A lot of public connections are free to use but that does not mean there is not a cost involved. The WiFi provider might be tracking everything you do on the WiFi connection and sell your data to advertisers.\nA good way to think about it is if you are not paying to use a service, someone else might be paying them for data about their users. You also cannot always assume you are connecting to a legitimate WiFi service, which brings us to the next potential threat.\n3. Man-In-The-Middle Attacks\nA man-in-the-middle attack happens when someone \"impersonates\" a legitimate public WiFi service to trick you into connecting. For example, say you are staying in a SleepTight hotel for the night. The hotel offers free WiFi to its guests so you power up your laptop, turn on WiFi and see a network called \"SleepTyte\". If you are not paying close enough attention, you might miss the slight misspelling.\nIn fact, the SleepTyte network is actually someone in a room down the hall who has their own hotspot set up to lure unsuspecting guests. When you connect to it, the Internet works as expected so you would not think twice. But in reality, everything you do while on that connection goes through the hacker's computer. Those \"men-in-the-middle\" could have access to all your login information, passwords and anything else you do while on that WiFi connection.\n4. Unencrypted Connections\nWhen you connect to a website that supports encryption, the data that goes back and forth gets encrypted using a secure key. If someone were to intercept that data without the possession of the key, they wouldn't be able to read it - the data would look like unreadable computer code.\nNot all websites offer encryption though. You can tell by the HTTP prefix stated before the domain name. If it starts with HTTPS, it is an encrypted site. If the web address just contains HTTP, it is not encrypted.\nWhen you are connected to a public WiFi network, anyone within range of your computer can intercept everything you send or receive. If you are connected to an unencrypted website, it will all be fully readable. How can someone intercept your network communication? They use the next listed threat.\n5. Packet Sniffing / Eavesdropping\nAnyone connected to the same WiFi network as you can eavesdrop on what you send and receive using a tool called a packet analyzer or packet sniffer. These tools provide the possibility to view everything transmitted over the WiFi network, provided it is not encrypted.\nThese tools are not inherently bad. Like many tools, you can use them for good or bad purposes. Packet sniffers let network administrators troubleshoot connection problems and other performance issues with their wireless networks (good). On the other hand, they also let hackers intercept other users' information and steal anything of any value (bad).\n6. Malware Distribution\nAnother threat that can occur while using public WiFi, is the implementation of malware on your device. Malware exists in many forms:\nViruses\nWorms\nTrojan horses\nRansomware\nAdware\nIf someone on the same public WiFi as you has bad intentions, they could plant malware on your computer if it is not protected properly. A suspect WiFi provider could use the hotspot itself to infect your computer with one or more of these threats.\nIt could be as simple as using the WiFi network to place ads on every website you visit. The website itself does not run ads, but the WiFi service can overlay them on top of other websites.\nIn that case, the ads would normally disappear once you disconnect from the WiFi and go back to your home or office connection. In more serious cases, they could install malware on your personal devices that would persist across all connections.\n7. Session Hijacking\nSession hijacking is another public WiFi security threat. In this case, an attacker intercepts information about your computer and its connection to websites or other services. Once the attacker has that information, he can configure his own computer to match yours and hijack the connection.\nFor example, hackers could hijack your connection to your bank's website after you log in. From the bank's end of the connection, it would look like your computer and since you are already logged in, the attacker would have access to everything in your account.\nHow to Protect Yourself From the Dangers of Public WiFi\nIf you need to use public WiFi, there are several things you can do to help protect yourself from these threats. Some are more effective than others, but it is good to keep in mind that hackers usually aim for the path of least resistance. If you have taken steps to protect yourself, they will more than likely move on to an easier target.\n\n\n#Happy_Learning\n#Stay_Safe\n#Stay_Secure",

      "description": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to coerce the application into making requests to unintended locations. SSRF attacks are typically used to establish connections with internal services, which are safeguarded by firewalls within an organization's infrastructure. This could result in sensitive data exposure, denial of service attacks, and in the most severe cases, remote code execution.\n\n\nSSRF is ranked as the 10th most critical security risk facing web applications today according to the OWASP Top 10 list. Therefore, mastering the ability to identify and exploit SSRF vulnerabilities has become an essential and foundational skill.\n\n\nIn this course, we dive into the technical details behind SSRF vulnerabilities. We explore methods for detecting these vulnerabilities from both black-box and white-box perspectives, along with various techniques for exploiting them. Moreover, we provide insights into preventive and mitigative measures to safeguard against SSRF attacks.\n\n\nThis course goes beyond the basics, offering a well-balanced blend of theoretical knowledge and practical experience! It contains seven hands-on lab exercises of varying complexity levels, guiding you through the process of manually exploiting the vulnerability and then scripting and automating your exploits using Python.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll not only have a solid understanding of SSRF vulnerabilities, but also the ability to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities in real-world applications. We've designed the course content to be beginner-friendly, so you'll never feel overwhelmed.\n\n\nWhether you are a penetration tester, an application security specialist, a bug bounty hunter, a software developer, an ethical hacker, or simply someone intrigued by web application security, this course is for you!",

How do hackers crack passwords, gain unauthorized access to social sites such as Facebook or impersonate legitimate users by stealing credentials?\nWhat if it were possible to pass the CompTIA Security+ exam without just reading a book or watching a video?\nWhat if you could actually create real-life attack scenarios in the comfort of your own home using the very tools the attackers use?\nMaybe You Have Questions...\nDo I need to know Linux?\nWhat programming languages do I need?\nHow long will it take?\nI'm new, where should I start?\nThe cybersecurity sector is a hot field.  According to Symantec, \"the demand for the (cybersecurity) workforce is expected to rise to 6 million (globally) by 2019, with a projected shortfall of 1.5 million\" and the 2014 Cisco Annual Security Report warned that there was an estimated 1 million openings in cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity positions are on the rise.  Cybersecurity was the top IT priority in the Obama administration and appears to be a priority for Trump as well.  There is a deep need for talented, professional white-hat hackers who can protect critical infrastructure and make a positive difference in the world.\nThis is what most people do...\nMost people who want to get into cybersecurity make the rookie mistake of wading through endless blogs, books (Messer and Myers), Youtube videos, magazines and Reddit forums trying to read everything they can about hacking.\nWith this approach, you'll probably gain some good head knowledge about how to hack, but if a potential employer gave you an Ethernet jack and a laptop and said:\nHere, go break into our enterprise - you've got 30 minutes.\nWould you know what to do?\nThe raw truth\nMost professional hackers can gain domain administrator rights before lunch.\nIt's not hard but if you don't know where to begin it can be extremely challenging.\nDo it right the first time\nThat's where the Weekend Pen-Testing Lab Creation Boot camp comes in.  This intensive two-day boot camp shortcuts your time investment by training you to build a professional-grade penetration testing lab.\nThis is a hands-on course that will transform you into a confident penetration tester (even if you have no prior experience).\nThe boot camp is a step-by-step system for building a practice lab so you can gain the experience you need to become a professional penetration tester.  You can then use your lab not only as a platform to pass the CompTIA Security+ exam but also other more advanced certifications such as the CEH \"Certified Ethical Hacker\" and others.\nBy the end of this course, not only will you know how to hack but you'll have the infrastructure in place to hone your tradecraft and become an excellent candidate for entry level penetration testing jobs.\nIf you do the work, complete the exercises and practice your hacks - you will succeed.  You will be building a professional pen-testing lab using the very same attack tools the bad guys use to breach organizations and compromise systems.\nAre you up for the challenge?\nWhen you finish this course, you will:\nFeel a deep sense of confidence and responsibility as you'll not only know how to hack Windows servers and clients but also how to explain how its done to your colleagues and friends.  You'll feel smarter because you'll BE smarter.\nFeel in control of your career as you'll have a complete hacking lab established on your computer with the exact attack tools used by black-hat hackers and professional penetration testers.\nYou'll have a platform to practice and refine your tradecraft as you attack Windows, Linux and web server systems all within the safety of your lab environment.\nHere's what you'll get\n6 hands-on modules that walk you through the basics of building a pen-test lab.  You'll learn the step-by-step process for setting up vulnerable hosts and executing sophisticated attacks against them in the comfort of your own home.  Everything takes place in a lab that emulates real production networks so you'll gain the first step of experience needed to apply for entry-level pen-testing jobs.  Another side-benefit is that you may be able to leverage the skills you gain from this course to negotiate a higher salary and more challenging career options.\n28 resource guides with summaries of all the commands used in the video lesson as well as explanations as to what each command did.\nThe course is 100% online and 100% downloadable so you can take it with you on the go even without an internet connection.\nYou have unlimited updates.  The cybersecurity landscape is continually evolving thus we are continually updating the course and adding new content to keep it relevant.  By the course one time today and you'll get grandfathered into updates forever.\nHere's what you'll create\nA pen-test lab including a Kali Linux attack box, a Windows XP host, a Windows 2008 Domain Controller and a vulnerable webserver.\nA completely isolated environment where you can perfect your skills over-and-over again without any fear of breaking a real production system\nYour time is now.\nYour Investment\nWhen you signup today you will get:\n\nThe Complete Pen Testing Lab Creation Two Boot Camp Course in 6 Modules\n30 Convenient PDF Resource Guide Cheat Sheets\nEverything is 100% Online and 100% Downloadable\nInstant Access After Purchase\nLifetime Access with Unlimited Updates to the Course\nSo let us ask you the question: do you have what it takes to be a hacker?\nAfter taking this course you will be able to confidently say: yes!",

OT is critical to the operation of critical infrastructures, which are often highly interconnected, mutually dependent systems. It is important to note that while federal agencies operate many of the nation’s critical infrastructures, many others are privately owned and operated.\nThis course was created after thoroughly understanding and practically implementing it in the OT environment, so this 6-hour course is a summarized version of the NIST 800-82 standard. It will help to understand what it contains and how it should be understood. So, the following are the basic topics that we will cover in this course:\n1. OT Overview: DCS/PLC/PLC/BACS/PACS\n2. About Cybersecurity program development\n3. Risk Management for OT systems\n4. OT Cybersecurity Architecture\n5. Cybersecurity Framework\n6. OT Security capabilities and tools\nAfter finishing this course, you will have the following understanding:\n\n\n1. Good grasp of NIST 800-82 Standard\n2. What technologies are required for securing an OT infrastructure.\n3. What is the cybersecurity framework\n4. What to do to achieve defense in depth architecture\n5. Why cybersecurity program is required and how to set up\n6. Feel confident about referring standards in professional discussions\n7. Will help in cracking interviews\nThis course provides guidance for establishing secure operational technology (OT) while addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events.\n* If video seems fast try playing at 0.75x speed\n* Connect to me on Linkedin/ or visit cyberotsecure{dot}com website to get discounts.*",

Whether they are a Fortune 500 technology company or a sole proprietor landscaping company, software is integral to businesses large and small. Software provides a means to track employees, customers, inventory, and scheduling. Data moves from a myriad of systems, networks, and software providing insights to businesses looking to stay competitive. Some of that software used is built within the organization or it is purchased and integrated. What this means is that every organization, regardless of size and industry, has a software need. It enables organizations to move quickly and stay ahead of their competition.\nThis is where organizations need your help to secure their applications!\nIn this quick guide to application security and the OWASP Top Ten we will cover what is in the Top Ten. We’ll cover what makes them vulnerabilities and how to protect your application from attacks using these vulnerabilities. Well talk about cryptographic failures, insecure configuration, how to maintain software integrity, what injection attacks are and more!You’ll learn about the terms and security goals that are used in an organization. You’ll learn about some of the basic ways that application security can be brought into the development lifecycle both from a traditional pipeline and from a DevSecOps perspective.

As the title suggests, we will cover only the Windows environment in this class, since it is by far the most used and abused. We try to provide a complete picture for the starting reverse engineer but in the same time relevant for the more advanced analysts.\nThere are always multiple ways to do a task. We will insist more on \"Why?\"s instead of \"How?\"s since we consider that it's more important to understand WHAT we're trying to achieve and WHY.\nThere are no pre-requisites for this class other that a Windows virtual machine and the will to learn. All the tools discussed here are freely available online. Analyses are demonstrated on a Windows 8.1 virtual machine.\nDon't worry! Neither professional programming experience nor assembly language knowledge are required to benefit from the course. If you know these already, it would be helpful when we’ll look at identifying encryption algorithms and bypass anti-virtualisation checks. The concepts will be explained clearly and additional resources will be recommended.\nSome programming experience will definitely be beneficial, however, the focus will be mostly on understanding the technique, the tools and their most useful features. When needed, source code written in C or Python will be provided.\nTo get the most out of this course, we recommended to try all the exercises and assignments that follow the lectures and whenever a concept or idea is not fully explained or clearly understood, either reach out with questions on the Q&A section or consult online resources.",

      "description": "*** The only Palo Alto Networks Firewall course on Udemy 100% Ethical Hacking Oriented .***\nThousand of companies get compromised every year, and unfortunately many of them had no clue they could be the target of a Cyber Attack. Too often, they thought technologies like Firewall & IPS were not necessary in their network and underestimated the risk and damage of a breach.\nIn this training, you will learn why & how the bad actors target your network. You will also understand what cyber attacks are all about and be in a position where you can better protect your assets with Palo Alto Networks Firewalls.\nThe course will give you an introduction of the kill chain used by the bad actors to take control of a network and provide a method to successfully block every stage of a hack using Palo Alto Networks Firewalls. You will receive an introduction to the different features of Palo Alto Networks Firewalls such as Wildfire, Vulnerability Profiles, and DNS Security and learn where and how to use them effectively.\nThe course also comes with different demonstrations of ethical hacking activities and configuration of your Palo Alto Networks firewall.  Like a Cyber Range Training or Blue Team / Red Team exercise you will be in the position of the attacker and the Firewall administrator to get the big picture of what Cyber Security is all about.\n\n\nWHAT OTHER STUDENTS SAY\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nThis was a great introductory cybersecurity course ! The course begins with a high-level overview of the cyber kill chain followed by a module for each step of the kill chain each of which includes a more-in-depth conceptual overview and practical demonstration, steps to prevent that step of the kill chain using Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and implementation best practices. I would definitely recommend this course to others as a brief introduction to cybersecurity (and the cyber kill chain) using Palo Alto Networks technologies.",

The goal of the course is not to protect against Wannacry, but to provide you with a methodology to be able to quickly assess the behavour of a suspicious application in a computer. The tools we are using in this course are free for personal use, but there are way more other solutions you can use for the same purpose.\nAt the end of this training you will have a solid understanding how the ransomware works and how to protect you environment, also you will be able to use the tools to identify and analyse other malicious tools. You will not be a malware analyst, this is not the course for that. This course will give you the steps to be able to do incident response in a quick manner and see what areas you need to develop yourself using other courses.

The Network+ certification by CompTIA is an internationally recognized and coveted credential providing proof of a student’s knowledge, skills and ability to manage, maintain, troubleshoot, install, operate and configure a basic network infrastructure. These courses prepare the student for the CompTIA Network+ Certification Exam N10-006.\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nThe curriculum for CompTIA’s Network+ Certification Course begins with the 7 Layers of the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) Model, OSI Data Flow and Terminology. After a basic knowledge of OSI has been built, we begin discussing Communication Between Layers. Then we delve into TCP/IP System Interconnect Model Layers, Open Systems Interconnect Model Comparisons and Application Layer Examples. Next we cover Binary Numbers and iPv4 Addressing (addressing the how’s, why’s and The Big Picture. Once broader concepts are established, student’s learn the Purpose and Properties of IP Addressing, iPv4 Bitwise Notation, Private IPv4 Networks, and Subnetting. After an extensive overview of IPv6 Addressing we switch modes to The Purpose of Routing and Switching, Common Networking Protocols and finally Installing and Configuring. At the end of this course, a student walks away having had practical experience and comprehensive knowledge allowing confident execution of the CompTIA N+ N10-006 exam.",

It's also referred to as hacking process. Any individual can perform an ethical hacking scan, but ethical hacking is most often performed by computer security professionals. An ethical hacking scan is an essential part of any cyber security strategy.\nA cyber kill chain is a series of steps done to hack a computer system. It's composed of the steps required to hack a system- from downloading the necessary software to identifying and exploiting security loopholes. Certain cyber security agencies use this as part of their hacking procedure, and anyone can learn how to perform this task. The hacker will gather information about the target computer and its environment in one of the first steps. This includes identifying the target's applications, users and data; the target's malware;\nIn this course you will learn about the Cyber Kill Chain, not just from a theoretical perspective but also using practical examples. You will learn how to hack a Windows computer, and all the steps required to get to that stage. It is a beginners course, you don't need any prior knowledge about Ethical Hacking, but some general knowledge about Linux, Virtualization or Networking is recommended.",

With more than 2 million IT certifications issued worldwide, CompTIA is dedicated to helping IT professionals lead the charge in our digitally connected world.\nFor more than 20 years, CompTIA has developed training and certification exams for computing support, networking, security, open-source (Linux) development, cloud and mobility. Our regular review and updates of exams ensure that CompTIA certifications continue to address the needs of today’s technology challenges.\n\n\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched. Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack.\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results.\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\n\n\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now “CompTIA Pentest+ PT0-002 ( Ethical Hacking & Pentest+ ) Lab” course.\nDevelop your Ethical Hacking & Pentesting skills, get CompTIA Pentest+ certification and be a certified ethical hacker\n\n\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",

      "description": "Are you a Java web developer and want to write secure code? Do you want to learn Ethical hacking and Web application security?  With this hands-on injection attacks course you will start learning web security using one of the top vulnerabilities of OWASP Top 10 list. Injection attack is still listed in top 3 attacks in the OWASP Top 10 and it is important to prevent against injection attacks to develop secure web applications.\n\n\nKrzysztof Telka: \"Nice examples, where the host is presenting step by step how to exploit the application and then how to prevent. Lot of nice tools, features to check and examine the web page in case of hackers attack. CSV/Log4J/SQL made big wow effect on my face. The atendeers they will not be dissapointed Great job Ali, Thank you!\"\nYou can always use the latest versions for spring boot, and other dependencies in this course. I will be constantly updating the dependency version in the last section's lectures. You may check that to see the required code and configuration changes for updated versions. Also if you would like to use subtitles during the course, you can turn on the captions on videos. I suggest using subtitles to make it easier to follow the lectures.\nAs part of the blue and red security teams,I have a practical knowledge and I am here to help you learn the injection vulnerability in detail\nIn this course, you will focus on different type of injection attacks;\nSQL Injection\nNoSQL injection\nLDAP injection\nLOG injection\nCSV injection\nEthical hacking and Web application security are the two important subjects of Cyber Security field and having practical knowledge about Injections will enable you to better understand the security concepts and make a quick start.\nIn this course you will follow defense-in-depth principle and apply multiple solutions to each vulnerability to secure the web application in multiple layers.\nYou will follow a hands-on approach. You will not only learn how to exploit an application using different kind of injection attacks, but also develop the vulnerable applications from scratch in which you will have a common web login module with Thymeleaf and Bootstrap for a basic front-end, with Spring security form login authentication & authorisation, and with separate applications for SQL, NoSQL and LDAP injections.\nThe applications will be developed using Java, Spring boot and Spring Data along with the most used data sources, such as PostgreSQL for SQL Injection, MongoDB for NoSQL injection and OpenLDAP for LDAP injection.\nIn each section there will be;\nDevelopment of the vulnerable web application using Java, Spring boot and Spring security\nHacking of the application with various attack payloads and with Ethical hacking examples\nProtection steps and the implementations to prevent injection attacks\nAt the end of the course you will understand the different type of injection vulnerabilities, perform injection attacks against the vulnerable web applications you have developed, and learn how to protect your applications against the injection attacks using various techniques such as,\nValidation and sanitisation using white list approach\nParametrised queries with prepared statements\nEscaping output\nUsing secure trusted libraries\nError handling and logging\nGeneral coding practices\nIf you want to skip the development and only perform the hacking of applications, you can jump into the injection lectures and download the source code provided in the resources section of that lecture. The source codes are in lecture 20 (SQL Injection), lecture 38 (NoSQL Injection), lecture 51 ( LDAP Injection), lecture 60 (LOG Injection) and lecture 74 (CSV Injection). Be aware that you will still need to install PostgreSQL for SQL Injection, MongoDB for NoSQL injection and OpenLDAP docker container for LDAP injection. You can see how to install and configure these data sources in the beginning lectures of each injection section.\n\n\nManoj Singh: \"Talented instructor and great course!!! Just a small suggestion, If you could add a chapter about \"Broken Access Control\" topic that will be a great help.\"\nFor more detailed information on the progress of this course, you can check the introductory video and free lessons, and if you decide to enroll in this course, you are always welcome to ask and discuss the concepts and implementation details on Q/A and messages sections. I will guide you from start to finish to help you successfully complete the course and gain as much knowledge and experience as possible from this course.\nRemember!

      "description": "Welcome to the Detection Engineering Masterclass: Part 1!\n\n\nTwo Part Course Overview\nThis course will first teach the theory behind security operations and detection engineering. We’ll then start building out our home lab using VirtualBox and Elastic’s security offering. Then we’ll run through three different attack scenarios, each more complex than the one prior. We’ll make detections off of our attacks, and learn how to document our detections. Next we’ll dive more into coding and Python by writing validation scripts and learning out to interact with Elastic through their API. Wrapping everything up, we’ll host all our detections on GitHub and sync with Elastic through our own GitHub Action automations. As a cherry on top, we’ll have a final section on how to write scripts to gather important metrics and visualizations.\n\n\nThis course takes students from A-Z on the detection engineering lifecycle and technical implementation of a detection engineering architecture.\n\n\nWhile this course is marketed as entry level, any prerequisite knowledge will help in the courses learning curve. Familiarity with security operations, searching logs, security analysis, or any related skillset will be helpful (but ultimately not required).\n\n\nPart One Overview\nThis is part one of a two part series on Detection Engineering! This course is meant to kickstart anyone interested in security analysis, detection engineering, and security architecture.\n\n\nThe first part is the meat of the course, where we will go over:\nDetection Engineering Theory\nSetting Up our Lab\nWorking with Logging and our SIEM\nRunning Attack Scenarios to generate logs and create alerts\nLearn how to use Atomic Red Team for testing\n\n\nThe second part deals with detection as code philosophies, which will be very Python and GitHub heavy (but don't worry! I'll walk you through everything step by step.)\n\n\nBy the end of this two part course, you'll have a full stack detection engineering architecture. You'll be able to:\nRun offensive tests\nReview the logs\nMake alerts\nSave alerts using a standardized template\nEnforce template data through code\nProgrammatically push the alerts to the SIEM\nRun periodic metrics off the detection data\n\n\nThe entire course runs ~11 or so hours in length, but should take ~20-40 hours to complete fully. All code written will be available on the course GitHub in case you'd like to skip the Python heavy sections.\n\n\nRequirements\nThe ability to run 2-3 VMs on a local machine:\nUbuntu Linux\nParrotOS\nWindows 11\n\n\nMinimum Requirements\nCPU Cores: 4\nRAM: 8gb\nHard Drive Space: 50GB\n\n\nRecommended Requirements\nCPU Cores: 6+\nRAM: 16GB+\nHard Drive Space: 50GB+\n\n\nYou can technically get by with the main host having only a couple cores and 8 gigs of RAM, but any additional resources that can be assigned to your VMs will make the process smoother.\n\n\nThanks for stopping by!",

      "description": "In this course, we will start learning Oauth2 by using a production-ready Authorization Server such as Keycloak at the beginning. That sounds reasonable, but why do we do that?\nBy using a correct implementation authorization server at the beginning, it prevents us from going in the wrong way by ensuring that the authorization server complies with the Oauth 2.0 specification correctly. Besides, we can peacefully focus on how a client communicates with the authorization server in various different flows that are available and waiting for us to learn them and understand them. At the end of the day, it is less likely that one will use the Authorization server written from scratch for their production. And more importantly, we are focusing on fundamentals as our first priority. We wanted to divide the huge concept apart and conquer each small enough pieces that can be easily comprehended from the ground up.\nHence we offload what we haven’t focused yet to another piece of software we believe it implements correctly. Once we understand ins and outs all relevant theories, then our implementation will hardly go wrong if we really wanted to implement an Authentication server ourselves, In addition, the Authorization server is unarguably a complex system. So again, we won’t implement an authorization server in this course.\nAfter we develop the OAuth 2.0 client and protected-resource. The protected resource will be a simple service that exposes APIs. Then we protected them with the Oauth2 framework. And with all solid understanding of the fundamental of how an authorization server behaves, plus the familiarity with RFC6749. Then we can at least implement a simple authorization server with joy.\nLet’s imagine that, if this course was designed completely opposite direction, that is to guide you to start building the Authorization server at the beginning, it will draw a lot of energy from us. It will keep us juggling all OAuth's roles at once, and possibly take time to correct any mistakes that may occur from misunderstanding the concept and hence it could possibly take longer to achieve that same goal. That is why this course is carefully designed to deeply understand the Oauth 2.0 framework.\nFor more information and more specialty, please find my blog under my profile picture.",

      "description": "This course is All about Practical Implementation of OSPF and EIGRP Commands and It's features. Open Shortest Path First is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol networks. It uses a link state routing algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols, operating within a single autonomous system.\nEIGRP is a Cisco proprietary routing protocol, with features such as unequal-cost load balancing, support for networks 255 hops away, and rapid convergence features. EIGRP is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol, with optimizations to minimize both the routing instability incurred after topology changes, as well as the use of bandwidth and processing power in the router. EIGRP uses a diffusing update algorithm (DUAL) to identify network paths and provides for fast convergence using pre-calculated loop-free backup paths.\nEducational training videos that are supported with step by step configuration and troubleshooting scenarios to help you understand the topics. You will also gain hands-on experience to make a competent networking professional.\nYou Will Learn How To:\nIntroduction & Concept of Dynamic Routing Protocols EIGRP.\nConfigure classic EIGRP and named EIGRP for IPv4.\nOptimize classic EIGRP and named EIGRP for IPv4.\nTroubleshoot classic EIGRP and named EIGRP for IPv4.\nIntroduction & Concept of Dynamic Routing Protocols OSPF.\nConfigure OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 in IPv4 and IPv6 environments.\nOptimize OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 behavior.\nTroubleshoot OSPFv2 for IPv4 and OSPFv3 for IPv4 and IPv6.\nConfigure and Verify Administrative Distance.\nConfigure and Verify EIGRP Auto and Manual Summarization.\nRouting Protocols EIGRP Trouble Tickets Lab & Solution.\nConfigure and Verify Bidirectional Forwarding Detection.\nConfigure OSPF on Routers with Complete Understanding and Confidence.\nConfigure EIGRP on Routers with Complete Understanding and Confidence.\nTroubleshoot various environment where OSPF and EIGRP is running.",

I am James Beers, I am currently obtaining my bachelors in cybersecurity and I have been doing bug bounties and hacking for over 3 years now. This course will teach you everything I know so far about recon. In this course, we will be covering the basics to the intermediates of recon.\n\n\nWe will be using our skills on a public lab that I have hosted on Heroku. It is juice shop and is really good for javascript enumeration and source code enumeration. Other public “labs” include the google VRP which can be found at their VRP program website. I will be teaching you how to enumerate IP addresses and versions on ports, how to enumerate subdomains from many sources and tools, and how to bring all of that data together so you can apply it. I will also teach you URL enumeration for parameters to add to a custom wordlist. Javascript reading for DOM interactions, API keys, and directories and requests that tools may miss.\nThe purpose of this course is to get your mind thinking like an attacker from the start of the recon process. I will also be going over my methodology that I developed over my 3 years of bug bounties. I have some friends who are really good at wide scope target recon and they will be sharing info to be added to this course. Please take my methodology and make it your own, you cant get somewhere new following the same roads everyone else has, but you might be able to touch the sky if you stand on the shoulders of giants.\n\n\nEnjoy the course and please download all of the notes and walkthroughs that are available.",

In this course  we will go over hands-on walk-through that enable the process of integrating a Dockerized app into a DevOps style automated workflow that includes Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) elements.  This course walks through the process of integrating a Dockerized app with DevOps style automated workflows.\nWe start off reviewing a pre-made node.js express web app no coding skill required this will run by itself. Then we develope a small test to validate the code is working. From there we uploaded or code to Github or Bit ucket and from configure Github to track all changes moving forward.\nWe then get a beginner level introduction to CircleCI  our Continuous integration platform  We create a connection between Github and Circle CI that Chircle is notified of any changes to the code are committed or pushed. CircleCI will perform test builds. Upon successful test builds,\nFrom there we get a entry level introduction to DockerHub. We then set up a webhook from DockerHub so CircleCI will run and if the test pass will trigger a new Automated Build and in DockerHub.\nDocker hub acts our a image build for our Docker Container. It informs Docker Cloud our container platform. Docker Cloud will then pull the new Docker image and deploy it as a container on the Amazon Web Service platform. The entire end-to-end workflow will be described and implemented in extensive demos, as well as demonstrating bugs in the app code and pushing fixes to production.\nBy The End of this Course you will be able to\n1)Build and Deploy Code Using an Automated Workflow\n2)Use Web Hooks in Github to Kick Automated Builds\n3)Utilize Circle CI and as A Continuous Integration Server\n4)Use Triggers and Webhooks in Circle CI to Automate Your Development Workflow\n5)Push and Pull Docker Images into Docker Hub Automagically USING Webhooks AND Triggers\n6)Integrate Docker Cloud with Docker Hub and Amazon Web Services for Autonomous Builds from Github.\n7)Build A Kick Ass End to End Automated Workflow.\nIn this course we recommend that you have some basic knowledge of what docker and what continuous deployments are is but this is not required.",

      "description": "Cyber-attacks have become so sophisticated over the years, that a new term has emerged - Advanced Persistent Threat, which we will refer to as APT. An APT is a group of individuals that have both the means and the intent to launch persistent attacks against specific targets. Understanding these groups and their behavior is important when evaluating threats against any organization.\nHackers have traditionally targeted large corporations, but today small to midsize businesses are being attacked with the same type of highly sophisticated malware. These new strains of advanced malware are often referred to as APTs\nModern malware uses Advanced techniques such as encrypted communication channels, kernel-level rootkits, and sophisticated evasion capabilities to get past a network’s defenses. More importantly, they often leverage zero day vulnerabilities – flaws for which no patch is available yet and no signature has been written.\nModern malware is often Persistent and designed to stick around. It’s stealthy and carefully hides its communications. It lives in a victim’s network for as long as possible, often cleaning up after itself by deleting logs, using strong encryption, and only reporting back to its controller in small, obfuscated bursts of communication.\nMany attacks are now blended combinations of different techniques. A common tactic for hackers is to initiate an APT with spear phishing. This involves sending a carefully crafted email that appears to be in the from of a known individual or business with a link to a malicious website or an infected download.\nOnce the initial breach is successful, attackers can further damage defenses by disabling security protocols, changing security settings or stealing passwords. Groups of highly skilled, motivated, and very well-funded attackers represent significant Threats because they have very specific targets and goals in mind – often financial gain from theft of credit cards and other valuable account information.\nHere are the topics that we will be covering in this course. We will begin by going over the APT Lifecycle and teach you a structured approach to analyze and assess inherent vulnerabilities. We will teach you mitigation and countermeasures that may prevent an attacker from gaining a foothold into an organization.\nNext, we will get you familiar with APT1 Group and some common ATPs we have seen in the last few years like Stuxnet, and two new ones, Adwind and Poseidon. Lastly, we will get you familiar with the Cyber World War.",

      "description": "This is a beginner level course on Apigee API management platform from Google Cloud. This is currently the only course on Apigee X on Udemy platform and is therefore the first of its kind.\nHighlights of the course:\nPractical exercises - 30\nAssignments   - 7\nQuizzes - 4\nGartner has recognized Google Cloud’s Apigee as a Leader in the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management\nWhat to expect from this course?\nThe course will give you the basics of API management using Apigee X and will guide you through several hands-on practical lessons that you are able to do yourself after registering for free Google Cloud trial for 90 days with USD 300 credit.\nThis is the only course on Udemy platform available so far, that targets the newly released version (February 2021) of Apigee X within the Apigee family of API Management platforms. So this course is the first and unique of its kind.\nAll the required steps to setup your Apigee platform to practice at home or office on your stand-alone dev platform have been demonstrated through video lectures.\nThis course doesn't show provisioning of production organisation but only the evaluation (Eval) organisation. Once having gone through the eval organisation setup, production organisation setup can easily follow.\nThe course has useful tutorials on setting a budget alert, enabling and disabling GCP and removing unused projects to save resources and therefore preserve your valuable credits.\nBrief exposure on Apigee Hybrid is provided for those who are exploring the hybrid world for their organisations.\nHowever it sets up the student to take a more advanced level course on the topic.\nIn this course all our references to Apigee are specific to Apigee X which is the current fresh from the kitchen version of Apigee API management platform. Apigee X is of recent origin having been in existence since February 2021. Apigee edge was the previous version. Google cloud is only supporting Apigee X for evaluation organisation. Hence this course is entirely based on Apigee X.\nThere are about 30  hands-on exercises which should give plenty of opportunity for practical training on these topics:\nGetting started with API Proxy with Apigee X (that includes: Create, Test, Deploy, Change the Target Endpoint and Adding a Policy to an API Proxy)\nSetting up important traffic management policies (SpikeArrest and Quota Policies) in API proxies\nCreate, test and deploy API with XML to JSON policy\nAdd OAuth2 authentication to an API Proxy and test it\nAdding API key to an API Proxy and test its effectiveness",

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI or GenAI) refers to a category of artificial intelligence systems that have the capability to generate new content or data that is similar to, but not identical to, existing data. These systems use machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, to learn patterns and structures from the input data and then generate new instances that share similar characteristics.\n\n\nIt has been proven that GenAI can be a useful tool for almost all industries. Whether you are a developer and need help with developing code, you are a marketing person and need some marketing materials or you need help in any other category of work, you can ask existing platforms like ChatGPT or Google Bard and there is a good chance that you will get a high quality response.\n\n\nCyber Security experts have been concerned about the usage of Generative AI and the challenges we might face in long run, but at the same time these powerful tools can be used for cyber security and assist in multiple areas as well. In this course, you will learn how to leverage GenAI solutions to build a security and compliance program for your organization with having minimum skills about complex frameworks like ISO 27001 or NIST CSF.",

      "description": "If you've been using debuggers to reverse-engineer programs and wish you had a better understanding of Assembly Language, or if you're just looking to learn Assembly Language in a fun and exciting way, then this course is for you. Embark on a journey to master the intricacies of x64 assembly language with this specialized course, designed for those aiming to elevate their reverse engineering skills. This is the second course in this series after the first one: Assembly Language Programming for Reverse Engineering. In that earlier course the focus was on x86 basics where we covered 32-bit assembly. In this course, we continue the journey by learning x64 (64-bit assembly).  In the second half of this course, we will apply all the knowledge from the first course, as well as new insights from this course, to hands-on reverse-engineering exercises with executable binaries. Taking the first course is preferable but not mandatory. You could just jump straight into this x64 course and learn the differences with x86 as you go along.\n\n\nWhile traditional assembly language courses focus on writing code from scratch using assemblers like NASM or FASM, they often leave a knowledge gap when it comes to applying that expertise to real-world reverse engineering. This course is tailored to fill this gap, providing you with the knowledge to modify and extend the functionality of existing  32-bit and 64-bit applications.\n\n\nUtilizing the powerful x64dbg debugger, we'll bypass the traditional assemblers to teach you assembly language in the context it's most used in the field: directly within the debugging environment. This is also known as the hacker's perspective to assembly language. This hands-on approach ensures that you learn by doing, which is critical for effectively reverse engineering and manipulating software.\n\n\nThis black art is not widely taught and there are no existing courses elsewhere that put together coherently all the knowledge of assembly and reverse engineering in one place. More often than not, courses on Assembly and Reverse Engineering are offered separately. Many courses on Reverse Engineering don't cover the background assembly language from a software hacker's perspective. Moreover, almost all Assembly Language courses focus on writing programs from scratch rather than modifying existing programs to add new functionality with your own code using a debugger like x64dbg.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn to:\n\n\n- Navigate and utilize the x64dbg debugger\n- Analyze and alter x64 executable files to inject custom code.\n- Harness data, executable and memory segments to expand program capabilities.\n- Develop new functions within existing applications for added functionality.\n- Understand the x64 Microsoft Calling conventions and Stack Frames.\n- Directly manipulate memory data segment\n- Bypass string encryption\n- Deep tracing to retrieve data and passwords\n- Use Python to patch process memory\n- Modify packed programs without unpacking\nand more . . .\n\n\nFeatures of this course:\n\n\nThis course is oriented towards practical applications\nNo lengthy, dull theoretical lectures\nFirst half of this course: Learn x64 Assembly Language through the x64dbg debugger\nSecond half of this course: Practice reversing, tracing, extracting data, memory hacking, and modifying executable binaries\n\n\nLearning Objectives:\nBy the end of this course, you will have a thorough understanding of x64 assembly language from a reverse engineer's perspective, a skill set that is rare and highly sought after in fields like cybersecurity, malware analysis, and software development.\n\n\nWhether you're a security researcher, a malware analyst, a student of software security, or a programmer looking to deepen your understanding of software internals, this course is your stepping stone to becoming proficient in the 'black art' of assembly language and reverse engineering.\n\n\nEnroll now to gain this competitive edge and take your skills to the next level. Let's unravel the complexities of x64 together. I look forward to guiding you through every step of this exciting journey! See you inside!",

      "description": "Virtual Extensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) is an L2 overlay scheme on top of an L3 network, also described as an L2 in L3 tunnel. It runs over the existing networks and provides the means to stretch the L2 network.  As a standardized overlay technology, multiple vendors have adopted VXLAN as a datacenter solution to provide scalability and allow layer 2 across IP network. MP-BPG EVPN as the VXLAN control plane protocol provides a robust scalable solution to overcome the limitation in VXLAN flood and learn mode. Only VMs within the same VXLAN segment can communicate with each other. Each VXLAN segment is identified by a 24 bit segment ID called VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI). This helps to overcome the 4094 VLAN scale limitation and enables extension to 224 segments. VXLAN uses BGP as its control plane for Overlay. It makes its forwarding decisions at VTEPs (Virtual tunnel end points) for L2 and L3. Forwarding happens based on MAC or IP learned via the control plane (MP-BGP EVPN) . VXLAN uses IGP, PIM and BGP as its underlay in the fabric.\nThis lab introduces students to the industry standard MP-BGP EVPN and Cisco implementation of VXLAN on NXOSv. Student will use virtual Nexus switches to implement MP-BGP EVPN VXLAN control plane. Upon completion of this lab, users will able to\n• Manually configure BGP EVPN in a standard Spine-Leaf topology\n• Use command line to verify VXLAN/BGP EVPN.",

      "description": "Incident Response Course Syllabus\n\n\nCourse Overview\nIn this course you will learn how to use open source tools for incident response purposes.   This course utilizes first hand explanations and screencast demonstrations of how to use these tools in a step-by-step manner so you can start incident response work immediately on your own.\nTable of Contents\nCourse Overview – Introductory Lesson\nIncident Response - Incident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or attack .  The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs. An incident response plan includes a policy that defines, in specific terms, what constitutes an incident and provides a step-by-step process that should be followed when an incident occurs.\nCyber Attacks - Here we will cover CyberAttacks on Wi-Fi networks and over the web so you can understand how to respond to them.\nVirtualization and Cloud Security - So virtualization can mean many things at different layers of the stack.   At the network layer you have VLAN’s, MPLS networks and even SDN (Software Defined Network) technologies such as Openflow.    At the storage layer you have VSAN’s.     At the Hardware and OS layer you have hypervisors for machine virtualization and containers for runtime virtualization and isolation.     Databases have even gotten in on the act using container technology.\nMalware - In this section we will define Malware categories and characteristics and talk through protective countermeasures to keep networks, systems and data safe from compromise. ‘\nStatic Malware Analysis –\nAnalyze malware statically in VM environments.\nOperational Security - Once we have a Risk Management program in place we need to implement operational security to manage the day to day aspects of security.    In this lesson you will learn about Operational Security Controls what they consist of and how they help us to incrementally manage risk on a daily basis.\nLesson 7 – Disaster Recovery - While at first glance DR might not seem like a natural fit with cybersecurity after further analysis we realize that disasters are threats that can inflict much more damage than any hacker.   Here we will talk about DR planning, strategies and best practices.\nPlatform Hardening and Baselining - Minimizing the attack surface area of operating systems, databases and applications is a key tenet of operational security.   In this lesson you will learn about techniques for OS/DB and App hardening.\n\nLesson 9 - Advanced Perimeter Security - While many argue that with the advent of mobile technologies and the cloud the perimeter is dissolving, it will remain a key component in securing network resources for years to come.    Here we’ll cover Load balancers, forward and reverse proxies, API Security Gateways,  Firewall rules and Unified Threat Management technologies.\nIDS - Intrusion Detection technology is offered in multiple flavors.    They are either network based or host based and can be detective or preventive in nature.\nAdvanced IDS - Previously we’ve talked about IDS basic concepts.   Now it’s time to cover advanced IDS architectures, standards and further explore the inner workings of statistical and Rule based IDS.\nSnort and Bro – In this lesson you will learn how to use Snort and Bro NIDS/HIDS by example.\nHoneypots and Honeynets - Luring attackers away from critical data and studying their behavior can help us to protect the data that matters most.   Let’s found out how we can use honeypots to tie up attackers and find out what they are up to.\nKippo SSH Honeypot\nFirewalls - In this lesson we will cover the evolution of firewalls and their capabilities.\nApache Security Logging – Apache is still the most popular web server by install base on the web.   Let’s learn how to log malicious activities using Apache logging.\n\nSIM - Management of logs is a key component of operational security.    These days the velocity, variety and volume of data collected via logs has catapulted log management into the realm of Big Data.   You will learn how to effectively manage these logs and derive useful security information from them.\nForensic Duplication\nLearn how to acquire a forensic duplicate using Linux based tool",

There is a significant increase in cloud migration during the COVID pandemic situation because every organization wants their work force to work remotely. Public cloud providers are helping organization at every shape to continue their business in this pandemic situation.\nWhile moving to public cloud, security is still one of the main concern for organization because they are moving from a full controlled environment to Shared responsibility model.\nIn on premise network, security was the responsibility of corporate security team, but in cloud due to the overlapping roles, now security is not just the responsibility of corporate security team.\nInfrastructure team who create and maintain the cloud infra and Application team or DevOps team who deploy application to cloud infra is equally responsible for cloud security.\nWhich means understanding security in cloud is not just important for security team, It is also important for cloud admins and DevOps team.\nIn cloud, security controls are primarily comes from cloud native tools.\nThese native controls are good to start with but they provide limited visibility and control. For example - Azure Network security group is very good at access control level but it can't do deep packet inspection and understand the network communication at application layer.\nThis is where you need a dedicated security solution. Now, Azure Market place offers multiple dedicated network solutions and Check Point is one of them.\nCheck Point is an Israel based security company and it is one of the oldest security company exists from last 25 years. They are the one who invented the stateful firewall technology.\nCheck Point has evolved very quickly to adopted cloud and it integrates well with almost all major public cloud vendors like - Azure, AWS, GCP, Oracle, Alibaba etc.\nIn this course we will learn how to design, implement and operate Check Point Cloud Firewall in Azure Cloud. This is a hands on course and it assumes that students has basic knowledge of Azure and Network Firewall.",

      "description": "Welcome to the all-encompassing \"SNMP Protocol Mastery\" course. SNMP, which stands for Simple Network Management Protocol, is the linchpin of efficient network management and monitoring. In this extensive program, we leave no stone unturned as we embark on a journey to demystify SNMP and arm you with the knowledge and hands-on skills required for effective network administration.\nFirst, we lay the foundation by unraveling what SNMP truly is. You'll grasp the essence of this protocol and understand its pivotal role in managing network devices. Central to SNMP are two key players: the SNMP Manager and the SNMP Agent. The SNMP Manager is the control center, communicating with SNMP Agents situated on network devices to oversee and configure them. A crucial aspect of SNMP is the MIB (Management Information Base) file, which serves as the structure for SNMP communication.\nTheory is essential, but we don't stop there. Hands-on experience is paramount. You'll learn to craft custom MIB files, giving you the ability to tailor SNMP management to your specific requirements. Real-world applications are our focus, including WiFi status monitoring on Windows systems. We guide you through enabling SNMP services on both Windows 7 and Windows 10, and we show you how to install free SNMP Managers on Windows.\nBut that's not the end of our journey. We delve into the practical use of Java and Python as SNMP Agents, Managers, and Trap senders and receivers. You'll also discover how to convert a Raspberry Pi into a potent monitoring device by installing SNMP Agents, enabling remote access, and using it for SNMP trap transmission and reception. If you're operating in the cloud, we've got you covered, too, with insights into SNMP operations on Google Cloud.\nLastly, for those managing Dlink routers, we guide you through enabling SNMP Agents for streamlined network management. This course is designed to make you proficient in SNMP, transforming you into an adept network administrator and monitoring expert. Join us on this SNMP Protocol Mastery journey to unlock the potential of efficient network management and monitoring.",

      "description": "The Internal Security Assessor qualification was designed to help people perform internal audits for their own company and to make a list of fix items as they relate to PCI DSS compliance.  You should be sponsored by your company before registering for the official exam with the Security Council.  This certification will enable you to act as a go-between with external PCI auditors such as a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and your company.\n\n\nThe practice test is 60 multiple choice questions and a second test with 40 bonus questions.  Before taking the ISA exam with the security council, students will need to take and pass the online PCI fundamentals primer before completing the qualification course.  The security council offers a 2-day course that will cover the PCI DSS requirements and what the Report on Compliance (ROC) entails.  After completing the class, you can take the test and annual re-certification will be required similar to the Qualified Security Assessor certification.  Please refer to the PCI DSS Security Council website for more information regarding ISA training classes and exams.\n\n\nThe qualification process involves the following three primary steps (described further below):\n\n\n1. Sponsor Company Qualification: The candidate organization must apply for qualification as a Sponsor Company. Applying for qualification requires submission of a complete Sponsor Company Application Package (defined in Section 1.2.1 below), including executed Sponsor Attestation. Sponsor Company qualification occurs once the above has been processed and the applicant has been notified by PCI SSC.\n\n\n2. ISA Qualification: The process whereby employees of Sponsor Companies may be trained, tested, and ultimately qualified as PCI SSC-approved “Internal Security Assessors” or “ISAs.” ISA qualification registration on behalf of the ISA candidate is achieved by its supporting Sponsor Company employer (by submitting a training request through the Portal), payment of applicable ISA Program training fees by the Sponsor Company (see Website for ISA Program Fees), successful completion of ISA training and examinations, and the ISA candidate accepting the ISA Attestation through the Portal.\n\n\n3. Annual Re-Qualification and Good Standing: To maintain “Good Standing,” a Sponsor Company must satisfy the requirements in Section 2.2, including but not limited to payment of applicable ISA training fees. To maintain “Good Standing,” an ISA must satisfy the requirements in Section 3.3, including but not limited to successful completion of all required ISA requalification training and exams.",

You'll also be able to create malicious executables that take over the targets computer.\n\n\nThe course contains a demonstration of running an exploit that crashes a Windows 2000 computer. By the end of this course, you should be able to configure and run exploits, to run brute force password attacks and also to create malicious executables that give you complete remote control over the targets computer. That includes doing things like downloading files, browsing files, uploading files, taking screenshots, recording the microphone, starting web cam and much more.\n\n\nThis is a beginners course, you don't need any prior knowledge about ethical hacking but you should have Kali Linux at hand. Kali Linux is a system that is designed for hacking, which happens to be Linux based. You can get this system for free, by downloading the iso file and putting it onto a usb. A more simple way is to just ship a Kali Linux Live USB to your home address. Once you start Kali, you'll have many hacking tools at hand",

This is the ultimate practice exam course designed to help you confidently prepare for and pass the latest CompTIA Security+ certification exam. Whether you're a beginner in cybersecurity or an IT professional looking to validate your skills, this course will help you get an understanding on what to expect when tackling the multiple choice questions on your exam.\n\n\nThese questions are designed to challenge you. Every question is part of the Security+ 701 exam objectives and are full of acronyms, just like what you WILL see on your exam. You will have loads of acronyms.\nEach question will have an explanation to further help you understand the question, as I personally believe that is the best way to learn when taking practice exams.\n\n\nThe practice exams consists of the 5 domains:\n\n\nGeneral Security Concepts\nThreats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations\nSecurity Architecture\nSecurity Operations\nSecurity Program Management and Oversight\n\n\nRemember, these questions are to mimic the type of questions you will see on the actual exam, in both format and difficulty. These aren't questions taken from other areas on the internet like other courses on here, these are questions that have not been seen before. And that's important. A lot of courses on here are just repeat questions from other resources/courses. I also want to mention that there are no performance based questions on here, and that is intentional. There is no way to appropriately add a simulation similar to what you will see on the actual exam using Udemy, so I don't want to provide material that doesn't adequately prepare someone.\n\n\nTo get the best out of this course, please take the questions seriously. Plan ahead like you would with the real exam, don't take breaks during the practice exam, and flag/skip if you're unsure until the end. I provide a lot of content for free, and most of my content will always be free. My courses will always be the lowest price that Udemy will allow, as I truly want people to succeed.\nGood luck!\n- Cyber James",

      "description": "The Internet of things is the network of physical objects or things embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity which enables these objects to collect and exchange data whereas IoT Pentesting is much like taking a battering ram to the door of a fortress. You keep pounding away but try to find a secret backdoor to enter through.\nWith this practically oriented course, you will first start with deep dive into common IoT components and technologies to protect your systems and devices. Then you will explore some common IoT use cases across Industries for connected vehicles, microgrids and enterprise drone systems, along with this you will also be focusing on threats to IoT systems, attack vectors, current security regulations, and standards and common security architectures. Moving on, you will learn how to perform pentesting on advanced IoT Devices including Amazon Eco, Logitech Cameras, the Google Nexus phone, Vyos Gateways, TP-Link Smart Switches, and firewalls to ensure that the hardware devices and the software are free of any security loopholes.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 2 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Fundamentals of IoT Security will cover fundamental aspects of the Internet of Things, to include a review of use cases across various industries, we will discuss common IoT components and technologies to provide a baseline understanding of the systems and devices that you need to protect. We will also review common security architectures that can be applied to IoT systems, and discusses regulations and standards that apply to secure IoT systems. We will study of IOT components such as the IoT (hardware, real-time operating systems (RTOS), Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), messaging and communication protocols and backend services. We will discuss threats to IoT systems, attack vectors, current security regulations, and standards and common security architectures. We will examine Privacy by Design (PbD) principles and walk through an example Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). By the end of this course, you will understand the fundamentals of IoT systems and IoT security and be able to identify threats and required mitigations to their own IoT systems.\nThe second course, Hands-On IoT Penetration Testing begins with the IoT device architecture to help you understand the most common vulnerabilities. You'll explore networks, sniffing out vulnerabilities while also ensuring that the hardware devices and the software running on them are free of any security loopholes. Moving on, you will learn how to perform pentesting on advanced IoT Devices including Amazon Eco, Logitech Cameras, the Google Nexus phone, Vyos Gateways, TP-Link Smart Switches, and firewalls. By the end of the course, you will be able to create IoT pentesting reports. After completion of the course, you will be able to penetrate even the most densely populated IoT networks.\nAbout the Authors:\nBrian Russell is a chief engineer focused on cybersecurity solutions for Leidos.
