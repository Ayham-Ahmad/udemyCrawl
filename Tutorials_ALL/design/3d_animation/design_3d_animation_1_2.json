This is a creative coding course, where you learn to create programs that animate for you, rather than you manually creating keyframes in a traditional sense of 3D animation.\nThis 2 hr 45 min course, is packed with code snippets, techniques and workflows that I've acquired creating interactive art and multimedia installations in the field. Here are just a few lists of thing you'll do:\nConfiguring a Unreal Engine project for interactive art (disabling GameDev features).\nCreating 'plugin' like functions that can be reused and repurposed in later projects.\nUsing vector math to achieve several procedural FX and animations.\nLinking a mobile device through OSC (Open Sound Control) to create an immersive experience.\nOptimization of the UE5 physics system to increase performance and computational stress.\nAs an artist or designer, it's not easy to dive into programming and Unreal Engine can be quite overwhelming. However, like everything with repetition and many practical projects you'll soon realize that it is not too difficult and more of an issue of time.\nFor programmers wanting to create more aesthetically pleasing work in Unreal Engine. This course will allow you to see through the lens of an artist and how to think differently if you are more used to creating programs for traditional GameDev contexts.",

      "description": "In this course, we intend to give you a solid set of techniques and tools to begin your jorney in this exciting frontier called Virtual Production. The tutorial series uses a practical, hands-on approach to teach you how to build VP projects and applications using the Unreal Engine. Each chapter walks you step-by-step through the process of building the essential building blocks of a VP you can use in your own studio application. We pair these steps with in-depth explanations of what's really going on when you follow them and why things are done the way they are. It's this why that matters.\nUnderstanding how the underlying systems and ideas work is crucial to the work you'll do on your own after you've finished these tutorials, and, in this class, we've tried to give you both—an understanding of what to do to build a VP application, and the background you'll need in order to use this course as a springboard for your own wor.You should come away from this course with a solid understanding of how VP workflows are built, and what specifically you need to know and understand about the Unreal Engine 4.25, 2.46+ and Blender 2.83+ to set this all up!\nMost of the software used in this course is free to use even for commercial projects to use so you can get started right away. It's our hope that the work we do together here will set you up to take your exploration into this new frontier wherever you want to go.Who this course is for If you're interested in creating Virtual Production setups, VR games or applications, interested in seeing how VR makes VP work eaiser this content is for you.\nIf you are just interested in exploring VR and seeing what it can do for VP, this course also for you. You don't have to be an experienced engineer or even deeply experienced with Unreal Engine to benefit or get started with this course; we explain everything as we go.\nViewers who are entirely new to Unreal Engine will find it helpful to run through Epic's getting started tutorials before diving in here, just so you know where everything is, but this course is carefully stuctured appropriate for both experienced Unreal users who need to learn specifically how Unreal works with VP, and for new Unreal users just finding their way around.\nWhether you're entirely new to VP development and to Unreal, you've already been working in another engine, or you know your way around Unreal but are new to VP, this masterclass should be able to provide a lot of value. And we hope even those already well versed in VP&VR creation using Unreal Engine find a few interesting new perspectives and techniques as well.\nWe plan to update this course every two to three months with fresh VP content as new features get added. This is a WIP and all our courses get updated for years after release. We keep content up to date as new engine updates come every month. Do not miss out on this opporunity join today and start shooting today using Virtual Production!",

The final stories and editing are so unique project-to-project that I have chose to focus on these animation methods.\nCheck out the trailer and free lectures to learn more about the amazing world of Motion Comics, and see you in class!",

It is a very ergonomic software which allows to make simple animations for presentations, or for social networks, but which also allows to make much more advanced animations with the creation of characters and puppets.\nWho is the course for?\nThe course is aimed at all people who want to get started in animation with reference software. You are beginners in graphics and animation, or simply in animation, the course will be adapted to your research. You need to make animations for personal or professional projects, then the course will be an excellent basis for carrying out your animations.\nDescription of the course\nIn this course you will learn how to use Adobe Animate from scratch. We will work in a learning logic, namely the discovery of the dashboard, to then work on the design part. The different tools will be seen in detail for the design. Once this big part is designed, we will work on a big animation part. We will thus see how to use the timeline with the images, and to realize animations with several examples.

I have taught a lot of students how to make art for games; specially in the fields of environment art.\n\n\nBy the End Of This Course, You Will Be Able To:\nCreate a Dark and Moody environment for games using the new methods and workflows\nMake an environment in a no-concept-art situation, by looking at references and mixing with your own ideas\nUse Modularity, Vertex Blending, Decals for the most variety\nPut a difference between hero props and secondary props, and learn where to sacrifice quality to save time and energy; and spending it on other places.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\nHow to plan for an Environment Art piece\nMake a blockout to ensure that the ideas are working correctly\nWhen to rush for a prop and where to put details\nHow to sculpt in Zbrush for environments\nMaking Master Materials for games\nHow to set to simple yet effective Niagara particles to add motion to the scene\n\n\nCourse Project Overview:\nWe will first start by taking a look at references, in this scenario we do not have an actual concept art. So we create a mood board by existing photos and then combine them in our mind to get a sense of the final product. Then to make sure that the idea is going to work, we will set up a blockout of the scene to get a feeling about the scale, composition and probability of the environment. Then we will start to generate art to replace the blcokout, and we do it in an iterative fashion, we do not make anything in one go; but rather we do it in multiple steps. We are going to create a lot of props and textures for this project, and we learn which props are more important and why? And of course where to sacrifice quality on some props to put that saved time and energy for another more important prop. We have a focus on material creation and how to reuse the same material and changing it in multiple scenarios for multiple use cases. We will learn about setting up a modular environment and how to clear the repetition by using vertex blending decals and set dressing props. And games are all about saving for performance, so we are going to learn some simple techniques to work more efficiently. Finally, there is going to be some content relative to the VFX and lighting.\n\n\nWho is This Course For?\nI have designed this course for intermediate 3d environment art students, who want to make beautiful looking environments, but they struggle to get it because they don't find a tutorial which is a step by step, no fast-forward, no skip.\nThe course is also for artists who want to speed up their workflow in Unreal Engine 5, Blender, Substance 3D Designer, Substance 3D Painter and Zbrush and improve their skill in creating an environment.\n\n\nWho is Not The Ideal Student For This Course?\nThis course is not designed for absolute beginners.\n\n\nWhat Are The Requirements Or Prerequisites For Taking This Course?\nI expect you to have some sort of basic experience with these software packages.\nYou should have the software packages installed on your computer.\n\n\nJoin Me Now:\nSo if you want to make a realistic environment, then join me now, and take your skills to the next level. Don't forget that investing in yourself will pay for the rest of your life. Hope to see you in the course.",

      "description": "You will learn to work in the coolest and rapidly evolving 3D package, which in my opinion is Blender.\nYou will master the use of Substance Painter, which is currently the most in-demand software in the market for texturing game models.\nYou will build and texture a AK-47 model that can be integrated into any game engine and game.\nThis course is the largest course I have ever done. It took more than three months to develop. My goal was simple: to teach Blender and Substance Painter from scratch and to bring students to a level that meets all the standards of the modern gaming industry.\nWe will start by dissecting the Blender program and learn from scratch:\nthe program interface\nnavigation in the viewport\nBlender settings\ntools (all of them)\nworking with modifiers\ndownloading and learning to use many useful addons\nand everything else necessary for a quick start in the program.\nNext, we will set up reference images and start modeling our objects. During the modeling process, I will explain all the necessary nuances so that, based on this model, you will be able to independently build and assemble any other model after completing this course. You will be provided with a collage of reference images for work. I will also show you how to work with a small program for reference images (Pureref).\nPrimarily, we will use Hard Surface modeling techniques to create objects, but also, for general development, we will build a couple of objects using subdivision.\nAfter the modeling stage, we will move on to the UV unwrapping stage and learn to use Udims (multiple UV squares for one object). I will try to acquaint you with all the intricacies of this process.\nThen we will create the high-poly version of our object for further baking deformation maps in Substance Painter. We will create high-poly in Blender, through modifiers, and, in a couple of moments, sculpting. At the moment, I believe this is the simplest and most convenient way to create high-polygon models.\nAfter that, we will export our models in OBJ format and import them into Substance Painter to bake deformation maps and texture them. And we will start our work stage in Substance Painter.\nFirst, I will teach you how to work in the program. Again, this includes:\nnavigation\nbaking deformation maps\ninterface\nlayer system\nsettings\ntools\nmasks\ngrunge and generators\nfilters and everything you need for free work in Substance Painter.\nAfter that, we will create material after material and texture our model using many diverse and cool texturing techniques and reference images. After the course, you will be familiar with the overwhelming majority of techniques that I know myself. Including:\nCreating various textures\nPoint placement of scratches or any other defects through overlay modes\nEmbedding hard surface details in the normal map (decals) and much more.\nAfter the texturing stage, we will export our texture sets and import them into the Blender file, properly load them, and fix any problems that arise.\nNext, we will set up the scene for rendering. The rendering stage will include:\nCreating composition and backdrop\nSetting up and adjusting the camera\nSetting up and adjusting lighting\nRender settings\nRendering multiple compositions (you can see them in the promo video for the course)\nFlyover of our gun with the camera (also seen in the promo)\nCompositing in the third-party program Luminar neo (Optional step, you can skip it).\nIn the end, you will be able to work in 2 programs (actually in 4 if you count Pureref and Luminar neo), learn to build, texture, and render complex and modern models, and take a giant step towards working on game creation.",

      "description": "You probably have always wondered, how to make your Zbrush models animation ready and prepare them for texturing? How to make this retopologizing step that everybody is talking about? How to make this jump from couple of million polygons to just a few thousand? All those questions, and more, will be answered in this course.\n\n\nMy name is Niko, and i am a 3D character artist for more than a decade now. I have made numerous characters for numerous games. And for all of them i was using the style of retopologizing and UV mapping i will show you in this course.\n\n\nUsing the retopology and UV unwrap tools that come default with 3ds Max, we will retopologize a simple cartoon character. We will then make it's UVs, so he is ready for baking and texturing in Substance painter (whch we will do separately in the Substance painter course). As a bonus i will show you how to retopologize and unwrap an animation ready realistic head with open mouth and also a realistic hand.\n\n\nIn this course we will learn:\n\n\nPreparing your mesh in Zbrush for export\nExporting your meshes from Zbrush and import them in 3dsMax\nBaiscs of 3dsMax, needed for retopology\nHow to start the retopology of a character\nRetopologizing tricks and hints\nBasics of 3dsMax UV unwrap\nHints and tips on efficiant and quality unwraping of a character\nExporting a high poly  realistic head from Zbrush and importing in 3dsMax\nRetopologizing a realistic head with loops in the right places ready for animation\nMaking good and useful UV map of a human head\nRetopology of a human hand\nUV mapping of a human hand\nSome interesting random artistic stuff when we are doing something repetitive :)\n\n\n\n\nWe will start in Zbrush, where we will spend some time to organize, merge and prepare the high poly meshes for export. Then we will decimate the high poly so we can import it in 3dsMax without too much performance issues. We will see how to export meshes from Zbrush and import them in 3dsMax. Then we will get familiar with the retopology tools and get some basic knowledge about 3d Max.\n\n\nAfter that we will start the retopolology from the head and horns, and then going trough every separate pieces we have, like the arms, shoulders, cape and legs. As we go i will tell you how i do retopology and how i approach the problems when retopologizing.\nWe will then get familiar with the UV unwrapping capabilities embeded in 3dsMax, and we will start unwrapping the character piece by piece and checking our unwrap with a checker texture. When we finish, we will arrange all the pieces in a sqare texture space like a puzzle.\n\n\nWhen we are done with that we will export a realistic head from Zbrush, and import it in Max so we can start making it's topology. We will make a topology which is animation friendly and also include the inside of the mouth. Next will be, of course, making the UV unwrapping of the head, in which i will show you how to use Zbrush as a very good unwrapping tool. We will do all this steps again for a realistic hand too.\n\n\n\n\nI made this course for absolute retopology beginners and no previous knowledge of 3dsMax is required. I made this course in 3dsMax, because i always made my retopologies and UV mapping there, i think it is a pretty good software for this purpose, and i am ready to prove it! So see you in the first video of the course!",

Some experience with Blender 3D and Premiere Pro will also be helpful.\nIn this tutorial, we're gonna be covering the basics of Importing Models, Rigging, Texturing and Animating so you can take your 3D Art skills to the next level.\nThe good thing about this class is that this class will show you the raw process of a 3D artist in creating art. We will be solving all problems and making all creative decisions together!\nSo what are you waiting for? Just start this class today and take your Unreal skills to a whole new level!\n\n\nProject:\n\n\nThe project is quite simple! You need to first watch the whole course and then make your own 3D scene of a car! You can either use the same 3D models which I used, or you could use others! You must use all the techniques and skills taught in the class to make sure that you are actually learning something new! You get extra points if you model the car yourself too because that will really enhance your modelling skills as well!\nBe sure to change things up by using your own unique colors and lighting setups!\nGood luck!",

Storyboarding is just that - the blueprint of your film, or any film.\nIt is a cheaper way to understand whether your story is working or not before even starting the production.\nHere I´m going to teach you how to use camera angles, framing, and pacing to deliver strong story beats.\nYou will get a quick course on perspective and why is that important when you storyboard.\nAlso, you will learn how to draw fast. Because when you are in production working for a big company, you will need to produce a lot of panels per day. And for that, speed is even more important than clean drawing.\nI will guide you step by step through this course using simple examples so you can dive into the Art of storyboarding and start applying it to your own projects or create a portfolio to apply to movie companies.",

      "description": "Have you ever wanted to breathe life into your game world through foliage like plants, grass, water lilies and reeds?\n\n\n'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation' is very different to any other 3D modeling course out there! Our focus is to create an entire foliage pack completely made in Blender - one of the top open-source and free 3D modeling software out there.\n\n\nWe will not be using any other software to create all that you see in the thumbnail, except Blender. You will also learn about plant and grass animation, and as an added plus, you will learn about how to integrate foliage into a game engine - Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\nThis is great because it means you will get to see how we make foliage from scratch and import it into video games. I am sure 'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation' will be the one course that you will want to keep handy anytime you need to create variations of foliage.\n\n\n\n\nOur 'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation' top 6:\n1.   Creating vegetation from a simple plane and turning it into a 3D foliage (i.e., modeling from 3D plane)\n2.   Making use of Blender’s particle system to model foliage including flowers\n3.   Learning about optimisation and the importance of low poly modeling to get a best performace out of a dense foliage setup within any scene at the same time as maintaining the stylized visuals of custom painted foliage\n4.   Using weight painting techniques to get better control over foliage position\n5.   Creating materials for the foliage using UE5 texture customisation and the wind system\n6.   Learning how to paint water foliage into a scene and how to get more depth out of its volume, painting plants on top of water, inside the water, and underwater\n\n\n\n\nNow, there are courses out there that can show you how to create grass that reacts to wind, but there is nothing that covers the entire process from flowers and plants to grass, and even water lilies and reeds. 'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation' is intended to be the complete guide to creating foliage in Blender.\n\n\n\n\nBlender: 3D Modeling\n'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation’ will see you creating 12 different types of foliage with over 30 variations. We start our journey from a simple cube and we through all the techniques you will need to create flowers and stems. This will include low poly modelling techniques as well as more advanced Blender functions using the Bezier curve functions.\n\n\nAs we progress through 'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation', we will be increasing the difficulty of the foliage we are creating. You will also be learning about the most fundamental 3D modelling skills, including how to properly UV plants ready for adding materials to them.\n\n\nYou will be learning about Blender's powerful texture painting workflow. I will be supplying some of my very own custom alpha brushes which you can use in your 3D models and scenes. The texture painting part of 'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation' is huge and has a lot of depth to cover, showing you everything available in Blender. This includes custom brushes, cavity masking, and different map types.\n\n\n'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation’ will introduce you to particle system setups. This will show you how to populate an area with plants and grass in a natural way, with complete control over placement and smaller variations.\n\n\n\n\nBlender: Animation\nFinally, creating your foliage pack which will include grass, flowers and stems, reeds, and water plants, you will be animating all parts using Blender.\n\n\nWe will be going through the entire process of bringing the foliage to life by creating realistic movement. This will consist of adding wind and turbulence to our blender scene.\n\n\nThis will add a massive amount of realism to any Blender renders you might create using the foliage you created in 'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation'.\n\n\nBest of all, we will also be covering how to light your scene using real-world lighting techniques. To finish off the Blender section, I will be showing you the correct way of exporting foliage to game engines like Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\n\n\nUnreal Engine 5: Game Engine Integration\nThis section of 'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation' has as much depth as the Blender part. We will cover everything from importing foliage to setting up vertex painting and creating materials. Finally, we will be looking into the foliage tools available in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), including setting up realistic wind animations.\nYou will become a master of using the foliage tool in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). With it, you will be able to set up foliage with all of its settings. You will find out how to change and randomise scale, how to change allignment, and how to make adjust foliage density to achieve nice variation over an entire foliage painting process.\n\nFinally, the Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) part includes a full environment scene composition guide for to enhance your environment without cluttering up the terrain.\nSince 'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation' has two parts based on Blender and Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) respectively, your UE5 milestone project will be to present your foliage set in Unreal Engine 5 using a prepared environment included in the course resources and render out a scene.\n\n\n\n\n'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation' is unique because all the foliage is made entirely in Blender. That means it can all be created entirely for free once you realize the true power of this amazing software.\n\n\nSo, come join me on this amazing course and you will never be stuck again when it comes to bringing your scene to life!\n\n\nYour project will be to model, texture, animate, and optimise 12 different types of foliage with over 30 variations. Of course, you could set yourself a challenge and diversify aspects or details of foliage like plants, grass, water lilies and reeds. You could change the textures, and add different variations or more types of plants, such as different wall-climbing plants, bushes, and shrubbery, to make your environments more alive.\n\nI imagine you using flowers, plants, water lilies and reeds in the fields surrounding the farm in 3D Tudor’s ‘Blender 3 The Ultimate Medieval Scene Course’!\n\n\nTo get you pumped, imagine how well this 3D foliage set fits in with your other 3D Tudor projects.\nBe creative! Feature your foliage set around a medieval castle keep with ‘Creating a Modular Kitbash in Blender’. Also, think about using them in other medieval environments such as:\n\n\n- Around a gipsy carriage in ‘Substance Painter to Unreal Engine 5 Masterclass’;\n- All around the ‘Unreal Engine 5 Beginners Guide to Building an Environment Course’ course scene to transform its landscape;\n- Next to a river running by a medieval wind and water mill hybrid with ‘Blender to Unreal Engine 5 Ultimate Course’, or;\n- To populate and make ‘Blender 3D Modelling & Animating A Stylized Oriental Scene’ even more beautiful.\n\n\nThis course will give you access to just over 15 hours of 3D art in around 82 comprehensive lessons.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Resources & Freebies\n\n\n\n\nThe 'Blender to Unreal Engine 3D Plants and Vegetation’ resource pack includes 6 custom brushes (alpha textures and other Blender preset formats), 9 image references and a Pureref reference file, and an environment example (.blend file and .fbx file inclusive of 15 textures).\n\n\nJoin this course and come be part of a game design journey of over 15 hours of learning that will see you creating all the foliage you might want in just 82 lessons.\n\n\nI am excited for you to share your renders and turntables of how you used your foliage in different environments for your portfolios with me. Go beyond the taught material and make new foliage types to represent the flora of different continents.\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down!\n\n\n\n\nUntil next time, happy modelling everyone!\n\n\nNeil – 3D Tudor",

      "description": "What's up nerds?\nUnreal Engine 5 is a very high in demand right now but learning it can be a little intimidating for beginners, which is why I made this course just to show you guys how to make amazing, realistic Car / Automotive renders in Unreal very easily!\nThis is project based course and we will be making 3 high quality Car Renders in different environments.\nThis course is extremely easy and is made for Unreal beginners who have very little experience, however, you are expected to know how to navigate the UI of Unreal Engine and use basic tools.\nIn this tutorial, we're gonna be covering the basics of Importing Models, Texturing, Lighting and Animating so you can take your 3D Art skills to the next level.\nThe good thing about this class is that this class will show you the raw process of a 3D artist in\ncreating art. We will be solving all problems and making all creative decisions together!\nSo what are you waiting for? Just start this class today and take your Unreal skills to a whole new level!\n\n\nProject:\n\n\nThe project is quite simple! You need to first watch the whole course and then make your own 3D scene of a car! You can either use the same 3D models which I used, or you could use others! You must use all the techniques and skills taught in the class to make sure that you are actually learning something new! You get extra points if you model the car yourself too because that will really enhance your modelling skills as well!\nBe sure to change things up by using your own unique colors and lighting setups! Once you are done, be sure to upload the project so I can give you feedback!\nGood luck!",

      "description": "Have you wanted to learn Blender and not know where to start?\nThen I welcome you to Nexttut’s Blender Modelling Course for Beginners.\n\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU LEARN FROM ME:\nMy name is Alejandro Aguilar, and I have been working in 3D art for about 7 years. I have worked on numerous projects, from mobile games to video production. My area of work focuses on understanding 3D at a technical level, so that I can then teach you in an easy-to-understand way.\n\n\nBENEFITS :\nBy the end of this course you will be able to model hard surface robot type characters in Blender.\n\n\nWHAT WILL I LEARN:\n● Blender Hard Surface Character Modelling.\n● UV Unwrapping Robotic Characters\n● How to Render within Blender.\n\n\nCOURSE PROJECTS:\nIn this course we will be making a robotic character. We will start by opening Blender and discussing what we will be working on for the course. Next we will block out the shapes that we need in order to create our character and go over the tools and model out each piece in detail. Then, we will finalise the modelling, fixing anything that needs a second pass, and prepare to unwrap our prop. We’ll begin going over how to unwrap our model and discuss the importance of unwrapping. After this we will go over how to create textures and apply materials to our robot. Afterwards, we will use modifiers to push our character to a more high poly finish in a non-destructive manner. By the end of the course, we will have our robot fully modelled, textured, and rendered within Blender. We’ll make a render of the character and finish the course.\n\n\nIS THIS COURSE RIGHT FOR ME:\nThis course is for you if you are a blender beginner and want to learn Blender modelling to model simple hard surface robotic kind of characters rather than complex organic characters.\n\n\nWHO IS NOT THE IDEAL STUDENT:\nThis course is not for advanced blender users, or who want to learn organic modelling.\n\n\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW OR HAVE FOR THE COURSE:\n● A basic understanding of computers and know how to open a 3D Program.\n● You should have Blender installed on your computer.\n\n\nJOIN ME NOW:\nIf you want to learn how to use Blender 3.0, join me now and take your skills to the next level. Don't forget that investing in yourself will benefit you for the rest of your life! Hope to see you in the course!",

Now several years later, Blender version 3.3 continues to explore and evolve one of the most exciting procedural systems; Geometry Nodes. As of November 2022, Geometry Nodes are a little over a year old, and each release is still considered a prototype. However, the developers consider it to be production-ready, and many users find it stable enough to incorporate into their pipeline.\n\n\nTraditionally there exists a gap between digital artists and software developers. 3D art is indeed a visual medium, but Geometry Nodes provides a middle ground where one can dabble with code. I have taught this curriculum three times as a synchronous online class and after feedback from kids, teens, and adults, I am very proud of this carefully crafted learning experience. I found it was crucial to not overwhelm students with formulas, but rather create opportunities for seeing relationships between, numbers, code, and beautiful shapes.\n\n\nCLASS FORMAT\nThis class contains 22 video lectures and 22 Blender scene files. Most of the Blender files are incomplete projects and students are given instructions on how to finish them. Some of the files only require a few clicks to complete. I find that focusing on specific tasks is more efficient for beginners rather than trying to digest the dozens of steps to complete a project.

      "description": "Welcome to the most detailed Backrooms tutorial ever recorded. In this 4-hour and 40-minutes long tutorial we will try to make a Backrooms video with a lot of details.\nThe Backrooms is an urban legend and creepypasta that tells the tale of an endless maze of randomly generated office rooms. It is characterized by the smell of wet carpet, walls with a monochromatic tone of yellow, and buzzing fluorescent lights. Although Internet users have expanded upon this concept by creating different \"levels\" and \"entities\" of the Backrooms. The Backrooms soon became popular from writers and Internet users.\nBackrooms has become so viral that hundreds of new videos can be found on YouTube every day, some of them with millions of views. The most popular channel on this topic is Kanel Pixels with 1.35 million subscribers, most gathered in just a few months after the release of the first Backroom video.\nMaybe it's time for you to get involved in this story. This detailed tutorial is the right place to start.\nThis tutorial captures every step of creating a Backrooms video that you can see in the video above. Even if you are a beginner in Blender, you can follow this tutorial.\nPart 1 - 46 min\n- Introduction\n- Modeling rooms, walls, ceiling\n- Creating materials\n- Camera setup\n- Creating lighting\nPart 2 - 43 min\n- Creating walls and mazes\n- Ventilation modeling\nPart 3 - 40 min\n- Smoke detector modeling and texturing\n- Pipe modeling and texturing\n- Compositing in Blender\n- Adding mist and camera imperfections\n- Adding graffiti and dirt to the walls\nPart 4 - 36 min\n- Add details (cables, trash, edges)\nPart 5 - 60 min\n- Creating details\n- Camera animation (2 ways)\n- Import and animate reptile (Mixamo)\n- Rendering and exporting animation from Blender\nPart 6 - 41 min\n- Post-processing in After Effects (if you do not use After Effects, this part is optional, it can also be done in a blender)\n- Finding and adding VHS Overlays\n- Creating sound effects",

      "description": "Quadrupeds come in various types, and they all have their own unique needs, but in this module we will rig a canine character which covers many of the unique problems in rigging a quadruped. Some of these problems include how to deal with the back leg and setting up a spline ik for the back.\nIn the first module we will analyze the problem we are attempting to solve. We will start with talking about some basic rigging processes we will use throughout the modules, and then discuss how we will lay out our joints. At the end, we will bind our mesh to the joints and begin skinning. In the second module we will go through the process of skinning our character using tools such as the Paint Weights Tool, the Prune Small Weights function, and the Component Editor. In the third module, we start building the control rig to drive our bind joints, focusing on a simple FK control structure for the tail, and then working on the back dog leg In our fourth and final module, we will finish the rig, completing the front leg as well as the spine and the head/neck area. We will also illustrate how we can deal with some of the quirks we stumble over in Maya and how to overcome and troubleshoot your rig.\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nChad Robert Morgan started his career in computer games and animated film after his tour in the US Navy and using his veteran’s benefits to attend Sonoma State University in northern California. His first job in the industry was at LucasArts - where he was introduced to Maya and mentored by some of the best people in the industry. From there he spent some time working at ReelFX before moving back to California and joining The Collective, which eventually became Double Helix and worked on such titles as Silent Hill : Homecoming, Strider, and Killer Instinct. Chad has taught several Maya Master Classes for Autodesk and has an article published in 3DWorld magazine. Chad now runs his own fledgling company, Spectral Ink Productions, and works for clients such as WhiteMoon Dreams and UCI.",

Weather it be for games or a film modeling a character from a reference image is usually how the job gets done. In this course I will go over getting started in blender, then I jump right into modeling, afterwards we rig and pose the character.\nThis course I about quickly learning the modeling and rigging process for character creation in blender. Lots of courses teach you about the modeling basics but never really show you how to put something (in this case someone) together. This is what I do in this course.\nJust so that you are familiar the terms I will be using in this series are as follows:\nExtrude (E) : The process of taking existing geometry and extending it to form new shapes.\nRotate (R) : The process of rotating geometry in blender.\nScale (S) : The Process of resizing geometry in blender.\nGrab (G): The process of moving geometry in blender. Select (Right Click): The process of selecting Geometry in Blender. To select more than one object or piece of geometry hold shift while right clicking.\nObject Mode: The default mode in blender.\nEdit Mode: Once and object is selected in object mode ( note that the object must be geometry, not lights or cameras) hit the tab button on your key board and the you will have entered Edit Mode.\nRigging: The process of adding bones to a mesh to enable it to be animated through the bones.\nWeight Painting: Setting the amount of influence a bone or a vertex group has on an object.\nThe Materials needed are a computer or a laptop preferably with a number pad.\nIf you follow this course in its entirety it should take a few weeks to a month to complete. But its well worth the wait.\nYou should take this course if you want to finally learn how to make characters in blender for your own use. If you have a model sheet that you would like to see come to life then take this course.",

      "description": "If you want to start your journey to learn 3D animation, take your data visualization to the next level, or just impress everyone at your next presentation, this course is for you! I believe the best way to learn 3D is not by me just listing off every single tool, but by taking a project-based approach like this course so you can learn from actually building something you can use in your day-to-day life.\nWho Am I?\nMy name is Lucas Ridley and I work in the film and commercial industry animating on such commercials and films as The Clash of Clans, Transformers, Suicide Squad, and the latest Spielberg movie Ready Player One (which is also a great book btw). Take a look at my profile to see some of my work.\nDon't be intimidated by 3D!\nI know it's an intimidating idea to learn 3D because I struggled to learn it when I began but I will walk you through exactly what buttons to press, concepts to begin to understand, and pitfalls to avoid to achieve the same results you see from the 4 examples in the preview video.\nWhy Maya?\nMaya is the industry standard in film and commercials. Over the past several years I've worked at over 7 different studios, big and small, and they all use Maya for their 3D work. We will also cover using the Arnold renderer as it is now shipped with Autodesk Maya. In addition, we will use Adobe After Effects and Photoshop to aid us in completing some finals renders out of Maya and to manipulate the map texture for the final series.\nOutline\nThe course is broken down into 4 sections of ascending difficulty:\nLine Graph\nBar Graph\nPie Chart\nMaps\nEach section will cover a different method and technique inside Maya so the course will make the most sense starting from the beginning and watch each lesson in order. However, if you only need to learn how to make a pie chart, for example, you should be able to skip to that section and only watch that series of lessons and still be able to follow along to make only a pie chart.\nI'm excited to share this course with you and introduce you to 3D. If you already know a little 3D or Maya you will still have plenty to learn as I cover some creative solutions to problems I haven't seen covered anywhere else. Thanks for enrolling!",

You’ll learn techniques like Modular Modeling, Procedural Texturing, High to low poly modeling, Sculpting, Composition, Level Art, Lighting – and much more!\n*Environment based on the concept art from Luis Medina*\nMAYA, SUBSTANCE, AND UNREAL ENGINE 5\nAll the modeling will be done in Maya, However, the techniques used are universal and can be replicated in any other 3d modeling package. Sculpting will be done using Zbrush and the materials will be created using Substance Designer and previewed in marmoset toolbag 4. The environment will be built in the brand-new Unreal Engine 5 and the lighting will use the new Lumen system. Next to this, we will also use Substance Painter to generate masks.\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to know to create the final results that you see in the images and trailers. Next to this, the same techniques can be applied to almost any type of environment.\n32.5 HOURS!\nThis course contains over 32.5 hours of content – You can follow along with every single step – The course does enclose a few small-time lapses, this is just to speed up very repetitive tasks, the rest is done in real-time.\nWe will start by going over our reference and planning and then continue to create a blockout version of our environment. We will be using modular modeling techniques to create all the pieces and later on take them to final.\nWe will also be using Zbrush to sculpt more detailed pieces like the pillars. We will set up all these pieces in UE5 and already build our environment. Then we will move on to create our procedural materials.\nOnce those are done, we will do the UV-Unwrapping of our models and apply our materials.\nWe will then export everything to UE5, set up our materials and shaders, and get started with the composition, lighting, and general improvement of our environment.\nWe will leave the course off with general polishing and also adding some megascans statues to push the quality even more.\nSKILL LEVEL\nThis game art tutorial is perfect for students who have some familiarity with a 3d Modeling tool like Maya, Substance Designer/Painter, Zbrush, and Unreal Engine – Everything in this tutorial will be explained in detail. However, if you have never touched any modeling or texturing tools before we recommend that you first watch an introduction tutorial of those programs (you can find many of these for free on YouTube or paid on this very website)\nTOOLS USED\nMaya 2022\nSubstance 3D Designer and Substance 3D Painter\nZbrush 2021\nUnreal Engine 5\nMarmoset Toolbag 4\nYOUR INSTRUCTOR\nEmiel Sleegers is a senior environment artist currently working in the AAA Game Industry. He’s worked on games like The Division 2 + DLC at Ubisoft, Forza Horizon 3 at Playground Games, and as a Freelancer on multiple projects as an Environment Artist and Material Artist.\nCHAPTER SORTING\nThere’s a total of 89 videos split into easy-to-digest chapters.\nAll the videos will have logical naming and are numbered to make it easy to find exactly the ones you want to follow.\nSOURCE FILES\nPlease note that this project does not come with any source files or extra content due to platform limitations.

We are a studio with more than 10 years dedicated to the creation of courses in the area of programming, 3d, animation and creation of games, both for online courses and for school classrooms.\nIn this course I will show you the entire production process of a cartoon style ship, from modeling to rendering and exporting a final image, using the Maya 2018 and Arnold Render features.\nFirst we will start modeling the ship's cabin through simple objects. I'll model the glass part of the cabin, and set a turbine on the back of the ship. Next you will learn how to add details into models by creating details in the central region of the ship's cabin.\nWith the cabin models created and smoothed, I'm going to start modeling a second turbine for the ship. From this point, we will work with curves and the application of the NURBS tool and conversion of NURBS mesh to polygon.\nWith the base structure of the turbine created I will add details in the mesh of it and create new elements to complement the model. With the template ready, I'll move on to the part of creating and setting up the scene lighting.\nLet's create a background for the scene and a camera for the final render. Next we'll create and configure all the project lighting using Arnold Render features. With everything ready, let's set up the final render parameters, render and save a high resolution image of our project.\nTo do this course you will need a computer, previous knowledge in Maya, which you can find in our basic Maya course here at Udemy, or on our website. This course is intended for illustrators, animators, designers, or any artist who wants to enhance their techniques in creating and rendering models in Maya 2018.\nI invite you to take this course, and improve the quality of your productions in Autodesk Maya 2018.",

It is a software widely used in the world, in particular by architects, landscapers but also for the presentation of events, the design of 3D objects ... Sketchup is very interesting for garden design because it allows to model a 3D garden project. With this software, it will be possible to give an overview of a project with a 3D model to scale. We can thus create step by step a garden, starting from a plan, by positioning the structural elements of the arrangement, by adding materials, plants, decorations.\nAdvantages of Sketchup\n- SketchUp is simple, fast and intuitive software compared to other 3D modeling software.\n- You can already make simple models after only a few hours of learning.\n- SketchUp allows you to produce models made up of few faces.\n- Due to its non-parametric modeling principle, SketchUp is suitable for a large number of uses.\n- It has a large collection of free components with the 3D Warehouse to import plants, decorations or even furniture.\n- It is possible to create complete garden projects.\n- There are a large number of plugins, many of which are free like Twilight Render to create realistic renderings.\nTraining course\nIn this course you will learn how to use Sketchup from the start and use it for landscaping. We will thus see all the tools step by step and then adapt them for the creation of garden. We will thus see concrete examples such as a project to develop a small garden or a project with decorative pots. I will show you how to use the free Twilight Render plugin to create a more realistic rendering of your project.",

Remember if you don't understand a part you can go through that part again or come over to the very beginning and watch it to the end. I'm sure if you do this the second time, it becomes super easy to use Vyond and you can go out and create your own voice overs put them in 2d animation video, create your own characters, create your own scenes and produce your very own animation that is stunning and engaging to viewers to watch and you'll be getting good reviews from your 2d animation videos at the end of the day this is the plan for everyone who enrols in this 2d animation video course with Vyond.\nSo if this is something you're interested in, make sure you take this course and stick to it till the very end. It is very important you watch every single video in the series so that you can understand it properly.\nI’m David Oisamoje, and I will be your instructor on this course see you inside this full 2D animation course with Vyond.",

You may be pulling your hair out, because your speed and process have been thrown out the door. You may be knowing what you want to create but getting nowhere trying to accomplish it.\nMost tutorials for learning Maya are fundamentals videos that are long and drawn out, covering topics that you already understand. You're just looking for the information on how to transfer the skills you already have from working in Blender. You may be spending large amounts of time scanning through tons of beginner videos only to find the videos overlook the advanced techniques you use. Sometimes the techniques you use aren't even available in Maya. This becomes irritating and wastes your time.\nThis video series is designed to get you up to speed inside of Maya and have you wondering why it ever seemed so hard to transfer between software in the first place. All of the main tools and techniques that are used in everyday video game art development (modeling, unwrapping, and baking) will be explained and cross referenced to what you would use inside of Blender. So if you're in need of getting up to speed inside of Maya for a new job position or are a student looking to improve your resume to become more attractive to employers this video series is perfect for you.",

In this tutorial I am going to explain to you how to animate anything you want using the Animankenstein Formula and any animation software you like. For this course I will be using CrazyTalk Animator 3.\nThe first thing you need to start animating is, get a reference. For my case, I will use this line test of some awesome martial art kicks.\nThen, in CrazyTalk Animator 3, I import the character, already rigged and ready to be animated.\nThen I open YouTube, to see the first pose...\nAnd I position my character like that.\nThen I count how many frames I need to move the play head so my animation has the exact same timing as the reference I am copying from.\nThen I see the character in the anticipation for the first kick, and\nI duplicate that pose in CrazyTalk, moving the bones of my character as needed.\nThen I check the kick in my reference,\nand duplicate that pose in crazy talk.\nAnd so on. It is super simple, all you have to do is check each of the poses, measure the number of frames you need between poses, and duplicate those poses in any animation software you like.\nYou can even do this frame by frame, with pencil and paper, just like I did this pencil test copying the kicks from an anime character fighting with another character.\nEasy enough, right?\nAll you need to do for each pose is:\nCheck the reference\nCount the number of frames between each pose\nPose your character exactly as in the reference\nYou will have the in-between frames created automatically for you thanks to the interpolation feature inside CrazyTalk Animator 3.\nGreat.\nAnd then, you end up with an animation like this.\nPLAY ANIMATION\nIf you already know how to use CrazyTalk Animator, then this tutorial is all you need to know to get it started and do this on your own, with any reference you want.\nBut if you are a total beginner, you can enroll to this crash course for FREE:\nAnimate a Ninja in CrazyTalk Animator 3\nInside you will find almost 3 hrs of video content in which I go in depth on each of the steps required to create this animation, step by step, super detailed.\nSo, if you are just starting in animation, and want to learn how to do this, step by step, then enroll for FREE right now.

      "description": "Note: The Best Course for those who are just Starting 3DsMax and want to Become Professional.\n\n\nVilla design is a subset of residential space design. In order to achieve an optimal and ideal design in which the limitations in the project are fully considered, the design principles and techniques must be carried out carefully from the concept design to the final design stage. The landscape design process is considered as an important part in the design process of villa projects, because the spaces are closely related to the natural environment around them. Simulation software, as a key factor in the design process of architectural projects, can easily provide the main concept of the designer and finally the volume of the project to the client. 3D Max as one of the most practical simulation software, having the ability to model different levels with high accuracy and details, has a lot of potential in 3D design of different styles of villa projects. Combining architectural volumes with landscape elements is easily possible through the modeling techniques of this software. Considering that in the construction market, the design and implementation of modern villas is in high demand, in the IMAX course, the focus of the first chapter is on the modeling of modern villas.\n\n\nThe topics presented in this course include:\n- Introduction of the working environment (Interface) of 3Dsmax\n- How to draw 3D(Geometry) and 2D(Shape)\n- Several original and practical tools and modifiers\n- Edit Poly, Editable Spline and Editable Mesh techniques\n- Retopology\n- Introduction of Reference Coordinate System\n- Scene Explorer and Layer Explorer\n\n\nThe modeling of the project proceeds in several different phases:\nphase 1 : Modeling the main walls of the villa\nphase 2: Modeling the internal walls and openings\nphase 3: Modeling the walls details\nphase 4: Furniture Modeling\nphase 5: Modeling the area and topography around the villa\nTools and techniques are taught in most of the different parts of the project.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this course and use it very well. In the process of learning, I gave you exercise files to measure your ability and feel free to ask me any questions you have.",

It was the luxury car of the stars in its day, owned by Amelia Earhart, Greta Garbo, and Al Jolson. Of the 35,000 cars that were produced, only 150 of them are still around. But we are going to make one more using Blender and Krita.\nWe will begin with the fundamental modeling tools of Blender, building up the basic shapes of the car. And as we progress, you’ll be introduced to more advanced tools and hard surface modeling techniques. Once the modeling is complete, we will begin assigning materials and adding textures to the leather seats and the woodgrain steering wheel. You’ll learn how to use Krita to add text to an object, and even try out Blender’s 3D Text tool. Finally, we will set up the lights for our scene and render out our final images.\nIf you’re interested in creating vehicles and would like a comprehensive project through which to learn Blender, then this course is for you. This kind of scene is great for building your skills and gaining valuable insights into organizing and managing a complex project.\nSo let’s get started!

The course covers each and every feature available in the Parts, Assembly and Drawing section of Solidworks 2020. We have divided this course into 4 major sections:\nSketch Section - The first step in CAD is making a sketch of a desired model. This section covers various commands like line, circle, rectangle, parallelogram, arc, spline, slot, polygon, text, point, trim, extend, offset, mirror, linear pattern, move, copy, quick snaps, project curve and many more.... After we finish few sketch commands, we will practice them during the exercise. These exercises will help you to gain confidence and you can easily do any complex sketch. We have also included some practice sketch which you can practice to improve your skills. The quiz will test your understanding and help you in the application of commands learnt.\n3D Modelling Section - After understanding how to sketch, in this section will understand on how to convert sketch into 3D models. This section covers various features available in Solidworks 2020 like extrude boss/base, extrude cut, swept boss/base, swept cut, lofted boss/base, lofted cut, boundary boss/base, boundary cut, wrap, shell, revolved boss/base, revolved cut and other miscellaneous features. The interesting thing about this section is that, along with the exercises we will be doing real life models like chess pawn, cricket bat, exhaust manifold, ICC cricket world cup.\nAssembly Section - In this section, we basically assemble the parts that we have created. In simple words, we join various parts to form a machine. This section is full of excitement as you will learn the CAD models like Ball Bearing, Gearbox and Road Bike. Here we will understand all the types of mates like standard mates, advanced mates and mechanical mates.\nDrawing Section - This section covers engineering drawing at an advanced level. All the features in Solidworks 2020 are covered under this section.",

As well steps on how to animate and loop your character doing a simple wave to the audience. Perfect for your Instagram, art blogs, or for whatever social media platform you use!\nWhat you will get out of this class is designing a simple character with a recognizable silhouette, and bringing the character to life. And of course a few animation principles such as easing, drag and appeal!\nFor this class project, create a simple character and have them wave to the audience a few times. Be sure to add in some idle or buffer time before the character waves to create some realism and make sure that you have the character animate back to it’s original position so that it can loop seamlessly! Also throwing in a blink or two will bring your character more to life and up your animation skills!\nHope you enjoy the class, and if you need a hand please be sure to send me a message and I will try my best to get back to you! In addition, I am happy to review your work!\n\nProgram: Toonboom Harmony or whatever animation software you prefer\n-Resolution should be around 1920x1280 or similar 16:9 ratio\n-Coloured background\n-Animation loops seamlessly",

It is the Industry standard widely used by both professionals and enthusiasts. But what factors distinguish After Effects Professionals from beginners?\nWhat is After Effects Expressions?\nExpressions. Professionals write After Effects expressions to automate their tasks, speed up their work, saving time from things that beginners do a lot- Creating repetitive keyframes. Expressions also let you add various advanced functionalities allowing you more control over properties and attributes such as over time, frequency, amplitude, conditionals and loops, etc.\nThis course will teach you After Effects expressions right from the fundamentals, where you will learn various methods and ways to write expressions with practical lessons.\nIn this course you will be learning following variety of After Effects expressions:\nWiggle Expression- Add motion to any object in terms of position, rotation, opacity, scale by manipulating its Frequency and Amplitude.\n\n\nTime Expression- Speed up and slow down anything, make any object follow another object with time delay, etc\n\n\nValue at Time method- Fetch coordinates or value of any transformation property of any object and pass it to another object's transformation property based on time.\n\n\nMath round- You can round off value of any property to its decimal value and can display it on the screen.\n\n\nLoop In- Automate your workflow by repeating a set of keyframes (two, three, and more) right from the beginning of the timeline of a layer to the set keyframes. This method can save a lot of time used for setting repetitive keyframes.\n\n\nLoop Out- Similar to Loop In, looping set of keyframes till the end of the timeline of a layer. It doesn't start at the beginning of the time, rather from the time you set the looping keyframes.\n\n\nRandom method- You can generate random values within a range provided as parameters in the Random method. The generated values can be used to trigger various effects and change values of various transformation properties.\n\n\nLength- This method can be used to calculate length of any change in values such as distance between two points, etc.\n\n\nIf Else- You can implement conditional logic to create advanced motion graphics. You can specify various conditions and actions to perform based on situations. It is one of the core building block of any programming language.\n\n\nTime delay- You can trigger any effect on a object relative to other object's time with and without any delay.",

You are looking for a practical and compact beginner course on CAD & Design and want to take a professional course from an engineer right away?\nThen you have come to the right place and this course is best for you! Because, in this course you will learn all the basics you need to use a free CAD design software (DesignSpark Mechanical) to create your own 3D objects. Start now with a clearly presented, step-by-step guided and professional CAD tutorial.\nThe advantages at a glance:\nFREE CAD SOFTWARE !\nStep by step basics and explanations on how to use CAD software.\nLearn all the basics about CAD design through the guidance of an engineer and experienced user and get started easily & quickly.\nEasy to follow explanations on the subject. Ideal for absolute beginners.\nLearn everything important in no time! Compact and to the point: Total running time approx. 75 minutes.\nSTART NOW AND ENROLL IN THE COURSE RIGHT AWAY! GET STARTED AND LEARN CAD!\n\n\nFAQ's about the course:\nWhat can I learn in the CAD course?\nThe course includes everything you need to know to design 3D components on your PC. From the creation of a 2D sketch to the handling of the features of the software (DesignSpark Mechanical) to the three-dimensional object, everything is included. The software is explained step by step using several design projects.\nWhat do I need for the course and how long does it take?\nThe course on 3D modelling has a total running time of approx. 77 minutes (divided into several individual lessons). Of course, you are free to choose which chapters you would like to view at which time and you can also take breaks at any time. Apart from a PC and the CAD software DesignSpark Mechanical (available as a free download) you don't need anything else.\nIs the tutorial only for CAD beginners?\nThis course is generally designed for beginners and absolute beginners with no prior knowledge. It doesn't matter if it is only for information purposes about the technique of CAD design or for the application and implementation of your own ideas and projects. All procedures are explained in detail and are easy to understand. This course is also ideal for tinkerers, inventors, artists, students, teenagers, etc.\nWho will show me the CAD basics in this course?\nThe design course is taught by an engineer (M.Eng.).\nIs learning CAD design difficult?\nCAD design is definitely a complex subject, as the handling of the software (here: DesignSpark Mechanical) has to be learned and some kind of three-dimensional imagination is required. Without help you can lose the overview. With this CAD tutorial, however, you have all the information in one format and always keep track. Everything you need is explained step by step and taught as simple and straightforward as possible.\nWill I also learn how to handle assemblies and create technical drawings?\nNo, only parts, but no assemblies are designed in the course. This is usually sufficient for beginner applications. The handling of assemblies and the creation of technical drawings would go beyond the scope of this beginner course and is often simply not necessary when you practice it as a hobby. Therefore, this course is limited to the essentials to remain compact and clearly understandable .\nWhat can I do with 3D objects and CAD?\nYou have the opportunity to create numerous great objects, virtually from scratch, and implement your own ideas and projects. You could then print the objects usind a 3D printer, for example, or have them manufactured (by milling, turning,...). In this way, you could create prototypes of an invention, 3D objects for model making, spare parts that are no longer available or other great objects.\nSTART NOW AND ENROLL IN THE COURSE RIGHT AWAY!

I am a self taught 3D artist, in the past I have worked for 3D artist and 3D world magazine, Nissan. I was also a 3D artist at Guerilla games . Currently working at Warcradle studios\nAt the end of the course , you will be able sculpt hard surface creatures using zbrush and keyshot with confidence, you will be able to create a hard surface creature with ease and use the techniques to go on and create your own models.\nWe will cover in this course\nSculpt overall shape of our Creature\nAdding mechanical part\nWorking with fabrics for joints\nCreating outer Armor\nMaking custom inserts\nPosing The character\nGetting it ready to send to keyshot\nRendering in keyshot then bringing the files into photoshop\nFirst we will look at our base mesh, then we will roughly sculpt out the panel placements . We’ll go over each piece individually creating Armor and fabrics, deciding which parts to switch out with hard surface , when were happy with that we will start painting the organic parts, and then before moving to keyshot we will go though the model and prepare it ready for keyshot .\nOnce we have it into keyshot we will start adding materials and find the best render settings then move the images into photoshop fir our final composite image\nI made this course for intermediate Zbrush users but any one can download zbrush and keyshot and just start creating with only what zbrush comes with . All default settings, all real time, no speed ups, no skipping and completely step by step.\nSo enrol now and start creating, Hard surface creature model today.",

However, you will be expected to know the basics like navigating the viewport, using the scale, rotate, move tools, etc.\nIn this tutorial, we're gonna be covering the basics of Importing Models, Texturing, Lighting, Animation and Rendering in Blender so you can take your 3d art skills to the next level.\nSo what are you waiting for? Just start this class today and take your blender skills to a whole new level!\n\n\nThe project of this class is quite simple, yet very exciting!\nYou will create a product render similar to the ones which I showed in the class but you will add something extra or make some changes to the design, textures, lighting or camera angle so that you are actually learning and not blindly following a tutorial. You can choose any product which you want and there are absolutely no rules so you can be as creative as you want!\nTrust me, when you complete this project, you will feel much more confident and comfortable in Blender!\nWhen you are done, kindly upload your final render to the Project section of this class so I can give you feedback and suggestions.\nThank you!",

This phase is a tiny step in the correct direction, it's so simple and ridiculously easy to the point where you'd be shocked.\n\n2) Simple Shape Anatomy\nDon't know anatomy? In this lesson, you will learn to see anatomy as completely simple shapes. This\n\n3) Overlapping\nOverlapping is the ONE concept that divides a newbie from an intermediate. You can apply this concept to your drawings and IMMEDIATELY upgrade all of your art. Most beginners are not taught this.\n\n4) Perspective\n\nYou will get a crash course in perspective. Most people make this topic ridiculously overcomplicated. I give you the bare essentials of perspective so it's easy to remember and apply.\n\n5) Demonstration of Process\nYou will see every concept we have learned so far in action. You absorb the whole process, and I will walk you through it step by step.\n\n6) Complete Review of Everything we learned.\nYou will get a quick review of all the concepts up to this point. This lesson is to double-check that you memorized the concepts. it's a great add-on to ensure your drawing levels up.\n\n7) Bonus Lesson\nYou'll get an additional lesson that further solidifies anime poses.\n\n8) Final Thoughts\nIf you really want to learn, this is a great time. I'm a huge anime fan. I've been so in love with anime my entire life. This has been my funest lesson I've ever made for anyone. I love making lessons for new artists and I want to improve your life in any way I can.\nLet's get started! This is going to be super exciting. Love it! Get out some paper and get ready to better yourself. There is so many things they can do. You will draw better than you ever dreamed. I can't wait til you see this. There is much to do. And this is the coolest lesson I've done so far.\nYou can be drawing anime poses by the end of the hour.",

      "description": "What's up nerds?\nUnreal Engine 5 is very high in demand right now but learning it can be a little intimidating for beginners, which is why I made this class just to show you guys how to make amazing, realistic Architecture Visualization / Interior Designing renders in Unreal very easily!\nNow this tutorial is extremely easy and is made for Unreal beginners who have very little experience, however, you are expected to know how to navigate the UI of Unreal Engine and use basic tools.\nIn this tutorial, we're gonna be covering the basics of Importing Models, texturing and Lighting so you can take your 3D Art skills to the next level.\nThe good thing about this class is that this class will show you the raw process of a 3D artist in\ncreating art. We will be solving all problems and making all creative decisions together!\nSo what are you waiting for? Just start this class today and take your Unreal skills to a whole new level!\n\n\nClass Project:\nThe project is quite simple! You need to first watch the whole tutorial and then make a 3D scene of your own room! You can either use the same 3D models which I used, or others! You should use all the techniques and skills taught in the class to make sure that you are actually learning something new! You get extra points if you model the furniture yourself too in Blender because that will really enhance your Blender modelling skills as well!\nBe sure to change things up by using your own unique colors and lighting setups! Once you are done, be sure to upload the project so I can give you feedback!\nGood luck!",

Using the expression editor, you’ll connect data across your model to drive intelligent, adaptable designs.\nThroughout the course, you’ll work on real-world projects created from a beginner’s perspective: build a parametric toy brick, a hinged box that adapts to its length, and dynamic custom signs that automatically resize based on the text’s height and length pulled from spreadsheets. These hands-on examples will show you how to create smart, reusable components using configuration tables and variant links, making it easy to manage complex assemblies with different variants and visual properties.\nBy the end, you’ll confidently create fully parametric FreeCAD models that are easy to update, scalable, and ready for any design challenge. Enroll now and start building smarter, data-driven 3D designs with FreeCAD!",

My jobs have included creating user interface art for a major video game development company, a green screen footage editor and 3d background artist for a video production company, and working as the lead 3d Artist and later Studio Director for an award winning Architectural Visualization studio.\nIn this class I’ll guide you through a fun beginner exercise where we’ll model, texture and render a cute gnome with a real hair beard. We’ll go through each part of the process step-by-step, so you should find it fun and easy to follow along with me.\nWe’re using Blender for this tutorial, which is an amazing and totally free 3d software. The only barrier to entry is having a computer to run the software on.\nA gnome might seem like an odd choice for a beginner project, but it really is a perfect place to start!\nWhile modeling your gnome, you’ll learn:\nModeling - which is how we’ll create the body of our little gnome\nModifiers - that add additional modeling effects such as smoothing\nTexturing - this will add color and detail to the clothing of our gnome and their beard.\nLighting - we’ll add lights to illuminate our scene\nRendering - which involves positioning a 3d camera and generating a picture of our gnome\nCompositing - that will add a background and fun pattern behind our gnome render\nAt the end, we’ll have a cute gnome to render to our heart’s content. It’s also a character that can be easily altered to give them a different look pretty easily.\nI hope you’ll join me on this fun little beginner’s journey through Blender by making your very own bearded gnome!",

You’ll learn techniques like Modular Modeling, Procedural Texturing, Unique Texturing, Decal Creation, Composition, Level Art, Lighting – and much more!\nMAYA, SUBSTANCE AND UNREAL ENGINE\nAll the modeling will be done in Maya, However, the techniques used are universal and can be replicated in any other 3d modeling package. The materials will be created using Substance Designer and Substance Painter, and they will be previewed in marmoset toolbag 4. The foliage will be created using a combination of Maya and Speedtree and the level will be built in Unreal Engine 4.\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to know to create the final results that you see in the images and trailers. Next to this, the same techniques can be applied to almost any type of environment.\n21 HOURS!\nThis course contains over 21 hours of content – You can follow along with every single step – The course does inclose a few small time lapses, this is just to speed up very repetitive tasks, the rest is done in real-time.\nWe will start by creating our blockout to make sure our modular pieces work and that the composition is correct. We will then turn these into final assets. Along with the final assets, we will create our procedural materials and unique textures. We will bring it all together in UE4 and start creating and placing our decals. we will finish things off with our first lighting pass and then draw focus to our foliage. where we will use Speedtree and Maya to create multiple types of foliage. We will bring the foliage in Unreal and place it, add general improvements to our scene and paint our terrain. Finally, we will finish off with some bonus chapters on how to use Megascans to push your level even more.\nSKILL LEVEL\nThis game art tutorial is perfect for students who have some familiarity with a 3d Modeling tool like Maya, Substance Designer/Painter, Speedtree, and Unreal Engine 4– Everything in this tutorial will be explained in detail. However, if you have never touched any modeling or texturing tools before we recommend that you first watch an introduction tutorial of those programs (you can find many of these for free on Youtube or paid on this very website)\nTOOLS USED\nMaya 2020\nSubstance Designer and Substance Painter\nSpeedtree For UE4\nUnreal Engine 4\nMarmoset Toolbag 4\nPhotoshop\nYOUR INSTRUCTOR\nEmiel Sleegers is a senior environment artist currently working in the AAA Game Industry. He’s worked on games like The Division 2 + DLC at Ubisoft, Forza Horizon 3 at Playground Games, and as a Freelancer on multiple projects as an Environment Artist and Material Artist.\nSOURCE FILES\nPlease note that this project does not come with any source files or extra content due to platform limitations.

      "description": "1. Efficient 3D design\nSOLIDWORKS is an easy to use parametric design modular, meaning you can easily edit the design at any stage in the design process. RealView graphics allow you to visualise your design in real time whilst PhotoView 360 can create sophisticated photo realistic renderings and animations. Both tools will give you a fantastic insight into the way your design will look without it actually being made and can be a powerful asset when presenting your work to customers. You can look at each individual part of the design, see accurate mass properties and check for interference, meaning that you won’t have to build/manufacture the product before you see any errors, saving time and money and reducing the number of prototypes needed. All of this will speed up the whole process of design as you know it and increase productivity.\n2. Customer/Supplier Compatibility\nChoosing a CAD system that is widely recognised is very important. Due to the popularity of SOLIDWORKS it is highly likely that a competitor, supplier or customer will be using it, therefore eliminating the need to translate files from one system to another, reducing time and minimising the chance of errors. This makes working with customers and suppliers much easier, less time converting, increased efficiency, not to mention working together in 3D means delivering much better results.\n3. Built-In Applications\nSOLIDWORKS is a very productive 3D CAD software tool, with its integrated analytical tools and design automation to help stimulate physical behaviour such as kinematics, dynamics, stress, deflection, vibration, temperatures or fluid flow to suit all types of design.\nOrganisations with more than just a few designers can utilise product data management (PDM) software, which fully integrates with SOLIDWORKS. PDM systems can do much more than just store and organise files. They can help designers find existing parts to re-use instead of reinventing them, saving many man hours. PDM systems also generate material lists for cost estimating and feed data to manufacturing resource planning (MRP) systems. More advanced PDM software can automate change-control processes to assure that out-of-date or unreleased information isn’t sent to factories or suppliers.\n4. Short Learning Curve\nTime is money, subsequently the last thing you want as a forward moving organisation is to get stuck behind, and therefore you want the transaction to 3D CAD to be quick, simple and easy. SOLIDWORKS offers a consistent user interface throughout and drafting procedures that flow logically from start to finish. Furthermore SOLIDWORKS has built in tutorials, and lots of fantastic pre-sets to make designing speedy and stress-free. If you’re looking for that extra bit of help, Cadtek is part of the Solid Solutions Group, a fully authorised and approved training provider for all of the SOLIDWORKS products available. With different training locations across the UK we are able to offer regular classroom based training courses with a fully qualified instructor, to suit all needs. Our flexible training course structure is designed to allow customers to build an appropriate learning and development path that addresses individual specific industry needs.",

      "description": "In this new tutorial we will learn to Make VFX effect by adding a Realistic Car into a real Background Image\nPart 1: Rig your Car Model\nAfter downloading our vehicle, we need to separate the chassis and the wheels as separate objects\nYou can use the ‘L’ key to selection parts of your model, press ‘P’ to separate them\nNow it order for CarRig addon to understand each part of our model, we need to give them specific names\n– Chassis: we need to name it ‘car.body’\n– Wheels: The order should go like this ‘car.Wheel.Bk.R’\n– Front right wheel -> Car.Wheel.Ft.R\n– Car.Wheel.Ft.L\n– Car.Wheel.Bk.R\n– Car.Wheel.Bk.L\n\n\nAlso make sure to leave the anchor point of each object to the center because we want the wheels to rotate around their center point\nAll is set by now, we can go ahead and Generate a Car Rig\n\n\nPart 2 – Use fSpy to Get Right Perspective\nWe will import our background image into the fSpy and set the X axis to be aligned with the main road where our car will be moving on\nThen we will export that .fSpy file and create the road with the sidewalk and Put our vehicle into that path\n\n\nPart 3 – Realistic Lighting: Find the Right HDRI Map\nNow this step is essential, we must find an HDRI that looks pretty close to our background scene\nWe should study everything: is it urban? How’s the weather.. is it rainy or sunny?\nThis is what’s gonna allow our CGI to blend into the background, otherwise it will look suspisious and our VFX will be easily spotted\nWe can also play with our background by adding the 2 nodes ‘Mapping & Texture Coordinates’ which gonna allow us to rotate our HDRI until the reflection of our vehicle matches it’s surroundings cars\n\n\nPart 4 – Set VFX Settings\nFirst we need to hide the road in the render Buuut we need to keep the shadow.. Without the shadow, the VFX will collapse no matter how good you put the other things\nSelect Road\nGo to “Object Settings” and Choose Visibility.. Make sure you’re on Cycle engine, this effect doesn’t work in Eevee yet\nFrom there you can check ‘Shadow Catcher’\nThe second setting you need to set is in the “Render Properties”, then “Film” and choose “Transparent”\nNow if you render your scene, jump into the compositing and check ‘Use Nodes’ you will see our Car\n\n\nNow it’s time to merge between our Alpha render and our Background\nSo let’s add an image node, choose the background and connect both nodes to an ‘Alpha Over’ and don’t forget to add a ‘Scale’ node set to ‘Render Size’\nAnd Basically that’s it, you got your VFX working",

In Cinema 4D we will use both, stock materials that Cinema 4D comes with, and materials that we create ourselves to give life to our models.\nAfter that we will use a few High Dynamic Range Images (HDRIs) to lit the final scene, and make a few amazing renders. And finally, we will use Photoshop to retouch our renders and add a little bit of smoke and a title to the poster.\nThis course focuses on creating a set of energy drink cans as you can see in the promo video, but you can use the techniques you learn here to create other objects in 3D and present them to your clients.\nI’m confident that at the end of this course you will have a solid understanding of the 3D modeling process in Cinema 4D and you will be able to start creating your own 3D product visualization images.",

      "description": "One of the most common tips for creating photorealistic scenes is to use high-quality PBR textures, which are mostly not free, but is this the best way? Using multiple textures photographed in different locations under different lighting conditions can result in a lot of work and an unrealistic result if the textures don't match well with each other.\nIn this tutorial, we will use a photo I took with my mobile phone on the street at a bad angle in collage with concrete texture, plus one free Photo from Unsplash for the interior and try to turn it into a realistic 3D object and scene. With these limited resources of only two photos, we will create this scene from start to finish in just 3 hours.\nWith this method, you can turn any photo into a realistic 3D model quickly and easily in Blender. We will talk about modeling, unwrapping, creating realistic materials, lighting, post-processing, and more. The entire process of creating scenes is recorded step by step, so the tutorial is easy to follow even for beginners. The tutorial is separated into 15 parts with an average duration of 12 minutes to make it easier to follow. This is the workflow that I have learned in the last 4 years of using Blender.\nLanguage: English + subtitles",

We will create a photorealistic Classroom scene with the help of Blender\nI will take you through each and every step of this course and nothing will be skipped. This is a course for users of all types but a basic understanding of Blender and 3D would be really helpful.\nWe will start by modelling the different props in BLENDER, we will make use of multiple techniques and modifiers to create our models. We will go through the entire modelling process of each and every prop and nothing will be skipped.\nAfter finishing with the modelling process we will move onto texturing, we will create multiple PBR textures using completely free textures, we will be creating shaders like Glass, wood etc.\nAt last we will light and render our scene, we will use HDRIs to light our scene and use Cycles as our rendering engine. We will render multiple angles of our scene and finish the course with some compositing to make our renders look even better.\nAll the project files related to this course would be provided to you, that would include the blender files, all the images used, textures etc.\nSo if you want to learn how to create this photorealistic classroom scene with me, join the course today. Thank you!",

      "description": "Tap into the unlimited potential of Blender’s incredibly powerful node editor, and learn how to create advanced and highly customizable procedural textures from scratch. In this course I’ll walk you through building complex textures, step by step. You’ll learn about a ton of different nodes and creative ways you can combine them to achieve amazing results.\n\n\nIt All Starts With Awesome Textures\nWe’ll focus on 3 big projects in this course, highly customizable Subway Tiles, an animated and customizable Lava Field, and a realistic Painted Metal complete with peeling paint and edge damage. All are fun and complex projects that will give us a good mix of both technical and organic styles of textures.\nFor this course I teamed up with procedural texture master Erindale Woodford. Erin created the textures and I created the training. We chose these specific topics to focus on important texture building skills like technical planning and texture layering to help you gain a strong understanding of how to approach and achieve complexity.\n\n\nThe Thought Process and Techniques You Won’t Forget\nWhen it comes to nodes, the thought process can be just as important as the technical knowledge, so I’ll be explaining the reasoning behind every move so that you understand not just what to do, but how to plan out every step logically too. One of the hardest parts to approaching something complex is figuring out where to start, and what kind of dependencies could complicate things further into the building process. So each step of the way I’ll include insight into the process behind the planning, and the reasons why things should be done certain ways. By focusing on the reasoning behind every step, I hope to take this complicated topic and break it down to something that sticks with you. On top of that, Erin’s techniques themselves are extremely innovative, making them something that leaves a lasting impression.\n\n\nCourse Updates!\nLots of bonus content has already been added to the course. The first additional project covers how to use the lava texture we make in the course to easily transform any logo into lava like in the image below. And another big project has been added in as well on created a painted metal texture with paint peeling, chipping, rust, and customizable edge damage.\n\n\nKeep in Touch!\nThis is an intermediate difficulty course so as long as you have some experience with blender you should be able to follow along fine. But if you need any help going through the project, or even if you just want to chat about the techniques or share your progress, you can use the Q&A sections within the course, or you can email me at chris.cgmasters@gmail.com.",

Each of the videos is explained in detail with voice-over so you can understand the reason and benefits of using brush or techniques.\nIn this organic sculpting, I have begun with zbrush UI/UX explain to basic human head blocking, lips, eyes, ears and some neck sculpting. After basic sculpting I moved to detailed sculpting by adding more polycount. After finalizing the female head I added some noise and wrinkles on face to add more likeness sculpting. Then I explained the technique of hair sculpting of girl.\nThroughout the course I have explained about human head proportions, maintain the face features placement and sizes. Sculpting the mesh and bone specific areas on face and on neck too. How to sculpt a beautiful female 3d model, this is the main objective of this course.\nIn this course I tried to sculpt a beautiful female head using Zbrush.

Whether you're just starting out or already experienced in 3D, this course is designed to elevate your skills and help you build dynamic, reusable systems from scratch — all without destructive workflows.\nWe begin with the core concepts — learning the node interface, creating simple shapes, and understanding how data flows from one node to another. From there, we explore the powerful world of procedural modeling, instancing, attributes, field-based systems, and animation techniques.\nThroughout the course, you'll work on real-world examples and exercises that will help you solidify your knowledge. You’ll learn how to build efficient workflows, create complex 3D structures, and even automate modeling tasks using nothing but nodes.\nBy the end of the course, you will not only be fluent in Geometry Nodes — you’ll be able to design flexible 3D systems, build procedural tools, and think like a technical artist. You'll also gain the ability to quickly prototype, iterate, and reuse your setups across different projects.\nThis course is ideal for 3D artists, motion designers, game developers, architectures, engineers, academcians and anyone curious about the future of smart modeling workflows in Blender.\nGet ready to transform your creative process. Let’s dive in and design the impossible!",

      "description": "In this Solidworks course, you'll get up to speed on creating complex parts, assemblies and drawings. We'll cover all the key tools and techniques so you can focus on your design and not the software. We'll start with the basic sketch tools and create two-dimensional sketches that will become the foundation for 3D objects. Next, we'll look at modeling 3D features by extruding or evolving sketches into 3D parts. Followed by creating more complex objects using the sweep, loft, and surface tools. Parts will be modified using a suite of tools that includes Fillets, Chamfers, Ribs, Draft, Shell, plus so much more. And that's just the beginning. We will cover the best practices for putting parts together into assemblies and building robust structures. Finally, we'll see how to create drawings to relate the final parts in assemblies to a manufacturer, complete with an itemized bill of materials and drawing notes. This course is for anyone looking to get into the world of 3D design and will benefit new users as well as those transitioning from other software packages. Are you ready to upgrade your skills and learn one of the most powerful 3D CAD design software packages in the industry? Join me in this course for SOLIDWORKS Hands-on Essential Training.",

And if drawing a street scene sounds difficult, this class will teach each step along the path to painting colorful and quirky scenes.\nFor the class project we are going to create a scene inspired by the charming and magical Disney Pixar movie, Luca, a scene saturated with warm mediterranean colors that exudes a quirky and authentic style. A street scene with buildings can be a really daunting project. So, I’m going to take you step by step through the entire process and explain everything that I do and why I do it.\n\n\nI’ll teach you first how to research your ideas, and build a solid reference to work from\nYou’ll learn how to translate your idea or concept into a rough sketch.\nHow to wrangle that complex drawing or idea into simple and manageable color shapes\nFrom there you’ll roughen the edges, add texture and color variation, giving your world a lived in feel, a real place that has history, life and character.\nFinally I’ll show you how I add all the minute details that go into a street scene - things like windows, doorways, drainpipes and even washing lines.\nI worked for 15 years as background artist and environment designer for animation. Before getting my career up and running I was enthralled by the scenes and images that the art of animation created, and I never thought I would be able to do something like that.\nIn fact even when I tried, it felt impossible, because i didn’t even know where to start.\nWhen I finally did get a lucky break and land a job as an assistant BG artist, I learned in my first week on the job, every trick and technique that had been missing and that was all I needed to set me up for the rest of my career.\nSo, that’s what we’ll do today!

To wrap it up we will take our model into Marmoset Toolbag 3 and set up a material and lighting for our beauty renders. Along the way I will give advice and my expertise on what it takes to be a production artist. There's a lot of great stuff to learn here, so don't miss it!\n\n\nMore about the Instructor:\nChristian Cunningham is an environment artist currently living in Santa Clarita California. After 5 long years he finally broke into the industry. He started in July of 2017 (yes dreams do come true, just never give up).

We will be learning how to model a hurricane lamp from scratch. We will then unwrap UVs followed by a full texturing session which will provide you an introduction to the huge world of procedural texturing techniques inside of blender. We will then bake our generated textures in PBR maps like the base colour, metallic, roughness, normal and opacity map. The techniques used in this course can be used for asset creation in games and in real-time visualisation.\nRoyalty Free Music from Bensound\nThe best part is we will be doing all the modelling, UV unwrapping, texturing and baking all inside of blender without the need for any other third party texturing software. In my opinion, the node based shader editor in blender is as powerful as any other dedicated texturing software. This course is aimed to be short and crisp with the entire duration of just under 3 and a half hours. where I aim to deliver the most relevant information in a short span of time. I am excited as you are. Enroll now and I hope to see you in the course.",

Beginning with modeling in Maya, we will cover some basic modeling principles before moving into preparing UV's for painting. Painting will take place using 3D Coat, a software package that allows for the rapid texture painting required of many production studios, with final edits taking place in Photoshop. The end result will be a low-rez vehicle that will be usable in most game engines available today.\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nAn adopted son of San Francisco and the Academy of Art University, Ryan Ribot lives a small apartment with 3 cats and a Wacom. Currently working as a texture artist and character modeler with Telltale Games, Ryan spends most of his time painting and sculpting. ZBrush, Photoshop, and Maya are like breathing to him, and he is always looking to share his knowledge. Ryan has been teaching for several years, and is experienced as both an instructor and an industry professional.",

In the course, you get to make four low poly assets from start to finish, which are a mushroom, a rock, a tree, and a house.\nThe game asset creation workflow consists of the following steps:\n3D modeling the shape of an asset\nunwrapping the three-dimensional shape into a two-dimensional UV map\npainting a texture on the surface of the 3D model\ncreating level of detail (LOD) versions of the model to optimize it for a game\nAt the end of the course, all assets will be taken to the Unity game engine, where they are made game-ready by adding the necessary components for them and saving them as prefabs. With these prefabs, you can start building your game world. The game assets made in the course will also work on other game engines, such as the Unreal Engine.\nThis course is best suited for those who already have at least a little bit of experience with Blender.

In the past I taught how to design and animate characters as well as build scenes and create pre-made actions. This course takes all of that to create a final product for work, personal or entertainment purposes.\nMore specifically this course covers:\nAnimating 3D ships to create a fun space battle\nLip syncing and body language for multiple characters\nWorking within full 3D sets to build depth and atmosphere\nCorrecting timing and other animation anomalies that can pop up\nCreating vector particle effects such as lightning, smoke and dust\nCreating a teleportation effect using Moho 13's new bitmap tools\nUsing layer references to correct animations and create eye catching effects\nWorking with pre-made PNG particle effects to compliment action\nEditing multiple Moho scenes together with the Sequencer\nEditing multiple Moho video scenes in Premiere\nExporting the final sequence for distribution",

      "description": "Autodesk Revit is one of the most commonly used Building Information Modelling platforms in the design and construction industry. At the heart of Revit's functions are the components which make up the design.  In Revit, these are termed as 'Families'.\n\n\nIn this course, I'll be sharing my best practice concepts and principles which can be applied to the creation of almost any type of Revit Family. During the course, I'll teach you the range of family types available, to ensure you make strategic template planning decisions before you start modelling.\n\n\nWe'll take a look at various additive and subtractive modelling techniques for both static and parametric families. You'll also learn about the various tools available to use when sketching out your component in the Family editor, as well as methods for testing and quality checking before use in a project.\n\n\nWe'll explore how materials can be applied to families; considering parameters, shading, fill patterns, assets and textures.\n\n\nYou'll discover the pros and cons of 'nested' and 'shared nested' families, how to drive families with calculations using formulas, as well as how and when to use type catalogues to complement your families.\n\n\nThe course is hands-on, meaning you'll be expected to have Autodesk Revit installed so you can follow the exercise steps alongside the tutor.\n\n\nA basic working knowledge of the Autodesk Revit interface is recommended, but no prior knowledge of the Revit Family Editor or Family Creation is required.\n\n\nThe course is intended for novice or intermediate Revit modellers who have little or no prior knowledge of Revit Family creation.  For those with an intermediate level of knowledge, the course should provide you with some best practice workflows along with some tips and tricks along the way to enhance your productivity.\n\n\nIf all that sounds good, then it's time to get started with some Family creation using Autodesk Revit!",

This tutorial is aimed at someone who already has a basic understanding of zbrush, but there is an extra video which goes over and explains some tools and brushes in real-time.\nThere are also a few extras included, such as a few alpha maps that can be useful, UI which is seen in the tutorial and custom metal Material.",

Not only are these techniques important to learn, but also the mindset of problem solving, research, and the initiative required to learn by yourself and further yourself as an artist.\nLearn Pyro FX, destruction, FLIP simulations, rendering and compositing. Most importantly learn how all these FX interact with each other and the problems that will happen in production.\nOnline training usually doesn't address the problems you will face in production, often artists can follow along with a tutorial but then will get stuck very quickly with a real scene, and so this training is a production style course that is very similar to the work you will do in the real world. You will take it from start to finish, and we will go over a lot of the bugs and simple things that will stop you from completing the training.\nBy keeping things simple you will learn how to get fast and efficient results. Become faster and better by using these techniques over and over again. All these techniques can be applied to different versions of Houdini.",

I want you to experience an early victory of holding your own 3D printed miniature in your hand to feel more motivated about continuing your journey of learning zBrush.\nIn the first section I will launch zBrush with you for the first time together, and show you how to quickly get into edit mode to start playing with digital clay. Then I will show you how to customize your UI to better follow the rest of the course. In the next section I go through the various tools and functions we will be using most. And finally I will show you the entire process start to finish of creating a simple target dummy miniature for 3D printing.\nAnd as an added bonus to students of this course, I have created a Discord group you can join to share progress and ask for feedback or for help.\nNo risk: If this course ends up being not what you expected there is always a 30-day money-back guarantee.

There are lots of online training available over the internet on After Effects, but this is a brand new course for creating publishable motion graphic templates in After Effects which is very comprehensive & effective on the market. Here are some solid bullet points:\nCourse is created by the instructor who has several years of experience in creating motion graphics & publishing real time templates.\nThis is only full stack course on After Effects which covers brand new & very hot topic i.e. how to create a publishable motion graphic template and also teach you step by step how to create awesome motion graphic.\nCourse is arranged in such way that students will get from A to Z learning experience that means we start from learning expressions, then controls & we build real life projects.\nEverything we cover is up-to-date and relevant to today's competitive market.\nWe have approached project based learning. We build 4+ expression driven info-graphic, then we create real time motion graphic template which is ready to sell on any platform. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial motion graphic.\nThe course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules. So it will be like a subscription of never ending supply of animation training.\nWe understand your requirements. You need such a course which will guide you thoroughly. So keeping that in mind, we have designed this course in which we will teach you valuable tips for animating objects, create awesome motion graphic in front of you and in this process we'll setup controls & organize the template. The most important thing is we do not use any third party plugins. We just learn built in features in the following series:\nUsing Expressions\nVarious Controls\nBuilding Info-graphic\nCreating Organized Motion Graphic Template\nThis course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many courses are just focused on a particular stuff like 'watch me as I animate', with long videos. This course is different. We've incorporated everything which our instructor learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging.\nIf you have any question, feel free to contact us. We will be always with you in your journey.",

In this course, we will go over the entire process of Creating a Nintendo Game-Boy using Blender and Substance Painter.\n\n\nWhat you will get:\n· 16 FHD videos with over 5+ hours of content\n· All the resources files required to complete the course including the Models, Substance Painter Files, Textures, Alphas etc\n\n\nWe will go over the complete pipeline of creating a high-quality realistic prop, starting with modelling the prop in blender, texturing in Substance Painter and finally lighting and rendering a portfolio piece in blender.\nThis course will help you improve your 3D prop modelling and texturing skills massively as we go through each step together and learn many different techniques. After finishing the course, you would easily be able to create the renders shown in the trailer and create high quality props of your own.\n\n\nThis course has over 5+ hours of content! (All the videos have audio commentary)\n\n\nWe will go over every step in this course together and nothing will be skipped. The course does not have any kind of time-lapse so that you can follow every step easily.\nWe will start by modelling the prop in Blender, and learn various modelling techniques and also learn a lot about different modifiers. After finishing the modelling, we will apply all the modifiers and UV unwrap our model for export.\n\n\nWe will import our model into Substance Painter to start with the texturing process; we will start by baking the mesh maps for our model. We will learn to create high quality and realistic materials and the key features of Substance Painter like Smart Masks, generators, smart materials etc.\n\n\nAfter modelling and texturing our main model, we will also model and texture a Game-Boy Cartridge to enhance our renders and give them a bit more detail.\nAt last, we will take our models back to Blender and render them. We will set up the material, lighting, and the camera and learn how to use HDRIs to light our scenes. We will finish the course by taking a portfolio ready render and a little bit of Photoshop editing.\nThis course is for everyone who has a basic understanding of Blender and Substance Painter and wants to upgrade their skills.",

      "description": "Would you like to learn how animate and simulate two complete Halloween scenes in Blender in addition to video editing them to make a movie?\n\n\nNow, what if I told you I have a course to do just that on Udemy?\n\n\n\n\n‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’ will see you creating two spooky Halloween scenes inclusive of simulations and fully animated elements.\n\n\n\n\nThis course will give you access to just over 7 hours of 3D art.\n\n\nLearn how to build Halloween-themed witch cauldrons with boiling magic potions or simulate smoke over a stairway featuring carved pumpkins in just 41 lessons.\n\n\n\n\nThis course will see you learn all the techniques pros use and how they use them. Video editing and movie composition in Blender will be a central part of this course's learning objectives for the first time!\n\n\n\n\nThrough reading this course description you will find out:\n\n\n- What you want to learn about 3D modelling;\n- What you are going to get through ‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’, and;\n- How the course will take your 3D modelling, animation, and simulation skills to the next level.\n\n\n\n\nWhy not celebrate this popular holiday with spooky Halloween renders?\nWhether it is Samhain or the height of summer, let’s have some fun while learning how the new simulation functions in Blender work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling\n\n\nThis course will be your complete pathway from concept to seeing a living and breathing 3D scene on your computer screen in a way that we haven't done before.\nOur 3D modelling focus will be on creating two Halloween scenes, each with a different potential for simulation. This will include simulating liquid using the example of a green magic potion bubbling away above a roaring simulated fire, as well as simulating smoke that spreads over a set of stairs in an ever so scary way.\n\n\nTexturing and Materials\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, ‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’ will provide you with intensive learning all in one place, giving you access to over 8 textures, and 40 texture maps at 2 k resolution. This course will also teach you the basics of making your own materials and shaders using these textures.\n\n\n‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’ will teach you all about the gamma, hue, saturation, and some world Blender nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulations\n\n\n\n\nSimulation is something new which we have never covered before until today. This is the best side of this ‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’ course. We will be learning all about the three major simulations in Blender. First, we will talk all about liquid and displacement maps. You will be simulating a liquid that is in its boiling state.\n\n\nYou will also be finding out about how to simulate fire and how domains work. This will allow you to simulate fire realistically, changing the way it looks depending on whether it is candlelight or a massive explosion. Likewise, we will be discovering how to give any scene that ominous feeling of impending death or spookiness in general. We will do that by simulating a moving cloud of smoke.\n\nSince this ‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’ course will not cover just one but three different types of simulations, you will be rocking the simulation game in no time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimation & Video Editing\n\n\n\n\nAs part of this ‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’ course, you will learn how to use keyframes to key in different animations to the parts we want to animate. These will include our magic potion and flickering lights.\n\n\nWe will also be going over a part of the 3D modelling artist role that most courses do not cover – video editing in Blender. Creating realistic simulations is not time well spent if you cannot do anything with them afterwards. Our video editing lessons will be like a course within a course with more to come. You will come away with the know-how that will allow you to put your animations and simulations together to create an amazing short video clip.\n\n\n\n\nLighting & Rendering\n\n\n\n\nBy joining ‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’, you will learn about specific types of in-built Blender lighting functionalities that will enhance the scary and dark feeling of our two Halloween scenes.\n\n\nWe will also be creating a portfolio render for any multimedia site you wish to upload your completed model to. Trust me when I say that having a short movie clip of your model, coupled with simulated and animated details will make you stand out by a mile.\n‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’ is a complete guide into using Cycles for lighting, rendering, shadow.\n\n\nRendering in Blender’s Eevee renderer will be discussed as well.\n\n\nCourse Resources & Freebies\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’ course resource pack includes pumpkin Jack-o'-lantern reference faces, 2 sounds for each simulation to go along with its move clip, 8 textures, and 40 texture maps at 2 k resolution.\nThe best course navigation tool for ‘Blender VFX Liquid, Fire & Smoke’ will be included. The course handbook will give the control back to you and you will be able to fully streamline your learning process to your needs and wants seamlessly.\n\n\n\n\nJoin this course and come be part of a 3D modeling journey of over 7 hours of learning that will see you go away with not one but two portfolio pieces.\n\n\nCheck out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down!\n\n\n\n\nStill unsure? Then, let me tell you what's unique about this course:\n\n\n\n\n· Following through a complete guide on creating two spooky Halloween scenes inclusive of simulations and fully animated elements\n· Using Blender and understanding its interface and shortcuts\n· 3D modeling from a beginner level right up to techniques used by professionals around the world in many top game companies\n· A course within a course introduction into (a) Blender basics, (b) materials and textures, (c) seams, sharps, and UVs, and (d) video editing basics\n· Discovering how to do simulations of liquid, fire, and smoke in Blender\n· Mastering the basics of Blender video editing and movie compositing\n· Using Pumpkin Jack-o'-lantern reference faces to create carved pumpkins\n· Effective problem-solving in Blender\n· Creating Collections of Objects and Meshes using a Hierarchy System\n\n\nLet's create something with a real scary feel to it just in time for Halloween. It will be alive and everything!\nWhat a perfect virtual escape for us lovers of all things magical…\n\n\nUntil next time, happy modelling everyone!\n\n\nNeil – 3D Tudor",

As a result, the render time is limited, hurting your presentation.\nThis course is for you if you are an architect or designer who needs visualizations/renderings but does not have the time to understand complicated rendering processes. Are you ready to master Lumion 12 in the fastest way possible?\nThis course will begin with an overview of Lumion's essential tools and functions. We'll start with SketchUp models (download link provided) and work our way up to importing and setting effects for the render. You'll have gone through the fundamentals of creating excellent exterior photos and movies in only a few videos.

It is intended for those already in the civil engineering workforce and those looking to stand out from others and become a specialist civil designer.\nThe software is very comprehensive and can perform any civil engineering requirement. Yearly updates are released from Autodesk, and there is multiple third party add-ons. You can spend a life time trying to master the software and still have benefit from more training.\n\"The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.\" - Albert Einstein\nThere are many training courses available which are excellent for beginners or those wanting to get an overview of a specific workflow such as a designing a road. However, this course takes a step back and looks at a variety of ways of working with Civil 3D surfaces in the initial stages of a project. It focuses on one topic in detail, a resource that is not easily found elsewhere.\nHaving an accurate and manageable existing base model/surface is an essential step in a design project. It is paramount to ensuring the design is feasible, safe, and able to be priced accurately.\nSetting up a design project correctly is an essential skill that you cannot afford not to have.\nNote: This course will be done using metric measurement terminology.",

The skills you learn here are fully transferable to all your future builds.\n\n\nIt will teach you about snapping, free transform techniques, and structure modification. This will allow you to get unique-looking variances to populate your medieval castle, stronghold area, or city as fast as possible.\nWork with multiple pre-set camera angles to get the best composition out of a castle that looks great from any angle.\n\n\nTexturing & Materials\n\n\nThrough ‘Build Stunning Medieval Worlds with UE5's Modular Kitbash’ you will be learning everything right from importing individual models from Blender to having them work correctly in UE5.\nWe will look at how to import and use textures created specifically for Unreal Engine and use them to create the materials for our medieval castle stronghold modular pieces. You will find out how to change PBR texture values by directly adjusting their information from within, built into the image editor.\n\n\nNext, we will set up PBR materials with adjustable parameters that will allow you to change the intensity of the normal map (e.g., adjust colour, change roughness values, and more). You will work through the different transparency materials that will help you set up cut-out decals, partially transparent decals with PBR values and two side-faced textures.\n\n\nUE5 Water System\n\n\nYou will learn how to use UE5’s modeling mode to deform a collection of modular assets. One of the things we will do together is to merge bridge pieces and bend a bridge using the curve deformer. And that’s because who doesn’t love a picturesque bridge over a body of water?!\n‘Build Stunning Medieval Worlds with UE5's Modular Kitbash’ will also show you how to create a body of water for a river which transitions into a lake using UE5’s built-in water plugin. Together, we will learn how to modify the plugin to allow submergible boats to float on it in a realistic way.\n\n\nSculpting Terrain\n\n\nThis course will teach you how to model and sculpt out terrain using a variety of techniques to help us shape out large-scale areas:\n- Using sculpting mode tools (e.g., sculpt + flatten) to shape out terrain;\n- Optimising thermal erosion and hydro erosion to add natural detail to a landscape;\n- Utilising UE5’s copy mode to reuse height information to create background mountains quickly.\n\n\n‘Build Stunning Medieval Worlds with UE5's Modular Kitbash’ will also see us creating a landscape material that uses PBR values from Quixel asset library materials and sets them up as a ‘material attribute’.\nYou will learn how to hide a textured pattern with mask noise variances and distance blend techniques. Afterwards, you will learn how to create (a) an automatic landscape based on a one-slope angle with mask height overlay, (b) castle tiles with rotation and scaling, and (c) landscape-painted puddles.\n\n\nLandscaping in UE5\n\n\n‘Build Stunning Medieval Worlds with UE5's Modular Kitbash’ will show you how to make texture adjustments in the texture detail panel and material graph. You will also be finding out about how to organise material graphs with comments boxes and node reroute techniques.\nUsing Quixel library assets, we will be quickly populating our medieval city scene with rocks. At the same time, we will also make use of Quixel’s built-in vertex painting tool to paint a grass texture onto our rocky assets.\nLikewise, Quixel foliage will allow us to add animated trees and bushes to our scene, and with UE5’s nanite functionality, there are no limits to how great and alive these can look!\n‘Build Stunning Medieval Worlds with UE5's Modular Kitbash’ will teach you how to paint out natural forests and make them look realistic in a large-level environment.\n\n\nLighting & VFX\n\n\nUsing the UE5 starter content pack, we will readjust fire and smoke VFX to fit the aesthetics of our medieval city stronghold scene. This will involve rescaling and applying these effects to our torches and chimney.\n‘Build Stunning Medieval Worlds with UE5's Modular Kitbash’ will show you how to create a dynamic light system using the addon blueprint. We will also be creating a day/night cycle by manually setting up a moon since it does not work by default.\n\n\nAs part of the course, you will also be engaging in post-processing, and we will be adding additional lighting sources to the castle, such as the ones coming out of the building windows.\n\n\nOne of the most exciting things about ‘Build Stunning Medieval Worlds with UE5's Modular Kitbash’ is that you will create collisions for stairs so that a playable UE5 character can use them.

      "description": "Introduction to Animation Principles using Adobe Animate is an introductory course into 2D Character Animation focused on the practicalities and theory behind the animation principles.\nThe aim of the course is to introduce students to the animation pipelines and workflows, from planning and blocking, to the final 2D animation sequence. These workflows are the base for films and games animation.\nUnderstanding the animation principles will increase your artistic abilities related to character animation.\nThis course also offers an insight into the physics concepts in connection to the animation principles. As animators, we use basic physics principles in order to capture the mechanics of a believable motion.\nThroughout the course, we build the complexity with each new exercise. You’ll develop a strong foundation on how to apply the animation principles and how to bring your own ideas to life.\n\n\nTeaching modules:\nThe course is divided into several modules covering the tools, theory, and practical exercises.\nIntroduction Lecture of the Animation Principles vs Physics Principles.\nExercise 1. Bouncing ball on place, loop cycle\nExercise 2. Bouncing ball in space, with attenuation\nExercise 3.1. Ball with tail, bouncing on place, loop cycle\nExercise 3.2. Ball with tail, sliding in space\nThe End and What's Next\nHow to approach this course:\nThe course has 3 main progressive exercises, and each exercise comes along with the following materials:\nReal-time animation workflow video, from start to finish.\n1 JPG file as a starting planning sheet.\n1 PDF file as keynotes from video lessons, covering all the animation tools, animation theory, as well as specific animation workflows.\nMultiple FLA files (source files) are saved as progressive files for each video lesson.\nWith each exercise, you get increased complexity of animation principles, tools, and workflows.\nExported animation in multiple file formats.\nEach exercise starts with a discussion around the planning sheet and then students are being introduced to the theory and tools.\nNote: The first exercise comes with an introduction to Adobe Animate interface.\nAfter this course:\nThe role of a character animator is to give life to characters and to create the illusion of life.\nThe character can be anything in terms of physical appearance, from an object to an animal, to a human or a creature. It doesn’t really matter as long as the animator makes the character feel alive, making the audience think that the character is real in terms of movement and emotions.\nTo understand and practice character animation you also have to learn the visual language of communication. And you start doing this only by learning the fundamentals of visual storytelling.\nOnce you understand the basics, you'll get a boost of artistic confidence.

      "description": "This course was originally created for students participating in Skills Ontario's Animation Challenge (similar to the 11 Second Club), as a way to quickly get them comfortable with both the fundamentals of traditional animation as well as practical knowledge of Toon Boom's software. To do this, the course is designed to walk through the completion of a scene starting from analyzing dialogue, to story-boarding, to creating actual animation, while being sure to emphasize the core principles of animation.\nWith this in mind, the course is best suited for animation students that are either new to the medium, or those looking to bring their traditional skills to the digital realm, using Toon Boom. While there are many videos available online that feature Toon Boom's software, most of them focus on cut-out style animation, or puppets, rather than traditional frame-by-frame style animation. After getting many remarks from even industry pros surprised that Toon Boom can actually not only support traditional animation, but do it amazingly well, I felt it high time for some video tutorials focussing on the basics.\nThis course features Toon Boom's Storyboard Pro, and Harmony 11, industry standards in animation software. Although, to keep up with all the version changes, I've made sure to focus on features that are also available in both older and newer versions of Harmony (including Harmony 17), as well Toon Boom's former Animate, Animate Pro, applications. And for those absolute beginners, there's still plenty of information that can be used, whether you're still drawing with a pencil, or deciding what type of software to pick up for your next animated project.\nThis course includes 19, densely-packed lessons, over the span of exactly an hour.\n\nA great way to fast-track your working knowledge of both animation and Toon Boom basics!",

In the middle of the path that goes from pure polygonal modeling (mostly used in the videogame industry or archviz) and solid modeling (purely used in CAD systems for very technical levels) there is the hard surface modeling field, In this modeling style you will get advantage of both worlds: You will have the creative freedom of polygonal modeling and the finesse of solid modeling.\nIn terms of building a path in your 3D artist career, hard surface modeling is a key point.\nWhat do I need to start?\nFirst of all, the techniques and methods shown in this course are, in a high percentage, applicable to any other 3D modeling software. As a teacher, I always try to keep it simple, use the tools wisely and show the basics that every 3D modeler should know.\nFor this course, I used Foundry´s MODO901, so you will need to have that software installed in your computer. It is not strictly limited to the 901 version (you will be able to replicate almost all the procedures even in previous versions) but it is highly recommended to follow it with the latest version, or you will be missing some specific tools.\nIncluded in the first lesson there is a download link for you to download the sample files in MODO´s native format, and also in OBJ format if you want to use another software. The images used as blueprints and a nice hdri image for the illumination is also included.\nWhat will I learn?\nThis course covers a wide range of modeling methods with the purpose of showing all the techniques available to you to get a good quality model. This means:\nKeeping a good mesh flow\nWorking in all quads for a good finished mesh\nSolving typical problems\nAdding interest to the look of your project, be it materials, lightning, modeling details...\nKnowing the tools and how to use them properly",

Except from Twinmotion!\nAfter more than 4 years of using Twinmotion, I decided to create this course in order to teach you the basics of the software and also my workflow in how to work between REVIT and Twinmotion.\nHaving the knowledge of a software like that, will give you a big push in your career path (believe me in that :) )\nBy using the skill of rendering using Twinmotion; you can save a lot of money for your firm, your project or even you can make a lot of money if you decided to work as a freelancer! ( I have done it already ;) )\nWith Twinmotion you manipulate your model directly in 3D, as in a game. Choose how to move, the speed and mode:  walking, driving, flying or a step-by-step immersive “walkthrough.”\nThe interface with chronological tabs continuously guides you. The logic behind Twinmotion allows you to progress step-by-step in the construction of the scene. From the perspective to orthographic views, you can observe your project from any angle. For even more precision, access the Object manager and its advanced features to customize your workspace.",

This is a shader that makes realistic waterfalls in the Eevee render engine.\nThe 3D version uses a special form of shader displacement that is specialized for Eevee. Since it does not use deforming geometry, so you can create waterfalls dynamically in real-time.\nAfter that we have water simulation based addon. Add water effects to your scene super quickly with aquatiq. Instead of spending hours creating complex simulations, you add simple planes with animation sequences that can be previewed in the viewport.\nThe library contains 2D and 3D water assets that can be used as legos to build new effects and assets like fountains, birdbaths, and water materials.

I have taught many people in the workplace the best ways to set up corridors and how to use them to your advantage to productively create drawing outputs so I believe I understand how to convey the important bits of information in a format you can understand.\nThere are many training courses available which are excellent for beginners or those wanting to get an overview of the whole software. In addition, I believe there is a demand for courses aimed at intermediate/advanced users who want to be able to use the software more independently at a higher level. It is important to understand, making a detailed corridor model is not always actually required. The corridor model is just a tool to help check and convey your design.\nRemember: \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\" - George Box\nCheck out the course content below to see if the sections and lecture questions might be useful to you.\nNote: Example drawings in this course are provided in 2013 and 2018 file versions. Although, it is recommended you use Civil 3D version 2018 or later for this course to avoid backward compatibility issues with drawing objects.\nIf you have a Civil 3D version below 2018 you will still be able to follow the course but some of the completed example drawings may not appear correctly when opened.",

If you have a natural curiosity for tinkering, building, or engineering your own designs, this is a course in bringing those designs to life, and to market!\nThe lectures in this course will provide you with the background knowledge you need to design in 3D covering skills like; modeling, meshing, extruding, rapid prototyping, 3D printing, and more. All of the materials in this course are based on developing real-world experience in designing printable products and selling them online.\n*Even if you don't have access to your own personal 3D printer, I will show you several options to handle this small problem.*\nYou DO have options for getting your ideas printed for prototyping before they go to market!\nThe course is comprehensive in nature and starts with an overview of what 3D printing technology is, some of the leaders in this space, and how the process works. As the course progresses, students will see how simple ideas can quickly come to a design, and how those designs can be printed within hours. Further, I will show you how to create an online store and sales system for marketing and selling your ideas. A start to finish process of idea -> design -> prototype -> product for sale.\nThe course can be taken in small bits, and could easily be completed in a few days. If you stop to work through the projects, it could easily take up to two weeks. Move as you see fit through the projects based on your comfort and experience level.\nThe course is updated frequently as new projects, technologies and trends become available.

      "description": "Hello potential students.! This course is going to cover everything you need to know in order to destroy and blow up a building from a real photograph.\nThere are over 10.5 hours of lecture videos going over the process of destroying a building.\nYou should have working knowledge of Houdini before enrolling in this course. If you have done my previous Houdini course “Master Houdini FX”, you will have no problem following this course since I build on a lot of the initial principles of rig creation that were presented in the first course.\nThis is a “Fast paced” course, meaning I will not be explaining every function of every node I use. I will explain where necessary, but basic nodes will not be explained in detail, this is to try keeping this total course time to a minimum, and another reason you should have basic Houdini knowledge prior to enrolling into this mid level course.\nAll lectures will have Houdini hip files for you to download and any other necessary assets. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I encourage you to watch the intro video and watch some of the “free” videos so you can get a sense of what the course is like.\n\n\nThe basic breakdown of the course goes like this:\n\n\nWe will start with an overview of how and why I chose the building I did to use as our subject.\n\n\nI will include the model file and briefly go over what I did to model the building, but will not be showing the creation process step by step. It took around 4.5 hours of Boolean modelling to finish and would be unnecessarily boring to make you watch the model process.!\n\n\nWe will then start selectively fracturing the building model section by section until we have all geometry fractured.\n\n\nWe then start doing RBD sims and even throw a little vellum into the mix to make our sim more interesting.\n\n\nOnce we have our RBD’s and vellum finished, we go into simulating our fireball explosion using the more modern “Sparse” simulation tools.\n\n\nWe will then create an embers pass to give our sim a little something extra.\n\n\nWe will be creating and assigning any and all shaders that are needed as we go.\n\n\nWe will then go into rendering and I will show how to create all the renders necessary for a full comp.\n\n\nThis course will be using Mantra as our render engine to keep things “off the shelf Houdini” and not rely on plugins.\n\n\nOnce all the renders are done, we will assemble a full comp including camera shake to add some more realism to the end result.\n\n\nThis course will teach you everything you need to know to be able to go out and photograph your own building and create all the custom destruction you wish. Once you finish this course using the included image and building geometry, you will be ready to find your own building in your own town to photograph and recreate this setup on a building of your choice. I will be presenting a very straight forward and “easy” method to creating an FX shot like this.\nIf you have been using Houdini for a little while, you should have no problems following this course. If you need a refresher or are just starting to use Houdini, I recommend doing my first Houdini course “Master Houdini FX” as a primer to this course.",

      "description": "Rigging can be a very excruciatingly technical step in creating animatable characters. This class aims to present a step-by-step guide to creating a functional character rig that will allow the animator to deliver a believable performance. Being able to rig characters from scratch empowers the animator to be able to create characters of their own free from the constraints of automatic rigging solutions. Make no mistake, such solutions are great timesavers, but they can tend to limit the animator.\nWe will create this rig using Manlo, the character we modeled, UV mapped and surfaced in Model a Low-Polygon Character in Maya 2018, so if you are new to Maya, you should at least have that course under your belt. Also, please note that this is an intermediate class. The author assumes you have a functional understanding of basic Maya tools as the move, rotate, and scale tools, shelf and tool locations and using Maya's hotbox to access them; concepts like X, Y, and Z movement and axes, object vs. world space movement and rotations and hierarchies. The author will address these ideas in terms of rigging characters, however, they may be unfamiliar to beginners.\nThat said, at the end of this course, you will have both a rigged character that you can use in your own animations AND the skill set to create animated characters of your very own!",

This file, is a set of instructions, the printer follows, to print your model. This file, is known as a \"GCODE\" file.\n\nULTIMATER \"CURA\" is a widely used program, by 3D Printers world wide, as it is powerful, and 100% FREE. In this course, we will be working with CURA, to teach you everything you need, to download an STL, and print it properly\n\nSlicing an STL file, into a working GCODE, that will print successfully, is complicated, and can become extremely frustrating. I will walk you through the most important functions of Ultimaker Cura, in small, easy to follow lectures. Each lecture, will teach you a vital component, of working with STL files, in Cura, to help you understand how prepare a GCODE file, for printing success.\n\nThis course, is tought in a slow, detailed, plain language manner.

Other key functionalities within ZBrush are the modify topology palette and, especially useful, the transpose action tools.  Both have a great number of features to facilitate our workflow and help speed up the process of production.  We'll look to create separate elements in separate Ztools and then merge each mesh into one single scene for a final completed piece.\nMore about the Instructor:\nHaving 25 years of experience in the videogame development/entertainment arenas, Stephen is well versed in a variety of programs and production pipelines and strives to work as cleanly and efficiently as possible. He's done pretty much everything, and enjoys getting to share his knowledge and experience in the hopes that he can help students gain a better understanding and appreciation of what 3D computer art (in all its varying forms) has to offer.",

Within each lesson we build upon the things learned in previous lessons and add new tips and features along the way.\nFusion 360 is a free and powerful, widely used 3d modeling software.\nFusion 360 is a huge program and it is impossible to even get close to discussing everything within the software in one hour. Therefore, I focus on the solids design workspace, but I also show you how to render your designs.\nAfter this course you will have the confidence to create your own prototypes or designs and you will also be able to make beautiful renders of them, all in just 1 hour.\nI do limit the course to the solids design workspace (sketch, create, modify, etc.) but experience tells me that once you are comfortable within this part of Fusion, you will also be able to use other parts of the program thanks to Fusion's intuitive nature.\nAt the end of the course I also added 3 bonus video's which will get your started designing for both 3d printing and laser cutting\nIf you can not wait to start creating your own designs, and want the tools to get started, this it the perfect course for you!",

You can find the new lesson videos at the bottom part of the curriculum.\n\n\nArchitectural visualization is the skill needed in every architecture and property development business. Why? Because architects need them to present their designs and property developers need them to make sale. The demand is very high yet not many people willing to master it; thinking it's a complicated stuff to master. Well not anymore! This course will teach you effectively how to create beautiful 3D architectural visualization using 3DS MAX and Arnold renderer with just a fraction of time usually needed.\nThis course is designed for a complete beginner so no prior experience is needed. On the other hand seasoned 3DS MAX users can still benefit from this course as we'll be covering more specific topics in this course such as Arnold renderer and post-processing with Photoshop.\nFirst we'll cover the fundamental stuff in 3DS MAX. Then we move on to different 3D modeling techniques. We'll cover a lot of exercise projects designed to develop your skill step-by-step. After that we're going to deepen our knowledge to lighting, material and rendering using Arnold rendering engine. Our final project is to build an interior scene from scratch; from modeling, texturing, lighting, rendering and finally retouch it in Photoshop.",

I've worked on numerous Films including Guardians of the Galaxy, World War Z, The Dark Knight, The Golden Compass, Clash of the titans, Hobbs and Shaw and Tenet. Over that time, I've taught Zbrush at schools and universities, and I've hired and trained Interns for Cinesite, Framestore and The Mill. After writing many articles and training documents for the companies I've worked for, I'm finally releasing a course for everyone out there to get started in Zbrush!\n\n\nIn this course, you'll learn the basics of zbrush, how its navigation and menu's work. How to use the tools and get starting sculpting your own 3D creations. Following the guided structure, you'll learn how to block out a creature in zspheres, define the form and add high resolution details before going onto to pose, texture and render your concept. This course is designed for beginners and those new to zbrush.",

      "description": "In this course, I will teach you how to design and animate 2-D game characters in the simplest, clearest way possible. You will get an over the shoulder viewpoint of my actual workflow from start to finish.\nBy the end of the series, you will be able to build modular game characters that allow for an unlimited amount of movement and poses needed for most game characters. You will learn how to create expressions and switch them out depending on what actions the characters were taking.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nhow to design a 2-D game character that works across all screens\nhow to apply color theory to your game character\nhow to build a modular 2-D game character\nhow to navigate Spriter's timeline\nhow to work with my \"Foundation First\" approach to animation and design\nand much more!\nAlways start with the end in mind!\nIn this course, you will not only learn how to animate 2-D game characters, but I will also teach you how to design characters for multiple screen sizes. Screens are now smaller than ever, and not everyone plays games on a TV, so is essential that we maximize the screen real estate so the main character stands out as they should.\nWe will also touch on simple color theory so we can create a color scheme for the character that works well with his environment. We will design the character in specific proportions that will allow for the most readability and clear understanding of what the characters capable of as soon as the player sees and interacts with the character.\nWe will then move on to a basic walk cycle building off the momentum from the simple jump animation we just finished creating. The methodology I'll be using for these lessons is that we make a solid foundational animation, then overlay our secondary animation over the foundation, this ensures that the core animation is complete and we don't get bogged down with details too early.\nEnroll today!",

Well Autodesk Maya is a very powerful software which is used in many leading animation companies for creation of 3d art work an animation. Recently I have gone through many tutorials and have found those awesome and very useful, but I think learning Maya is not that easy and watching a tutorial for complete Maya wont help . Through experience and practice you can enhance your skills in the fields you choose like Modeling , texturing and animation.\nIf I would have been a beginner I would definitely want to learn Maya quickly. Being a professional character modeler I understand what is required to teach cause Maya is vast and takes time to learn everything. So I have focused on specific tools required for Modeling a 3d Face. In my course I have explained about various modeling tools and have shown you to build a 3d face from a reference. I have also added the Maya files and the reference images for the course for you.\nSo students who are eager to learn fast Modeling techniques can come to my course and enhance their skills",

      "description": "In this course, you will be able to create a dinosaur from scratch to finish. You will learn the in's and out's when it comes to creating a finalized portfolio piece. What's even better is this course is geared and created with an open-sourced program called Blender!\nInside this course, I do my absolute best to explain every process using real-time footage and explanations. You can see every click and change that I do within the video. The course is in-depth as it is nearly 40 hours long!\n\n\nThe Workflow:\n* Create a low to high poly T-Rex\n* Sculpt using a multiresolution modifier\n* UV unwrap\n* Bake information onto texture maps\n* Pose\n* Create a scene\n* Post-editing\n\n\nWhat you can expect inside:\nThis course is designed with the intention of creating a finalized render for your portfolio.\nThroughout the modeling stages of the T-Rex, we will start with designing a low poly T-Rex.\nThe process will entail using a multi-resolution modifier that we will enable once we get into the sculpting stages of the course. From that point, we will be baking our high poly information onto our low poly dinosaur via texture maps.\nWe will use several different techniques to bake our texture maps; one technique that is extremely useful is called a cage.\nThe next stages will include creating an armature, dealing with bones, and inverse kinematics so that we can pose our dinosaur.\nWe then create our scene with much more environmental detail.\nLastly, we render and finish up with some compositing!\n\n\nLearn how to:\n* Insert blueprint references\n* Create a model from blueprint references\n* Join several pieces of geometry into one object\n* Utilize different tools and add-ons featured within Blender\n* Use alpha brushes to create scales on your T-Rex\n* Create your own alpha textures\n* UV unwrap your model\n* Create two different base colors for your Rex.\n* Create several different texture maps that will bring your T-Rex to life!\n* Finalize the scene with plants, trees, and lights for a final render.\n* Lastly, composite your T-Rex to apply final effects!\n\n\n… There is so much more inside the course!\n\nAdditional Offers\nPart 2 available on my website - view my profile to get access!\nFREE modeling course on the Onchopristis saw shark (exclusive to my website)!\n\n\nThis course was designed and created using Blender 3.0 + but is compatible with 4.0 and up...

      "description": "SKETCHUP\nIn this Sketchup course we will start from an initiation level to end up mastering the program at an expert level. We will learn all the Sketchup tools such as: materials, styles, scenes, animations, sunlight, connection to Google-Earth, photomatch, dynamic components, terrains, plugins and much more.\nIt is a very complete course equivalent to 30 teaching hours where theory and practice go hand in hand through numerous exercises that will increase in complexity as more knowledge is acquired. It is designed to end with expert knowledge about the program that will allow us to face any project successfully, no matter how complex it may be.\nThe course consists of different blocks:\n\n\nWorkspace block. We will start with a presentation of the program, we will see how to install it correctly, we will adjust our preferences as well as the units and we will begin to familiarize ourselves with the workspace. We will learn how to navigate in the three-dimensional environment of Sketchup, how to move using the different views, we will see the selection tools and the keyboard shortcuts that will make our workflow much faster.\nTheory and concepts . We will begin to learn important and slightly more complex concepts such as the difference between lines, surfaces, groups and components within Sketchup. We will also see the importance of inverting faces at specific moments\nDrawing in 2D. We will explore all the drawing tools in 2D.\nDrawing in 3D . It will be time to delve into the most complex tools of the program such as the extrusion tools, move, copy, rotate, scale, follow me or equidistance. In this block we will also see  operations between solids.\nMeasure and text. Which will focus on the use of other types of tools more focused on measurement, such as dimensioning tools, distance and angle measurement, change of position of the coordinate axes or the text tools and of section.\nDefaut trays. We will see the so-called ¨default trays¨. We will learn how to use the material tray, entity information, components, layers, styles, scenes or sunshine.\nSpecial tools. We will see some other Sketchup tools of special importance. We will study the use of the wharehouse library, the creation of terrains, the geolocation of our projects through the use of Google Earth, the very interesting photomatch tool, the creation of animations, dynamic components and the use of plugins that extend the capabilities of Sketchup to be able to model everything that is in our imagination.\nUtilities. Will deal with functional aspects of the program such as: importing dwg files, exporting images in different formats, as well as useful tips to improve our workflow based on my experience. Finally, the last chapter will make a comparison between Lumion and Vray, the two main rendering software that the market offers us to obtain photorealistic images from our models made in Sketchup.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these blocks will be accompanied by practical exercises at the end of each block to establish the theory explained with specific exercises on those specific topics.\nAlso to consolidate knowledge, at the end of all the blocks, a 30-question multiple choice questionnaire is proposed, where the student will test their theoretical knowledge of the program.\n\n\nUpdates block. The course is made in the 2021-2022 version.The truth is that there are hardly any differences with the previous versions. In this block I will update a new class every year explaining the most important improvements in the latest Sketchup version.\n\n\nElevate your 3D design and visualization skills with our comprehensive Master Course, combining the power of SketchUp, LayOut, and Lumion. This Master is tailored for architects, designers, and professionals looking to master the entire workflow from initial concept to stunning presentations.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn:\nSketchUp: Create detailed 3D models with precision and ease.\nLayOut: Develop professional architectural documents and presentations.\nLumion: Bring your designs to life with realistic rendering and animation.\nCourse Highlights:\nStep-by-step instruction from an architect and industry expert\nHands-on projects to build your portfolio\nTips and tricks to streamline your workflow\nAccess to exclusive resources and project files\nCertificate of completion to enhance your credentials\n\n\nWhy this Master course?\nMy name is Manuel Pallarés, I live in Bali, Indonesia, and I have been using SketchUp for over more than ten years. I am a freelance architect and I use to collaborate with diferent architectural firms to model and render their projects.\nFuthermore, I have been teaching SketchUp for several years in different creative schools and this course is the resault of that acumulated knowldge. I have experienced face to face the problems that you encounter in the program. They are always the same. So in this course I will try to resolve all of them step by step.\nThis course is well thought out, carefully planned to teach you exactly what you need to know, without any fluff. In addition to using my own experience with SketchUp, many tutorials require hours of research and experimentation. The result is an easy to follow tutorial to get you modeling quickly and having fun during the process.\nSketchUp is a powerful, flexible, affordable, easy to use 3D modeling software.\nMy goal is to enable you to effortlessly take your ideas and bring them to life in 3D. SketchUp is the best tool for communicating and visualizing ideas, because its simplicity encourages creativity. The tool doesn’t get in the way of the creative process.\nIf you’ve never used CAD or any other 3D modeling program, you are at an advantage because you will not have habits ingrained from other software. You’ll be able to learn the fundamentals quickly, and you’ll be encouraged by the quick progress you are making. Don’t be intimidated if you’ve tried other complicated CAD software, only to become overwhelmed. SketchUp is one of the easiest 3D modeling programs to get started with, and I will help you learn the basics.\nIf you’re experienced with CAD, or are looking for an alternative 3D modeling program from what you’re currently using, you’ll find SketchUp to be refreshing. The simple interface does not inhibit your creativity. You will no longer need to conform to complicated tools or procedures. Create whatever you can imagine. SketchUp is 100% accurate, works with nearly any unit of measurement, with precision up to 0.000001″. Enhance SketchUp with thousands of 3rd party extensions, and use LayOut to create construction documents from your SketchUp Pro models.\nMy Background\nMy first experience with Sketchup was during the last years of my architecture degree in Madrid. I was in my last year and I decided to use the program to represent my project in a three-dimensional way. I started self-taught, but even so, the program completely seduced me and I enjoyed making my 3D model . The truth is that I would have liked to know this powerful tool from the first year of my degree and not in the last. Accustomed to using Autocad, Sketchup was a breath of fresh air. I began to enjoy graphic representation. That is why for all those university students I think it is the perfect tool.\nAfter the degree, I started working in different architecture studios in Lujbljana, Slovenia. Always in charge of the 3D representation of the different projects and their rendering. In this way I began to specialize in the use of Sketchup at a professional level. A program that seemed simple turned out to be more and more complex and powerful while maintaining that fresh air. That intuitive ability.\nIn this way, the next step consisted of working as a teacher in different creative schools. In this way I began to carry out a study program. I gradually polished this program over the years learning from the difficulties my students encountered.\nAnd here came the pandemic. At that moment, I decided to transform my face-to-face course into an online course. In a constant learning process thanks to keeping professional collaborations open, this course tries to synthesize all that knowledge accumulated over the last ten years in a professional and rigorous way, but also honoring the spirit of Sketchup, and proposing a way to learn fun and enjoyable.\n\n\nSketchup course\nIn this Sketchup course we will start from an initiation level to end up mastering the program at an expert level. We will learn all the Sketchup tools such as: materials, styles, scenes, animations, sunlight, connection to Google-Earth, photomatch, dynamic components, terrains, plugins and much more.\nIt is a very complete course equivalent to 30 teaching hours where theory and practice go hand in hand through numerous exercises that will increase in complexity as more knowledge is acquired.

We will see the so-called ¨default trays¨. We will learn how to use the material tray, entity information, components, layers, styles, scenes or sunshine.\nSpecial tools. We will see some other Sketchup tools of special importance. We will study the use of the wharehouse library, the creation of terrains, the geolocation of our projects through the use of Google Earth, the very interesting photomatch tool, the creation of animations, dynamic components and the use of plugins that extend the capabilities of Sketchup to be able to model everything that is in our imagination.\nUtilities. Will deal with functional aspects of the program such as: importing dwg files, exporting images in different formats, as well as useful tips to improve our workflow based on my experience. Finally, the last chapter will make a comparison between Lumion and Vray, the two main rendering software that the market offers us to obtain photorealistic images from our models made in Sketchup.\n\n\nEach of these blocks will be accompanied by practical exercises at the end of each block to establish the theory explained with specific exercises on those specific topics.\nAlso to consolidate knowledge, at the end of all the blocks, a 30-question multiple choice questionnaire is proposed, where the student will test their theoretical knowledge of the program.\n\n\nUpdates block. The course is made in the 2021-2022 version.The truth is that there are hardly any differences with the previous versions. In this block I will update a new class every year explaining the most important improvements in the latest Sketchup version.\n\n\nNew Plugins and Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence is changing the way we work. In this section we will focus on the main plugins that emerge in this topic.\nTo complete the course, the 3D modeling of the iconic Barcelona Pavilion by the German architect Mies Van der Rohe is proposed as a WORK PROJECT. We will work on it during all the course using the tools that we learnt in the previous block.\nThrough this project you will learn:\nControl the scale of the model, correct use of groups and components, using dynamic components, model order through the use of tags, correct use of materials, correct use of furniture and elements outside SKP, correct placement of the north and sunlight of the scene, artistic use of styles, use of sections, dimensions and text and making animations in mp4 format from our scenes.\n\n\nLayout course\n\n\nUsing LayOut with SketchUp offers numerous advantages that significantly enhance your workflow, especially when it comes to creating professional documentation and presentations. Here are some key benefits:\nSeamless Integration\nDirect Link to SketchUp Models: LayOut integrates directly with SketchUp, allowing you to import and update your 3D models effortlessly. Any changes made in SketchUp can be automatically reflected in your LayOut documents, ensuring consistency and saving time.\nProfessional Documentation\nCreate Detailed 2D Drawings: LayOut enables you to generate high-quality 2D drawings from your 3D models, including plans, elevations, sections, and details. These drawings are precise and can be annotated with dimensions, labels, and notes.\nCustomizable Templates\nConsistent Branding and Layouts: LayOut offers customizable templates that help maintain consistency across all your documents. You can create templates that match your brand, including logos, title blocks, and standardized layouts, ensuring a professional appearance.\nDynamic Viewports\nFlexible Model Views: LayOut’s viewports allow you to create multiple views of your SketchUp model within a single document. You can control the scale, perspective, and style of each viewport, giving you the flexibility to showcase your design from different angles.\nScalable and Accurate Outputs\nPrecise Scaling: LayOut allows you to scale your models accurately, making it ideal for producing construction documents. Whether you’re working on large architectural plans or detailed shop drawings, you can ensure that your outputs are to scale and meet industry standards.\nEnhanced Presentation\nVisual Storytelling: LayOut empowers you to create compelling presentations that go beyond basic 2D drawings. With the ability to add textures, shadows, and even stylized line work, your documents can convey the full intent and aesthetic of your design.\nEfficient Revision Process\nEasy Updates and Revisions: Because LayOut links directly to your SketchUp model, any revisions made in SketchUp are easily updated in LayOut. This minimizes the need for manual adjustments, streamlining the revision process and reducing errors.\nCollaboration and Sharing\nExport Options: LayOut offers multiple export options, including PDF, DWG, and image formats, making it easy to share your work with clients, collaborators, and stakeholders. This ensures that your documents are accessible to everyone involved in the project.\nTime-Saving Automation\nAuto-Text and Tables: LayOut includes features like auto-text, which automatically populates text fields with project information, and tables for organizing data, further reducing the time spent on documentation tasks.\nConsistency and Quality Control\nStandardized Output: By using LayOut, you can ensure that all your project documentation adheres to a consistent standard, which is crucial for quality control and professional presentation.\n\n\nI just want to add,\nWelcome to this Sketchup + Layout course!\n\n\nFinally you should know that you will have my guidance during the course. Any doubt you have, you can ask me and in less than 48h I will respond you with the answer.\n\n\nBest regards,\nManuel Pallarés\n\n\nWelcome!\n\n\nFinally you should know that you will have my guidance during the course. Any doubt you have, you can ask me and in less than 48h I will respond you with the answer.\n\n\nBest regards,\nManuel Pallarés",

      "description": "INTRODUCTION\nHave you ever found yourself staring at your render output and ponder over it’s lack of photo realism. Have you wanted to get into Architectural Visualization, but felt it might be very tough? Do you have basic knowledge of 3ds Max and don’t know where to go next? Have you searched to get a course that takes you right from modelling right into rendering a photo realistic scene?\nWell then you are not only at the right place, but you get an added bonus – We do 2 Architectural Visualization Projects – Right from Scratch in both these scenes. So you not only learn new skills, new workflow, new way of looking at lighting, but also get to revise your skills simultaneously in the same course! How great is that?!!\nBut wait, I also tell you how to do some basic post processing after rendering out your scenes to get the final kick!\nWe have more – we not only use 3ds Max, Photoshop, as from the title you might’ve guessed, we also jump into VRAY & Marvelous Designer. Vray is used for texturing, lighting and rendering. 3ds Max for modelling the scenes obviously, Marvelous Designer to make the cloth elements of the scene. It’s a special software for cloth only. 3ds Max also does it but if you can cut a vegetable with a knife, why use a scissor to do that right?!\nLastly, you get the model files for free usage. The references used in this course were picked up from google images. Design isn’t mine but the models are.\nToo much right?!\nAt the time of recording this course, I am loading up SCENE 1 into the course, and SCENE 2 will be gradually added over the next 2 weeks as the editing is done.\n\n\nNow what do you need for this course?\n\n\nYou need to have access to the following –\nPC capable of running 3ds Max\n3DS Max, MD, Photoshop and VRAY. Except for vray there is trial for all.\nAccess to internet as we will search for textures and I will provide you with links.\nWhat are the prerequisites in terms of knowledge for the course?\nYou should be familiar with the basics of 3ds max interface, some basic modelling, texturing. If you are a complete beginner, then you can go through my free course called 3ds Max Learn Basics Foundation Course from my Instructor page.\nYou should be familiar with VRAY and Photoshop. For MD, I give a 1 minute tour along with our course itself.\nSo in short, it is kind of an intermediate level course. Nonetheless, I am always here, you can send me a message asking doubts if any and we will gather mountains to clear it! :D\nWhat will you gain at the end of this course?\nYou have added 2 scenes to your portfolio.\nAs mentioned, you get to learn and practice via the 2 scenes in same course.\nYou learn to make your own vray materials.\nYou Understand 3D Lighting.\nYou learn to set renders for fast rendering.\nYou learn to make your own textures in photoshop.\nLearn to MD a bit, so that you have realistic models.\nYou learn how to get realistic renders.\nYou also learn how to work with render elements section and a lot lot more!\nI’ll be launching a ton of such quality rich courses in future!\nSo what are you waiting for now? Click on that BUY NOW Button and gift yourself the pure learning experience and a chance to succeed! See you soon!",

      "description": "This course was originally 3 courses combined into 1. In the first course, you will learn all the fundamentals of Blender and then move on to 3D modeling techniques. In the second course, you will learn how to use materials, PBR textures, and UV mapping. And, in the third course, you will learn all aspects related to the Cycles rendering engine, including lighting, camera, render settings, and post-processing. I have carefully crafted the curriculum so that students can gain the skills gradually with no friction at all. After this course, in sha Allah, you will be able to create sophisticated 3D models, apply complex textures through UV editing, and be able to optimize Cycles to render high quality images.\nAbout the instructor\nMy name is Widhi Muttaqien, founder of Expose Academy, Expose Studio and Edutalenta. For more than 20 years, I have created thousands of 3D renderings, for architectural, interior, and master plan projects. I have worked with many clients all over the world. I have clients on almost every continent in the world. Besides doing projects, I have also been teaching 3D and computer graphics academically at various schools since the year 2000. In short, I have real-world professional expertise in 3D and teaching experience.\nThe curriculum\nYou will learn a lot in this course. In short, the course has nine chapters, not including the introduction chapter.\nIn the first chapter, you will learn all the fundamentals of working with Blender, such as the UI, navigation, viewport settings, object creation, selection, and so on. In the second chapter, we will focus on different object transformation techniques, and also the snapping features. In the third chapter, you will learn 3D modeling techniques. These include loop selection, extrude, inset, bevel, bridge, spin, and so on. You will model a lot of 3D objects along the way. By the end of the third chapter you should be able to model a modern curved nightstand product.\nIn the fourth chapter, you will learn all the basics of working with materials in Blender. From assigning and managing materials. Learn some CG fundamentals such as color models and color codes. Learn the differences between \"Metal\" and \"Dielectric\" materials. And learn all the features and potentials of the “Principled BSDF” shader. By the end of the chapter, you will have hands-on projects composing materials for a nightstand product and also some architectural objects.\nNext, in chapter 5, you will learn the fundamentals of shader and texture. You will understand the difference between procedural and image textures, and know how and when to use both. We will then cover PBR textures in detail. At the end of the chapter, you will have hands-on projects where you create texture for a vase model completely procedural. After that, you will create materials for a snowman model, also completely procedural.\nIn chapter 6, you will learn UV mapping in depth. You will learn different techniques of UV mapping and know how to use them and when to use them against different scenarios. You will also learn UV editing such as tweaking, splitting, stitching, UV sculpting, straightening, and so on. By the end of the chapter, you will have 4 hands-on projects. First, you will add a texture to a side table product. Then you will work on the previous nightstand model, but this time with a wood texture. And then you will add textures to this floor lamp 3D model. And finally, you will work on UV mapping a lounge chair product.\nIn the seventh chapter, you will learn how to use various light sources inside Blender. We will start with the world background and the sky texture. Then, you will learn how to use HDR or EXR files. And then learn to use light objects, such as point light, sunlight, spotlight, and area light. You will also learn how to create caustic effects, learn how to make lighting more realistic using IES files, and learn how to make material emit light using the “Emission” shader.\nNext, in chapter 8, you will learn how to easily set up cameras using different manipulation techniques. Then, you will learn the ins and outs of Cycles render settings such as samples, denoising, clamping, color spaces, view transform, white balance, and so on.\nIn the final chapter, you will learn how to perform post-processing to the rendered result using the “Compositor”. Everything is done non-destructively via nodes. And then, you will learn how to easily isolate pixels for compositing using “Cryptomatte”. Besides the small exercises throughout the course, you will be given a final project at the end. Basically, you will create product renderings of a lounge chair set in 3 different styles. First, with a transparent background but with shadows that can fit into any color or background. Second, with a 3D environment and an evening sky. And third, using the same 3D environment, but now with a day or afternoon sky.\nSo join now and master all the essentials 3D skills using Blender!",

When he is not in a  3d program creating unique and amazing hardsurface artwork, he is  having fun making money hand painting bag toss boards. As a young child,  he wanted to be a chef, but then got into video games and adopted his  cousins’ interests in comics and drawing. Most of his 3D/CG work has  been featured in courses, lesson articles and reviews he had made for 3D  Creative Magazine, 3D Artist Magazine, CGTuts+, Digital Tutors and  Pluralsight. The advice he gives artists that are just starting out and  want to make it in the 3d industry is to continue to learn and challenge  yourself. He believes in hardcore studying of the art fundamentals, but  also understands the importance of taking breaks, watching a movie,  hanging with friends because he believes that art imitates life and so one must do some ‘living’ between art projects for the sake of one’s  art. A very interesting fact about Pierre is he still has his pet turtle from 7th grade so the turtle is over 22 years old now!\nCourse Info\nIn this course, we will be creating the Mother Drive character.\nMother Drive is an organic android hybrid interface, developed to manage millions of landscaping drones and cultivate wildlife for peak eco standards.\nDuring the creation of our MotherDrive, we will cover important industry hardsurface methods and workflow in Zbrush.  I will show you variety of techniques for painting our character to set the mood and enhance her persona. Then we will pose our character bringing her to life. We will go through the process of rendering, and taking our renders in Photoshop to further embellish our art piece. By the end of this course, you will be able to produce your own amazing portfolio-ready character.\n\nMove fast and don’t waste time trying to decide if you deserve to get real results in your journey as a 3D artist.

      "description": "Hello everyone and welcome to this bundle which has 4 different complete courses compiled into a single one. With more than 37 hours of content, We will go over creating 4 different environments completely from start to finish.\n\n\nWhat you will get:\n\n\n4 Complete Courses!\n108 FHD videos with over 37+ hours of content\nAll the resources files required to complete the course including the Models, Unreal Projects, Substance Painter Files, Textures, Alphas\n\n\nSOFTWARES USED - (BLENDER, Substance Painter, Unreal Engine 5):\n\n\nWe will go over the complete pipeline of creating multiple high-quality realistic environments, starting with modelling all the assets in blender, texturing in Substance Painter and finally level design and composition in Unreal Engine 5.\nThis bundle has 4 different complete courses that are Creating a Kitchen Environment, Creating a Japanese Shrine Environment, Creating a Street Environment and Creating a Moroccan Riad. This bundle will help you improve your 3D Environment Art skills massively as we go through each step together and learn many different techniques.\nAfter finishing the courses, you would easily be able to create the renders shown in the trailer and also create high quality environments of your own.\n\n\nThis course has over 37 hours of content! (All the videos have audio commentary)\n\n\nWe will go over each and every step in this course together and nothing will be skipped. None of the courses have any kind of timelapses so that you can follow every step easily.\nWe will start by gathering some reference images to gain some initial ideas and the mood for our scene. After this we will move on to Blender and start modelling assets. We will start by modelling the main assets in our scene and after we are done with them, we will also create a bunch of different props to detail our scene even more, the entire process of modelling will be covered in Blender only.\nAfter we have modelled all our main assets, we will export them to Substance Painter to start the texturing process. We will learn to create high quality and realistic materials and the key features of Substance Painter like Smart Masks, generators, smart materials etc.\nAfter this we will import all our models and textures into Unreal Engine and setup the scene over there. The next step would be to setup our lighting and create a mood and atmosphere for our scene. We will make use of the new features of Unreal Engine such as Lumen to get realistic lighting for our scene, next we will set up a post-Processing volume to further enhance the visuals of our scene.\nThen we will spend some more time modelling and texturing many small props to further detail the scene even more. We will end all the courses setting up different camera angles and taking high resolution screenshots for our portfolio along with some compositing.\n\n\nThis bundle is for everyone who has a basic understanding of Blender, Substance Painter, Unreal Engine 5 and wants to upgrade their skills\nSo, I hope to see you there in the course, thank you.",

      "description": "In this course you will learn about Fusion 360 and how to design complex mechanical assemblies.\n\nAfter the quick introduction to Fusion 360, section 1 explains step by step how to design slide-n-pop mechanism. The mechanism is used to hide an iPad Pro underneath the surface of a desk or a wall. When the arm rotates, the iPad pops up and the cover slides back. Behind this interesting motion are many parts that are designed to work together to carry out this motion properly. Through the lessons a great focus in given to explain the concept behind each part's design and why it's made the way it is. Throughout the course, you will learn about Fusion 360 power when it comes to assembly modeling. You will gain experience with top-down design using Fusion 360. Further, you will become very comfortable using Fusion 360 for any kind of design work later. This course is comprehensive and cuts through all the important modules in Fusion 360. By the end of the course, you will learn all the basics that you need to approach any mechanical design project in Fusion 360.\nSection 1 starts from the ground up; modelling the frame and stationary gear, and moving up step by step to model the cover. You will watch how the mechanism is built step by step while observing the thinking methodology behind the structure of the model. All the modelling done is kept realistic and true to nature by using fasteners, proper sketches, chamfers and well selected materials. You will be getting a front seat to an inside look at how the professional do it.\nIf you're not familiar with Fusion 360, Section 3 will give you a brief introduction to Fusion. I'll explain the reasons that makes Fusion very special among other CAD softwares. This section includes an introduction to the UI, Data management concepts in Fusion and the special model structure. After that Rule#1 will be introduced and the methodology of the modelling will explained.",

We will learn how to solve various glitches and shading issues that occur while working with Booleans.\n\n\nThen after that we will export our model to Substance Painter and start by baking mesh maps for our model, after that we will start to texture our model. We will learn how to create realistic textures for our models by using different features in Substance like Smart Masks, Smart Materials etc.\nAfter we finish with texturing in Substance Painter we will take our model back to Blender and render it. We will setup the material, lighting and the camera. We will also learn how to use HDRIs. I will be rendering the scene using Cycles.\nThis course is for everyone who wants to upgrade their skillset and have a basic understanding of Blender and Substance Painter.",

Knowing what's going on under the hood will make you a better artist because you'll not just be able to fix errors, but you'll understand why those errors are happening, which is a much stronger position to be in. During this course he'll start at the fundamentals and work our way up to advanced trouble shooting techniques. This will include covering topics such as: What a Normal Is, What a Normal Map Is, What Normal Maps Do and Don't Do, What Causes Seams, and various baking related topics to name a few. We won't cover specific applications or workflows because the idea here is to give you the core knowledge of what a normal map is - specifically, what it's doing for you and what it's not doing for you. Near the end, he'll talk about how to avoid projection error when baking your normal maps and he'll be showing you an easy way to add details to your high poly mesh in the form of floaters. Lots of great introductory content here, so don't miss out!\nMore about the Instructor:\nWarren Marshall has been making games professionally for almost 20 years. He's worked at Epic Games for the bulk of that time doing everything from level design to programming to environment art. He's since taken up freelancing and has been spending the last few years working on a wide variety of fun projects.",

      "description": "Ever wondered how to create those professional looking motion graphics animations where things seem to move so smoothly? The key is to master the Principles of Animation, which have been used by Disney animators for nearly a century. This course is a fresh new take on these principles as they have been adopted and repurposed specifically for motion graphics designers. So instead of characters, we will be looking at how to animate 3D objects, lines and text.\nYou will learn everything you need to start creating complex and believable motions. Some of the key subjects covered in this course are:\nTiming & Spacing\nSlow In & Out\nBounces & Decay\nSquash & Stretch\nAnticipation\nFollow Through & Overlapping Action\nExaggeration\nArcs\nSecondary Animation\nStaging\nAppeal\nThis course is for anyone who is interested in creating impactful and meaningful animations. You could be a complete beginner or a pro animator - you will still learn a great deal of industry standard techniques, tips and tricks when it comes to creating pro level motion graphics.\nThe course was created with Cinema 4D, but you could be using any animation software (or even draw each frame by hand!) to follow along, since these principles remain the same.\nTogether with the training, you also get all of the project and reference files used on the course, so you can follow along as you watch the lessons. At the end of the training, you will be asked to create an animation with all of the skills you've learned.\nSo put your animation hats on and let's master the Principles of Animation together!",

In this course, we will go over the entire process of creating a Traditional Chinese Room Environment using Unreal Engine 5, Blender, Substance Painter.\nWe will go over modelling in Blender, texturing using Substance Painter and setting up the scene, lighting, and materials in Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\nYou will get:\n1. 33 Full HD video lectures with over 11+ hours of content and AUDIO commentary.\n2. All the files related to the course including .blend files, unreal project files, substance files, reference images, textures etc.\n\n\nSOFTWARES USED - (BLENDER, Substance Painter, Unreal Engine 5):\nAll the modelling will be done in Blender, However, the techniques used are universal and can be replicated in any other 3D modelling package. The materials and textures will be created using Substance Painter. Level art, lighting and composition will be done in Unreal Engine 5.\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to know to create the final results that you see in the images and trailers. The same techniques can be applied to almost any type of environment.\nThis course has over 11 hours of content! (All the videos have audio commentary)\nWe will go over every step in this course together and nothing will be skipped. The course does not have any kind of timelapse so that you can follow every step easily.\nWe will start by gathering some reference images to gain some initial ideas and the mood for our scene. We will arrange these reference images in a free program called Pure Ref. After this we will move on to Blender and start modelling our main assets. We will start by modelling things like the Writing Table, Chairs, Shelfs and all the different props in our scene, the entire process of modelling will be covered in Blender only.\nAfter we have modeled all our main assets, we will UV Unwrap and export them to Substance Painter to start the texturing process. We will learn to create high quality and realistic materials and the key features of Substance Painter like Smart Masks, generators, smart materials etc.\nAfter this we will import all our models and textures into Unreal Engine and set up the scene over there. The next step would be to set up our lighting and create a mood and atmosphere for our scene. We will use the new features of Unreal Engine such as Lumen to get realistic lighting for our scene and set up a Post-Processing volume to further enhance our scene's visuals.\nThen we will spend some more time creating a lot of small props to further detail the scene even more like some Vases, Lamps, Tea Pots etc. We will end this course by adding a couple of props from Quixel Megascans to give the environment a finishing touch, setting up different camera angles and taking high resolution screenshots for our portfolio.\nSo, I hope to see you there in the course, thank you.\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nStudents that have basic knowledge of modelling, texturing and want to learn how to create environments. Everything on this course would be explained in detail but some prior knowledge of the software would be helpful.",

We gonna start looking at some reference photos and get an idea about what we want to build together. Then it is time to actual start working on this and we gonna get going with the modeling part. Here we gonna have the modeling lessons divided in two separate lessons. In the first one we gonna model and sculpt the wall, window, table, bottles, candle, plates. In part two we will be focusing on modeling the wind chimes and the book. After that we will bring our focus to the level design and creating the curtains. In the next section all our focus will be on lighting the scene and creating the force of the wind also animating the scene.\nNext, texturing will be our main priority. This is divided in two parts where texturing the curtains and the book is gonna be in the center of our attention and in the second part we will texture everything else we have in the scene. After that we will be creating the outside world adding trees and fog to create an mysterious and atmospheric environment. We will set up the camera and animate the camera. And at the end I will show you how you can render this animation and make it look even better.\n\n\nThis course if for you if you want to dive in creating a simple cinematic.

      "description": "Why this SketchUp course\nMy name is Manuel Pallarés, I live in Bali, Indonesia, and I have been using SketchUp for over more than ten years. I am a freelance architect and I use to collaborate with diferent architectural firms to model and render their projects.\nFuthermore, I have been teaching SketchUp for several years in different creative schools and this course is the resault of that acumulated knowldge. I have experienced face to face the problems that you encounter in the program. They are always the same. So in this course I will try to resolve all of them step by step.\nThis course is well thought out, carefully planned to teach you exactly what you need to know, without any fluff. In addition to using my own experience with SketchUp, many tutorials require hours of research and experimentation. The result is an easy to follow tutorial to get you modeling quickly and having fun during the process.\nSketchUp is a powerful, flexible, affordable, easy to use 3D modeling software.\nMy goal is to enable you to effortlessly take your ideas and bring them to life in 3D. SketchUp is the best tool for communicating and visualizing ideas, because its simplicity encourages creativity. The tool doesn’t get in the way of the creative process.\nIf you’ve never used CAD or any other 3D modeling program, you are at an advantage because you will not have habits ingrained from other software. You’ll be able to learn the fundamentals quickly, and you’ll be encouraged by the quick progress you are making. Don’t be intimidated if you’ve tried other complicated CAD software, only to become overwhelmed. SketchUp is one of the easiest 3D modeling programs to get started with, and I will help you learn the basics.\nIf you’re experienced with CAD, or are looking for an alternative 3D modeling program from what you’re currently using, you’ll find SketchUp to be refreshing. The simple interface does not inhibit your creativity. You will no longer need to conform to complicated tools or procedures. Create whatever you can imagine. SketchUp is 100% accurate, works with nearly any unit of measurement, with precision up to 0.000001″. Enhance SketchUp with thousands of 3rd party extensions, and use LayOut to create construction documents from your SketchUp Pro models.\nMy Background\nMy first experience with Sketchup was during the last years of my architecture degree in Madrid. I was in my last year and I decided to use the program to represent my project in a three-dimensional way. I started self-taught, but even so, the program completely seduced me and I enjoyed making my 3D model . The truth is that I would have liked to know this powerful tool from the first year of my degree and not in the last. Accustomed to using Autocad, Sketchup was a breath of fresh air. I began to enjoy graphic representation. That is why for all those university students I think it is the perfect tool.\nAfter the degree, I started working in different architecture studios in Lujbljana, Slovenia. Always in charge of the 3D representation of the different projects and their rendering. In this way I began to specialize in the use of Sketchup at a professional level. A program that seemed simple turned out to be more and more complex and powerful while maintaining that fresh air. That intuitive ability.\nIn this way, the next step consisted of working as a teacher in different creative schools. In this way I began to carry out a study program. I gradually polished this program over the years learning from the difficulties my students encountered.\nAnd here came the pandemic. At that moment, I decided to transform my face-to-face course into an online course. In a constant learning process thanks to keeping professional collaborations open, this course tries to synthesize all that knowledge accumulated over the last ten years in a professional and rigorous way, but also honoring the spirit of Sketchup, and proposing a way to learn fun and enjoyable.\nThis Sketchup course\nWelcome to everyone. In this SKETCHUP PRO course we will start from an initiation level to end up dominating the program at a very high level. We will learn all the SKETCHUP PRO tools such as: materials, styles, scenes, animations, sunlight, connection with Google-Earth, photomatch, dynamic components, terrain, plugins and much more. But the REALLY INTERESTING thing about this course is that we will do all of this in a SUPER PRACTICAL WAY. We will do it while MODELING A SINGLE BUILDING: THE BARCELONA PAVILION designed by the architect Mies Van Der Rohe in 1929.\nIt is a course in which I have carried out a very large synthesis exercise of all my knowledge in order to offer you a course where ALL THE SKETCHUP TOOLS are seen ONLY WITH ONE MODEL. The goal is to make LEARNING MORE FLUID AND FUN.\nThrough this project you will learn:\n\n\nControl the scale of the model\nCorrect use of groups and components\nUsing dynamic components\nModel order through the use of layers\nCorrect use of materials\nCorrect use of furniture and exterior elements to SKP\nCorrect placement of north and sunlight of the scene\nArtistic use of styles\nUse of sections\nDimensions and text\nMaking animations in mp4 format from our scenes\n\n\nSKETCHUP PRO is a 3D modeling program from the Trimble company. It is a program designed for architects, urban planners, landscapers, engineers, draughtsmen, quantity surveyors, interior designers, product designers and, in fact, any professional in the design sector. It stands out, unlike other 3D modeling programs, for its intuitive interface that allows you to work fluidly, being able to deal with the most complex projects in the same way. It is for this reason that more and more people demand their knowledge.\n\n\nFinally you should know that you will have my guidance during the course. Any doubt you have, you can ask me and in less than 48h I will respond you with the answer.\n\n\nThank you for enrolling in this SketchUp course!\n\n\nBest regards,\nManuel Pallarés",

One of the main aspects of professional-quality isometric room design is working on a real-world scale and using references from real life. In this course, you will learn how to do both to make sure your designs are accurate and consistent. You will also be introduced to Pureref – a free referencing tool that will save you an unmentionable number of hours in researching appropriate references. Even better, you can use Pureref while working in Blender and ‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3 will show you exactly how to optimise this new workflow.\nApart from the technical side of creating isometric rooms, you will also learn about colour and composition through a deep dive into the creative and artistic side of the process.\n\n\nModelling\nOur ‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3´ will take you on a journey of building a stylised isometric room in 45 lessons. By completing the course, you will be able to build isometric rooms for any art\nstyle, giving your viewers a unique perspective into the interior of a room and your own style as a 3D modeller.\nFollowing the success of my latest courses, we will be modelling, texturing, and finalising every individual asset before moving on to the next. Students have said that this has helped them in staying excited throughout the creation process, being able to see how their scene comes closer to the course preview step-by-step.\n\n\nYou will learn about advanced ways to use curves and Boolean operations, alongside more basic functions such as extrusion and loop cutting.\nOf course, you could set yourself a challenge and diversify aspects of the stylized isometric room such as changing the textures, adding more rooms, or adding furniture assets to room look different.\nTexturing: Cloth Simulation & Particle System\n‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3’ will provide you with intensive learning all in one place, giving you access to 1 human reference, 1 Pureref reference board, 1 finished isometric room reference, and 30 texture maps.\n\n\n\n\nStarting from the beginning, you will learn how to mark seams and sharps and create different types of texture maps, including atlas and seamless textures. ‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3’ will also introduce you to UV-ing correctly, and how to use Blender’s node system to adjust materials and textures in Blender.\nCreating your materials or altering textures on the fly is something you will want to learn about.  Maximising your knowledge of Blender’s node system will raise the level of your textures and skill up your skill in working with materials.\n\n\nUsing the cloth simulation and particle system, you will learn how to create realistic and dynamic simulations for fabrics and other materials. As part of the creation process for ‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3’, you will be learning about different types of cloth for bed sheets, pillowcases, and carpets. This will include knowing how to make wrinkles, folds, and drapes that appear convincing.\nFinally, we will also be creating shaders for materials such as glass, metal, and plastic.\nLighting & Compositing\n\n\nWhen we look at renders of 3D models on social media, we can see a huge difference between the models of different artists. Most of this can be normally attributed to not only the skills of the artist but part of it can be attributed to how they achieve realism in their models.\n\n\nBy joining ‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3’, you will learn about specific types of in-built Blender lighting functionalities that will enhance the stylised atmosphere of your isometric room. You will be guided through the different processes of creating different lighting effects using point lights, spotlights, and area lights. As a bonus, learning how to use moonlight and volumetrics to create a natural glow will also be part of the learning process.\nRendering\n\n\n‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3’ offers a comprehensive overview of rendering in both Eevee and Cycles. You will learn about the different options available to each rendering engine, including settings for materials, lighting, and post-processing. This will include learning about how to use Blender’s built-in compositor to enhance your renders and make them more visually striking.\n\n\nWe will be going through the many pitfalls and some technical details of what Blender render options to use for the specific machine you are using.  Together, we will be creating a portfolio render for any multimedia site you wish to upload your completed model to.\nCourse Resources & Freebies\nThe ‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3’ resource pack includes 1 human reference, 1 Pureref reference board, 1 finished isometric room reference, and 30 texture maps.\nJoin this course and come be part of a 3D modelling journey of over 8 hours of learning that will see you go away with a game-ready AAA-stylised isometric room interior environment.\nCheck out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down!\n\nTo get you pumped, imagine how well this stylised isometric environment fits in with your other 3D Tudor projects.\n\n\n\n\nBe creative! Think about enhancing your other projects such as the stylised hotel resort we created in ‘Blender 3: Stylized Scene The Ultimate Guide’ by giving it an interior too. Since ‘Blender 3: Stylized Scene The Ultimate Guide’ and ‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3’ follow the same Sim City, Sims franchise art style, you could do both courses to maximise that experience!\nAlso, think about creating more stylised environments, with ‘Blender Design & Render a Stylized Water Scene’ and ‘Blender 3D Model & Render a Stylized Halloween Scene’. Use the full power of Blender to your advantage to become a true stylised art 3D artist and game designer.\nHas ‘Mastering the Art of Isometric Room Design in Blender 3’ given you a taste of prop design, you’ve fallen in love with designing interiors for games and want to do more?!

We'll cover the entire process from setting up bones and rigging to animating a character with smooth, fluid motions.\nYou'll start by understanding the fundamentals of character rigging, including how to structure a bone hierarchy and properly attach sprite pieces for optimal movement. Then, we'll move on to creating key animations, such as an idle stance, a walk cycle, a punch, and a kick animation, ensuring that your character has the necessary movements for a side-scrolling or platformer-style video game.\nOnce our animations are polished, we'll take them into Unity and set up a fully functional animated character. You'll learn how to import your Spriter animations into Unity, configure animation controllers, and apply basic scripting to bring your character to life. By the end of the course, you’ll have a fully rigged and animated character, complete with basic movement controls, allowing your character to walk, punch, and kick on a platform.\nThis course is ideal for indie game developers, artists, or designers who want to create high-quality 2D animations without the hassle of frame-by-frame animation. Whether you’re a beginner or have some experience with Spriter and Unity, this course will equip you with the skills to integrate smooth 2D animations into your games efficiently.",

      "description": "Hello,  and your are very Welcome to our course Maya 2018: Modelling a Motorcycle Cartoon, We are a creation studio, with more than 10 years of existence, dedicated to courses in the IT, animation and game design areas, We offer both online and in-class courses.\nIn this course, the student will follow and learn about the production stages of a cartoon style motorcycle, from the modeling till the rendering and the exporting the final image, using both Maya 2018 and Arnold Render resources.\n\nFirst I'm going to show how to properly create and customize a project in Maya 2018, Next, we will learn how to import a reference image to the program, which will serve as a starting point for our modeling work, Once the image is loaded, we start the modeling of the motorcycle's exhaust pipe and during that stage, we will make use of several tools and polygon modeling techniques.\n\nNext, we start modeling the seat and the tank of the motorcycle, and for those items, I am going to use deformers and also create NURBS curves, which will help in the modeling process, After that, we start modeling the elements that will compose the motorcycle's engine, and we are going to learn about the Isolate and the Smooth Mesh features as well as other modeling techniques, in addition to the view customization settings.\n\nNext, I'm going to start the modeling of the motorcycle's tyre. Using some techniques and tools we are going to create an element that will give a more realistic appearance to our model, To wrap up the modeling stage we are going to create the headlights, the handle bars and a background to the scene.\n\nAfter the modeling stage is done, we will move to the lighting stage, The student will learn how to create a camera for the final render, as well as to create and configure all the lighting of the project, using the Arnold Render resources. After everything is ready, the student will learn to configure the parameters for the final render and also save the image in high-resolution.\n\nTo follow this course, the students will need a computer, previous knowledge of Maya, which can be obtained in our Maya Basic Course, available here at Udemy, or in our website, Also, a lot of energy and some cups of coffee to help keep you going, right?\n\nThis course is best suited for illustrators, animators, designers, or any other artist or professional that intends to sharpen their design and rendering skills in Maya 2018.\n\nI strongly recommend you to take this course, which will help you improve the quality of your productions in Autodesk Maya 2018.",

Imagine sitting by this grand piano with just the right natural light and ambience.\n\nYour project will be to model, texture, and build assets and props for a stylised isometric room interior following our course lessons.\n\n\nOur ‘Blender 3 Beginners Step-by-Step Guide to Isometric Rooms’ top 8:\n- Completing a full referencing guide to creating stylized 3D art for games in Blender;\n- Making concrete steps in your path towards mastering 3D modelling even as a beginner through an interior design journey;\n- Learning a professional UV workflow incorporating atlas and seamless maps;\n- Creating textures from scratch as you learn Blender’s node systems;\n- Learning how to make your artwork pop with our complete compositor guide;\n- Speeding up your 3D modelling workflow;\n- Becoming a magician of all types of lighting in Blender;\n- Adding depth to scenes using volumetrics.\n\n\nThis course will teach you everything you need to know about using texture maps to create stunning, realistic 3D models that look like they've been pulled straight from the real world in just over 11 hours of 3D art.\n\n\n\n\n‘Blender 3 Beginners Step-by-Step Guide to Isometric Rooms´ is the 2nd to a series of Blender courses about isometric interior design. One of the main aspects of professional-quality isometric room design is working on a real-world scale and using references from real life. In this course, you will learn how to do both to make sure your designs are accurate and consistent. You will also be introduced to Pureref – a free referencing tool that will save you an unmentionable number of hours in researching appropriate references. Even better, you can use Pureref while working in Blender and ‘Blender 3 Beginners Step-by-Step Guide to Isometric Rooms’ will show you exactly how to optimise this new workflow.\n\n\n\n\nApart from the technical side of creating isometric rooms, you will also learn about colour and composition through a deep dive into the creative and artistic side of the process.\n\n\nModelling\n\n\nOur ‘Blender 3 Beginners Step-by-Step Guide to Isometric Rooms´ will take you on a journey of building a stylised isometric room in 61 lessons. By completing the course, you will be able to build isometric rooms for any artstyle, giving your viewers a unique perspective into the interior of a room and your style as a 3D modeller.\n\n\nFollowing the success of my latest courses, we will be modelling, texturing, and finalising every individual asset before moving on to the next. Students have said that this has helped them in staying excited throughout the creation process, being able to see how their scene comes closer to the course preview step-by-step.\n\n\nYou will learn about advanced ways to use curves and Boolean operations, alongside more basic functions such as extrusion and loop cutting.\n\n\nYour project will be to model, texture, and build assets and props for a stylised isometric room interior following our course lessons. Of course, you could set yourself a challenge and diversify aspects or details of the props or add new ones. You could change the textures, add different variations or more assets, such as different types of furniture, or make the space larger so that you can include more assets typical of a dining room or dance hall instead, for example.\n\n\nTexturing\n\n\n\n\nIf you're a Blender user looking to take your projects to the next level, you won't want to miss our ‘Blender 3 Beginners Step-by-Step Guide to Isometric Rooms’. This pack includes everything you need to create stunning, professional-level renders, from a human OBJ to nearly 30 texture maps and a high-dynamic-range image lighting file.\nOur experienced instructors will guide you through every step of the process, showing you how to use nodes to create textures, bump maps, and normal maps that add depth and realism to your models. You'll also learn how to use Blender's built-in shaders to create stunning lighting and volume effects, and how to use the compositor to create post-processing effects that make your renders look even better.\n\n\nAs part of the creation process for ‘Blender 3 Beginners Step-by-Step Guide to Isometric Rooms’, you will be learning about different types of wood for hardwood flooring and wall panelling, and leather for a sofa that gives off the appearance of bi-cast or full grain leather.\n\n\nYou will learn how to use Blender's node-based material and shader system to create a wide variety of realistic textures and surfaces. You'll learn how to create materials that look like wood, metal, plastic, and other materials, and how to use shading nodes to create complex lighting effects that can bring your scenes to life.\n\n\n\n\nLighting & Compositing\n\n\n\n\nWhen we look at renders of 3D models on social media, we can see a huge difference between the models of different artists. Most of this can be normally attributed to not only the skills of the artist but part of it can be attributed to how they achieve realism in their models.\n\n\nBy joining ‘Blender 3 Beginners Step-by-Step Guide to Isometric Rooms’, you will learn about specific types of in-built Blender lighting functionalities that will enhance the stylised atmosphere of your isometric room. You will be guided through the different processes of creating different lighting effects using point lights, spotlights, and area lights. Learning how to use moonlight and volumetrics to create a natural glow will also be part of the learning process.\n\n\n\n\nRendering\n\n\n\n\n‘Blender 3 Beginners Step-by-Step Guide to Isometric Rooms’ offers a comprehensive overview of rendering in both Eevee and Cycles. You will learn about the different options available to each rendering engine, including settings for materials, lighting, and post-processing. This will include learning about how to use Blender’s built-in compositor to enhance your renders and make them more visually striking.\n\n\nWe will be going through the many pitfalls and some technical details of what Blender render options to use for the specific machine you are using. Together, we will be creating a portfolio render for any multimedia site you wish to upload your completed model to.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Resources & Freebies\n\n\n\n\nThe course includes a comprehensive set of seamless and atlas texture maps, which are essential for creating lifelike textures and surfaces in your models. With these texture maps, you'll be able to create a wide range of materials, from wood and metal to marble and brick, all with stunning levels of detail and realism.\n\n\nIn addition to the human OBJ, the resource pack includes nearly 30 texture maps, including both seamless and atlas-based textures. These textures are essential for creating realistic surfaces, such as wood, metal, and stone, and can help you bring your projects to life. The high-dynamic-range image lighting file is also a valuable resource, providing you with the tools you need to create stunning lighting and shading effects that will make your work stand out. And with seven reference images, including a Pureref file with loads of references, you'll have everything you need to create accurate, lifelike models and scenes.\n\n\nJoin this course and come be part of a 3D modelling journey of over 11 hours of learning that will see you go away with a game-ready AAA-stylised isometric music room interior environment.\n\n\nCheck out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down!\n\nTo get you pumped, imagine how well this stylised isometric environment fits in with your other 3D Tudor projects.\nBe creative! Think about enhancing your other projects such as the stylised hotel resort we created in ‘Blender 3: Stylized Scene The Ultimate Guide’ by giving it an interior too.

      "description": "Want to create cool 3D models and fully understand Blender?\nThen the Blender Masterclass is for you!\nIn this course Vincent will show you everything about the basics/navigation of Blender, modelling, shading, lighting & advanced modelling, rendering & compositing, advanced animation / simulation, motion tracking + VFX and much more\n\n\nBut what exactly will you learn in detail in this course?\nBasics: In the first section of the Blender Masterclass you will learn the basics so that you can navigate through the software with confidence. You will learn the basic shortcuts to add objects, delete objects, move objects and also how to set the keyframes for an animation.\nModeling: Since the course is very practical, you start in the second section with modeling. Here you don't have to talk for a long time, but you get to know the tools in practice. At the end of this section you will have modelled a McDonald's cup.\nShading: You will learn how to create a UV map and how to \"print\" a texture onto your object. After you have mastered the UV maps, Vincent will show you how to add details to your cup and how to adjust the surface of your object. Watch a few free preview videos to see the quality of the course for yourself.\nLighting & Advanced Modeling: In this section you will learn the difference between realistic light and artificial light, from a softbox for example. You will learn how to add a background and adjust the exposure to the environment of your scene. You will also gain quite a bit of modelling experience as our McDonalds branch project continues! The course is very much designed for hands-on learning.\nRendering & Compositing: You are now at the point where you have created a finished 3D scene and want to create a 2D image from it. In this section you will learn which settings are best suited for which case and how you can even edit your image in Blender.\nAdvanced Animation/Simulation: You can now create cool 3D scenes, but how do you create realistic animation and make a person do a backflip, for example? That's what you'll learn in this section. You will also learn how to use the different simulation types and Dynamic Paint. For example, you can use it to animate realistic water!\nMotion Tracking + VFX: You will learn how to free objects in a video with the help of masks - the topic is rotoscoping. If you use green screen footage, the whole thing is even easier! After that, we go into detail about motion tracking so that you can realistically integrate objects into your scene.\nStylistic basics: In the stylistic basics section you will learn a few useful tools to get the most out of your scene. You learn how to create a dark atmosphere and how to work with the alpha channel.\nNice to know: Blender has almost infinite possibilities to create a scene or animation. Everything that didn't fit into one of the upper sections, but is still very fun and useful, we have packed into this section. Feel free to click through and see what's interesting for you. The stereoscopy function, for example, is very cool!\nHelpful addons, apps and websites: In the last section of the Blender Masterclass Vincent shows you a lot of useful addons for your work with the software. Addons can speed up your work with Blender many times over and are very useful. For example, you will learn how to automatically create a 3D model from a portrait image.\n\n\nThis course is for everyone who wants to have fun with 3D modelling and wants to master the topic from A-Z step by step.\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Sign up for the Blender Masterclass today and we'll see you in the first video.\nWe look forward to seeing you!\nVincent & Marius",

This tutorial is ideal for Blender beginners who have watched a video or two already and are now looking to expand their knowledge. Split into 56 videos, each between 10-20 minutes on average, this course is designed for ease of learning and flexibility, allowing you to progress at your own pace. I divided it into three main sections: Modeling, Texturing, and Animation.\n\n\nModeling: Here, I'll guide you through the process of installing free plugins and integrating useful shortcuts into your workflow. You'll delve into various modeling techniques, including hard surface modeling, mesh cleanup, and basic geometry node setups.\nTexturing: Next, we will explore a variety of texturing methods. You'll learn how to find and utilize image textures, create your own procedural textures, and learn texture painting to bring depth and realism to your renders.\nAnimation: In the final phase, you’ll learn how to animate your scene and use dynamic paint to create a wavelike animation.\n\n\nFor accessibility, all of the compositing will also be done in Blender, but of course, if you are proficient in After Effects, I am more than happy to encourage you to do just that. I look forward to your results!",

      "description": "Course Description\n\n\n\n\nAn upgrade to Blender 3.0 won’t cost you anything.\n\n\nHow can we make your transition to Blender 3.0 even better?\n\n\nJoin ‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’ to learn how to use Blender 3.0 and how to master its newest and most complex functionalities.\n\n\nChallenge yourself with a stylized tropical hotel resort 3D modelling project and become the 3D modelling artist you have always wanted to be.\n\n\n\n\nHere are my best 5 points about the new exciting things you will be learning about through this class:\n1. Complete Sims, Sims City and City Skylines art style workflow;\n2. Fully procedural textures including ambient occlusion and ocean shader;\n3. Extensive use of modifiers to simplify the building process, including walls and cobblestones;\n4. Next level compositing Blender 3.0 guide including sharpness, colourisation, and bloom;\n5. The most complete Blender 3.0 asset manager overview to help you scale this scene into a large seaside resort;\n\n\nStart learning Blender 3.0 with ‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’!\n‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’ will see you creating a hotel resort with all the perks. Your stylized scene will remind you of the art style of Sims, Sim City and City Skylines, some of the top video game contenders in the stylised digital art genre. Your hotel resort will feature air conditioners, deck chairs, a parking barrier, a lamppost, a bar, a variety of foliage, different types of bins, and a Vespa motorbike.\n\n\n\n\nThis course will give you access to just over 24 hours (yes, a whole day!) of 3D art.\n\n\n\n\nLearning how to achieve realism through setting the scene and incorporating storytelling into your 3D game environments will be a central part of this course's learning objectives.\n\n\nYou will learn how to work and 3D model to real-world dimensions, in addition to developing the know-how about what to expect where in this type of scene.\n\n\n\n\nThrough reading this course description you will find out:\n\n\n- What you want to learn about 3D modelling;\n- What you are going to get through ‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’, and;\n- How the course will take your 3D modelling skills to the next level.\n\n\n\n\nModeling\n\n\nI enjoy creating little props that can bring a scene to life. One of the things you can do to add to realism within your scenes is to create plenty of small props to make the scene look busy. ‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’ will introduce you to the Blender 3.0 asset manager, helping you organise all of these to maximise the efficiency of your prop placement in the scene.\nDetails are very important as we will cover what you might want to look for at the back of hotels, making it all the more believable by hiding the ugly behind the beautiful. From surfing boards and other beach props to a hotdog stand, you will always be working on something new in this course!\nAs a 3D modelling artist with an avid interest in environment modeling, you will need to know how to use props to tell a story through your art. For example, the placement of the Vespa at the back of one of the hotels might make you think that it belongs to one of the staff members who have parked it there to quickly go on a ride around the seafront after work. In a few words, props can make a 3D scene believable.\nAmong other character-boosting assets, you will find out how to character model tiger sharks, and where to place them. This will be your first introduction to organic meshes and you can be sure they need an entirely different approach to digital art. We will not be using the sculpting tools for this. It is a basic mesh and you will need to learn how to create these before sculpting to give yourself a good base to work from.\n\n\nTexturing and Materials\n\n\n\n\n‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’ will provide you with intensive learning all in one place, giving you access to over 50 references, 1 HDRI map, and 1 human reference.\nThis course is a texturing masterclass. You will learn about all the node systems Blender 3.0 has to offer. Through ‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’, you will be creating fully procedural shaders and materials for every single model in the scene\n\n\nThe node wrangler is one of the best free built-in addons within Blender but most users are not even aware of it. This course will teach you how to create your materials, find out how to take all of those beautiful texture maps and make use of them.\nWhen it comes to shaders, you will certainly want to know how to create transparency. You will also learn how to use noise textures to create variations for your materials. Blender comes with a whole host of nodes, but I will show you why the varied noise nodes are the most important.\nWe will also cover how to create a glass shader in Blender. It will be essential to get this right since most of our hotel’s exterior is made up of glass and it is a huge focal point of the whole ‘Blender 3 - Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’ scene.\nMaximising your knowledge of Blender’s node system will raise the level of your textures and skill up your skill in working with materials.\n\n\nLighting & Rendering\n\n\n\n\nLighting is essential to making a 3D scene pop. It helps you tell a story and convey the mood, what time of day it is or what the weather is like. It’s very similar to how lighting works in photography and cinematography.\n\n\n‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’ will be your introduction to lighting skills for 3D modelling artists. You will learn about specific types of in-built Blender lighting functionalities that will enhance the sunny weather and tropical atmosphere of your hotel resort. You will also find out about how composition works with lighting to direct your viewer’s attention to what you want them to see.\n\n\nWe will be going through the many pitfalls and some technical details of what Cycles render options to use for the specific machine you are using. I will also be introducing you to the all-new Cycles X Blender renderer.\nTogether, we will be creating a portfolio render for any multimedia site you wish to upload your completed model to.\n‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’ is a complete guide into using Cycles, and Cycles X for lighting, rendering, shadow.\n\n\nCourse Resources & Freebies\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘Blender 3 Stylized Scene Ultimate Guide’ pack includes 50 references, 1 HDRI map, and 1 human reference.\n\n\nJoin this course and come be part of a 3D modelling journey of over 24 hours of learning that will see you go away with a game-ready stylized environment set in the tropics, ready to go on holiday this summer!\n\n\nCheck out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill unsure? Then, let me tell you what's unique about this course:\n\n\n· Following through a complete guide on creating a game-ready quality stylized tropical hotel resort fit with sun shaders deck chairs, balconies, solar panels, and plenty of sand to sunbathe on;\n· Maximising the potential of your references to develop strong game asset concepts;\n· Learning how to use HDRIs as 3D model backgrounds for your portfolio;\n· Maintaining and optimizing stylized art aesthetics in a Sims, Sim City, and City Skylines art style;\n· Learning how to use rendering to improve the quality of presentation for your 3D environment in Blender Cycles and Cycles X;\n· Rendering game assets to a high level for professional 3D artist portfolios.\n\n\nLet’s create something sunny, fun, and stylized 3D game environment this April to get ready for our own dips in the sea this summer!\n\n\nUntil next time, happy modelling everyone!\n\n\nNeil – 3D Tudor",

Once that is done we will create a color mask from out heightmap and use that mask to have multi colored bricks.\nAfter, we'll start to build up our diffuse map by stacking up layers of dirt and details and we will finish it off by creating a mossy effect in between and overgrowing the bricks. Once everything is finished we will create the roughness and metallic map and we will wrap up this course by polishing the final texture and rendering everything in Marmoset Toolbag 2.\nMore about the Instructor:\nEmiel Sleegers is a self-taught 3d artist currently residing in the Netherlands.

To begin, he will focus on the process of setting up topology and UVs, as this is an important process to understand as a texture artist. Following this, the real fun begins: we will dive right into skin tones and simple principles of rendering volume and color variations, and finally, we will learn about other materials such as wood, leather, and cloth to close out with. All of this will be done using a combination of 3D Coat, Photoshop and Maya, with a final output in Marmoset 2.\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nAn adopted son of San Francisco and the Academy of Art University, Ryan Ribot lives a small apartment with 3 cats and a Wacom. Currently working as a texture artist and character modeler with Telltale Games, Ryan spends most of his time painting and sculpting. ZBrush, Photoshop, and Maya are like breathing to him, and he is always looking to share his knowledge. Ryan has been teaching for several years, and is experienced as both an instructor and an industry professional.",

It is important to have correct and clean topology in order to create a great model.\nYou will also learn the difference between a low resolution model and a high resolution model and how that affects your workflow.\nYou will learn how to create the character's body, then the eye, then the tentacles.\nWe will then move on to creating the character's UVs/ UV mapping id very important as it allows you to then create textures for the character.\nYou will learn how to texture the character with the 3D Paint Tool.\nThe 3D Paint Tool allows you to paint directly onto the model, then afterwards, you will learn how to save the textures and how to plug the textures into the correct shaders to get the final look.\nYou will learn how to use the HYPERSHADE, which is the place where Maya keeps all of its materials and shaders.\nYou will learn how to use the Arnold Standard Surface Shader, an all-in-one-purpose shader that allows you to create many wonderful textures.\nYou will learn how to create skin, using Subsurface Scattering.\nThen you will learn how to create a camera, and understand what the focal length is, and how that affects the proportion of the character.\nYou will learn how to set the lighting. There is the Skydome lighting, which acts as a global illumination. Then we will use area lights, one for the back and one for the front. Then finally, in Maya, you will learn how to use the render settings to get a final, professional looking rendered image.\nFinally, we will bring the rendered image into Photoshop where we will create the final look.",

      "description": "A full-fledged training system for future character creators in Blender.\n\n\n-It includes instruction on the basics of using the software\n-character modeling\n-sculpting\n-baking deformation maps\n-texturing\n-rigging\n-posing-\n-rendering process.\n\n\nHello, my name is Ilya Khlyinin. I am a 3D artist and a lecturer with 3 years of teaching experience in 3D modeling at the \"Specialist\" training center, affiliated with Bauman University. I made this system because i still remember how hard it was to learn everything from scratch when i just started my 3d modeling journey.I didn't know where to find specific information, and I had to learn everything from various sources and then piece it together during practice.\nWith this system, you will forget about the need for additional sources of information for a while. This course will fully engage you for at least a month, and you will learn how to work in Blender from absolute scratch. Step by step, I will guide you through the process of creating a character from our very first polygon to a beautiful render in the Cycles render engine.\nSo let me  provide you with the details of what you can expect from the course:\n\n\n-First, we will quickly familiarize ourselves with the Blender interface\n-We will then explore viewport navigation\n-How to create and delete objects\n-We will learn the tools\n-Basic 3d modeling concepts\n-Local and global transform orientations\n-Origin and 3d cursor\n-Outliner tab\n-Orthogonal views\n-Transformations\n\n\n-Than we will explore the components\n-Component selection\n-Component tools like\n-Move/Rotate/Scale\n-Bevel\n-Extrude\n-Knife\n-Merge\n-And so on , in reality, we will explore almost all the tools, so I won't list the rest.\n\n\nAt this stage, you will acquire the minimum set of knowledge that will allow you to comfortably proceed to the practical part of the course where we will:\n\n\n-Set our reference images\n-Start our modeling process with only one polygon\n-We will begin studying modeling techniques that will enable you to model almost any character, except for hyper-realistic ones\n-We will model the face with an interior mouth and eyes so that the character can speak and smile\n-The body and limbs with high-quality topology that will allow for easy posing and animating the character\n-We will model clothing and accessories\n-We will learn the technique of creating hairstyles using curves\n-We will explore sculpting mode to create folds on pants and to create hairstyle\n-We will learn how to create lowpoly and bake normal maps in Blender\n\n\nAfter we finish modeling, we will move on to the process of applying materials and texturing\n\n\n-We will explore how the material system works in Blender\n-We will learn how to apply textures\n-We will create our own unique texture in Krita (Free photoshop analogue) and import it to blender\n\n\nAfter we are satisfied with the model's appearance, we will move on to the rigging stage\n\n\n-Where we will prepare our model to the rigging\n-Create our armature with Riggify addon\n-Place the armature(we will do face rig too)\n-Create the rig\n-Explore all rig controls\n-We will learn how to use Cage object to smoothly transfer weights on our high poly mesh(Data transfer)\n-Attach meshes to rig\n-Weight paint problematic areas\n\n\nAfter our rig will be ready we will pose the character and Render it with Cycles Engine to create Beautiful picture.\nU can see Render results on course thumbnail by the way.\n\n\n-So we will create backdrop\n-Make a light setup\n-Learn a little bit about the сapabilities of Blender in render process\n-Create a fog with a volumetric container\n-Look briefly at blender render settings\n-Make a render\n\n\nAnd that is basically it. In addition to this, you will learn a lot about human anatomy.\nAll the videos in the course (except for one hair timelapse , which, I promise, will not be a problem for you ) are recorded in real-time, so you won't be able to fall behind or get lost during the course.\n\n\nSee you all in comments . I will always be available to answer any questions you may have and provide any additional information that may be of interest to you. Chao.",

      "description": "Interested in improving the graphics of your next animation?\nA lot of us have heard about cell shading for static images, but what about using it for your animations?\nWell, now you can definitely do that by combining Photoshop with any animation software you like.\nThe one we prefer, and the one we will be using is CrazyTalk Animator 3.2 because it lets you jump back and forth between the two, to make little modifications here and there, and have them update in CrazyTalk Animator.\nIn this course I will teach you how to use Photoshop and CrazyTalk Animator to use Cell Shading in your animations.\nI will explain the basic concepts.\nThe different masking techniques used to shade comfortably,\nHow to use the different tools like masking, clipping mask, and the Magic Wand Tool so you can extract pieces of your characters and add shadows and highlights to increase the quality of your image.\nYou will learn how to add images as texture.\nHow to stylize a layer with filter effects.\nAnd then, this course would be useless if I didn’t cover the theory to really understand lights and shadows, using simple shapes as examples.\nThen we will analyze some common mistakes that a lot of beginners make when they are starting with techniques to add shadings, comparing the different ways to do it.\nThen after you know the basics, we will move on to the practical part.\nHey, practice makes perfect right?\nSo that’s why in this course we included some practical exercises that you can follow to help you take action and understand each concept and technique to its fullest.\nFrom adding simple shadows to a character, to using soft shadows, texture and depth to the hair of your characters, and even learn how to create texture for your backgrounds.\nAnd after you finish with all the exercises, we will move on to improve a whole scene, from start to finish, and at the end, we will compare the before and after.\nThen, if you know about the principles of animation, we will dig into one of the newest features on CrazyTalk Animator 3.2 that lets you apply the follow through principle to your characters, in a lesson in which we animate the hair as a separate accessory.\nAnd, to finish off with the course, you will learn why a lot of graphic designers are now using CrazyTalk Animator to pose their characters for their designs. Why? Because it’s simple and easy, with one click you can export any frame of your animation, or any character in any pose into Photoshop.\nYou will learn this in a tutorial that teaches you how to create YouTube Thumbnails.\nSo, if you are ready to take the visuals of your animation to the next level, start applying Cell Shading using Crazytalk and Photoshop and increase your quality.\nEnroll now, and learn by watching and doing the exercises provided in the course.\nSee you inside!",

      "description": "Why I Created This Course.\nI am a game developer who recently got into first person shooters for a personal project of mine. I wanted to learn how to model low poly guns so I went to YouTube. The selection of videos were awful. Some videos were too short and the commentary was faster than Ben Shapiro hyped up on an eight ball of coke. Other videos were excessively long and drawn out. I had to struggle when learning how to make good looking low poly guns. I made this course so you wouldn't have to struggle.\n\n\nCourse Overview\nThe course follows a path of linear progression. We start with simple basic models and as the videos progress, move on to more challenging models.\n\n\nYou start by learning blocking techniques to create the general shape of the gun. Then you become familiar with Blender modifiers to speed up the modeling process. You will learn how to grab images off Google and  turn them into PS1 style textures. You will then learn how to properly UV Unwrap an object so that you may texture it.\n\n\nWe will model the M4A1, Colt Python .357 Magnum, and PPSH-41. If you have a gun that you would like me to make a video on, you can suggest it to me and I will consider creating a section on it.\n\n\nYou will also gain access to the private discord. There, I will answer any questions you may have. If time permits, I will even go one on one with you and teach you directly what you wish to know.",

It is a robust and practical solution to create realistic 3D representations of objects that are time consuming to create by traditional 3D modelling methods. The class starts with explaining the basic principles of photogrammetry and its methods for scanning 3D objects followed by creating a low poly 3D asset with baked PBR maps from the scan result.\n\n\nWhy You Should Take This Class:\nPhotogrammetry offers a great solution for creating complicated assets in a very short amount of time when compared with traditional methods of 3D modelling. However, photogrammetry results in dense meshes with improper topology and bad UV's this limits photogrammetric abilities to be used in practical applications such as games or realtime Visualisation. This class aims to solve this problem by creating a low poly asset from a scanned 3D mesh. After completing this class, you will be able to create great looking 3D assets from photogrammetry.\n\n\nWho This Class is For:\nThis class is for Everyone who is interested in photogrammetry, 3D artists, Designers and game developers can take full advantage of this class.

To start things off, we will build a basemesh in Maya to use it later in ZBrush. In ZBrush we will cover how to create some nice and convincing metal and wood surfaces. After that, we will learn how to generate in ColorID map in ZBrush. With the high poly model and the generated maps, we now can modify our basemesh to use it as Lowpoly. After we have created the low poly object, we will use UVLayout to generate UV's for it. After that, we will bake the low poly in Substance Painter and generate color and textures. The last part will cover rendering in Iray to create some portfolio shots.\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nPhilipp Schmidt graduated as a 3D Artist in Germany, and has worked at Crytek as an Intern Environment Artist for “The Climb” and as Freelance Artist on numerous unannounced projects.

I have a good amount of experience in teaching 3d Environment Art for games. I have had many happy students who enjoyed my courses; Hope you too.\n\n\nBENEFITS :\nBy the end of this course,\n● You will have an understanding about Complete Level Creation Using UE5 and other softwares as well.\n● You will learn a lot of pipelines and workflows when it comes to mesh and texture and material creation for Realtime Game Environments.\n\n\nWHAT WILL I LEARN:\n● Using UE5 new technologies like LUMEN and NANITE and\n● How to plan and execute a full environment; methods that will guarantee the chance of finishing an environment\n● High Quality AAA Prop authoring for games\n● How to Use Blender as the main DCC app\n● Using Gaea to generate Terrains\n● Creating high quality Foliage, vegetation and tree\n● Master Material Creation for games\n● How to make proper structure for project that will keep consistency throughout\n● Sculpting natural elements like: Rock, stone, in Zbrush\n● Creating high quality textures in Substance 3d Painter and Substance 3d Designer\n\n\nCOURSE PROJECTS:\nWe start by planning the environment; we use references to make informed decisions that will make the environment as realistic as possible, technically and aesthetically. Then We generate a Basic Landscape in Gaea and import in Ue5 and start Blocking out the environments using simples shapes. The Landscape itself is going to be deleted later on and replaced with high quality Nanite meshes to ensure the best quality. Then we will start to iterate, reiterate, and iterate more. We start by simple shapes and gradually make them better, this way we know where to save time and stop adding details and where put the most focus and detail and time. We always start with Big Shapes; and it doesn’t’ matter if it is a mesh, texture or a landscape. We always start from big shapes and then start adding medium and small details in the way we learn how to use Zbrush, Blender and Substance 3d Painter and Substance 3d Designer to produce high quality content. Then use UE5 as the renderer to make a Realtime 3d Environment for Games.\n\n\nIS THIS COURSE RIGHT FOR ME:\n● I have designed this course for intermediate 3d artists, who want to make beautiful looking environment for games but they struggle to get it because they don't find a tutorial which is step by step, no fast forward, no skip and coming from an artist who knows how to do it.\n● The course is also for artists who want to speed up their workflow in UE5, Zbrush, Blender and Substance 3d Painter and Substance 3d Designer and improve their skill in Environment Creation for Games.\n\n\nWHO IS NOT THE IDEAL STUDENT:\nThis course is not designed for absolute 3d beginners,\n\n\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW OR HAVE FOR THE COURSE:\n● I expect you to have some sort of basic 3d experience.\n● You should have Zbrush, Blender, UE5, Substance 3d Painter and Substance 3d Designer and Gaea installed on your computer.\n\n\nJOIN ME NOW:\nSo if you want to make a full 3d Environment, then join me now, and take your skills to the next level. Don't forget that investing in yourself will pay for the rest of your life. Hope to see you in the course.",

We will use shortcuts to make the modeling process easier.\nIn the second part of the tutorial, we will talk about lighting, materials, particle system, mixing shaders, rendering, and more.\nI'll show you where to find free textures, how to mux shaders and create a bump, roughness, and other maps, and how to unwrap and create procedural textures.\nWe will also work with objects imported into the blender from external sources. I'll show you the best places to download objects, materials, and the most useful addons I use in Blender.\nWe will talk in more detail about how to use Quixel Bridge, a place where you can find thousands of 3D assets, surfaces, vegetation, imperfections, and much more.\nI will show you how to combine volumetric and lighting in a blender to get a dark, cinematic, mist mood.\nIn the end, we will do post-processing in After Effects, but if you're not using After Effects, you can use the same techniques in any graphics program.",

      "description": "Super Sila is the only knock-your-socks off motion design course on the Internet.\nWe’ll launch you beyond the basics of simple interface studying, primitive shape cases, color correction, and keying.\nWe don’t just teach motion design, we actually do motion design.\nAlexey is a professional who will share his knowledge of how motion design works in actual practice. No boring interface studying here -- you’ll master everything through practice on a real task. You’ll create the style, choose the right color scheme, create a composition, and show feeling in the movement.\nIt doesn’t matter how many tutorials about “How to Use After Effects” you’ve viewed. Without the necessary foundation, any tutorial will fall short of getting you to your goal. But with Super Sila, you’ll establish a firm foundation and build upon it with program knowledge (in our case, mainly After Effects). You’ll learn motion design the right way from the start, with plenty of support along the way.\nWelcome to the World of Motion Design!\n-------------- / -------------- / -------------- / --------------- / ---------------\n(*based on Russian version of SuperSila  -  community of 7k+ students)\nsome reviews (courtesy of google.translate):\n\n\nAlexander Sanakoev June 26, 2017 at 1:47\nThank you very much for your lectures, and for the excellent approach. I hope the teacher will be able to buy a nice table and a cool chair for the money. :)\n\n\nOlya Teslyuk 14 Jul 2017 at 15:10\nI like it very much, I am not new to Ae, technically I know how to perform certain actions, but Aleksey shows an approach, techniques and thinking. I am beginning to understand how to use the tools I know in a different way, what, how and why they are used in motion design. The format of lectures with a maximum of information in a minimum of time, examples and memchiki are very pleased. Inspires creativity and experimentation.\n\n\nEvgeny Aleksandrovich August 16, 2017 at 5:15\nIt is felt that there is not a standard course on after effects, a look at everything a bit from the other side, which makes the course very interesting. The topics are revealed that are needed right all the time and I really like it. Very accessible, not boring, professional, If ever there is a superpower2, I already know that I will participate in it))\n\n\nTanya Panova August 28, 2017 at 11:01\nGuys, thank you very much for the course!\nShe took up animation quite recently and was in some kind of panic, because she didn’t know what to grab at a huge number of lessons from the network. You seem to be watching and doing something, but still moving slowly. The course gave for a fairly short time a strong base and a weighty set of useful techniques.\nVery motivating faculty. It has come to the realization that all this coolness is in fact made by ordinary people from our planet and the chance to join their ranks is quite real.\nThe material is available and at the same time dynamically, you do not fall asleep. The channel in the telegram also turned out to be useful, the guys share links, help if anyone has any questions.\nThe course is very much solves the problem, to achieve the minimum amount of effort maximum result) As a result, the door to the motion was ajar, the kick was given, and the rest depends only on the degree of his desire to do)\n\n\nValya Tkalenko Aug 30, 2017 at 7:02 am\nThe course is excellent. I am a beginner, so I’ll say that for beginners this is a very quick and explosive start. Nothing chews for a long time, but for the minimum period an incredible amount of information is given. Similar did not meet anywhere. Super! Thank you very much!\n\n\nIgor Lugansky 6 Oct 2017 at 3:02\nA delightful course. Basic things can be learned on YouTube, and Super Power helps to take the next step. Before the course, there was a great lack of understanding of how to make a product out of an idea; after the course, it remains only to dig out and dig out its possibilities. Excellent and different teachers share the wisdom without quotes, directing to their style. A lot of good thoughts and a cool look at what motion-design is.\nIf you learn a lesson-to-lesson, you are not sure what you will learn. Techniques and chips are perfectly shown, but in order to truly master a short way, you must thoroughly know a long one, without it going nowhere. And all the necessary clues in their places.\nThank you!\n\n\nAyrat Yusupov December 28, 2017 at 1:36\nI am not new to AE, many lessons have been reviewed and books on effects have been read, but this didn’t help me. As I went through the course, it would turn out to put my thoughts on the schedule. I liked that knowledge is not even given in the course of how the keys move or use effects, namely how to think, where to start, the secret knowledge that professionals have and who already have experience in the industry are given. In general, not a bit sorry that he acquired the course. And most importantly, this is support, this is a chat, where you can ask questions about the sore. I recommend to everyone!\n\n\nMonk Ostolopov Jan 3, 2018 at 2:34\nI have to say, the course is designed more for beginners. If you just opened AE or hover in one place for a couple of months / years, then this course will give you a serious boost. But an experienced user will find here a ton of interesting things, a huge number of tricks and chips, both in style and in technical aspects. Separately, I want to highlight the block of character animation, it is generally a BOMB. This block alone, fully justifies its price. Andrey Stifeev, I send you rays of good. He fumbles and teaches fumble you. And most importantly, this is a chat in a telegram, where you will always find support among the comrades, not a single question will be left without attention. Make yourself a gift for the new year, purchase a course. Good for all.\n\n\nOleg Turyansky July 9, 2018 at 8:30\nVery good course! I came across a lot of new ideas, but for beginners I would advise you to go through the base before this course",
