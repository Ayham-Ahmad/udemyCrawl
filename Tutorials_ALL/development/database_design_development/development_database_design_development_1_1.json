      "description": "Whichever database application you use does not matter! This course will cover design concepts for all relational database management systems. This course is designed for those who want to download this course or watch it ad free. This is a course for relational database design. Here are some examples of the most popular databases:\nMySQL\nOracle\nMicrosoft SQL Server\nPostgreSQL\nSQLite\nMiariaDB\nand MORE!\nWe start off this course by taking our time to first look at what a database is and how it differs from a spreadsheet, website, filing cabinet, and so forth. We introduce SQL and talk about data definition language and data manipulation language. After about 4 solid videos of explaining databases and SQL, we dive into learning about entities and attributes. We apply all of these concepts to structure tables and relationships. We learn to design all of the relationships and I explain everything in depth.\nMost of the videos are on my chalkboard, explaining concepts. This is because it helps to fully understand database design before you dive into designing your own database. Once we go over all of the concepts of database design we will be designing databases from start to finish.\nNo programming skills are required. This course does not program a database. This course will only be teaching how to best design your database. You may be wondering why such a large course is required for only designing a database. Well, designing a database is an extremely important part of database management. The best design will get us the best results and make programming our database really easy.\nAfter this course you should be able to tackle almost any database design project with confidence and skill. Keep in mind though that learning database design takes a lot of time and effort. Be sure to take notes and stop after each video to reflect on what you've learned. Keeping notes will make this video course a whole lot easier!",

      "description": "Hi! Welcome to the AWS Data Architect Bootcamp course, the only course you need to learn everything about data architecture on AWS and play the role of an Enterprise Data Architect. This is the most-comprehensive AWS course related to AWS data architecture on the market. Here's why:\nThis is the only online course taught by an Enterprise Cloud Architect, who leads large teams of junior architects in the real world, who has an industry experience of close to two decades in the IT industry, who is a published author, and leads technology architecture of XXX million dollar projects on cloud for multi-national clients. Data Architects draw a salary in the range of $150K - $250K on an average. This course trains you for that job! This is my 10th course on Udemy, 3rd on AWS topics (previous 2 are best-sellers).\n\n\nTypical AWS classroom trainings on data architecture which contains a fraction of the topics covered in this course, costs $3000 - $5000. And this course teaches you 5 to 7 times more topics than AWS Training (40+ AWS Services) in the fraction of the cost.\n\n\nEverything covered in this course is kept latest. Services which are in Beta and launched in Re-invent (last Nov) are already covered in the course . AWS innovates and adds features to their stack very fast, and I keep my course constantly updated with those changes. Think of this course as a Architecture Updates subscription.\n\n\nDevelopers have questions, Architect's have questions, Clients have questions - All technical curious minds have questions. And this course also has 500+ questions and answers (FAQs) curated from AWS FAQs, to equip you with as many ready-to-use answers as you would need in your architect role.\n\n\nThe entire course is formed of 40+ services. Every service is composed of the below listed sections, with their proportion in each section / service.\n\n\nArchitecture (12%) – Diagrams, Integration, Terminology\nUse-Cases (6%) – Whether and When to use the AWS Service\nPricing (2%) – Cost estimation methods to assess overall solution cost\nLabs (75%) – To-the-point labs for architectural understanding covering all major and important features\nFrequently Asked Questions (5%) – Selected question from AWS FAQs explained concisely. (Total 500+)\n\n\nApart from AWS Services, we will use a number of client tools to operate on AWS Services, Databases and other technology stack. Here is a list of the tools that we would be using:\n1. EC2          2. Putty          3. Cloud9,         4. HeidiSQL        5. MySQL Workbench         6. Pgadmin      7. SSMS\n8. Oracle SQL Developer         9. Aginity Workbench for Redshift            10. SQL Workbench / J\n11. WinSCP          12. AWS CLI              13. FoxyProxy            14. Oracle Virtualbox              15. Linux Shell Commands\n16. FastGlacier              17. Rstudio             18. Redis Client               19. Telnet                20. S3 Browser\n21. Juypter Notebooks\n\n\nBelow is a detailed description of the curriculum as AWS Services we will be learning to understand how they fit in the overall cloud data architecture on AWS and address various use-cases.

We will learn how to channel streamed data from Kinesis Data Streams to AWS Data Storage & Analytics Repositories like S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch and more using this service.\n\n\nAWS Kinesis Data Streams - Clients can have streaming infrastructure or even devices (IoT) which may stream data continuously. Using this service we will learn how to collect streaming data and store it on AWS.\n\n\nAWS Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK) (Nov 2018 Release) - AWS recently added Kafka to their technology stack, which has lot of similarities with Kinesis. Learn comparative features as well as the method of standing up Kafka cluster on AWS to accept streaming data in AWS.\n\n\nAWS Schema Conversion Tool - Database migration is a complex process and can be homogeneous (for ex. SQL Server on-premise to SQL Server on AWS) or heterogeneous ( for ex. MySQL to PostgreSQL). We will use this offline tool to learn about assessing migration complexities, generate migration assessment reports, and even perform schema migration.\n\n\nAWS Database Migration Service (DMS) - Database Migration / Replication is a very common need for any federated data solution. We will use this service to learn how to migrate and/or replicate on-premise data from databases to AWS hosted relational databases on AWS RDS.\n\n\nAWS Data Sync (Nov 2018 Release) - Continuous synchronization of data from on-premise to cloud hosted data repositories becomes a key requirement in environments where data is generated or changes very fast. We will use to service to learn how it can solve this requirement.\n\n\nAWS Storage Gateway - This service has striking resemblance with AWS Data Sync, and is one of the alternatives for standing cached volumes and stored volumes on AWS to build a bridge between on-premise data storage and AWS. We will briefly learn similarities between AWS Data Sync and AWS Storage Gateway.\n\n\nAWS ElastiCache ( Memcached ) - After covering most of the mechanisms of data ingestion, we will shift focus on caching data before moving on the databases.

We will learn advanced tactics like locking data for legal compliance, cross-region global replication, data querying with S3 Select feature, Life-cycle management to move data to cold storage etc.\n\n\nAWS Glacier - Data keep accumulating on cloud and can increase storage costs dramatically. Infrequently used data is suitable for cold storage, where this service comes into play. We will learning archival, archive retrieval and archive querying using this service.\n\n\nAWS Relational Database Service (MariaDB) - We will be focusing heavily on AWS Service, which consists of 6 different types of databases. We will learn basic concepts of AWS RDS using MariaDB, stand-up an instance and query it with a client tool.\n\n\nAWS Relational Database Service (SQL Server) - Data needs to be imported and exported between data-centers and cloud hosted database instances. We will learn such tactics for dealing with backups and restores across cloud using SQL Server database on RDS with a client tool.\n\n\nAWS Relational Database Service (Oracle) - We will spend some time to learn how to stand up Oracle on AWS RDS, especially for Oracle professionals.\n\n\nAWS Relational Database Service (MySQL) - After spending time on practicing basic concepts, with MySQL database on AWS RDS, we will start practicing advanced concepts for High-Availability and Performance, like Read Replicas and Performance Insights features.\n\n\nAWS Relational Database Service (PostgreSQL) - There can be use-cases where there may be need to convert one database to another on cloud, for example convert PostgreSQL to MySQL. We will learn about some compatibility features where we can create a MySQL read replica from a PostgreSQL instance and make a read replica as an independent database.\n\n\nAWS Relational Database Service (Aurora) - Aurora on AWS RDS is a native database service from AWS. It comes in two flavors - cluster hosted and serverless, which is suitable for different use-cases. Also the storage architecture of Aurora is shared by various other AWS services like AWS Neptune and DocumentDB. We will learn this service in-depth.\n\n\nAWS Neptune - Relational databases is just one of the types of databases in the industry as well as on AWS. Graph is special use-case for very densely connected data where the value of relationships is much higher than normal. We will learn graph theory of RDF vs Property Graph, and learn how Neptune fits in this picture, stand-up a Neptune Server as well as client, and operate on it with query languages like Gremlin ( Tinkerpop ) and SPARQL.\n\n\nAWS DocumentDB (Nov 2018 Release) - MongoDB is one of the industry leader in NoSQL Document Databases. AWS has recently introduced this new service which is a native implementation of AWS to provide an equivalent database with MongoDB compatibility. We will learn details of the same.\n\n\nAWS DynamoDB - Key-value databases are important for housing voluminous data typically logs, tokens etc. We will learn document database implementation in depth with advanced features like streaming, caching, data expiration and more.\n\n\nAWS API Gateway - REST APIs are today's standard mechanism of data ingestion. We will learn how to build data ingestion and access pipeline with APIs using this service with AWS DynamoDB.\n\n\nAWS Lambda - Microservices are often tied with APIs, and are the cornerstone of any programmatic integration with AWS Services, typically AWS's Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Services. We will learn developing Lambda functions\n\n\nAWS CloudWatch - System logging is at the center of all programmatic logic execution, and it ties very closely with microservices and metrics logging for a variety of AWS Services. We will learn how to access and log data from microservices in CloudWatch logs.\n\n\nAWS Internet of Things (IoT) - Today IoT is one of the fastest growing areas, and from a data perspective, its one of the most valued source of data. The first challenge enterprises phase is the mechanism of ingesting data from devices and then processing it. With prime focus on ingestion, we will learn how to solution this using an end-to-end practical example which reads data from a device and sends text messages on your cell phone.\n\n\nAWS Data Pipeline - With Data Lakes already overflowing with data, moving data within cloud repositories and from on-premises to AWS requires an orchestration engine which can move the data around with some processing. We will learn how to solve this use-case with this service.\n\n\nAmazon Redshift and Redshift Spectrum - All stored data in relational or non-relational format needs to be analyzed and warehoused. We will learn how to cater the requirement for a peta-byte scale, massively parallel data warehouse using this service.\n\n\nAWS ElasticSearch - ElasticSearch is one of the market leaders in search framework along with its alternative Apache Solr. AWS provides its own managed implementation of ElasticSearch, which can be used as one of the options to search data from different repositories. We will learn how to use this service for addressing search use-cases, and understand how tools like Logtash and Kibana fits in the overall solution.\n\n\nAWS CloudSearch - Standing up an AWS ElasticSearch needs some ElasticSearch specific understanding. For use-cases which needs a more managed solution, AWS provides an alternative packaged solution for search based on Apache Solr. We will learn how to stand up this service and use if for standing up search solutions in an express manner.\n\n\nAWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR) - After spending sufficient time on Ingestion, Migration, Storage, Databases, Search and Processing, now we will enter the world of Big Data Analytics where we will spend significant amount of time learning how to standup a Hadoop based cluster and process data with frameworks like Spark, Hive, Oozie, EMRFS, Tez, Jupyter Notebooks, EMR Notebooks, Dynamic Port Forwarding, RStudio on EMR, Read and Process data from S3 in EMR, Integrate Glue with Hive, Integrate DynamoDB with Hive and much more.\n\n\nAWS Backup (Nov 2018 Release) - Creating backup routines of various data repositories is a Standard Operating Procedure of production environments. AWS made this job easier for support team with this brand new service. We will learn about the details of this service.\n\n\nAWS Glue - AWS has centralized Data Cataloging and ETL for any and every data repository in AWS with this service. We will learn how to use features like crawlers, data catalog, serde (serialization de-serialization libraries), Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) jobs and many more features that addresses a variety of use-cases with this service.\n\n\nAWS Athena - Serverless data lake is formed using four major services : S3, Glue, Redshift, Athena and QuickSight. This service is at the tail end of the process, and acts like a query engine for the data lake. We will learn how it serves that purpose and completes the picture.\n\n\nAWS QuickSight - AWS filled the gap of a cloud-native reporting service in 2017 with the launch of this service. We will learn how it fits in the Serverless Data Lake picture and allows to create reports and dashboards.\n\n\nAWS Rekognition - We will start our journey into the world of cognitive services powered by Artificial Intelligence with this service. Images and Video are vital source of data, and extracting information from these data sources and processing that data in a programmatic manner has various applications. We will learn how to perform this integration with Rekognition.\n\n\nAWS Textract (Nov 2018 Release) - Optical Character Recognition is another vital source of data, for ex. we are very much used to scanning of bar codes, tax forms, ebooks etc. We will learn how to extract text from documents using this AI powered brand new service form AWS.\n\n\nAWS Comprehend - Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a very big practice area of data analytics, typically performed using data science languages like R and Python. AWS makes the job of NLP easier by wrapping up a AI powered NLP service. We will learn the use of this service and understand how it complements services like Textract and Rekognition.\n\n\nAWS Transcribe - One major source of data that we have not touched so far is Speech to Text. We will learn how to use this AP powered service to extract text from speech, and how it can be effectively used for a number of use-cases.\n\n\nAWS Polly - We would have covered many use-cases of processing textual data from one form to another, but processing text to speech, which is the exact opposite function of Transcribe, we will learn to perform that with this AI powered service from AWS. We will also learn the use of Speech Synthesis Language to control the details of the speech that gets generated.\n\n\nAWS SageMaker - After comfortably using AI powered service, which abstracts the complexity of machine learning models from end-users, we will now venture in the world of machine learning with this service. We will execute a machine learning model end-to-end and learn how to access data from S3, create a model, create notebooks for executing code to explore and process data, train - build - deploy machine learning model, tune hyper-parameters, and finally accessing it from a load balanced infrastructure using API endpoints.\n\n\nAWS Personalize - Recommendation Engines requires building a reinforced deep learning neural network. Amazon has been in the business of recommending products to customers since decades. They have packages their method of recommendation as a product and launched it as a service, which is making a debut in the form of Personalize. We will perform an end-to-end exercise to understand how to use this service for generating recommendations.\n\n\nAWS Lake Formation (Nov 2018 Release) - As forming data lakes is a tedious process, AWS has introduce a set of orchestration steps in the form of service to expedite the generation of Data Lakes. As this service is in early preview (Beta) and is subject to change, we will look at a preview of the GUI of this service before concluding the curriculum of this course.\n\n\nIf you are not sure whether this course is right for you, feel free to drop me a message and I will be happy to answer your question related to suitability of this course for you.

      "description": "SQL and MySQL are powerful tools for managing and analyzing relational databases, and a skill that every analyst and BI professional should have in the arsenal.\n\n\nIn this course, you'll take your database administration skills to the next level, expanding into advanced SQL database administration & analytics concepts like replication, automation, and database security.\n\n\nWe'll start by introducing the course structure, installing MySQL Community and Workbench, and reviewing key database administration (DBA) tasks; creating and editing schemas & tables, inserting and deleting records, and reviewing the key principles of normalized databases. From there we'll work through more advanced concepts like replication, backup and recovery, and learn how to leverage automation via stored procedures, triggers, and scheduled events.\n\n\nThroughout the course, you'll be playing the role of Lead Database Administrator for an e-commerce startup, and learn how to build and populate an entire database from the ground up using real-world projects and assignments.\n\n\nCOURSE OUTLINE:\nSQL Intro & MySQL Setup\nFor students who haven't completed one of our other SQL courses, we'll demonstrate exactly how to download and install the tools that we'll need to access MySQL, including MySQL Community Server & MySQL Workbench. We'll share download guides for both Mac & PC, and run our first piece of SQL code to generate the project database that we'll analyze throughout the course.\nImporting Data to the Database\nWe'll quickly review some basic concepts like creating, inserting, and deleting records. Then we'll learn how to tackle large data imports with ease, using the table data import wizard. We'll be using this handy tool throughout the course. You will construct and populate a database from the ground up as the business grows, just like a real DBA as part of the course project.\n\nAltering, Updating & Mapping Keys\nWe'll briefly review critical concepts like altering tables and updating records, discuss the ins and outs of primary and foreign keys, and from there you'll jump right into your assignments and quizzes for this section.\n\nReplication, Backup & Recovery\nHere we'll introduce the critical DBA concepts of replication, backup and recovery. We'll discuss the various benefits of replication, different methods of backing up your databases, and you'll learn how to restore your data should the need arise. This is getting into some pretty serious stuff!\n\n***MID-COURSE PROJECT\nYou will need all of the skills you've learned so far to complete this hands on mid-course project. You'll help your CEO by enhancing the data structure to accommodate changing business needs, and insert new data into various places within your database.\n\nTrigger Automation\nHere we'll dive into one of the most powerful automation tools you'll use as a DBA...triggers! You'll learn how you can create triggers to look for changes in the database via create, update, and delete statements, and then automatically enact changes on one of more of your tables. Triggers will be your best friend as a DBA, and can be extremely handy for Analysts to understand as well.\n\nCreating Views\nSometimes you don't need to create a table, and a view (aka \"a virtual table) is a better option. We'll walk through what views are, how you create them, and some of the major benefits of using views in certain situations.\n\n\nThe EER Diagram Editor\nOne of the best tools at your disposal for understanding your database and communicating its structure to others in your organization is leveraging EER Diagrams. We'll review some of the basics that we discussed in the Beginner course, and we'll also learn how to use the EER Diagram Editor to reverse engineer your schema, which is an extremely handy tool!\n\n\nStored Procedures & Scheduled Events\nNext, we'll dive deeper into automation by learning how to create stored procedures and scheduled events. If you liked triggers, you're going to love these! You can use stored procedures to simplify your processes, make your code more modular and easier to understand, and centralize certain parts of complex queries that you can leverage throughout your organization. Scheduled events will allow you to run one-time or recurring processes on your database, which you can schedule on whatever cadence you want. These are really fun!\n\n\nAutomating Data from Website Activity\nHere we'll be talking about the different types of data businesses typically track from their website activity, including traffic source data, on-site behavior, product purchases, and more. We'll discuss the various methods used to capture the various data types, and discuss the DBA's role in partnering with Engineering to make sure this is all working as it should.\n\n\nDatabase Security\nIn the last section before the final project, we'll discuss some of the most common types of database security threats you should be aware of as a DBA, as well as security best practices to mitigate your risk. Again, we'll discuss the DBA's role in the organization, how a DBA will partner with Engineering here, and who typically owns what.\n\n***FINAL COURSE PROJECT\nThis hands-on project will test all of your DBA skills. You will need to alter tables, import lots of data, design an optimal structure for an entirely new set of tables for a new business initiative, create an EER Diagram describing your new tables, and then you'll actually create them. After that, you'll need to create a stored procedure and a view, which will both used for reporting on the new data the company will be collecting. Finally, you'll need to come up with a comprehensive security plan to make sure your organization is aware of threats and following best practices. I know this sounds like a lot, but at this point you'll be ready for it!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This course does NOT go deep on data exploration and database analysis. Our goal here is to focus on building, altering, and maintaining SQL/MySQL databases using MySQL and MySQL Workbench (we cover data analysis in-depth in separate courses).\n______________________________\n\n\nEnroll today and get LIFETIME access to:\n8 hours of high-quality video\nDownloadable MySQL ebook and cheat sheets\nQuizzes and homework assignments\nMid-course and Final SQL projects\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\n\nIf you're looking for a unique and engaging way to develop advanced MySQL database administration skills, this is the course for you.\n\n\nHappy administering!\n-John (Lead SQL Instructor & MySQL Expert, Maven Analytics)\n\n\n__________\nLooking for our full course library? Search \"Maven Analytics\" to browse our full collection of Excel, Power BI, SQL, Tableau, Python, Alteryx & Machine Learning courses!\n\n\nSee why John is one of the TOP-RATED SQL/MySQL Instructors on Udemy:\n\"I totally loved this course! Everything was easy to understand, but it moved at a fast enough pace that I never got bored. I learned SO much about MySQL and had fun doing it. In fact, at the end of the day I didn't want to stop learning -- I wanted to keep charging on to the next lesson!\"\n- Ann S.\n\"This is an excellent advanced course! I've taken multiple SQL courses from Maven Analytics and recommend them all. The best part of this course is the detail they included by building a real world e-commerce database. It's much easier to grasp the concepts when you can see how they're literally applied to scenarios and outcomes as opposed to just theory. Great work!\"\n- Dan S.\n\"John's deep understanding of SQL and database analysis and ability to explain those tools is really unmatched. I've taken other SQL and MySQL courses and tried reading books, but this course is by far the most effective. Excited to see more courses from John!\"\n- Steven M.",

      "description": "In a world with hundreds of different databases, one database rises to rule them all.\nRedis is an in-memory database known for its speed and simplicity.  Originally used only for simple caching, its feature set has expanded to be one of the most versatile databases around.\nThis course will teach you everything you need to know to integrate Redis into a new or existing project.\nGet hands-on experience with commands used to add, update, and query data\nApply best practices and numerous design patterns by adding Redis to an E-Commerce app\nUnderstand and extend the internals of Redis by using modules and scripts\nGo beyond Redis with a deep look at fundamental concurrency issues and solutions\nData structures form the heart of Redis.  Rather than hiding functionality behind complex abstractions, Redis exposes several powerful data structures that developers use to store and query data.  Learning about these different data structures is the key to mastering Redis.  This course focuses on making sure that you understand the difference between a sorted set and a hash.  After completing this course, you'll understand when to use each structure and the benefits and drawbacks to each.  Don't have a background in algorithms or data structures?  That's OK!  Everything in this course assumes you have no prior knowledge.\nAlmost all top companies around the world use Redis.  Twitter, GitHub, Snapchat, Craigslist, StackOverflow - they all use Redis!  Nearly every major web product you use on a daily basis utilizes Redis behind the scenes.  And its not just large companies that use Redis - small startups do as well.\nTo understand Redis, you must use Redis.  Just memorizing commands isn't enough.  You need to get your hands dirty!  With that in mind, you'll work through many exercises and quizzes.  In addition, throughout this entire course you will build a large E-Commerce application using Redis.  Don't worry - you won't need to write any frontend code.  As we learn new topics in Redis, we will add new features to our E-Commerce app.  You'll get to see why and when we use each major feature of Redis.\nBuilt-in cheatsheets.  Many resources about Redis show running commands in a terminal window.  This approach makes it hard to remember even the most basic commands.  In this course, you'll take a different approach.  I built a standalone webapp called RBook just for you to use in this course.  This app allows you to run commands against your own Redis instance and document them at the same time, making it easy for you to refer back to your notes in the future.  Of course, you don't have to use RBook if you don't want to!\nEffective learning. Everything in this course is designed to make your learning process as easy as possible.\nAt every step, I will teach you what Redis is doing internally, and help you understand how to twist and bend Redis to better suit your application's needs.\nEvery single video in the course has an attached ZIP file containing up-to-date code, just in case you ever get stuck.\nFull-time teaching assistants are standing by to help answer your questions.\nAccess to a private live chat server is included. Live help whenever you need it!\n\n\nSoooo much more.  Here's a partial of some of the things you will do in this course:\nWrite basic commands to store, update, and query data\nPractice your skills with exercises and quizzes\nUse almost every major feature of Redis to build an E-Commerce app\nEnforce data constraints using sets, sorted sets, and lists\nUnderstand when to use each of Redis's major data structures\nApply numerous design patterns to integrate Redis into an existing codebase\nSecurely deploy a Redis instance using AWS, GCP, or Azure through Redis Cloud\nCollect stats and metrics sourced from a live API\nCommunicate between different servers using Streams\nMaster the concept of transactions to safely store data\nImplement a standard locking algorithm to solve concurrency issues\nRedis is known for being simple, but it is still hard to learn. You're given a huge toolbox with tons of features, but no clear guidance on when to use each feature.  This course aims to give you direction.  You'll understand why each feature exists, and when to use them in real apps.  You will find learning Redis a delightful experience and pick up a tremendous amount of knowledge along the way.\nSign up today and join me in mastering Redis!",

      "description": "This course starts from scratch!\nYou’ll learn Amazon DynamoDB from the ground up. No prior knowledge of DynamoDB is necessary!\n\n\nJoin the most comprehensive DynamoDB course ever.\nFrom basic to advanced topics in AWS DynamoDB, you get to learn it all! You’ll not only learn, but master DynamoDB, the cloud database from Amazon.\nWhile you learn, if you need my help, just ask. You’ll receive prompt support both via direct messaging or discussion.\nAmazon DynamoDB is a fast, flexible, serverless NoSQL database service from Amazon that scales on-demand to support virtually unlimited concurrent Read/Write operations, with sub-millisecond response times.\n\n\nThis Course uses Node.js and JavaScript\nFor all the demos that require the use of AWS SDKs, we'll use the AWS SDK for JavaScript. APIs are implemented on Node.js.\nKnowledge of Node.js and JavaScript is good to have for taking this course. This shouldn’t however stop you from taking the course. If you are new to JavaScript or Node.js, I cover the JavaScript fundamentals as an optional section inside this course.\nThe JavaScript and Node.js topics covered in the course will help you get up and running with using the AWS SDK and perform the demos presented in this course. However, keep in mind that, as this course is not a JavaScript or Node.js course.\nThe course also uses Angular and Ionic for Web and Mobile app demos. Knowledge of Angular or Ionic, however is not required for you to be able to complete the demos presented in the course.\n\n\nGet a very solid grasp on how to use DynamoDB in practice\nThis course will teach you all the fundamentals of DynamoDB as well as advanced DynamoDB topics. You’ll learn how to design DynamoDB tables using the DynamoDB best practices, how to use DAX or DynamoDB Accelerator for faster performance, how to reduce DynamoDB costs, how to perform efficient scaling and how to use AWS SDK to integrate highly-scalable web as well as highly-scalable mobile applications with DynamoDB.\n\n\nThis course follows a hands-on approach\nWe’ll build fully functional cross-platform web as well as mobile apps supporting social media login and providing a uniform user experience across devices and platforms.\nThis course demonstrates all the advanced features of DynamoDB, hands-on, and step by step. Simply watching me integrate DynamoDB with other AWS services and implementing web and mobile apps, will take your DynamoDB skills to the next level.\nWe will cover the latest DynamoDB features like DAX, Global tables, Auto-Scaling, Data Encryption, On-demand, Scheduled, as well as Continuous backups and Point-in-Time Recovery.\nWe’ll also cover hands-on demos on topics like integrating DynamoDB with S3, AWS Lambda, Cognito, Data Pipeline, Redshift, Apache Hive on EMR, CloudWatch, CloudTrail among others.\nWe’re also going to build RESTful API that connects to the DynamoDB backend with a Fine-Grained Access Control in place. We will then take this further and integrate a highly-scalable web application or a single page application with DynamoDB.\nAnd then we’ll integrate DynamoDB with highly-scalable iOS app as well as an Android app. All these three apps, web, iOS and Android apps will use Google login for user authentication. We'll do this by implementing social OAuth 2.0 based login with Federated Access using AWS Cognito.\nLook through the course curriculum above for the complete list of demos covered.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have mastered Amazon DynamoDB and you’ll be confident and be fully equipped to tackle even advanced level DynamoDB projects.\n\n\nTake a look at what my existing students have said about this course:\n\"The \"AWS DynamoDB - The Complete Guide\" is one of the best classes I have ever taken in person or online. Riyaz is thorough in his coverage of the topic. This practical Guide not only taught me the specifics of DynamoDB, but it also spoke to its typical ecosystem of transactional and batch solutions. His blend of concept, practical examples, production best practices, empower you to tackle real-world challenges.\" - Lincoln\n\"AWS DynamoDB course is one of excellent course in UDEMY platform.Very well nicely explained each and every concept.\" - Chaitanya K.\n\"Comprehensive course, instructor is highly competent and has a depth of experience\" - Mitch D.\n\"This is a very nice course and instructor has practically covered almost all aspects of integration with DynamoDB...very few people are as detailed on this topic as you are and very few people have this expertise\" - Vinay G.\n\"Amazing course, covering DynamoDB in depth with real life examples using Node, Express, Angular, and Ionic, hard to believe pack into one course. I learnt a huge amount from Riyaz, he really knows his stuff!!\" - Edward W.\nRemember, you are in good hands! I'm waiting to help you inside the course! This is an online course, so you can take it at your own pace. If you’re busy right now, that's perfectly alright. Sign up today, and take the course at your own pace.\nI look forward to welcoming you inside the course!",

In my opinion, the instructor did great with the \"How-tos\" which helped for sure in grasping the whole concept of how to create cubes, set up data source and source views, dimensions, add attributes etc.\" -- Lakeside David-Debo\n\"A fantastic course which gets you rolling very quickly and comfortably, thanks for the short and condensed knowledge delivery. Thanks, Phillip you made SSAS very simple for me.\" - Anup Kale\n\"This is really the perfect course for beginners! Easy to learn and very inspirational for further investigations in SSAS. Thank you very much, Phillip!\" - Marina Barinova\nWelcome to this course on SQL Server SSAS and MDX Cubes – an Introduction.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\n\n\nYou may have become experienced with creating SQL statements in SQL Server Management Studio. Building databases is ideal when you want to quickly add data – that’s why they are called OLTP – Online Transaction Processing – they are designed for speed for adding transactions.\nBut what if you want to get information out quickly? OLTP databases are not based designed for this. What you need instead is a process whereby data is pre-aggregated – in other words, a lot of the calculations you may write have been calculated before you ask for them. It saves a lot of time. It would also be useful if the end user didn’t have to bother with SQL queries, and could use something a bit more hands-on, although retaining something more advanced for advanced users. That’s where cubes come in, full of pre-aggregated data, and SQL Server Analytical Services– or SSAS – (Online Analytical Processing) allows you to make these cubes.\nThis course is designed for the complete beginner in Multidimensional cubes, or someone who wants to refresh their memory. We’ll create a cube to start with from an ordinary database, and then I’ll ask you to create one from a special database known as a Data Warehouse. We’ll export our cube in SQL Server Management Studio, and into SSRS – and we’ll even have a bit of a look at the more advanced way of querying that is MDX.",

Streaming data at scale and rapidly between all your systems should be centralised, automated and resilient to failure to ensure good delivery to your downstream systems.\nWith NiFi, you can build all your flows directly from a UI, no coding required, and at scale!\nApache NiFi initially used by the NSA so they could move data at scale and was then open sourced. Being such a hot technology, Onyara (the company behind it) was then acquired by Hortonworks, one of the main backers of the big data project Hadoop and then Hadoop Data Platform.\nApache NiFi is now used in many top organisations that want to harness the power of their fast data by sourcing and transferring information from and to their database and big data lakes. It is a key tool to learn for the analyst and data scientists alike. Its simplicity and drag and drop interface make it a breeze to use!\nYou can build streaming pipelines between Kafka and ElasticSearch, an FTP and MongoDB, and so much more! Your imagination is the limit\n==============================\nQuick Overview Of Course Content\nThis course will take you through an introduction of the Apache NiFi technology.\nWith a mix of theory lessons and hands-on labs, you'll get started and build your first data flows.\nYou will learn how to set up your connectors, processors, and how to read your FlowFiles to make most of what NiFi offer.\nThe most important configuration options will be demonstrated so you will be able to get started in no time.\nWe will also analyse a template picked from the web and understand how to debug your flows as well as route your data to different processors based on outcomes through relationships.\nWe will finally learn about the integrations between NiFi and Apache Kafka or MongoDB. Lots of learning ahead!\n==============================\nWhy I should take this course?\nWith over 1.5 hours of videos and over 15 classes, you will get a great understand of Apache NiFi in no time!\nYou will learn how to install and configure Apache NiFi to get started\nYou will learn Apache NiFI Architecture and Core Concepts\nThe core concepts like FlowFile, FlowFile Processor, Connection, Flow Controller, Process Groups etc.\nYou will learn how to use Apache NiFi Efficiently to Stream Data using NiFi between different systems at scale\nYou will also understand how to monitor Apache NiFi\nIntegrations between Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi!\nQuestions can also be asked on the forum and instructor is keen to answer those in timely manner\n==============================\nStudents Loved this course\nAshish Ranjan says “Great Course to get started with Nifi. Also, the instructor is very helpful and answers all your questions. I would highly recommend it. Great Job.” (Rated with 5 star)\nLuca Costa says “It was very interesting and now I have an Idea how to start my project :) Thank you” (Rated with 5 star)\nAaron Gong says “Very clear and well instructed, first section is the most important, why use Nifi and for what purpose it is better suited for…” (Rated with 5 star)\nI am sure that you will walk away with a great enterprise skill and start solving your streaming challenges!\n===============================\nInstructor\nMy name is Stephane Maarek, and I'll be your instructor in this course. I teach about Data Engineering and API, and throughout my career in designing and delivering these certifications and courses, I have already taught 1,000,000+ students and gotten 350,000+ reviews!\nWith NiFi becoming much more than a buzzword out there, I've decided it's time for students to properly learn about Apache NiFi - Cloudera DataFlow - HDF 2.0.

You'll learn by doing, using Redis Stack with a real e-commerce data set to:\n\n\nStream data in real time using Redis Streams\nStore structured, persistent data into a distributed NoSQL document store with RedisJSON\nIndex and query structured data with RediSearch\nAnalyze time series data with RedisTimeSeries and Redis Insight\nCreate a real-time topseller leaderboard with RedisBloom\nWe will use a free Redis Cloud account and scripts written in Python to illustrate the use of each system. We'll walk you through setting it all up.\nRedis makes it possible to build a complete technology stack that does not rely on a specific cloud computing vendor. Your colleagues probably still think Redis is just a caching technology; you can be the first to tell them about this new alternative for storing and processing data at massive scale. This concise yet complete training will get you up an running with Redis in the cloud, or on your own cluster.\nYour instructor is Frank Kane, a former senior manager at Amazon specializing in distributed systems. Frank has taught over 1,000,000 students around the world.\n\n\n* Development of this course was sponsored by Redis Ltd.",

      "description": "* Covers Oracle Database 11g, Oracle 12c, Oracle 18c, and Oracle 19c\nOracle is currently the most popular relational database management system in the world. It is used by thousands of big companies who are usually willing to pay good salaries to the right people, which includes those with practical Oracle SQL knowledge that is based on best practices and experience.\nMost SQL courses give you theoretical SQL knowledge. In this course, you will learn by actually writing code.\nWhat do other learners say about this course?\nShruti says: “It was such an amazing course. Absolutely a beginner friendly course”.\nDaniel says “Excellent match. In spite of knowing sql for more than a decade, learnt a loooot of new stuff.”\nDavid says: “Really well explained! Love the energy of the instructor!”.\nScott says: “This is an incredible course! I love how the instructor Carlos presents topics very clearly, but also challenges students in the quizzes and practice challenges. Too many courses out there contain practice challenges that are exact replicas of what was just taught, which are too easy and limit growth of the student. I have no suggestions for improvement on the course content and presentation, as it was simply perfect in my opinion. ... I would rate this course higher than 5 stars if that were possible. Thank you Carlos!”\nThomas says: “Honestly, I've seen some good udemy courses... This course is one of the best structured iv'e seen. It places a priority on the practice challenges that allows the quality of the course to rival a university course ... Great instruction, great value for the course!”\nRoshan says: “great course to cover all the fundamentals, great for interview preparations.”\nPaul says “This course is very thorough, and Carlos is a skilled instructor!”\nRadu says “Very clear course, concise presentation, excellent tips, very good pronunciation, captions without errors, lots of exercises for practice... Thank you for the excellent course, Carlos.”\nLearn Oracle SQL in a practical and smart way and jump-start your career as an Oracle SQL developer:\nLearn everything about the SELECT statement including the FROM, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, OVER, PIVOT and all other related clauses.\nLearn how to use all types of operators in Oracle SQL.\nLearn how to use numeric, text, date, conversion, aggregate, analytic, and other types of Oracle SQL functions.\nLearn how to add, modify, and delete information from Oracle databases using SQL by means of the UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE and other kinds of statements.\nLearn how to use SQL to create and use tables, constraints, sequences, indexes, and views.\nSolve interesting and challenging problems by actually writing Oracle SQL code, which will improve your learning and retention, and will give you confidence to put your skills to work in real life situations.\nGet tips and knowledge that is usually only learned through years of SQL experience.\nMuch more.\nCarlos created this course because most courses, if not all, focus too much on “telling” or “demonstrating” how to do things, but don’t give you, as a student, the opportunity to test and practice what is being taught. Some of them tell you to practice or to do things along with the instructor, but unfortunately, such an approach doesn’t really work. Seeing how things are done or just copying or repeating what you see on the screen is not going to help you learn SQL. You might feel that you are learning, but when the time comes for you to write a command on your own, you are most likely not going to feel very confident.\nHere you will learn and practice much more than just SQL basics.\nContent and Overview:\nThis course will not only help beginners learn the SQL language.  If you already have previous SQL knowledge, you will also learn a lot of new concepts, features and techniques that will make you an even better SQL developer.\nAfter setting the learning environment, it starts with the most basic concepts about databases in general and a very short introduction to Oracle and the SQL language.\nYou will start learning about the simplest SQL statements, and before you even notice it, you will have covered all the SQL basics and will be gradually progressing to more advanced concepts.\nThe course includes several topics that some people, including experienced developers and other instructors, consider advanced, such as Analytic Functions, Hierarchical Queries, Pivot and Unpivot features, and many more.\nIt does not include demonstration lectures because the whole course is a coding demonstration. In 90% of the video lectures, you will be watching the instructor's computer screen while he types, explains, and runs Oracle SQL code.\nIt does not include labs at the end of each section because practically every lesson has a coding task for you to practice what you are learning.\nPlease note that PL/SQL (Oracle's procedural language) is not covered in this course.\nThe instructor will not only teach you SQL. He will share his decades of Oracle experience with you through what he calls “experience tips”. Those tips can really help you differentiate and stand out.\nFinal words from the instructor:\nYou could enjoy being seen as an experienced and knowledgeable SQL developer by your friends, peers, and potential employers in a very short time, but you have to take action. If you want my help, you’ve got it.\n-Carlos, founder of the Standout-Dev Academy.",

      "description": "Database Engineering is a very interesting sector in software engineering. If you are interested in learning about database engineering you have come to the right place. I have curated this course carefully to discuss the Fundamental concepts of database engineering.\n\n\nThis course will not teach you SQL or programming languages, however, it will teach you skillsets and patterns that you can apply in database engineering. A few of the things that you will learn are Indexing, Partitioning, Sharding, Replication, b-trees in-depth indexing, Concurrency control, database engines and security, and much more.\n\n\nI believe that learning the fundamentals of database engineering will equip you with the necessary means to tackle difficult and challenging problems yourself. I always compare engineering to math, you never memorize specific formulas and equations, you know the basic proves and derive and solve any equation one throws at you. Database engineering is similar, you can't possibly say MongoDB is better than MySQL or Postgres is better than Oracle. Instead, you learn your use case and by understanding how each database platform does its own trade-offs you will be able to make optimal decisions.\n\n\nOne other thing you will learn in this course is the lowest database interface that talks to the OS which is the database engine. Database engines or storage engines or sometimes even called embedded databases is a software library that a database management software uses to store data on disk and do CRUD (create update delete) Embedded means move everything in one software no network client-server. In this video course, I want to go through the few popular database engines, explain the differences between them, and finally, I want to spin up a database and change its engine and show the different features of each engine.\n\n\nEnjoy the course.",

If you want to practice labs, it would require AWS Account and may cost $$.\nBasic working knowledge of Redshift is recommended, but not a must.\nThis course has been designed for intermediate and expert AWS Developers / Architects / Administrators.\nCourse covers each and every feature that AWS has released since 2018 for AWS Glue, AWS QuickSight, AWS Athena, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum, and it regularly updated with every new feature released for these services.\nServerless is the future of cloud computing and AWS is continuously launching new services on Serverless paradigm. AWS launched Athena and QuickSight in Nov 2016, Redshift Spectrum in Apr 2017, and Glue in Aug 2017. Data and Analytics on AWS platform is evolving and gradually transforming to serverless mode.\n\n\nBusinesses have always wanted to manage less infrastructure and more solutions. Big data challenges are continuously challenging the infrastructure boundaries. Having Serverless Storage, Serverless ETL, Serverless Analytics, and Serverless Reporting, all on one cloud platform had sounded too good to be true for a very long time. But now its a reality on AWS platform. AWS is the only cloud provider that has all the native serverless components for a true Serverless Data Lake Analytics solution.\n\n\nIt's not a secret that when a technology is new in the industry, professionals with expertise in new technologies command great salaries. Serverless is the future, Serverless is the industry demand, and Serverless is new.

      "description": "SQL Course For Beginners: Learn SQL Using MySQL Database\n\nThe course was completely updated on 9th December 2024\nHere Is What You Get By Enrolling In This Course:\nWord-By-Word Explanation: In the entire course, I explain each line of code, without skipping a single line of code.\nPractice Examples:  Special set of practice examples included at the end of each section.\nAwesome Quality Content: Over 15+ hours of HD(1080p) Videos.\nWell Structured & Easy To Learn: Course has been specially designed to make it easy for the students to learn SQL.\n24 X 7 Support: I will always be there to guide you in your journey to become SQL expert.\nNote: Student queries and problems will be answered immediately.\n\n\nHere Is Everything You Will Learn In This Complete Course:\nThe entire course is divided into 23 major sections.\nHere is what is covered in each section:\n\n\nSection 1: Introduction to the course\nIn this section we will learn what the course covers and have a brief overview of the topics to be covered\nSection 2: Introduction to SQL and Databases\nIn this section We will learn what are databases, what is SQL and what role does SQL play in databases. By the end of this section you will have a brief idea about what databases are and how they are created.\nSection 3: Installing required tools\nWe then install a couple of tools required for learning SQL, we install MySQL and A tool called MySQL workbench will allows us to write SQL queries.\nSection 4: SQL basics, creating databases, tables & data types\nOnce we have MySQL installed we will straightaway start creating and learn how to create our very own databases and database tables. We learn how a database table is created and how data is stored in database tables. We will learn how to create any table in a database by writing SQL syntax. We will also learn about data types and the select clause which allows us to select or query data from our database tables.\nSection 5: Constraints in MySQL\nWe then learn about constraints. After creating database tables, we need to enforce certain rules on each table. Constraints allow you to do exactly that, constraint allows us to impose rules on database tables. In this section we learn the different types of constraints and their uses.\nSection 6: Comparison operators in MySQL\nTo filter data from our SQL queries, MySQL provides us multiple comparison operators. In this section we will learn about t he different comparison operators like equal, not equal, less than, greater than, between, like, is null and is not null operators. All of these operators allow us to filter data from our query results.\nSection 7: Logical operators in MySQL\nMySQL provides logical operators like AND, OR & NOT, we can use these logical operators to combine multiple SQL queries together.\nSection 8: String functions in MySQL\nWe then learn about string functions. Most of the data stored in the database is stored in form of strings. MySQL provides built in string functions which can be used to perform string manipulations. Some of the string functions we will be learning are the Concat function, length function, Substring function, Trim function, replace function, Locate function and a lot more.\nSection 9: Arithmetic operations\nMySQL database contains numeric data as well. Hence mysql also provides the ability to perform arithmetic operations on numerical data present in our database. In this section we will learn how arithmetic can be performed on numerical data in our database tables.\nSection 10: Modifying database tables\nWe have already created database tables, but we also need to learn how to modify them and that is exactly what we will learn in this section. We will learn how to add new columns, delete existing columns, change data types of columns, rename columns, rename tables, modify constraints and drop constraints. This will give us superpowers to modify any database table in any way we desire.\nSection 11: CRUD operations\nCRUD stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE & DELETE In this section we will learn how to perform all the above operations with respect to database tables.\nSection 12: Aggregate functions\nSometimes we have to apply functions on the entire data and aggregate functions allow you to do that. Aggregate functions have the ability to collectively operate on all rows in our table. In this section we will learn about the different aggregate functions provided by MySQL.\nSection 13: Date & time data types in MySQL\nDatabase table can also have data and time data in it and we need to learn how to effectively work with that data. In this lecture we will learn exactly that, i.e how to work with data related to date and time\nSection 14: Foreign key constraint\nWe learn what a foreign key is and how it is used to establish a connection between two tables.\nSection 15: Relationships in MySQL\nIn a large database, database tables are connected with each other. These database table connections are called as relationships. In this section we will learn the different relationships that can exists between database tables.\nSection 16: Joins in MySQL\nIn this section we learn how we could join two tables on the basis of a common column. We learn the different types of joins that can be implemented between two database tables.\nSection 17: Views in MySQL\nWe then learn about views, what they are and how to create views in MySQL. Views allow us to write complex queries in MySQL and we learn how to write a complex query using a view.\nSection 18: Database theory for interviews\nThis section is completely theoretical and is added in this course keeping in mind that you might be appearing for interviews. In this section we learn what is a data definition language, data manipulation language. We will also learn what are relational databases, non relational databases and the differences between the two.\nSection 19: Window functions in MySQL\nWindow functions are a new concept introduced in MySQL 8. They allow us to apply a function over a specified window.\nWe learn the different types of window functions that exists.\nSection 20: CTEs in MySQL\nCTEs also called as common table expression are newly introduced in MySQL, in this section we will learn what CTEs are and how they are created and what purpose they serve in MySQL.\nSection 21: CASE statement in MySQL\nIn this section we learn how to create conditional flow in MySQL statements, we learn how the case statement works and how it can be used to write conditional queries.\nSection 22: Stored Routines in MySQL\nMySQL allows you to create your own functions and procedures and save them so that you can use them as and when required. In this section we will learn how to implement stored functions and stored procedures.\nSection 23: Triggers in MySQL\nIn the last section we will learn about triggers, how triggers are created in MySQL and the different types of triggers that can be created. We learn about the before insert trigger, before update trigger, after update trigger, before update trigger, after delete trigger.\n\n\nSo let's begin the journey of becoming an expert in SQL.\nIn addition to the Udemy 30-day money back guarantee, you  have my personal guarantee that you will love what you learn in this  course. If you ever have any questions please feel free to message me  directly and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as  possible!\n\n\nMake sure to enrol in the course before the price changes.\nTake yourself one step closer towards becoming a professional SQL developer by clicking the \"take this course button\" now!\nJoin the journey.\nSincerely,\nAshutosh Pawar",

      "description": "Just launched with all modern SQL and Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, + more) features! Join a live online community of over 900,000+ students and a course taught by industry experts that have actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto managing databases. This is one of the most in demand tech skills in the world right now with SQL being used for many years to come (it has been around since the 1970s and going stronger than ever)!\n\nUsing the latest best practices in SQL, Database Management and Database Design, this course is focused on efficiency. Never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore. Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies.\n\n\nWe guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online resource on Databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL. This project and exercise based course will introduce you to all of the modern toolchain of an SQL developer or anyone using a database in the workplace (Product Manager, Business Analyst/Intelligence, Data Analyst, Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineer, Web Developer, Mobile Developer + any role requiring insights from data). Along the way, we will learn practical and real world skills that will get you hired.\n\n\nThe curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of working with databases and SQL, all the way into learning how to scale databases, how to manage them, and even bonus material on working with Big Data, Caching using Redis, and connecting PostgreSQL to a Node.js server. We even talk about pros and cons of choosing an SQL Database vs NoSQL like MongoDB. We will start from the very beginning by teaching you SQL and Database Fundamentals and then going into advanced topics so you can make good decisions and work with any data that your company has no matter how complex!\n\nThe topics covered are:\n\n- NoSQL (MongoDB) vs PostgreSQL, MySQL vs NewSQL\n- SQL Theory And Concepts\n- The Relational Model\n- SQL Basics\n- SQL Functions\n- Data Modification Language / DML\n- Data Query Language / DQL\n- Subqueries\n- Indexes\n- SQL Filtering / WHERE Statement\n- 3 Valued Logic\n- SQL JOINS\n- Window Functions\n- Date Filtering and Timestamps\n- SQL Aggregate Functions\n- SQL Operator Precedense\n- SQL ORDER BY\n- SQL GROUP BY\n- SQL Top Down Design\n- SQL Bottom Up Design\n- SQL Entity Relationship Diagram\n- SQL Normalization\n- Database Types\n- The role of a DBMS\n- Multi Table SELECT\n- The Software Development Lifecycle / SDLC\n- POSTGRES Role Management\n- POSTGRES Permission Management\n- POSTGRES Backup Strategies\n- POSTGRES Transaction Management/ SQL Transactions\n- POSTGRES/SQL Data Types\n- SQL Views\n- Redis Database\n- Elasticsearch\n- Connecting A Database To A Server/Web App (Node.js)\n- Data Engineering (Kafka, Hadoop, etc...)\n- Sharding\n- Replication\n- Backups\n- Vertical + Horizontal Scaling\n- Distributed vs Centralized Databases\n- Big Data + Analytics\n- Database Security (SQL Injections, Access Control, etc...)\n+ more\n\nWith SQL you will be able to work with all databases like: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, SQLite, MariaDB, Amazon Redshift, Presto, Apache Hive with Hadoop, and many many more because SQL is everywhere!\n\n\nYou see, data is everywhere and it is the most valuable asset in the world. All the top companies need people that can work with data. That is where this course comes in. Unlike most tutorials out there, this course encompasses many fields working with many databases. Whether you want to get into the tech industry, you’re a mobile or web developer, a data scientist, a machine learning engineer, a business analyst, even sales and marketing or you have your own company. Any role that requires you to work with data will need to know this valuable skill that is SQL (how to interact with databases, analyze, and use data).\n\n\nHere is the thing though. There are many courses on this topic.\n\n\nLet me tell you 3 reasons why this course is different from any other SQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL/Database tutorial online:\n\n\n1. In this course you will learn to work with not just 1 but many Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Server, Redis, and so much more. No prior programming or technical experience is necessary. We take you from absolute zero, all the way to mastery. We will go above and beyond to not just teach you SQL commands but to teach you advanced techniques, best practices, database design and how to think about performance, security, and scalability.\n\n\n2. This course is taught by actual professionals who have experience and have worked with databases for some of the largest companies in the world. Mo is a super star when it comes SQL. He has built software for the European Union, launched products for 5 Fortune 500 companies, and has consulted at Google. Andrei has worked on enterprise level apps for large tech firms in Silicon Valley as well as Toronto and has also taught others tech skills that got them into big companies like Google. By having both Andrei and Mo teach, you get to see different perspective and learn from 2 engineers as if you are working at a company together.\n\n\n3. We are going to have fun here. The course starts off with you getting hired at Keiko Corp to investigate their recent Database breach. Because we believe in learning by doing, you will be doing tons of real life assignments and exercises along the way, and eventually get to the point where you can help Keiko Corp solve their mystery by looking at their databases and analyzing hidden information. Our goals is that everyone has fun and is successful after completing the course :)\n\n\nThis course is not about making you just watch along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in SQL and Databases to someone that is in the top 10% of SQL and Database experts!\n\n\nTaught By:\n\nAndrei is the instructor of the highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.\nHaving been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time. Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.\nAndrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.\nTaking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.\n\n\n\nMo is a Solutions Architect with over 7 years of experience in Software Architecture and Development. Having worked as a consultant for the majority of his career, he has seen it all.\nHe has worked on global applications for multi-nationals, governments and Fortune 500 companies.\n\n\nThroughout his career he has seen every type of developer and development practice, and the one thing that he believes more than anything is that software development is a pragmatic team sport. Go fast alone, go far together!\nMy main goal with instructing is to teach the foundational knowledge to set you up for life-long learning. Software and development practices change often, but when you have the right foundation adapting to the constant change becomes easy!\n\n\nSee you inside the courses!",

Additionally it's also used by data analysis and big data frameworks and tools like Apache Spark.\nKnowing SQL opens up an endless amount of opportunities and jobs - no matter if you're going to work with relational databases or if you're becoming a data scientist, knowing SQL will be key!\nThis course teaches you SQL from the ground up and in extremely high detail! In addition, this course comes with two main paths that you can take:\nThe \"Complete Course\" path where you go through the entire course, step by step, learning about ALL the key features and concepts you have to know\nThe \"Quick Summary\" path where you will learn the key SQL essentials within a few hours\nBoth paths are included in this course (i.e. with one single purchase) and you can switch between them or take both - simply as it makes most sense for you! Just dive into the free first course section to learn all about this course and these two paths (and how to take them).\nSQL is a standardized language and therefore learning SQL will help you apply it in all kinds of contexts. Nonetheless, different database systems also support different aspects of SQL or bring their own variations of the SQL language. Therefore, this course dives into SQL by exploring all key features at the example of the two most popular database systems: MySQL and PostgreSQL. All query and command examples are shown for both database systems, ensuring that you feel comfortable working with SQL in either environment!\nThis course will enable you to write your own (simple or complex) SQL queries, create basic or advanced databases and table structures and work with data of different shape and complexity!\nIn detail, you will learn:\nWhat exactly SQL is and how the core syntax looks like\nHow to write SQL commands\nHow to install MySQL & PostgreSQL as well as various clients\nHow to create and structure database tables\nWhich data types you may use and when to use which data type\nHow to perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update & Delete Data\nHow to insert data into tables\nHow to query and filter data\nWhy you should split data across multiple tables (and how to do that)\nHow to join (merge) data into combined result sets\nHow to write basic and more complex queries\nHow to aggregate and group data\nHow to use built-in database functions to work with numbers, text or dates\nHow to optimize databases with indexes\nAnd much, much more!\nExplore the full course curriculum to get a thorough overview of the course content and watch the free preview section to learn how this course will help you!\nThis course also comes with a 30 day refund period, so that you can try it risk-free :)\nWe'd love to welcome you on board of this course and explore SQL together with you!",

This course was perfect for that purpose!\n\n\nIn this course, we will look in an hour at the SELECT statement.\nThere are six constituent clauses in this statement:\nSELECT - this is akin to the Print statement in other languages, and\nFROM - this shows your data source,\nWHERE - this filters down your data source,\nGROUP BY - this enables the results to be summarised,\nHAVING - this filters the summary, and\nORDER BY - this sorts your results.\nWe will then look at saving your code using both views and procedures.\nFinally, we'll export your reports into Excel, both statistically (copy and paste) and dynamically (so that you always have the latest reports).\nIn just an hour, you'll be able to create your own SELECT statements, so you can use them in SQL Server (SSMS, SSRS and SSIS) and in Excel. This is all you need to start writing and using your own code. Quick and easily.\nIf you have not already got SQL Server installed on your machine, this course includes a link to a video which shows you how you can install for free SQL Server Developer edition, together with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

This is a common Java API used to work with Relational Databases.\nSpring Data JPA is an abstraction built on top of the JPA API specification.\nBeing an abstraction, Spring Data JPA makes working with database entities very efficient.\nSpring Data JPA eliminates a lot of the boilerplate / cerimonial code, and allows developers to focus on developing business logic.\nThe downside of the efficient abstraction is that accessing the database can become a mystery. Developers who just understand how to use Spring Data JPA do not understand the complexities of JDBC and Hibernate.\nYou will start this course with a basic demonstration of Spring Data JPA. In this section you will learn how to work with a H2 in-memory database.\nYou'll see how easy it is to work with Spring Data JPA. You will also begin to understand how the Hibernate interaction is being abstracted away.\nSince JPA is the Java API for working with Relational Databases, the course takes a closer look at Relational Databases and MySQL specifically.\nMySQL is the most popular open source relational database in the world. You will learn how to configure Spring Boot to test with a H2 in-memory database and to run integration tests against a MySQL database. This is a common real-world example leveraging the power of Spring and Hibernate to give you a very flexible environment.\nOnce we've established a persistent database, we can explore using database migration tools.\nLiquibase and Flyway are two very popular database migration tools. Spring Boot supports both options. And you will learn about both options and database security best practices.\nBy establishing a MySQL database, Spring Boot Integration Tests, and automated database migrations we can use Test Driven Development to explore the features of JDBC and Hibernate.\nIn the course you will learn:\nWhat is the DAO pattern, and how to implement it using JDBC, Spring's JDBCTemplate, and Hibernate\nRelational Database Principles\nSchema Creation in MySQL\nSchema Generation using Hibernate\nDatabase Migrations using Liquibase\nDatabase Migrations using Flyway\nDatabase Integration Testing using Spring Boot and JUnit 5\nDefining Primary Key's with Hibernate\nHibernate Criteria Queries\nNamed JPA Queries\nSpring Data JPA query methods\nSpring Data JPA @Query Annotation\nEntity Relationships - One to One, One to Many, Many to One, Many to Many\nEmbedded Types\nNatural Keys\nComposite Keys\nSpring Data JPA Query Methods\nPaging and Sorting\nDatabase Transaction Management\nDatabase Fetch Operations\nData Validation\nJPA Inheritance\nHibernate Interceptors and Listeners\nJPA Callbacks\nLegacy Database Mapping\nUsing Multiple Data Sources\nSpring Data REST\nLearn Hibernate and Spring Data JPA - Enroll today!",

You will learn step by step with hands-on examples.\nWhat is oracle SQL?\nSQL stands for Structured Query Language—the language developers use to interact with databases to create, read, update, and delete database records and manage other aspects of those databases. ANSI created the standard for SQL. Many database vendors, like Oracle, expand on this standard to create their version of the language. Oracle SQL is compliant with ANSI SQL standards, with features designed specifically for the Oracle database management system. This RDBMS was released as the first commercially available relational database management system in 1977 and holds the top market share worldwide for relational database management systems. Oracle SQL extends the SQL standard with a procedural language PL/SQL and adds the ability to use the Java programming language.\nWhat careers use Oracle SQL?\nHaving Oracle SQL skills can add value to many careers. The most obvious is being a database administrator in enterprises that use the Oracle database management system. But SQL dialects are pretty similar, and knowledge of Oracle SQL can apply to many types of relational databases and doesn't limit you to Oracle. Database developers also use Oracle SQL all day long to create new databases and table structures. Most applications require a database to function, so software engineers and web developers also use Oracle SQL frequently. Data scientists must access data to create machine learning models and find trends, and a lot of this data will get stored in databases that require a knowledge of SQL to retrieve and transform. Business analysts also use Oracle SQL to generate reports that help businesses get to their next stage.\nWhat skills should I have before learning Oracle SQL?\nThere are no prerequisites to learning Oracle SQL. Oracle SQL has a simpler syntax than many standard programming languages and reads almost like English. Most people can understand what a SQL query is trying to do before they even know the language. All you need is an interest in the language and a commitment to learning. That said, some things could help with your Oracle SQL education if you are already familiar with them. If you are familiar with Excel spreadsheets and understand how columns and rows work, you can apply that knowledge to Oracle database tables. It also helps to know at least the concepts of how a relational database management system works. Also, if you already know a programming language, that will help learn Oracle's extended features like PL/SQL.\nFresh Content\nYou will find DBA's in almost every organization/business, to maintain the organization's database. Becoming a DBA is totaly depends on the knowledge you have in the overall architecture of Oracle Database. It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New tools are released every day, Oracle updates its system, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge. With this course you will always have a chance to follow latest trends.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our contents are created/produced as high quality video/audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\n· Seeing clearly\n· Hearing clearly\n· Moving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nOracle Database Administrator DBA course\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",

      "description": "PostgreSQL is one of the most powerful and easy-to-use database management systems. It has strong support from the community and is being actively developed with a new release every year.\nPostgreSQL supports the most advanced features included in SQL standards. It also provides NoSQL capabilities and very rich data types and extensions. All of this makes PostgreSQL a very attractive solution in software systems.\nHowever, getting the best performance from it has not been an easy subject to tackle. You need just the right combination of rules of thumb to get started, proper testing, solid monitoring, and maintenance to keep your system running well, and hints for add-on tools to add the features the core database doesn't try to handle on its own.\nThis Udemy course is structured to give you both the theoretical and practical aspects to implement a High-Performance Postgres. It will help you build dynamic database solutions for enterprise applications using one of the latest releases of PostgreSQL.\nYou'll examine all the advanced aspects of PostgreSQL in detail, including logical replication, database clusters, performance tuning, and monitoring. You will also work with the PostgreSQL optimizer, configure Postgres for high speed by looking at transactions, locking, indexes, and optimizing queries.\nYou are expected to have some exposure to databases. Basic familiarity with database objects such as tables and indexes is expected. You will find this Udemy course really useful if you have no or a little exposure to PostgreSQL. If you have been working with PostgreSQL for a few years, you should still find a few useful commands that you were not aware of or a couple of optimization approaches you have not tried. You will also gain more insight into how the database works.\nPostgreSQL Performance Tuning Online Course Curriculum:\nUnderstanding PostgreSQL Server Architecture\nIn this section, we will explore the PostgreSQL Architecture.\nShared Buffers work in cooperation with the operating system cache, rather than replacing it. These caches improve performance by reducing the physical I/O necessary.\nWhy do we need to set Checkpoints carefully to limit crash recovery time, while not impacting the rest of the system's performance?\nThis section will give you all an introduction to why we need the WAL Writer and also the Background Writer.\nSee the stages that the Query Processor has to pass in order to obtain the results.\nThe utility Subsystem provides ways to maintain the database, such as claiming storage, updating statistics and logging.\nConfiguring Vacuum for Performance\nWe will understand why any time we do an UPDATE or DELETE, we will leave a dead row behind (and potentially a dead index entry) that needs to be cleaned up later by some form of vacuum.\nWe will learn that when tables grow very large because of excessive dead tuples then performance will tend to decrease. Therefore the VACUUM process should never be avoided.\nThis section explains why it's better to have a steady low-intensity vacuum work, using the autovacuum feature of the database, instead of disabling that feature and having to do that cleanup in larger blocks.\nHow to use an Index efficiently\nUnderstand that adding an index increase overhead every time you add or change rows in a table. Each index needs to satisfy enough queries to justify how much it costs to maintain.\nIn this section, we'll explain why the execution plan of a query depends on the data inside the table. If the data has low carnality, PostgreSQL will most probably ignore the index\nIn this section we'll learn why an index is only useful if it is selective; it can be used to only return a small portion of the rows in a table.\nIn this section, we will explore how to use bitmap scans effectively\nIndex Optimization Tips\nOn top of just using indexes, it is also possible to implement custom strategies for your particular application to speed things up\nHow to be able to answer queries by only using the data in an index using covering indexes.\nThis section covers why defining indexes on foreign keys it's a good practice.\nIn this section, we will explore partial indexes and how small, efficient index can be enjoyed.\nIndexes can require periodic rebuilding to return them to optimum performance, and clustering the underlying data against the index order can also help improve their speed for queries.\nWe'll explain when it's useful to modify the fill factor parameter of a table.\nIn this section, we will see in which cases it's better to use a combined index vs multiple independent indexes.\nMaking Use of Statistics\nIn this section, you'll explore statistics that can help you find and sort the queries that are responsible for most of the load on the system.\nPostgreSQL offers a large set of statistics. In this section, we'll make it easier to take advantage of their insights.\nWe'll get to see the fastest way to detect missing indexes but we'll also explore when it's necessary to drop indexes.\nSpotting Query Problems\nWe'll explain how to read query plans and understand how each of the underlying node types works.\nWe'll get to see how queries are executed as a series of nodes that each do a small task, such as fetching data aggregation or sorting.\nWe'll explore portions of the query that actually had the longest execution time, and see if they had an appropriate matching cost.\nThe variation between estimated and actual rows can cause major planning issues. We'll explore what we can do in such cases.\nQuery Optimizations Tips\nWe'll see why it's important to first question the semantic correctness of a statement before attacking the performance problem\nWe'll understand why we should avoid SELECT *, ORDER BY and DISTINCT unless we really need them and there is no other way\nWe'll explore PostgreSQL features such as CASE syntax and parallel queries to reduce time execution for queries\nHow to set shared_buffers for better performance\nWe will see that the PostgreSQL allocation for the default shared_buffers is extremely low and we need to increase it to allow proper shared memory size for the database.\nWe will cover how shared_buffers works in cooperation with operating system cache, rather than replacing it and we should size it as only a moderate percentage of total RAM.\nWe will understand that if we want to do better than allocating a percentage to the shared_buffers relative to the OS cache, we need to analyze the buffers cache content\nScaling and Replication\nWe'll see how replication can also be used to improve the performance of a software system by making it possible to distribute the load on several database servers.\nIn some cases, the functionality of replication provided by PostgreSQL isn't enough. There are third-party solutions that work around PostgreSQL, providing extra features, such as Pgpool-II which can work as a load balancer and Postgres-XL which implements a multi-server distributed database solution that can operate very large amounts of data and handle a huge load.",

      "description": "If you’re looking to develop practical, real-world data analytics & business intelligence skills and learn the foundations of database administration (DBA) and analysis, you’ve come to the right place.\n\n\nThis course is unlike anything you’ve seen before, guaranteed. We'll start from the ground up, teaching you the tools to get the job done, and most importantly how to you apply your skills to real projects and learn how to truly think like a Database Administrator.\n\n\nYou’ll be playing the role of a Database Administration Consultant for Maven Consulting, a firm that helps businesses create, maintain, and optimize their databases. Throughout the course, you’ll be working directly with the owners of various companies to help them manage data in their new and scaling enterprises. You will use the skills you learn to complete actual projects that database administration professionals work on every day.\n\n\nCOURSE OUTLINE:\n\n\nSQL Intro & MySQL Setup\nFor students who haven't completed one of our other SQL courses, we'll demonstrate exactly how to download and install the tools that we'll need to access MySQL, including MySQL Community Server & MySQL Workbench. We'll share download guides for both Mac & PC, and run our first piece of SQL code to generate the project database that we'll analyze throughout the course.\nCreating, Altering, and Deleting Schemas & Tables\nIn this section we'll learn how to create schemas and tables using SQL code and with the Workbench UI tools. Then, we will learn how to alter tables by adding and removing columns. Finally, we will walk through dropping schemas and tables (be careful with this one).\n\nInserting, Updating, and Deleting Records\nAfter we get up to speed creating and altering tables, we will learn how to populate those tables with records of data, and update and delete records as needed.\n\nDatabase Design\nNow that we have covered the basic mechanics, we will learn how tables relate to one another optimally, and discuss best practices for database design. We will explore the EER Diagram Editor, and you will have some opportunities to create your own database models.\n\n***MID-COURSE PROJECT: Normalize this database for your client!\n\nAdvanced Concepts\nIn this section, we will get into concepts like adding an index to a column, imposing constraints, and creating stored procedures and triggers. This is powerful stuff!\n\nServer & User Management\nIn our last section before the Final Project, we will learn how to monitor servers to make sure they are running, and how to restart them when needed. You will also get your hands on user management tools to assign roles and manage permissions, just like a real DBA.\n\n***FINAL COURSE PROJECT: Design and build an entire database from scratch!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This course does NOT cover data exploration and database analysis. Our goal here is to focus on building, altering, and maintaining SQL/MySQL databases using MySQL and MySQL Workbench (we cover data analysis in-depth in separate courses).\n______________________________\n\n\nEnroll today and get LIFETIME access to:\n7 hours of high-quality video\nDownloadable MySQL ebook and cheat sheets\nQuizzes and homework assignments\nMid-course and Final SQL projects\n30-day money-back guarantee\nIf you’re looking for a hands-on, practical guide to mastering database administration skills using SQL/MySQL, this is the course for you!\n\n\nHappy administering!\n-John (Lead SQL Instructor & MySQL Expert, Maven Analytics)\n\n\n__________\nLooking for our full course library? Search \"Maven Analytics\" to browse our full collection of Excel, Power BI, SQL, Tableau, Python, Alteryx & Machine Learning courses!\n\n\nSee why John is one of the TOP-RATED SQL/MySQL Instructors on Udemy:\n\"I totally loved this course! Everything was easy to understand, but it moved at a fast enough pace that I never got bored. I learned SO much about MySQL and had fun doing it. In fact, at the end of the day I didn't want to stop learning -- I wanted to keep charging on to the next lesson!\"\n- Ann S.\n\"This is an excellent advanced course! I've taken multiple SQL courses from Maven Analytics and recommend them all. The best part of this course is the detail they included by building a real world e-commerce database. It's much easier to grasp the concepts when you can see how they're literally applied to scenarios and outcomes as opposed to just theory. Great work!\"\n- Dan S.\n\"John's deep understanding of SQL and database analysis and ability to explain those tools is really unmatched. I've taken other SQL and MySQL courses and tried reading books, but this course is by far the most effective. Excited to see more courses from John!\"\n- Steven M.",

The VM used in the recording is backdated because of the expiry of the Software used.\nETL/ELT, buzz of Datawarehouse, Initial point and source for Reporting and Analytics, IBM Datastage is always in demand ETL tool used in many sectors to implement Business Requirement.\nThere are detailed explanation on the Architecture, Installation, Topology & 65 examples of Job Design using different stages to learn Datastage Designer and Director. Additionally, the course is filled with assignments & scenarios with free-data for practice.\nLet's parse that.\nIBM Datastage is one of the software in IBM Inforsphere Information Server Suite and is used in all major sectors not limited to Banking, HealthCare, LifeScience, Aerospace projects for data transformation and cleaning.\nBecause of its cool User Interface and ease of design, its easy to implement any requirement/scenario with limited background knowledge.\nThese 65 examples will help you trust Datastage. Each is self-contained, has its dsx code attached. Each example is simple, but not simplistic.\nWhat's Included:\nThe Big Ideas: Before we get to the how, we better understand the why - this course will help clarify why we even need ETL and Datastage.\nThe Little Details That Matter: Partitioning & Pipelining, Types of Jobs(Server,Parallel & Sequencer Jobs) and their differences, Deployment topologies (like Two tier, three Tier, Cluster & Grid). Concepts like these matter, this course will cover them.\nAditionally, the course focus on live requirement implementation & clarifications. Hence, we design 65 scenarios to understand the basic concepts of stages from Designer & Project setup from Web Console and Administrator.\nAlso, you are provided with Datastage 9.1 and Datastage 11.3 Virtual Machine where you can practice and explore the tool.\nUsing discussion forums\nPlease use the discussion forums on this course to engage with other students and to help each other out. Unfortunately, much as we would like to, it is not possible for me to respond to individual questions from students:-(\nI have worked with many consultancies on training Datastage and have literally seen students getting looted by them, in terms of money, time and training content and quality. And hence,I took over my course to Udemy to make it reachable to millions at an affordable price without worrying about the mediators.\nAlso, I have implemented the entire experience of 3 years of training to create a course, which is self understandable and covers all the concepts required to implement any simple to complex scenario on Datastage. And hence, the course comes with *MINIMAL Technical support over email or in-person*. The truth is, direct support is hugely expensive and just does not scale.\nWe understand that this is not ideal and that a lot of students might benefit from this additional support. Hiring resources for additional support would make our offering much more expensive, thus defeating our original purpose of delivering the course at a low cost. But we can definately use the discussion forum to help each other out. I can pitch in at times on certain scenarios if required.\nIt is a hard trade-off.\nThank you for your patience and understanding!\nWhat are the requirements?\nBasic knowledge of DB concepts like Joins (Left, Outer, Inner or Full) & Slowly Changing Dimension Concepts esp SCD Type 1 & 2.\nThe course cover the Virtual Machine set up of Datastage - no worries on that front as we have to simply use the Virtual Machine & Datastage is installed already!\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\nThe course explains the basic concepts and architecture of Datastage, sets the mandatory steps to follow to design the jobs to ensure minimal errors and warnings, use Datastage to Implement Business requirement using different stages, pick up the correct stage to create a best suitable job.\nIdentify what features are available in the stages that we can choose to implement a certain requirement to ensure limited stage usage and maximum output with accuracy.\n\n\nLastly, I would like to thank my colleague \"Sushmita Gaur\" in helping me create this Video.

      "description": "\"Completed my CCDH certification!!!\"\n\"I have just completed the CCDH certification last week. And i must say that this course helped me a great deal to master the Hadoop concepts and gain confidence in taking up this challenging exam.\nThe course is designed well and the Hadoop concepts explained in a very clear style which also made my learning fun. I would recommended this course for anyone wanting to take up the CCDH.\" -Glen\n=======================================================================\n\"Must have Course!!!\"\n\"Innovative way of teaching. I found this to be a lot of value packed into one single course! Instructor has really given his best to make you understand the topics. I would recommend this to everyone.\" - Abhijeet Garde\n=======================================================================\n\"Good course on hadoop for beginners!\"\n\"This is probably one of the best bang for the buck hadoop courses Ive taken and seen. Ive taken a few other quick free courses to get Hadoop and MapReduce from a different perspective and I always refer back to this course.\" -Brian Teusink\n=======================================================================\nObjective of this Course\nYou may start with no knowledge in Hadoop and this training will help you setup hadoop and learn hadoop and mapReduce programming to a level you can get ready to face certification exam from Cloudera: Cloudera Certified Hadoop Developer (CCD-410.)\nLearning hadoop is simple:\nLearning Hadoop is easy, all you need is a little help in the right direction. You can learn it at home by setting by a cluster on single machine and try your hands on advanced concepts at home and this course helps you do just that. In this course you will learn the fundamentals of hadoop with examples and pictorial explanations which are fast and easy to understand. With exam like practice quizzes, you will get ready to clear Cloudera and Hortonworks developer certification examination.\nThere are courses from a lot of companies which cost a fortune($2000 and upwards) for just 3 to 4 day training. This course is aimed to provide a less costly DIY pattern learning. One of the unique qualities of this course is that it helps you reach certification level expertise at fraction of the cost.\nWhy you should take this course?\nThings keep changing, and when in IT, you should know that the rule of the game is to understand the new wave and ride it when its there. This course would take down all the initial struggle that you might need to do to learn a complex technology and you'll be able to learn easily through video and through interacting with me.\nCalculate the Return On Investment (ROI) for this course. Knowledge, certification and higher pay-scales would remain with you forever, with just one time small investment.\nThis could be one of your best investment to brighten carrier opportunities\n.\nThis could open your doors to the most in demand IT jobs in the current times. Right now is the perfect time to enter the field of Big Data and whatever target you choose, to be hadoop developer or hadoop administrator or hadoop data scientist, the content of the course is fundamental to every carrier path and very necessary to reach the ultimate goal.\nWhat you will get from the course?\n1. High quality video content: The video content is filled with animations and pictorial representations so as to make your learning interesting, innovative, fast and easy.\n2. Code and Hands-on: All the students enrolled in this course install and run programs in map-reduce framework. Code of all the programs discussed is attached with the course. (10+ code examples).\n3. Quizzes: There are exam-like, interesting quiz questions at the end of each lesson to check the learning and to get you ready for the certification exams.\n4. Important Documents: A few important pdf document notes are attached with the lessons which help you to refer to when working on hadoop.\nFAQs\nThese general questions have been asked to me in the past.\nQues> By what time can I think of getting certified?\n> It would take you around 15-25 days time to complete the course as it involves setting up hadoop and some hands on exercises. At the end of the course there are exam like quiz questions which would test your readiness to face and clear the exam. Because the exam pattern keeps changing, I would highly recommend to go through Cloudera practice papers to be in perfect preparation for the exam.\nQues> Do you give exam dumps?\n> Nope. Sorry. This course would help you build understanding about Hadoop and thus prepare you for the exam. No dubious activities such as giving exam dumps are encouraged by this course.\nMore Information on Hadoop Certification\nFor more information on hadoop certification, search google for Cloudera CCD-410 and Hortonworks Certified Apache Hadoop 2.x Java Developer (HCAHD).\n=======================================================================\n\"Best Hadoop Training for Starters\"\n\"This is the best course which I have come across on Hadoop Training. Excellent teaching using slides in a way that anyone with zero knowledge can get along. This course is worth every cent.\nGreat work Nitesh. Thanks for coming up with this course.\" - Uzair\n=======================================================================",

      "description": "LEARN SQL WITH MySQL\nIn order to make intelligent business decisions you need the proper data. In order to get the proper data you will need to communicate with and query data within a database. This is where SQL comes into play. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's the language used to communicate with a database and more importantly the data needed to make intelligent decisions that will save time and money.\n\n\nWHY THIS COURSE\nThis SQL course starts with the absolute basic building blocks necessary to communicate effectively with any database. You'll learn how to query and manage a database using MySQL. MySQL is a free open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), used by many of the world's largest organizations.\nEach section of the course will focus on a key topic of working with SQL. The video lectures have been created so you can follow along as the instructor demonstrates each concept. At the end of each section you can test your understanding through a section quiz and exercise. Once you complete a section the next section will build on the topics of the previous section. This encourages your learning as you build upon the knowledge you learn as you move from one section to the next.\nThis course is not just a sit back and watch the instructor type on the screen kind of course. The lectures and course flow has been designed to  help you engage in the topic and participate by writing your own SQL. The TRUE LEARNING happens when you apply what you're learning and try it yourself.\nThe course also contains downloadable resources you can use away from the course as you continue to learn SQL. The QA board found within the course offers you the opportunity to ask questions and get answers from the instructor and interact with the other students enrolled in the course.\n\n\nCOURSE OBJECTIVES\nIn this SQL course you will learn the fundamental building blocks of creating, querying and working with databases using MySQL.\nLearn Proper SQL Syntax Using the MySQL Workbench\nLearn Relational Database Design Concepts\nUse the SQL SELECT Statement in Order to Query Data from a Database\nUse Column Alias to Give additional Context and Meaning to the Data\nLearn How to Filtering Database Query Results Using the SQL Where Clause\nCreate Advanced Queries by Using the Proper Filter Operators\nUse the SQL ORDER BY Keyword to Sort the Results of a Query\nLearn How to Properly Group Data and Create Calculations for Reporting\nUse the SQL HAVING Clause to Filter within Data Groups\nCreate a MySQL Database from Scratch\nLearn How to Create Tables and Manage Records within the Tables\nAnd Much More...\n\n\nWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR\nStart your SQL journey by enrolling now. See you in the course!",

Are You Ready to Master SQL and Take Your Database Skills to the Next Level?\n\n\nLet’s face it: SQL is one of the most in-demand, marketable skills today—and it's one that can seriously enhance your career. But here's the catch: learning SQL doesn’t have to be overwhelming, frustrating, or full of confusing jargon. What if you could learn SQL in bite-sized, manageable chunks—every single day—without all the tech overwhelm?\n\n\nIf you’re tired of hitting roadblocks in your database work, stuck in the Query Design window, or constantly relying on wizards to get anything done, it’s time to take control.

When we go online to make purchases, consume content, or share on social media, we are generating valuable data. Many of the largest tech companies are now operating on business models that depend on leveraging data. However none of that is possible without data integration. Data integration is the glue that makes it possible to convert raw data into a valuable asset.\nIn this course, I will focus on three types of data integration: Business-to-Business Integration, Application Integration, and Database Integration. You will learn how businesses exchange data using standard EDI, XML, and APIs. I’ll explain common communication methods like FTP and AS2. You’ll also learn about application integration approaches including SOAP, REST APIs, and Webhooks. And I’ll teach you about database integration technologies involving data warehouses, data lakes, streaming data, extract-transform-load processing, and data propagation techniques like replication.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have a solid understanding of how data integration can be used to improve business results. You will be knowledgeable about how these techniques are applied, and will be able to intelligently speak with software vendors, customers, suppliers or your internal IT department about data integration projects.",
