      "description": "I got a question for you\nWhat would it be like if you learn the scientific system to achieve targets faster and enjoy what you do?\nSo that you have more things done, more income and more free time without working for longer hours.\nI promise. It’s not what you think it is!\nI Will Show You Exactly How To Increase Your ABSOLUTE productivity, Enjoy More Freedom, And Quickly Achieve Extraordinary Results With This Proven, Step-By-Step System.\nHave you looked at your the list of things you need to do every morning and decide to do everything on your to-do list and realised that by the end of the day, you could hardly finish two or three items?\nDo you ever feel that instead of moving closer to your dreams, you’re merely in the same place even after weeks and months?\nOr maybe you feel overwhelmed, lost, unproductive, and burned out from trying to manage everything around you?\nDo you finally want to decide to focus rather than checking your email, Facebook and other social media?\nHave you ever felt like you were doing nothing but looking busy and you don’t want to feel that anymore?\nIf This Sounds Like You, I Have An Important Message For You Today: You Are Not Alone.\nHi, I am Mayur Bardolia, a coach and an author of 3 books and creator of best-selling video courses in the field of Leadership, Productivity, Communication, Management, Emotional Intelligence and Entrepreneurship.\nOver the years, I’ve trained close to 5,000 Sales Reps, Managers, College Students, Professionals, Business Owners, and many others – and almost everyone I’ve worked with struggles with the same problem:\n“How can I maximise my productivity and income without losing my free time – or my mind?”\nYou are going to find the answer here…\nBut before You find how to do, allow me to share my journey and how I dealt with this problem and how I got the solution that works every time.\n\n\nBelieve It Or Not, I’ve also been through the same experience…\nI used to work 70-80 hours a week…\nI used to feel like a loser.\nI just couldn’t get things done.\nAnd my life was going nowhere…I couldn’t spend more time with my family and friends.\nI was continually working but couldn’t see any result.\nI was always avoiding the things that I NEEDED to do.\nI was unable to bring my focus on to the tasks which were important to me. It happened so many times that I could not decide what to do.\nI ended up doing things I shouldn’t be doing just to look busy. I knew I was cheating myself but hey, I didn’t change because I couldn’t.\nThe unfinished tasks were piling up.\nI jumped from one motivational video to another just to get another dose of motivation.\nSadly, those things did not work longer.\nEvery night, I sleep with unfinished tasks and regret.\nI was crying inside because I was cheating myself. My self-esteem became weaker.\nI couldn’t act powerfully.\nAfter lying to myself consistently, I lost respect for myself.\nI was ready to take risks, but I just couldn’t get started.\nI wanted to know what I was doing wrong. I read countless books. I hired mentors and coaches. And as I learned more, I realised…\n\n\nThe surprising reason why most people can’t do what they want to do\nThe problem wasn’t that I didn’t have enough information about what to do. Such as running a business, writing a book, making more sales or hiring people.\nThe problem was that I had too much!\nI tried many time-management books, attended many seminars about success mindset and also hired many coaches to tell me how to be more productive.\nI wasted too much of money but learned nothing.\nInstead, the amount of information out there was paralysing me and causing massive overwhelm!. The problem is when you’re overwhelmed you will seek distractions subconsciously.\nWhen I focused instead on learning about how the very successfully managed to do it all – and still had time to enjoy life – I was finally able to identify the common threads and apply them to my own business.\nI finally started focusing on MASTERY vs Information Overload.\nOver the years, I’ve polished my system of boosting productivity and managing my time to science.\nAnd I’ve been able to teach it to others so they can replicate my results.\n\n\nHere’s What A Few Of My Students Have To Say About My Breakthrough Productivity System:\n“I was wasting my time. Each day, I was failing to keep my promises.  With the system Mayur has developed, I surprisingly achieved more results I could never dream to achieve. Mayur provided the solutions that enabled me to focus more and be more disciplined.” –  Ranjit Verma\n“I was struggling with the sales figure in my business.  I have now closed more deals in just one month than I closed in the last six months. I am sure that it’s going be extremely helpful to take my business to the next level.” – Vicky Turnball\n“After attending countless programs on productivity and time management, I finally found this program that helped me to get more things done consistently.\nI am enjoying what I do and can spend time with family and friends. It is the ultimate system to increase productivity.” – Liam Flees\n\n\nNow, Think About Your Perfect Day Of Work Would Look Like…\nYou wake up and finish your quick morning routine. You go to your computer and respond to the important emails.\nYou prepare your to-do list containing tasks that are important to you.\nBy the late afternoon, you have been focusing on relevant tasks only. So, almost all of your work is done.\nYou have quickly crossed each item off of your to-do list without stress, worry or effort.\nNow, that you have time to do anything you want. You can spend well-earned time with friends and family. You can enjoy your hobby.\nNow, at the end of the day, you can relax peacefully and without regret, because you had a fulfilling day.\n\n\nHere’s What’s going to happen to You……\nWhen you’ve learned to boost your productivity truly, you’ll be able to stop putting off your dreams and start living the life you’ve always wanted… Without worrying about looming deadlines and ever-growing to-do lists.\nInstead of putting off plans, endlessly running in circles, or getting buried by the weight of your workload, you can finish a full week’s work in 20 hours and spend the rest of your life having the experiences that matter most.\nIt may sound impossible. After all, we’ve all been conditioned to believe that the only path to success is constant, backbreaking work.\nBut this is how You too can live every day. And I want to help you achieve this kind of life for yourself.\n\n\nIntroducing Focus to Finish with Fun\nA proven Step by Step System to enjoy the work and to achieve goals quickly and maximising productivity without working for longer hours. So that you can create more profit and more time for yourselves and family.\nIn this program, you are going to learn to use your time more wisely and do things faster without losing focus and joy.\nWhy is this program far better than any other courses on productivity and time-management?\nThe answer: This course is focused on ‘Getting Results’. This course is not about mumbo-jumbo motivational lectures. This course is not about creating the success mindset. If those things would have worked, you probably already have got what you wanted.\nThis course is the result of an in-depth organised study of cognitive behaviour therapy, neuroscience and understanding how the brain works, animal training and game design; understanding the psychology of how game designers make their games compelling and make investing energy and work into making them something that’s fun. I tied these things together. I’m going to present that to you.\nNo other course is designed with such an organised study from various disciplines.\nAnd now I want to share them with you. No sugar coating. No academic theories. No BS. A just real world, tactical, hardcore strategies that work.\nThis course isn’t about just a theory. Along with all videos and audio modules, you will get a complete IMPLEMENTATION PLAN with each module so that you can immediately put things into action.\nThis implementation plan is so simple to follow that you will form a new habit, enjoy your work and see the results as an increase in your productivity even before you reach to the end of the program.\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is included in this course and how it is structured?\nThe course is in a video format where I am talking in front of a camera. It’s NOT a powerpoint narration. You will also get an audio recording so that you can listen to all modules while you are commuting. Along with videos and audios, you will get workbook along with each module. Each book includes the summary and complete action to assist you to put everything you learn in reality.\n\n\nWhat if I am already focused and productive?\nThis course is for serious entrepreneurs only. Since I started teaching this method, I’ve found there are certain types of people this program generally isn’t a good fit for. Even though this program can help anyone ends procrastination and double or triple their productivity, I don’t recommend you invest in it if you’re already self-driven, focused and productive.\n\n\nWhat if I don’t like to work on the system designed by someone else and love to work in my way?\nLet’s face it - some people are just attached to ‘their way’ of doing things. They have a hard time accepting that it’s probably the way they’ve always done things that got them where they are in the first place. Though I do my best to show how and why everything works the way it does. You’ll never believe that it works 100% until you experience the changes for yourself. And to do that, you’re going to have to temporarily set aside your ‘usual way’ and try some things you’ve never tried before. If you’re not willing or not able to do that, then this program probably isn’t for you…What I can promise is this: I will make it as easy as possible for you to implement the framework that you’re about to learn. I will guide you step by step through the process. I will give you every tool that’s helped me to enjoy what I do and get more things done without working for longer hours.\n\n\nHow will I get the product?\nOnce you complete the payment, you will be redirected to a page where you can access all modules.\nWill I get any assistance to learn?\nThis course is pre-recorded, and you can learn at your own pace. You can always message me if you have any query or need any assistance. I usually reply within 24-48 hours.\n\n\nWhat if I find this course rubbish and want my money back?\nI guarantee to provide 100% Ironclad Money-Back Guarantee. You can try The Course For 30 Days 100% Risk-Free. I want to make sure that you get the value that you pay for. If you decide to leave the course for any reason within the first 30 days, You will get refund the entire cost. No questions asked. Guaranteed. And we’ll still remain friends.  Either you get your full money back, or you become more productive and more profitable.  You’ve got nothing to lose!\n\n\nHow can I decide if I should buy this course or not?\nI strongly recommend you to give this program a try if You’ve struggled with procrastination now or in the past,  if you are ready to be the kind of self-directed, productive ‘action taker’ others look up to and if You are willing to take a chance and try some things you’ve never tried before.\n\n\n\nIt’s my ultimate guarantee that you will get more than you pay for. You have tried all the techniques and tools to deal with your problem of lack of motivation, fear, distraction and lack of focus.\nI value your time and money, that’s why I can help you to deal with the problems that are stopping you from taking more action.\nNow, it’s your time to take action.\nBest,\nMayur Bardolia\nP.S.

I use my planning and meditation techniques daily and the positive impact they have had on my life and my family relationships is awesome.

Psychiatrist, ADHD Specialist\n\n\n“ADHD meds and trying ideas from so many ADHD books were not changing my life enough. Luckily, my ADHD psychiatrist recommended Robert to me, and just three months later Robert has provided me with the tools and coaching support to dramatically increase my confidence, self-esteem, and productivity – not to mention growing my small business. He has helped me follow-through on creating new ways and changing old ways, of living a more effective and fulfilling life.\nFor the first time in my life, I feel I’m running at my ADHD, not from it, maximizing the parts that a huge advantage, and mitigating or eliminating the parts that were keeping me from feeling and being successful.\n— Mike Crum, Principal, Crum Group\n\n\n\"I’ve worked with numerous healthcare practitioners, therapists, and coaches to try to overcome my ADHD, but none were able to help me successfully. However, several months ago, I was fortunate enough to be introduced to Robert.  With his guidance and support, I’ve finally been able to take control of my ADHD. I’m able to function and remain productive without the aid of medication, which is the greatest gift anyone could have given me. I appreciate Robert deeply, and I feel that I owe him a great debt for helping me when no one else could ”\n— Marc R. New York, NY\n“Robert’s skill and expertise enabled him to evaluate my needs and connect me to tools and actions that helped me not only rediscover my dreams, but to start to believe I could achieve them. His guidance and support continues to help me build faith and trust in my strengths and abilities, enabling me to take the necessary steps to make my dreams a reality ”\n— Shelly Logan, OCT, NZCT, London, Ontario",

After getting a degree in Business and Entrepreneurship from the #1 Entrepreneurship program in the US at the time, I realized I still knew very little about how to actually create a successful business, write a book, change the world, or do anything else on my list of dreams.\nI had to figure it out on my own with the help of thousands of books, hundreds of seminars and workshops, and over a decade of experiencing running my own businesses, and writing and publishing books.\nTen years later, I'm now a bestselling author of more than twenty books and run a few very successful lifestyle businesses from the comfort of my home.\nOver the years I've struggled with every obstacle you've undoubtedly faced: fear, procrastination, self-doubt, ignorance, boredom, anxiety (lots of anxiety!), negative friends and family, unsupportive and dysfunctional relationships, a nagging fear of what others might think of me, and much more.\nThe good news is that because of all these challenges, I've been able to learn some truly valuable lessons on how to the overcome adversity and roadblocks (both internal and external) that stop most creative people from getting their most important and meaningful work done.\nHere's what you'll learn in this course:\nThe truth about creativity that most of us have been brainwashed to ignore, and how understanding this one simple truth can turn anyone into a creative genius.\nHow to get truly focused on what's most important to you (even if your friends all think you're a flaky multi-tasker who can't seem to focus for a minute).\nHow to come up with \"big ideas\" regularly and automatically (and how to make sure you actually implement your big ideas to make the world a better place).\nAnd much more!\nScroll up and click \"Take This Course\" to get started and Unleash Your Creative Genius today!",

The section also offers practical ways to improve each skill and explains why these soft skills are so important to employers.\nThe second section features a lecture on critical reading strategies. Even if you're not a student, this section will help you as you review reports, utilize research and facts sheets, and prepare proposals in the workplace. Ultimately, you don't want to waste time reading--and this lecture will help you find practical strategies to help you make the best use of your time reading.\nLastly, you'll find a section on logical fallacies. I included this because if you can't recognize faulty approaches to arguing, you will never be a true critical thinker or critical reader. You'll recognize these fallacies in everything you read, in speeches you hear, and in marketing and advertising efforts after you review this section. You'll be able to make much better decisions if you can recognize and argue against these 14 primary logical fallacies.\nReady to dig in and become a more critical thinker, a better decision maker, and a more thoughtful problem solver? Let's get started.\nBe sure to check out other courses on soft skills and workplace improvement by Bethany Wallace on Udemy.",

      "description": "Fighting Social Media addiction?\n\nSocial Media addiction is real.\nBy reducing your social media use you will:\nGain productivity\nReduce mental health struggles (depression, anxiety, etc.)\nFeel less shame and embarrassment\nGain better, real life relationships with those who mean the most to you\nThis is the most comprehensive course on fighting social media addiction on Udemy! Whether you are using social media for hours each day or maybe you just want to be more productive in general, this is the course for you!\nLearning how to manage your social media use is not easy. This course will walk you through each step, day-by-day, week-by-week. Following each step laid out in the course will give you the confidence you'll need to be healthier physically, mentally, and socially.\nI am quite confident that this is the most direct program you will find that targets social media addiction. Traditional rehab centers do not focus specially on social media addictions but rather overall behavioral addictions (social media addiction needs to be treated differently.)\nWhile other addictions require a \"quit date,\" social media addiction should not.  The goal is not to eliminate social media altogether but rather retrain your brain to think and behave differently when dealing with social media.\nYou can save a ton of money by taking courses for addiction online. Traditional rehab for behavioral addictions cost thousands of dollars.  Being able to take a course online in the privacy of your own home, is not only a powerful way to beat your addiction but a huge cost savings measure as well.\nIf you add in the flexibility, ease and ability to be in control you will find great success. You can truly overcome your addiction.\nThis course gives you weekly tasks devoted to your physical, psychological, and social health as well as tasks specifically related to reducing your social media use.\nMost of what you read online will only give you a baseline knowledge of social media addiction and fails to dig in deep to specifically outline things you can do each week for great success. I can confidentially say this course goes deep into specifics so that your brain can return back to its original baseline prior to your social media addiction.\nThere are four sections, each representing one week. Each week I talk about what you can do physically, psychologically, socially and specifically social media related.\nYou will receive ongoing instructor support via the Q&A as well as monthly emails that focus on addiction related topics.\nYou will get lifetime access to this course and it will be updated as things change with social media.\nSo what are you waiting for? Kick that social media addiction for good and move on to a healthier mind and body! Enroll today!\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Is this course only for people who struggle with social media addiction?\nA: While this course was primarily written for people who struggle with social media addiction other people can benefit from taking this course such as family members who are worried about a love one or addiction counselors who want more knowledge and insight on addiction and recovery\nQ: How is it possible to recover from an addiction online? Don't I need a 12-step program or in-patient rehab?\nA: 12 step programs are outdated and their success rates are shockingly low. Not everyone is cut out for rehab and can just leave their family, friends, kids, pets, work, school, etc. The material in this course will give you the tools you need to be successful in fighting an addiction, however, you will need to find the motivation within so you can apply the concepts you will learn.\nThere is so much stigma around addiction as it is let alone around something that even though millions of people face, it's not traditionally characterized as what society would deep a true addiction. But society is wrong and just by being here today, you are showing courage, strength and willingness to rise above so that you can achieve great success that isn't clouded by what you are seeing everyday online.\nThis course includes a series of assignments, quizzes, downloadable resources, external links to certain topics related to addiction and recovery and also links to 12 podcasts.\nUpon completing the final lecture, you will receive a certificate of completion.\nI look forward to seeing your progress and again, if you have any questions before enrolling please let me know. I'm always happy to help.",

Is this making you feel overwhelmed, always trying to do everything and then accomplish nothing?\nIn this letter, I’m going to reveal to you one of the best ways to step on the treacherous path of achieving more by working less.\nBut before I do that, let me introduce myself.\nI'm Bogdan Vaida, a former stressed, full time busy person turned stress-free time management trainer.\nStarting from university (though I had some symptoms before), I suffered from what I now call unbalanced Kime. (Kime is a Japanese word which in karate means focus).\nI had trouble staying focused and keeping my projects on track. No matter what the projects were, I kept abandoning them. When I was little, I tried doing sports. I started tennis, judo, karate and basketball… everything .. for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks it was like I had an internal clock that told me STOP!, let it be.\nProcrastination was my worst enemy .. I always procrastinated. I remember trying to go to the gym (motivated by my girlfriend to get rid of some nasty body fat). Success!! I was able to go for .. 1 month (basically I doubled my results)..\n.. only to postpone it for the rest of the year\n.. until my membership card finally expired.\nI was never a patient person, whenever I started some new project I was very enthusiastic .. but somehow, once my enthusiasm went away .. so did my results.\nAfter leaving college after a first college semester where, interestingly enough, I had aced all exams that I was really into but failed all the others (dem’ mathematics). I realised this had to change.\nI started reading some time management books, applying some of the things I learned in my life..\nWell .. it wasn’t that bad .. but I had to read a lot and very few techniques applied for my particular situation.\nSo .. read more I told myself.\nI immersed myself into everything productivity related. I participated in forums, seminars and even took some coaching lessons.\nSuddenly, my life was becoming enjoyable again. I entered another college (keeping my scholarship to my final year), took dancing classes, 2 jobs and I even had the luxury of free time.\nAfter passing through hundreds of techniques, I realized what was working for me. I adapted the generic things I learned about on the internet and I personalized them into techniques that gave results.\nThen I shared these with Dan, one of my friends waiting for his big heartfelt ;thank you’..\nBut no, the techniques didn’t work for him!\nI’ve spent days trying to help him but what I shared with him was actually what was working for me.\nAnd then I got it!\nI needed to fine tune each technique for the specific person who was using it. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution!\nSo I took all that I learned and developed a system that was fine-tuning these somehow “generic” techniques to the specific person that’s using them, an expert matchmaking system.\n.. 10 years later:\nI offer busy people the opportunity to find free time and to create a balance between their personal and professional life. I do this by teaching productivity principles and techniques specific to their personality using experiential methods.\nI am the founder of the most prominent time management resource in Eastern Europe and author of The Ultimate Time Management Guide For Workaholics.\nFor the last 8 years I’ve been traveling around the world holding trainings where I’ve created environments for people to learn through doing. I’ve held trainings in Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and a few other Eastern European countries and my online courses have over 7000 happy students.\nDuring all these years I came to identify 4 productivity bottlenecks that prevent people from developing focused productivity and achieving their goals. I noticed that once people can put their finger on the issue, the solution comes naturally to them and they keep applying it until the bottleneck disappears.\nLet me prove my point here.\nWhen you have trouble staying focused and keeping your projects on track,\nAnd when procrastination is your worst enemy and your internal alarm clock buzzes 5 minutes before the deadline..\nYou suffer from unbalanced Kime. (Kime is a Japanese word which in karate means focus).\nWe usually have some techniques to help alleviate the problem. One of the most successful ones is having a 25-minute interval of focused, productive work, followed by a 5 minute break. This starts the process of educating your brain to accept a specific interval of time as *work* time.\nBut there’s almost always a larger issue behind your unbalanced Kime and if you’re not going to correct it, it will get from worse to worst.\nYou need to solve this before your whole life goes out of balance. I know so many people that had unbalanced Kime and in my early days as a trainer I must confess, I had quite a bit of trouble helping them. I spent days and nights to try and figure out a solution. And found it I did!\nNext comes The Zen Curse.\nThe Zen Curse is exactly that. A curse that prevents you from reaching your zen state.\nYou crave patience and having time to sit and breathe but somehow things happen and you never find time for it. You are anxious and in a hurry and life tries to overthrow your plans and send you in disarray. Unexpected situations appear and it’s so hard to slow down and take a breath ..\nBeing in a hurry all of the time is one of the worst conditions us as humans find ourselves in. It impacts both our bodies and our minds. Stress is evil! And learning how to be patient and get rid of all the “bad” feelings that come from the inevitability of fate is hard .. dem’ hard.\nWhen you look at that empty calendar you’re not actually looking at free time. In fact, you are looking at occupied time that you have yet to identify. An empty calendar is actually a full day.\nThe Zen Curse is a state most of us go through from time to time.\nAnd we usually have some techniques to help mitigate the problem. One of the most common ones is meditation. And you may think meditation, pfah!, tried it and it doesn’t work for me. I tried it too, for 3 years, before I got the specific meditation type that I could work with. The trick was to start so easy that my brain wouldn’t be able to find an excuse to stop it. I tried it for 5 minutes a day. 5 minutes, anybody can do that! And now I’m doing it for half an hour, daily!\nBut meditation only mitigates your problem and you need to fight the issue behind the issue, so to speak.\nThen comes The Habit Cracker. This is the state where you strive to develop long lasting habits but things happen, disruptions appear and you forfeit those habits. Maybe you don’t even remember when you abandoned them.\nSome habits.. you stick with .. for some time, then you skip those one or two days at the gym, then, a week .. and one year later, you find that gym membership card discarded in that dark corner of our closet.\nBeing unable to stick to your habits may even give you the feeling that you shouldn’t even start them. And so the days go by and you forfeit the chance for exercising, meditating or working on your project.\nAn effective technique to mitigate The Habit Cracker is habit linking. That is creating a habit that follows an already established habit. For example, if you want to drink a glass of water each morning, take your toothbrush and put it in a water glass, instead of its usual place. Each morning, you’ll see the water glass when you take your toothbrush and you’ll know what to do.\nThis technique alleviates your situation but it hardly fixes it. Developing long lasting habits takes more time to do .. but it’s achievable. One of the 2 techniques is mentioned later in the letter.\nAnd the last productivity bottleneck is Funambulism.\nFunam..’what? Funambulism, also known as tightrope walking.\nYou go through your life stepping on a tightrope and if you take a step a bit to the left, there go your professional achievements .. you take a step to the right .. your spouse starts the family melodrama.\nIt is the situation where you strive for work / life balance but the rope is thin and your comfort lacking. Where you find that life doesn’t let you prioritise, where situations pop up and disrupt you. Where you don’t know what will happen next.\nBut enough information. How can we fix these 4 bottlenecks?\n4 years ago, I launched a series of online lessons that helps busy busy people de-stress by taking control over their life using techniques specific to their personality. It is the the fastest growing online course in time management, currently taught to over 1538 students over six continents.\nThis is not a traditional training. I will not be showing you techniques that I got off the internet, which might prove to be useful or not.\nFrom the very first day, you’ll discover new methods and modern techniques, such as “The Pyramid Technique” (which will clarify the road you want to walk on and what you want to do with your future) and “Constructive Postponement” (a less known technique with will “swap” the stress in your mind with a state of creativity and productivity).\nIntroducing the online course The Secrets of Time:\nI. The beginner’s guide\nThey say you know a book is good after you’ve read its first page. I’ve applied this same mentality for this course.\n- In “The beginner’s guide” you discover some quick tricks that have immediate results. The entire concept of the course and how it can offer you tangible results from the very beginning will be explained to you.\n- Together, we will find out what your main issues are and you will make the first steps to get rid of them\n- In this module, you’ll have the first complete system to help you organize yourself on a daily basis and I will show you, in practice, how easy it is to use from the very beginning.\n- You’ll also find out what my mentality was when I decided to lose 24 pounds, to broaden my circle of friends and how I got to teaching others to win their war on time.\nII. The mentality of a winner\nDid you know that only one hour of your day is truly productive? Find out which one in the second module, also called “The mentality of a winner”. It’s called as such because, in this module, you will acquire the mentality of an entrepreneur (which prevents the continuous postponement of tasks through a counterintuitive technique).\n- In this module I will tell you what mentality successful people have when they make their first step, so that you never get stuck in any way.\n- Together, we will find out what your main issues are and what first steps to make to get rid them.\n- You will also find out how to transform “wasted time” into “saved time” (this technique alone gave me the time I needed to study over 300 materials, time I never thought I had!)\n- I will also tell you about my secret habit, which bothers many people, but helps me make the right choices and keep stress away!\nIII. Instant self-motivation!\nDo you have motivation but don’t have results? This module is strictly on this topic! We won’t give up until we succeed, right?\n- In this module you’ll find out what are the 2 factors that keep you from making that first step and how you can get rid of them in order to get started.\n- I will also reveal  3 practical techniques to reduce the impact of the dependencies that consume your time\n- I will also offer you another complete time management system, which helped me throughout the years (and I will also show you a demo video). I’ve constantly improved this system and used it to work on 9 projects at the same time and I’m sure you can also adapt it to your needs.\n- Finally, I’ll show you a self-motivation technique which, if properly used, can rid you once and for all of procrastinating unpleasant tasks.\nIV. Fight against procrastination\nWhy do you keep abandoning projects?\nHave you ever asked yourself that? Did you find out why? I guess not.\nIn 2009 I was asked this question for the very first time and I did not know how to answer it. I was a trainer, not a psychologist.\nBut I promised to come up with an answer. I read intensely, I spoke with psychotherapists and contacted international trainers who were specialized in behavioral changes. In the end, I found the answer and I can’t wait to reveal it to you. It’s a very small change that will instantly make you go “AHA!”. Then you’ll ask yourself (as I did back then) why you haven’t thought about it until now!\n- When you get here you’ll discover how much you can achieve if you rephrase your tasks\n- You always hear: “focus on results”, but now you’ll become the person who achieves those results!\n- Find out what the main reasons why we’re stressed are and what techniques you can apply to get rid of each type of stress\n- Do you have a tendency to procrastinate on certain tasks? Find out how to immediately identify them and finish them on the same day!\n- Identify the tasks that must be postponed so that you can focus on your goals\n- By the end, you’ll understand an advanced technique to keep up with your tasks when you have a lot on your hands (and still some more coming your way).\nV. How to focus on your priorities regardless of interruptions\nYou have the mentality and the motivation and you don’t back away from anything. You’ve already had your first results and, from now on, I’ll make sure those results take you towards your chosen goal.\nDo you like to be a winner, but you always seem to come in second?\nNot after this training!\nFight against laziness and apathy, double your productivity, get over the obstacles in your way and aim for success!!!\n- In this module you’ll discover and stick with the techniques that truly suit you.\n- Together, we will find out what your main issues are and what first steps to make to get rid of them\n- I’ve had a cook, someone to clean around the house and an assistant ever since I got first job. Hiring these people is cheaper than you think and, in this module, I’ll prove it to you!\n- Are you working late? Do you mix your personal and professional tasks? After this module you’ll manage to keep a balance between your personal and professional lives!\n- Have you ever made choices that you later regretted? Have you ever chosen money over your family or perhaps family over money even though, when you made the choice, everything seemed clear? Find out how to avoid the trap of the big decisions in your life!\nVI. Vision – plan your objectives so that you can easily fulfill them\nThis is one of the most important modules that you need.\n- In this module we’ll focus on how to visualize your own future and how you can make it come true. I focused a lot on this aspect of my life, I’ve learnt from people who started from 0 and were successful and now you’ll also be able  to aim high and get there!\n- This module is not a motivational one; you’ll actually uncover  how to get to the top of the pyramid, how to make your dreams come true and how to steer through life’s turbulent waves\n- Here you will discover  the international technique with the help of which successful and very busy people from around the world organize their lives. Find out how stars such as Oprah Winfrey, Will Smith and Tom Cruise save time and how you can apply their experience to your life.\nCalin Iepure, entrepreneur and consultant in business strategy, moderator of Business Days and facilitator for the Bootcamp University was very enthusiastic after he went through the course:\n\"Hello! I’m Calin Iepure. I met Bogdan Vaida some 4 years ago during the weekly meetings of Timisoara Toastmasters. Since then I was introduced to his educational programs and I’ve seen how they make our life, my life and yours and the life of those who participate in them, a lot better. With their help I managed to better organize my time and become more productive. If you, right now, are interested in personal development, want to increase your productivity and motivation, I strongly recommend Bogdan’s online courses.\"\nMihnea Popescu, manager at Atos International knows me personally from one of the live trainings this course is based on.\n\"Hello, my name is Mihnea Popescu and I live in Timisoara, where I had the opportunity to meet Bogdan Vaida. I also participated in some of his courses. I am very glad that I did. At the beginning I was a bit skeptical about the perspectives he presented, because I was used to a completely different lifestyle. I was determined to believe in him blindly at the start and to continue to do so if I had results. In doing so, I applied his advice and techniques and I realized I had incredible results. I asked myself “what’s happening?” I continued to listen to him and apply what he said, even though I sometimes disagreed and thought it wasn’t suited for me. Gradually, I started to understand that there were certain perspectives that I would never have thought about. Participating in his courses helped me a great deal. I recommend them to you and in the end you’ll see how happy you are you’ve been part of them.”\nThis is a course that pays for itself because what you learn here will give you more time and time can be transformed into money; imagine spending your time working hard but not effectively while you could win back time by discovering effective productivity principles from this product\nThis course has been taken by people from multiple parts of life from busy CEOs that continuously missed family dinners to Andreea, a single mom who tried to balance day to day priorities between her child and her job to get 2 hours of sleep per night.\n\nI guarantee results from the very first day\n.. due to a special bonus called The Beginner's Guide. In it, I've amassed the most practical and intuitive techniques, voted by the participants of the course. They are easy to apply and provide you with the free time you need to continue with the rest of the course.\nBut we won't stop there. After the first week, you'll learn the counterintuitive technique of Continuous Postponement (told you it sounded counterintuitive) which frees your calendar, allowing you to destress and finally return to feeling like a human being (remember your childhood years when you had plenty of the special commodity called time?).\nOnly the first material of the guide (and the course has 28 such materials) will be enough to change your view of time so that you can focus on the rest of the content in peace.\nApart from these bonuses, there’s something else I want to offer you: interactivity and materials tailored after your needs.\n\nSeeing the answers to my surveys, I learned that my students need to communicate with their trainer. Therefore, in this course I have taken interactivity to a completely different level!\nApart from communicating privately and answering all of your questions, I have built this course so that I can provide new materials based on the needs of my students. In other words, apart from what I promised to offer in the course, I will add materials based on your questions!\nIt takes 10 minutes to watch a video and your full day to (unconsciously) apply what you've learned. 10 minutes a day, a lifetime feeling its effects!\nNow, what is it going to cost to not own this? You've heard my offer... I have expressed the value to you. I hope you feel like you can trust me. I've shown you exactly what's going to happen when you decide to give it a chance today. Remember that you have your 30-day guarantee. You're fully protected. All the risk is on me. If you're still wondering about this, let's just consider that right now you're standing at a crossroads and there are two paths. One of the paths takes you down the road I've just laid out for you where all these great things happen. Thirty days from now you'll feel like a different person, a stress free person with time to do anything you want or you can just stay on the road you're on right now and continue to experience the same frustration of not having enough time to do anything!\n\nGet inside, double your productivity, live a stress free life and always have time to accomplish your dreams.",

Eğitim süresince, grup olmanın aşamaları, takım çalışması ile ilgili engeller, takım içindeki güven faktörleri ve liderliğin dönüşümü gibi başlıklar üzerinde derinlemesine fikir alışverişinde bulunduk. Her bir modül, katılımcılara hem bilgi edinme hem de uygulama yapma fırsatı sundu. Ayrıca, eğitim boyunca öğrendiğimiz konuları gerçek hayatla ilişkilendirme şansımız oldu.\nLiderlik Becerilerinin Önemi\nLiderlik stilleri ve etkileri\nLiderlik eğitimi, farklı liderlik stillerinin etkilerini anlamak açısından kritik öneme sahip. Eğitim esnasında, demokratik, otoriter ve laissez-faire gibi çeşitli liderlik tarzlarının avantajlarını ve dezavantajlarını detaylı bir şekilde öğrenme şansı yakaladık. Her bir stilin takım üzerindeki etkileri, grup içindeki rol dağılımı ve motivasyon üzerindeki etkileri inceleme fırsatım oldu.\nBaşarılı liderlik özellikleri\nBaşarılı bir liderin sahip olması gereken özellikler arasında güçlü bir iletişim becerisi, empati, esneklik ve karar verme yeteneği bulunuyor. Bu özellikleri geliştirmek için eğitimde çeşitli aktif katılım faaliyetleri yaparak bu becerilerimi gözlemleyip geliştirmeye çalıştım. Özellikle, takım üyelerinin güçlü yönlerini fark etmek ve bunlardan nasıl faydalanacağını bilmek, liderlikte önemli bir yere sahip.\nTakım üzerindeki liderlik etkisi\nLiderliğin bir grup üzerindeki etkisini doğrudan deneyimlediğim anlar oldu.

Bu süreçte, ekibimin motivasyonunu artırmak için geliştirdiğim stratejilerin sonuçlarını gözlemlemek avantajını yaşadım. Üzerimde ciddi bir etki yaratan bu deneyim, liderlik becerilerimi daha da pekiştirdi.\nTakım Dinamikleri ve İş Birliği\nTakım çalışmasının avantajları\nTakım çalışmalarının avantajları, bireysel çaba ile elde edilemeyecek sonuçlar edinmeyi mümkün kılmaktadır. Eğitim süresince, iş birliğinin getirdiği sinerjinin ne denli önemli olduğunu öğrendim. Takımların birlikte çalışırken ortaya koyduğu yaratıcılık ve farklı bakış açıları, herhangi bir projeye ciddi katkılar sağlıyor.\nEtkili iletişim teknikleri\nEtkili iletişimin nasıl kurulacağı üzerine birçok teknik öğrettiler. Eğitimde öğrendiğim iletişim becerileri, grup içindeki dinamiklerin daha sağlıklı bir şekilde yönetilmesine olanak tanıdı.

Eğitim süresince, takımların karşılaştığı olası zorluklar üzerinde durulup, bu engelleri aşmak için geliştirilebilecek stratejiler üzerinde yoğunlaştık. Kendi deneyimimden bir örnek vermek gerekirse, basit bir iletişim sorununu çözmek için uyguladığımız yöntemle takımın çalışma verimliliği büyük oranda arttı.\nEğitimden Elde Edilen Kazanımlar\nKişisel ve mesleki gelişim fırsatları\nEğitimin pek çok fırsatı beraberinde getirdiğini söyleyebilirim. Kendi becerilerimi geliştirmenin yanı sıra, farklı sektörlerden katılımcılarla tanışmak ve onların deneyimlerini dinlemek benim için çok öğretici oldu. Oturumlar sırasında duyduğum geri dönüşler, kendi profesyonel gelişimime ışık tuttu.\nSertifikaların kariyere katkısı\nProgram sonunda edindiğim sertifika, kariyerimde önemli bir ayrım yarattı. Eğitimde öğrendiğim bilgileri, günlük iş yaşamımda etkin bir şekilde kullanarak ilerlemek benim için oldukça motivasyon artırıcı oldu. Herkese bu tür sertifikaların önemini vurgulamak isterim; çünkü bu belgeler, bireylerin profesyonel sıralardaki konumlarını güçlendirmektedir.\nEğitim sonrası uygulama alanları\nEğitimden sonra, öğrendiklerimi uygulama alanı bulduğum birçok fırsatla karşılaştım. Proje yönetimi yaptığım bir dönemde, eğitimde öğrendiğim liderlik becerilerini ve takım çalışması tekniklerini kullanarak başarılı sonuçlar elde ettim. Bu tür uygulamalar, eğitimde kazandığım bilgilerin pratikte ne denli etkili olabileceğini gösterdi.\nFAQs\nLiderlik ve Takım Çalışması Eğitimi Kursunun getirileri nelerdir?\nBu eğitim, bireylere liderlik becerileri kazandırmanın yanı sıra takım çalışmasını ve iş birliğini pekiştirir.

      "description": "Since Darwin's day, scientists have had a hard time pinpointing exactly what it is that distinguishes our species from other animals. There are two widely held beliefs, but neither one seems to have a great deal in the way of supporting evidence. One school of thought holds that the human mind was molded through the course of evolutionary time and may be traced back to its roots in the past. The counterargument to the traditional view of humans is that we are a cultural species that progressively develops human characteristics throughout the course of our history.\nThe Strategy That Is Mainly Motivated by Evolutionary Psychology\nPeople who adhere to the evolutionary psychology school of thought believe that people in all different kinds of societies behave in much the same way, and they point to the influence of genetics as the primary reason for explaining why this is the case when attempting to explain why people behave in this manner. Men, in comparison to women, are more ready to take risks, more physically aggressive, and more interested, for instance, in having casual sexual encounters. In addition, men are more likely to engage in sexual experiences with several partners. Additionally, men are more likely to participate in sexual encounters that are not intimate than women are. In a similar vein, jealousy is a big factor in the majority of spousal killings committed all over the world, and young people are seen as having the highest sexual appeal.\nThese premises make perfect sense when seen from the point of view of observation, which is the viewpoint we will be using. [Note: Keeping track of them is likely to be one of the more difficult aspects of this project. Researchers in the field of evolutionary psychology postulated that over the course of our species' more than two million years of existence, we gradually became adapted to a hunter-gatherer way of life, which favored the kinds of behavioral and psychological characteristics that are being discussed in this article. These characteristics include hunting and gathering for a living, as well as a social orientation that prioritizes cooperation over competition. This was shown by the fact that this style of living encouraged the development of features similar to those that are being addressed in this article. Natural selection was more likely to choose the genes that enhanced our odds of having traits like these because they raised our chances of having those genes.\nThe study of developmental genetics, on the other hand, has shown that this theory is not supported by the data since genes cannot include instructions for behavior or psychology.\nIt is essential to keep in mind that the environment, including the climate, the economics of sustenance, and the social structure of the environment, have all gone through significant shifts on multiple occasions over the course of the past two million years. These shifts may have occurred independently or in conjunction with one another. This is one of the most essential points that must be had in mind at all times. In addition, ancient people had drastically different body proportions, brain sizes, anatomies, and thermal physiologies. They also reproduced in a completely different fashion and had a more complicated social structure than we have now.\nThe term \"human\" may be used to refer to a broad range of distinct species, including Australopiths (commonly referred to as \"ape men,\" such as the fossil Lucy), Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Homo sapiens, and the countless extinct species that are now being uncovered. The \"environment of evolutionary adaptedness\" is a misconception due to the fact that different species have been subjected to a range of different environments throughout the course of their existence.\nCultural determinists define humans in terms of the knowledge that is obtained during the course of an individual's lifetime through the process of social learning. In contrast to evolutionary psychologists, who focus on purported adaptations to circumstances that existed in the past, cultural determinists define humans in terms of the knowledge that is obtained during the course of an individual's lifetime. To put it another way, understanding human beings requires taking into account the social learning that takes place over the course of an individual's whole existence.\nMethods That Take Into Consideration Each and Every Culture\nAccording to the cultural determinism hypothesis, the things that shape who we are are not the things that have happened to us in our families but rather the things that we have adopted as members of the various communities in which we have participated. In other words, the things that have made us who we are are not the things that have made us who our families are. There are a lot of examples; some of them include different languages, faiths, ways to make a living, and the skill of making different kinds of tools. This method of defining humanity is similarly fraught with problems to a comparable extent as the previous one.\nWhat does it mean to have knowledge if that information can only be gained by engagement with other people such that it can define us? Is it the answer that is provided verbally to a certain question that is included on a form, such as \"I agree to sexual activity before marriage\" as an example? Or does it take into consideration the changes that occur in the neurons of our brains as a direct consequence of the information that is taken in by us? Or is it a collection of data that has the potential to be reproduced in a large number of identical copies? The phenomenon has not been able to be defined in a way that is acceptable to the vast majority of people, and theorists have not been successful in doing so.\nTo state the obvious, humans are not the only species capable of developing social skills via engagement with the company of other people. In point of fact, it is quite plausible that all social vertebrates are endowed with the capacity for social learning.\nIt is quite likely that this is the reason why anthropologists feel that the accumulative nature of human social learning is the feature that most distinguishes humans from other animals.\nThe argument that is being made here is that it is difficult for a single person to fully comprehend the massive volumes of knowledge that are present in human society as a whole. The fact that we are currently living in an information age in which the amount of data is rising at a remarkable speed, whereas in the past this was not the case, is a point that drives home the point that this argument is being made to make. This argument is being made to make the point that we are currently living in an information age in which the amount of data is rising at a remarkable speed.",

There have been stories of miracles throughout history. We even have evidence in the form of the Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, Göbekli Tepe, Machu Picchu, and other examples of construction that we are unable to replicate today. One of the things I have always been fascinated with is the power of the mind.  Many cultures around the world have described people with great abilities. Most of these cultures and their secrets are long buried.  Only the ones that survived in isolation for centuries have been able to keep these traditions alive. One of these nations is the Hawaiians.\nMax Freedom Long discovered the power of Huna in the early 1900s and wrote several books about what he had learned. The Hawaiians were able to cure diseases and see the future, and change it all with the help of these techniques. Max experienced this personally when he sought help from a kahuna. I studied with a traditional Hawaiian kahuna on the Big Island of Hawaii in the 1980s.\nThis course explains how modern science is beginning to understand how the Hawaiians manipulated their brain waves and used brain wave awareness to perform what appeared to be miracles. The similarities between the Indigenous peoples of North America and Hawaii are not coincidental. Our legends speak of the brotherhood between our people, and our legends and cultural practices reflect this as well. This course shares some of these cultural similarities that relate to brain wave manipulation.\nYou'll learn about the inner personas, the fear feeders, how brain waves correspond to our different stages of development as we grow, and how we can work with this knowledge to improve our lives. You'll see how brain wave awareness can improve your memory and your ability to learn. You'll be able to monitor your brain waves without expensive medical equipment and learn how to work with this brain wave awareness to live your life to your fullest potential.",

      "description": "WANT TO GET MORE DONE IN LESS TIME?\nNo matter who you are or what you, we all face a similar challenge… There’s so much to do and so little time! Take control of your time, your to-do list, and your overwhelm. Learn how to get it all done, without the stress. If you have more things to do than you have time and frequently get overwhelmed with all your priorities and tasks, you are in the right place! I designed this course to help people from all walks of life that struggle with trying to get it all done.\n\n\nIf you're someone who has a LOT on their plate and wants to find a system to handle it all, but who also craves downtime for yourself, this course is for you. You might be an employee who doesn’t feel organized, a manager or exec who is learning to handle your own work and be an effective leader at the same time, a working parent, or someone who has recently said one of the following:\n\"I just don't have enough hours in the day!\"\n\"I've got too much on my plate!\"\n\"I have no downtime!\"\n\"I feel like I'm failing at work AND home!\"\n\"Planning stresses me out!\"\n\n\nDo you wake up at night thinking about something you need to do at work tomorrow? Do you go to bed thinking about all the things you didn't get done today? Do you fall into bed exhausted every night having had no time for yourself? Do you often find yourself scrambling to get things done at the last minute? Now imagine how it would feel if you:\nWe're able to leave work at work, and be present at home (while getting it all done!)\nHad time for yourself, every day\nCould show up to every meeting, event, or activity prepared and on time\nWere well-rested, focused, and relaxed\nKnew you were using your time in service of your own goals and values\nIn this course, I distill all of the content, strategies, techniques, and skills that I acquired. So let’s not waste any more time. Let’s jump right in and get started!\n\n\nIn this course, you will:\nMaster the techniques, strategies, tips and hacks to get everything done…without the stress.\nBuild a personalized productivity system so you can feel, and truly be, on top of it all.\nCreate and maintain a task-list system (for work and home) where balls are not dropped, nothing is forgotten or overlooked, and that allows your brain to focus on your work, instead of remembering the to-dos.\nImplement simple techniques for increasing focus and minimizing distractions.\nLearn how to say yes (and no!) to the right things.\nLearn how to disconnect and truly recharge in the evenings, on the weekends, and on vacation (without negative consequences).\n\n\nThis course will teach you EVERYTHING you need to know to develop your productivity and time management skills and become more productive in your professional and personal life.\n\n\nIn short, you’ll do more and stress less. Specifically, this course will cover:\nCommon Roadblocks to Productivity (and how to combat them!)\nPersonalized Productivity - How to use your natural tendencies to your advantage.\nTask Management - How to keep track of it all without relying on your memory!\nPrioritization - How to make sure you're working on the right things at the right times.\nPlanning - How taking a few moments now saves your future self TONS of time.\nFocus - How to increase focus and minimize the impact of distractions.\nTime is a finite resource, and perhaps our most valuable one. Not everything will work for everyone. In this course, we start with who YOU are, to build a system that works specifically for you.\nThe lectures in this course are complemented by exercises such as discovering your personal productivity roadblocks, creating a task system, creating action plans for minimizing distractions and increasing focus, building personalized rewards, and more. The exercises ensure that you apply the content from the lectures in a practical and pragmatic way.\nEnroll today to take back control of your time, and make time for the things that matter in YOUR life! Now, if you’re ready to take your productivity to the next level, I’ll see you inside!",

      "description": "Where there are people, sooner or later there will be problems, but there will also be potential. This principle has been the foundation of Dr Neil Thompson’s work for over 30 years – helping individuals and organizations to tackle the problems and to fulfill the potential. In this course, he uses that experience in problem solving to offer helpful guidance on rising to the challenges that arise when people come together in a workplace or other setting. It offers an invaluable basis for developing your knowledge, skills and confidence in preventing problems where possible, tackling them when they do arise and dealing with the aftermath.\nIn particular, the course provides a foundation of understanding of how a creative approach to problem solving can be effective and can contribute to helping people realize their potential as fully as possible. Being creative opens up a much wider repertoire of problem-solving tools and therefore significantly increases our chances of making a positive difference.\nSimply hoping that problems will go away if left alone is a very risky strategy and can be very costly in both human and financial terms, and so taking time to learn more about creative problem solving should prove to be a worthwhile investment of effort.",

You're in the right place.\nArtificial Intelligence isn’t science fiction anymore. It’s already part of your life—whether it’s helping you find the best route on your phone, powering your voice assistant, or making sense of those endless online ads for things you might have talked about once 5 years ago. But how does it all work? And more importantly, how can it work for you?\nThis course is built especially for Baby Boomers who are curious, not necessarily tech-savvy, and want to understand AI in a practical, easygoing way. You don’t need a math degree, coding experience, or a deep love for robots (although if you grew up watching The Jetsons, you’re in good company).\nWe’ll walk you through:\nWhat Artificial Intelligence actually is (no gobbledygook, we promise)\nHow tools like ChatGPT, voice assistants, and recommendation engines really work\nWhat machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing mean—in normal-person terms\nWays AI is already popping up in your daily life (and how to spot it)\nSimple ways you can start using AI to save time, explore new hobbies, or just have some fun\nThe truth about job automation, privacy, and other hot-button AI topics—without the panic\nYou’ll get hands-on with today’s most talked-about tools, hear real-world examples that make sense, and even try out a few yourself—whether you're retired, still working, or just trying to stay \"in the know\" at family dinners.\nSome lessons are short and sweet. Others go into more detail, with stories, analogies, and the occasional “remember when” to bring the concepts home. There’s no rush and no judgment—just you, learning something new at your own pace.\nSo grab a cup of coffee, bring your curiosity, and let’s figure out this AI thing together.",

It's purpose is to deliver small bite-sized learning that leads to immediate results.\n\n\nMotivation is crucial to your work—especially as freelancers (hello, no external deadlines)!

So, let’s get to work.\n\n\nWhat you'll learn in this course:\n+ About why we procrastinate and how we can avoid cycles that cause more stress\n+ 7 science-based motivation and productivity methods that you can start implementing into your business NOW.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nFreelancers and business owners who are feeling stuck, struggling to focus, or unable to grow their business.\nFreelancers and business owners who feel like they're not delivering their best work to their clients.\nPeople who want simple solutions that are easy to maintain.\n\n\nWho this course is not for:\nSomeone who wants a 4 hour, in-depth course that discusses lots of theories.\nI wanted to deliver actionable tips that you can learn over a cup of coffee or your lunch break so that you can implement these game-changing methods TODAY.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the instructor:\nI'm Erin, and I procrastinated making this course for 7 months. True story. Until I had a session with my own coach where we talked about the importance of taking action, no matter how small, to combat procrastination. I've since re-implemented the methods in this course to my personal and professional life and - to no ones surprise - my work improved, I got more done in a day than I thought was possible, and my anxiety went down.\nWhen I'm not procrastinating, I'm a virtual assistant and VA Coach who has successfully helped over 30,000 happy students launch their own VA businesses.\n\n\nI hope to see you in the course! Together, we can make magic happen.",

It's a gateway to a super fun & supportive community and it's a career jump-start where you will learn everything practical you need - even things the Pros can't teach you (see Introduction: Video 2 in Course Curriculum).\n\n\nFor those thinking about how to become a voice actor and how to succeed in voice acting, Break Into Voiceover is so much more than any \"Introduction to Voice-Over\" courses out there... it cuts through the noise with a first-steps approach that gives you the tools to start earning as quickly as possible.\n\n\nGet help from VO Friends: Break Into Voiceover - Enrol today!\n\n\nFrom the author:\n3 months ago I knew nothing about voiceover, except that it seemed like the coolest job on the planet. I don't mean offering voice recordings on places like Fiverr, which can be a faster way to earn money from home, but inside the VO industry - voicing ads, animation, video games, audiobooks, or corporate videos.\nSince I had no experience, no acting background, nothing, i proceeded to go down the YouTube rabbit hole and to also take courses by a local studio and a workshop at a famous acting school and... burn myself out and spend nearly $2500 without even getting a demo yet!\nWith this course I've developed my VA journey into a 5-step strategy you can learn for yourself and apply from home, that can save you from the time-wasting, money-sucking distractions this industry can kill (accidentally, usually!) VO dreams with.\nI go a little more into my story inside the course - it wasn't pretty. But I did find in myself something very few wannabe VA's have: drive and CLARITY. I saw a path and I took it, and it paid off. Now, I'm more than just that poor (literally trembling) amateur newbie on the outside looking in... I'm a Voice Actor!\nAnd you can be too.\nI wrote this course purely for the love of Voiceover - it's my new passion! I wanted to be part of a community of VO Friends to grow with, and I wanted to share this knowledge before I get in too deep and never look back. I hope it helps you!",

Without mental exercise, thinking slows, focus weakens, and long-term memory can decline.\n\n\nThis course isn’t about school math, it’s about training your mind to stay alert, quick, and independent in a world where technology wants to think for you.\n\n\nYes, calculators, Google, and AI tools like ChatGPT can give instant answers. But the more you outsource your thinking, the less your brain works, and studies prove the cost:\n\n\nMIT found that relying on AI reduced brain activity in areas tied to memory, creativity, and critical thinking.\nThe “Google Effect” shows we remember where to find information, not the information itself—weakening long-term memory.\nMIT Media Lab observed frequent AI users had poorer recall, lower creativity, and struggled when forced to think on their own.\n\n\nThe takeaway?\n\n\nLet AI support you, not replace you. Your brain’s cognitive muscles still need exercise.\n\n\nMental math is one of the most effective workouts for your mind. In just 15 minutes a day, you can:\n\n\nStrengthen memory and recall\nBoost focus and attention span\nImprove problem-solving and decision-making\nBuild mental resilience and agility\n\n\nMath Genius isn’t just a set of tricks, it’s a structured brain-training program that keeps your mind active, sharp, and independent, no matter your age.\n\n\nKeep your brain in the game.

But also, there are things you can do about it.\nIf you are earnestly in search of an answer to the above, you can start with my course - Ideas to Actions - where I take you through the methods I have developed to overcome this feeling while also progressing with the things I want to do or experience in life.\nI will take you through the following components of my Task Management System:\nConsolidated To-Do List that I call IGUPTSAs - that takes all of your life’s Ideas, from the most trivial to the most ambitious, and distills them into easily executable Actions\nReview Systems to keep you in check and answerable to your own goals and aspirations\nReporting Viewing Formats (apps/tools) that help you understand your progress in various spheres of your life\nAnd finally, I do all this in this amazing cross-functional tool called Notion!\nI will take you through the basics of Notion and teach you a trick or two to use Notion to take your productivity to the next level. But at the same time, the majority of my focus will be on teaching you how to build a Task Management system for higher productivity and you will be at liberty to build your own system with or without Notion (or any such tool whatsoever).\nI cannot wait for you to take this course so that you can benefit from some of the productivity practices I have built over the years.

She has worked for Fairfax Media (in Australia) and is the founder and editor of Ezra Magazine based in Australia.\nThis course was reviewed in September 2025.\nThe course\nUsing these strategies you will be able to conduct your own fact-checking mission to investigate whether the information you are accessing is reliable, accurate, and trustworthy. These three simple, easy, and effective strategies will become a part of your news reading habits to help build your critical thinking and reading skills.\nOur critical examination of news will incorporate:\nExamining previous news stories\nGoing upstream\nReading laterally\nHands-on activities\nUsing lectures, this course will examine the strategies in-detail but will provide you with opportunities to put your skills to use. Through two hands-on and practical activities, you will begin to employ the strategies taught and fact-check news websites. At the end of the course, you'll see how I fact-check news stories that I see on my newsfeed every day and show you just how quick and easy it is to verify something you see on the internet.\nCourse references\nThis course would not have been possible without the book: Web-Literacy for Student Fact-Checkers published by Mike Caulfield in 2017.

      "description": "What is this course about?\nThroughout our life and career, we face a lot of problems, and a few of them we overcome and few not. The whole idea of approaching to solve any problem is how do you approach to solve it?\nBeing an effective manager or an individual contributor is about being a problem solver. To become a truly effective & productive manager, you will not only have to solve the many problems you face on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Problem-solving is the process and ability to find solutions to complex problems and issues. Solving problems and finding potential solutions to fix a current issue is part of the problem-solving process. Practical problem solving can deal with creative thinking to see the common sense to the original problem and figure out what the next steps should be.\nSo rather than panicking every time you are under pressure, this module will help you take a more thoughtful and measured approach to tackle the problems that land on your desk.\nThe beauty of problem-solving is that new issues come up all the time, so learning the steps needed to identify a solution will be an essential skill to have. There is no one way via problem-solving techniques, so it's important to learn skills to figure out solutions to issues.\nEnjoy the course!",

      "description": "\"I don't focus on what I'm up against. I focus on my goals and I try to ignore the rest.\" Venus Williams\nWhat stops you from having the life, business success and rewards you desire?. How do you feel when you hear the words: Goal Setting? You know that goals work. You wouldn’t be here if you were not searching for an easier, more effective way of creating, sticking to and achieving goals would you?\nYou already know that you can change your life instantly, no matter what you want in life. Yet setting goals is more than just a yearly process. The first step is simply to decide, commit, set a goal. If you read any autobiography of a great achiever you know this to be true.\nYet maybe it just gnaws away at you; knowing that you will never achieve your true potential until you call yourself out and set goals to do so. Perhaps the though of truly taking time out to set goals fills you with the same dread as having homework did when you were a child or perhaps finishing your end of year tax return. So you resist. You procrastinate. You set goals and then ignore them. You fail and feel like a failure.\nGoals are instructions to yourself when you set a goal your commanding yourself getting momentum in your own life in the direction of your vision or dream.\nGoal setting is the most important skill you can ever develop.\nLogically you know that goals are just action points you consciously decide upon and you then have to turn up and be willing to make them work.\nYet what is not to love about a process that allows you to not only get the most out of life but to create a life of your dreams?\nGoal setting is a skill. The skill of goal setting is 100% learnable. People and organizations with clear visions, values, and plans accomplish far more and do it faster than their competitors.\nAsk yourself how much is not setting goals costing you …..\nSo what is it that stops you? You may not be able to put your finger on it you just know it is not working for you.\nBefore today, all of your best intentions and best efforts in setting and achieving goals may have failed. Repeatedly. Year after year after year. Leaving you frustrated with the process. Possibly feeling like a failure and that is your fault.\nThe truth is, up until now, your best efforts have been undermined by, well, your mind.\nWhat if you could, by watching and listening to ten bite sized coaching and training modules, have a blueprint for setting goals that will take you via daily steps to the BIG goals for your life and business that you feel are outside of your reach? What is more, in addition to these proven tools and techniques, you will embed the learning at a subconscious level through clinical hypnotherapy. This will help to rewire your thinking to change your beliefs and actions about goals so that you become a goal setting machine.\nIdentifying, understanding and letting go of old patterns of thought and behaviour can rewire their brains. In doing this, their thoughts and habits are changed, leading to new behaviours and ways of feeling. This not only allows you to reach your goals and re-frame your future, but also to do it with passion and purpose. You can do more because you ARE more. A freer, more successful version of you.\nBy dealing the unseen root causes that have been keeping you in a Groundhog Day of repeated unwanted behaviours, you can achieve what you want.\nThis unique course goes deeper than other traditional goal-setting courses. It harnesses the efficacy of clinical hypnotherapy, imagery, mindset and World-class coaching to engage your subconscious mind and take you from unwanted feeling, beliefs and behaviours to a new destiny by your own design. Changing the way you think at the deepest level changes the way you feel and act. It is that simple. And by rewiring yourself at this deepest level it becomes a permanent part of you. With your full commitment to the process of course!\nStarting with your introductory Transformational Therapy recording ‘Open your mind for goal setting success’ you will create the right mindset and start the transformative process to move you through the course and absorb effortlessly and permanently the coaching advice and training content.\nHow is the course structured?\nStarting with your introductory Transformational Therapy recording ‘Open your mind for goal setting success’ you will create the right mindset and start the transformative process to move you through the course and absorb effortlessly and permanently the coaching advice.\nYour coaches Stuart Ross and Rosalyn Palmer bring three decades of proven business, coaching and therapy skills together. Stuart’s tried and tested High Growth Coaching strategies that have made millions for some of the entrepreneurial individuals and companies in the world, whilst Rosalyn’s unique mix Clinical Hypnotherapy and NLP have enhanced and elevated many top performers to new levels. No other goal setting course fuses this practical, psychological and proven expertise. Many are good on theory. Some are good in practice but none offer this incredibly powerful mix.\nLearning the importance of goals setting you will become clear on not just how to goal-set but to create goals that inspire you, that fill you with the drive and ambition and excitement to be achieved as you will tap into your reason why.\nTouch points along the entire programme will allow you to reflect, reassess and recalibrate your overriding goals plus you will be able to chunk those goals down into yearly and quarterly goals. Each step of the way will become increasingly effortless as your brain will be altered for your benefit by the hypnotherapy recordings.",
