This skeleton will also have three different spines this will allow us to examine. These will include two curved skeletons, one with four bones to be compatible with the Unity humanoid rig.  The others skeletons are have more bones and will allow us to compare to pitfalls of using curved or straight spines.\nWe will create a custom reorient joints node that will allow us to have consistent orientations for all the joints.\n\n\nFor the rig we will be looking to implement IK and FK Controls. For the IK controls we will have both global and local controls. And we will be implementing number of methods to blend between global and local controls.\nWe will be creating a custom for the  spine rotations with options for both linear and quaternion interpolation.\nFor the arms we will be creating a dynamic skeleton that moves based of the position of the arm. The Hand will have preset poses that we can blend between.\nWe will be building an export pipeline with options for 'level of detail' and exporting characters and animation.",

Less than 10 years later, at the age of 21, I became one of the youngest animators ever hired by Walt Disney Animation.\nThat day, I was just a child who formed a dream of working as an animator for Disney. That dream turned into a goal, and that goal turned into a burning desire that wouldn't let me stop until I achieved it.\nThis isn't just a course on “how to animate\" or \"how to become a character animator\". This is a course on how to achieve your biggest dreams!\nI've reverse engineered the steps I used to turn the dream of a 12 year old into reality. You'll learn what it takes to get your Dream Job at an animation studio, and how to keep that job.\nOf course I'll teach you about the 12 Principles of Animation (the fundamental principles that ALL animation is based on), in fact I'll help you turn all 12 Principles into Habits.\nBut I'll ALSO teach you about yourself: How to motivate yourself to reach those big dreams, and how to STAY motivated even when everyone around you tells you to give up.\nYou should have a basic grasp of animation, and be able to use animation software such as Blender 3D, Maya, 3DS Max, or any of the 2D animation packages.\nThe techniques and practices taught in this course can be applied to any form of animation, but you will need to practice them throughout the course.\nI explain the concepts clearly, and there are video clips of each exercise being performed or animated, so you can follow along.\nThe course is 12 weeks long, and requires you to do a small animation exercise every single day. It is broken into sections by week, with each week having 7 videos (one for each day of the week) plus a quiz at the end of each week.\nThere were many 'dark days' where even I lost faith and felt like giving up on my dream of being a professional character animator.\nNow, in my mid-30's, I've worked for Disney, Fox Studios, and I run my own film and animation company - as well as an online animation community. I've managed to live and work in 7 countries around the world on everything from Feature Films, to Television Commercials, Video Games, and even Scientific Research. It's time to share my knowledge.\nI'm here to tell you that you SHOULD Dream big, and you CAN reach your Dream Job as a character animator in games, film, television, or any area you desire.\nJoin me for 12 weeks of mentoring, motivation, and animation training.\nI'll see you on the other side.",

Starting with exporting our character from Maya using the FBX format, we’ll import it into UE4 in such a way that will allow us to share animation blueprints across different characters. Then we’ll go over how to import animations and setting up things like additive aim poses and navigational blend spaces. We will cover the basic concepts of the blueprint scripting system in the Unreal Engine so we can set up our character and then our animation blueprint. We’ll cover how to hook up our character with input from the keyboard and gamepad, connect it to our anim blueprint, and have our character running around the level in the engine. In discussing anim blueprints, we’ll discuss concepts such as applying additive animations and setting up state machines. We’ll add extra features like ik systems, head look-at systems, other procedural animation systems.\nMore about the Instructor:\n\nChad Robert Morgan used his veteran’s benefits he earned from his tour in the US Navy to go to Sonoma State University where he earned his bachelors degree in Computer Science. He got his first job in the industry right after graduation with LucasArts where he learned how to rig characters in SoftImage and Maya, as well as how to apply his programming knowledge with MEL. Chad has worked in both film and games for nearly 20 years. Currently he runs his own company which published its first mobile game, The Last Rite – Endless Nightmare, as well as working at Whitemoon Dreams, the makers of WarMachine:Tactics and Starblood Arena.",

You can even learn basics of Blender just with the preview lections :).\nAnd the fun starts:\nNewbie Niko: I am so frustrated! I dream about learning Blender and make 3D characters with it, but i don't know where to start. It is so hard!\n\n\nPro Niko: Relax my man! I am here to help you!\n\n\nNewbie Niko: Waaaaa! What are you doing in my home! ... doesnt matter! Guys, this is Niko, and he is a professional 3D character artist and educator. He has numerous courses about Blender, Zbrush and human anatomy.\n\n\nPro Niko: Thank you for that, Newbie Niko. This course is just for you. We will start Blender from scratch and go trough all tools and actions needed to create this almost cute rabbit character. Modelling, sculpting, basic materials, lighting and render will be covered. So strap on!\n\n\nWe will begin by getting familiar with Blender interface and learning how to model and sculpt in the program and make a basic human head for warm up. Then we will start making the rabbit by working on the head, adding eyebrows, eyes and hair. We will then go and learn how to make the body and the limbs. After, i will point your attention to the hand, which is pretty tricky, but we will get trough it together :). Making the clothes will be the next task on our list and with my help you will do them just fine. We will even make a character prop - a big chef knife, for cutting some huge carrots, i guess. Then we will start detailing, smoothing and coloring the model. When we finish with that, we will make a basic character rig to move and pose the arms and hands, so we can achieve the pose on the concept. Then will be time for some tweaking and fixing, before we start doing the materials and light setup. We will also learn about renders, lights, camera position and even render with transparent background and compose in Photoshop.\nAt the end as a bonus i will even show you how to make a turntable video of your character.\n\n\nThe course is for Absolute beginners in Blender and character art, but if you are intermediate user and like to make this character with me, you are welcome to do so.\n\n\nNow i will leave you, because it is time to start the course, see ya there! :)",

      "description": "What is Manga Art School?\nManga Art School is a 2-6 week learn-anywhere video course where you learn to become adept at drawing professional and authentic Japanese Manga and Anime character stylization. I’ve hand-crafted the Manga Art School: The Complete Anime & Manga Drawing Course to be the only course you need, to learn all the core fundamentals and advanced stylization and proportional knowledge needed to draw and sketch Manga and Anime style characters well. If you’re an absolute beginner or you’re already at an intermediate level, the course will advance your current ability to not only a professional level, but help you achieve an authentic and appealing manga or anime style in your character work. You won't end up with Anime or Manga characters that don't look \"quite\" like true manga style - no, this course will show you how to achieve a real Japanese Anime and Manga stylization of your work.. The course is a comprehensive 6 module guided video course, where the only limit to your progression is your determination and engagement in learning the concepts and engaging in the rewarding assignments.\nWhether you want to draw stylized characters for Manga, Anime, or Manga genres such as Shoujo, Shounin, Bishoujo, your own Doujinshi, or Kodomo manga style characters, this is the course you need to get you there.\nI’ll teach you to draw in a true manga style without fear. I’ll teach you to draw an authentic manga style well.\n\n\nFinally, Learn Manga and Anime Style Drawing Well\nWhether you’re a complete beginner, or intermediate at drawing Manga styles, you’ll learn things you never knew you never knew. Immense time and research, as well as years of drawing experience have gone into creating a course that distills the core information you need to know, in order to draw convincing and authentic manga or anime style characters. I’m so convinced of this, I’ll give you a no-questions asked refund if you’re not satisfied.\n\n\nClear, Easy to Understand Lessons\nCrystal clear in fact. Learning Manga and Anime stylization effectively means having information presented in a logical and coherent way. The Manga Art School Course is modular by design, easy to grasp, and allows you to learn in a well paced, structured way. Engage in the course chronologically, then revise each module at your leisure. Grasp concepts faster than you ever have before – there’s no fluff here. (and really, this no fluff promise is in all of my courses!)\n\n\nAssignments that are Rewarding\nBridging the gap between theory and practice, each module’s assignments have been designed to both reinforce theory, and feel rewarding. I’ve taken the core of the theory, and purpose built each assignment to help you rapidly progress, and you’ll see the difference in your own work almost immediately. Art is about doing, so let’s get started.\n\n\nWhat's Your Style?\nAnime and Manga is not simply one single style, but has many, many variants. This course teaches you the foundational stylistic rules that are common among all styles, allowing you not only to draw authentic manga and anime characters, but create your own style that is still true to the original Japanese principles. I'm not teaching you a 'method' or a 'way' to draw the styles, I'm teaching you to be a fundamentally good Manga and Anime style character artist.",

      "description": "Hi and welcome to this new Udemy course, ‘Stylised Halloween Scene Blender 2.9 ’. This is the complete beginner’s guide to creating a 3D stylised game model. This course will teach you how to create a stylised 3D model from scratch to a professional level.\n‘Stylized Halloween Scene in Blender 2.9 ’ will take you through a Halloween 3D modeling rollercoaster exclusively in Blender 2.9. You will come away with an inspiring portfolio piece that will let you shine through.\nLike my other Udemy courses, I will be taking you on an extensive 3D modeling journey involving modeling, texturing, freebies, lighting and rendering a game ready 3D asset. The focus of this course is to creating a spooky creative scene to showcase your stylised game model of a Halloween pumpkin carriage in a way that it will make your 3D modelling artist portfolio shine!\nWe will also focus on making our model according to a real-world scale.\nEnroll in this Blender 2.9 course and experience over 20 hours of content, full of learning opportunities to take your 3D modeling, sculpting, texturing, lighting and rendering skills up by quite a few notches. By completing this course, you will walk away with a comprehensive view of how to model, texture, and render from the ground up, with a super-fast industry-standard workflow.\nWhat is more, we will be taking a new approach compared to my other past courses: after finishing the modelling of every course asset or sub-component, we will be texturing it straight away. This will elevate your excitement to new levels as with every couple of lessons, you will be able to grasp more of the final product step-by-step.\n‘Stylized Halloween Scene in Blender 2.9 ’ is beginner friendly, so even if you’ve just started 3D modelling, this course will set you up with a professional and efficient workflow.\n\n\nUsing everything I learned from previous courses, mainly from all your helpful feedback, I was able to make a course that really has the wow-factor; something you will be proud of accomplishing.\nThrough the incorporation of varied pumpkin carriage components, we will go over interesting functionalities, including new and creative ways of using various Blender 2.9 modifiers and addons, including but not limited to:\n- Marking Seams, Sharps, and fixing Normals;\n- Smoothing and preparing meshes for texturing;\n- Adding materials using Blender 2.9’s node system;\n- Mesh deforming and using Booleans;\n- Loop cuts;\n- Joining meshes and finishing seams;\n- Fixing Ngons;\n- Creating Glass, Leather, and Coal Materials;\n- Creating Collections of Objects and Meshes using a Hierarchy System;\n- Creating a Simple Animation;\n- Creating Grass using Particle Systems;\n- Creating Trees using the Ivy Generator;\n- Creating Moths & Bats using silhouette alphas;\n- Creating Atmospheric Light using principled volume;\n- Creating a Mood with Emission Lights;\n- Creating a Spooky, Halloween, Night Sky;\n- Creating Burning Ember with Nodes;\n- Rendering a Stylized Halloween Scene.\n\n\nModelling\nThrough this course, we will be modelling several smaller props and assets to be placed within our stylised Halloween pumpkin.\nThis course will teach you how to model stylised assets from the ground up, using Blender 2.9. Whether you are an absolute beginner or someone who is looking to elevate their skill level, animations will be popping up when you need them, telling you all about modifiers, Blender functions, and key commands. This course explains everything and will include a step-by-step exploration of all the new shortcuts that have come with this new Blender version. Best of all, this unique course functionality also lets you set your own pace. This allows the course to be viable for Blender users of any level.\nBy the end of the course, the knowledge you will have learned can be used independent of the direction you take in 3D modeling – following the amateur or the professional path.\n\n\nTexturing\nAs part of the texturing part of ‘Stylized Halloween Scene in Blender 2.9 ’, you will learn how to create complex stylised materials from scratch. This will include the embers and the world material for the night sky. To make the texturing process quicker and more beginner-friendly, you will be supplied with all the other materials that will be used in this course.\nAs part of the texturing process, we will also go over how to lay or apply multiple materials to meshes.\n\n\nRendering\nFinally, to present our model in a professional way and make it really stand out in any portfolio, we will be rendering out in a fully equipped spooky Halloween scene. A starry night with moths and bats in front of a full moon with cast light to our fully modelled and textured Halloween pumpkin carriage as it stands on a cobbled road with fenced off grass.\nYou will come away with renders which you will be proud to show off on your social media. By the time we have finished rendering in Blender 2.9, you will have the knowledge and confidence to create stylised assets that look like they fell out straight out of a game. As part of rendering, I will show you how to make backdrops and specialised lighting, including extra lights. I always feel that lighting is one of the key components that tend to be the most overlooked. To be honest, I learned this the hard way, seeing as lighting is important with regards to making a scene pop.\n\n\nDownload Pack\nBest of all, this course also comes with a free download pack, full of everything you will need for the course. This will include things like full references to over 22 props that will be part of our stylised Halloween pumpkin carriage scene, and a whopping 105 texture maps free for you to use. The ‘Stylized Halloween Scene in Blender 2.9 ’ course download pack will include resolution maps and alphas as well.\nThese are resources that you are free to download and reuse in your other projects. I created all these textures and resources using a mix of Substance Painter, Substance Designer, and Adobe Photoshop. All textures included for free with this course are custom made specifically for this course.\n\n\nSo, with all that said, I hope I have whetted your appetite to start your journey into stylised 3D game asset creation. Check out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down.\n\n\nGot plans for next weekend?\nNow you do! After opening access to ‘Stylized Halloween Scene in Blender 2.9 ’, you will know exactly what’s coming.\n\n\nHalloween is on its way and as October’s most exciting whimsical time, my newest course will fully honour it!\nIt’s including everything that’s magical about autumn held together by everything spooky about Halloween ... all held at your fingertips.\n\n\nI had a blast making this course and I am sure you will too.\n\n\nHappy modeling everyone!\nNeil, 3D Tudor",

Become a Blender node guru by adding nodes to your imported maps to completely change the way they look and feel\n\n\n\n\nI imagine you using these props in what is becoming 3D Tudor’s up-and-coming best seller, ‘Blender 3 to Unreal Engine 5 Dungeon Modular Kitbash’!\n\n\nThink about it – all these assets would fit perfectly within the rooms we created, making your 3D dungeon game environment alive with the power of storytelling.\nAlthough guillotines were introduced later than the medieval historical period our other assets are meant to depict, we thought you would enjoy learning how to make them as part of ‘Blender to Unreal Engine Become a Dungeon Prop Artist’. We will be ensuring that our model is structurally accurate. For example, we need to make sure that the structure can hold the weight of all its counterparts, including the blade.\n\n\nWhat about creating an interior for your castle with ‘Creating a Modular Kitbash in Blender’ and using these to populate the space too and create an environment that everyone will talk about?\nThis course will give you access to just over 30 hours of 3D art in around 160 comprehensive lessons.\n\n\n\n\nThis course will see you learn all the techniques pros use and how they use them. Learn how to achieve realism using custom materials to create blood spatter that will look perfect for your torture chamber at the bottom of your dungeon!\n\n\nBlender\n\n\n\n\nCreate the ‘Blender to Unreal Engine Become a Dungeon Prop Artist’ props and walk through the halls of your very own medieval dungeon with banners, cages, and a not-so-medieval but very torturous and iconic, guillotine.\nHave you ever wanted to learn how to model gems and treasure coins to add that extra glow to your scene?\nYou will do just that!\n‘Blender to Unreal Engine Become a Dungeon Prop Artist’ will see you build 3D props fit for the medieval dungeon of your dreams (or nightmares!), including but not limited to:\n- House banners\n- Wall cages\n- Stocks like in Game of Thrones (GoT)\n- A stretching rack\n- A guillotine\n- Traditional stocks\n- A straw bed\n- Table and chairs\n- Torches\n- A weapons rack\n- Candles, books, parchment, gems, and other furniture\nMaster geometry nodes to speed up your workflow. You will be able to alter how a prop looks (i.e., its geometry) using node-based functions. We will also set up the geometry node variable menus in the modelling tab to save you time rather than going into the geometry nodes menu every time. I will also be introducing you to another hidden addon in Blender – the loop tools addon. It enables you to create circles and circles in geometry, allowing you to bridge your geometry with two clicks\n\n\nFollowing the success of my latest courses, we will be modelling, texturing, and finalizing every individual asset before moving on to the next. Students have said that this has helped them in staying excited throughout the creation process, being able to see how their scene comes closer to the course preview step-by-step.\n\n\nOf course, you could set yourself a challenge and diversify aspects of the medieval dungeon props such as changing the textures, adding different variations, or more assets such as different doors and smaller assets like chains on the wall to make your medieval dungeon more alive.\nFind out how to set up materials Blender. Change them to suit your needs by adding adjustment modes and becoming a true texturing genius. For an extra touch of detail, you will learn how to use the grease pencil to draw lines to turn them into curves, and finally, into 3D mesh. This is a great technique for creating swirls and ornamental work.\nUse ‘Blender to Unreal Engine Become a Dungeon Prop Artist’ to master UV editing using edge seam creation, custom projection and UV manipulation to make the best use of your seamless textures.\nInstead of choosing one rendering engine over another, you will be learning how to use Blender’s Eevee and Cycles X renderers to get the most out of your prop presentation.\n\n\nUnreal Engine 5\n\n\n\n\nThrough ‘Blender to Unreal Engine Become a Dungeon Prop Artist’ you will be learning everything right from importing individual models from Blender to having them work correctly in UE5. We will be manually importing our asset collection and setting up material instances for them. One of the most interesting parts of the UE5 part of this course will be that we will be setting up torch blueprints with realistic fire particle animation and light flicker to bring your scene to life.\nWe will look at how to import and use textures created specifically for Unreal Engine and use them to create the materials for our medieval dungeon props. You will find out how to change PBR texture values by directly adjusting their information from within, built in the image editor.\n\n\nNext, we will set up PBR materials with adjustable parameters that will allow you to change the intensity of the normal map (e.g., adjust colour, change roughness values, and more). You will work through the different transparency materials that will help you set up cut-out decals, partially transparent decals with PBR values and two side-faced textures.\n\n\n‘Blender to Unreal Engine Become a Dungeon Prop Artist’ will also be an introduction to how to set up files to create a clean UI. The skills you learn here are fully transferable to all your future builds.\n\n\nOne of the most exciting things about ‘Blender to Unreal Engine Become a Dungeon Prop Artist’ is that you will create collisions for your props to block out your playable character. This will help your assets fit in seamlessly within your ‘Blender 3 to Unreal Engine 5 Dungeon Modular Kitbash’, ready to test out with your UE5 character. To optimise your time, you will learn a method for placing your assets quickly within any type of game level.\nYour UE5 milestone project will be to present your asset pack in Unreal Engine 5 and render out a turntable video.\n\n\nCourse Resources & Freebies\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘Blender to Unreal Engine Become a Dungeon Prop Artist’ resource pack includes 27 unique seamless materials, 1 atlas material for the books, 1 trim sheet for gold decorations, 7 ornaments set up with PBR materials, 3 unique blood PBR materials, 2 transparency detail textures (i.e., straw and helmet feather), and 1 UE5 animation texture for the Niagara fire particle system. You will be getting a total of 297 texture maps. You will be getting a total of 297 texture maps.\n\n\nJoin this course and come be part of a game design journey of over 30 hours of learning that will see you go away with over 50 game-ready medieval props for your dungeon in just 160 lessons.\n\n\nCheck out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down!\n\n\nTo get you pumped, imagine how well this 3D props set fits in with your other 3D Tudor projects.\nBe creative! Feature your medieval dungeon assets inside a medieval castle keep with ‘Creating a Modular Kitbash in Blender’. Also, think about using them in other medieval environments such as ‘Blender 3 The Ultimate Medieval Scene Course’, and adding more assets that would exist in farms such as bags of grain, a hearth, and different tables based on the skills you learned.\n\n\nPair up your guillotine with some gallows using ‘Blender to Unreal Engine 5 | 3D Props | Medieval Gallows’ to master the look of your medieval castle’s execution area. Use the full power of Blender 3 and Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) to your advantage.\n\n\n\n\nUntil next time, happy modelling everyone!\n\n\nNeil – 3D Tudor",

      "description": "Hi everyone, my name is Marwan Hussain I'm a 3D artist and I have been in the 3D field for 9 years now, I like to use Blender to create anything I want and in this course, we will learn how to create a 1957 BMW car from start to finish with Blender 2.92.\nCreating a car like BMW 507 is a bit challenging because the surface is curvy or I can say it's organic and not flat, this is reason that makes creating cars like BMW 507 a bit challenging, but with the right modeling technic you can achieve very clean results.\nAnd the beautiful thing about Blender it can handle that kind of organic modeling in a smart way by using the ShrinkWrap modifier, this is the secrete that I will use to kill any bad shading on the surface.\n\n\nSo we will go through all the details that you saw in the intro video, if you didn't see the intro I advise you to see it first to see the final result and how it looks.\nWhen the modeling journey is finished we will jump to the materials section, there, we will learn how to create the car paint material and the other materials like Rubber, Chrome, Plastic, and Iron, this section will be very fun and informative.\n\n\nRigging, yes we will rig the car and we will learn how to use armature step by step, first, we will add all the necessary bones and after that, we will learn how to create a relationship with them by using constraints like damped track constraints and transformation constraints.\nAnd now it's time to render the scene, we will add the camera and we will take a nice shot and we will learn nice technic about how to use DOF ( depth of field ) to take a close shot.\n\nThis is all about the course, in a nutshell, inside the course, there is tons of information that will take your level and ability to the advanced stage when it comes to car modeling.\nThe last thing that I want to add here is if you finish this course and learned how to create cars in general that's mean you can sell them online and make some money.",

I have more than 20 000 students in my  courses of human anatomy, Zbrush and Blender.\n\n\nIn this intermediate Blender course we will make this VIking, following the concept from Laurel D Austin.\n\n\nWe will start by analyzing the concept and doing the VIking head. After that we will go trough the beard, hair, and helmet until we reach the torso, arms and legs. When we are ready with the initial body, we will start adding clothes, boots and armors. Then we will start refining everything we did, so we will make the character ready for 3D printing without thin or separate parts. Then it will be time to color the character and make some lighting setup and materials. We will also learn how to make a shadow catcher and turntable video at the end.\n\n\nThis course is mostly for intermediate Blender users, but if you are an thrill seeking beginner, you could try it too :).\n\n\nLets start it then!",

Are you just fed up of not getting anywhere with your skillset? Then welcome to the Facial Anatomy and Portrait Course for Blender Artists. My name is Corazon Bryant, professional 3D artist and educator. I will be your instructor here.\nIn this course, we will take the time to truly understand the underlying structure of the human face. We will dive in deep and study the facial anatomy the correct way by dissecting each important parts of the skull, fat, and muscles. You will gain exceptional observational skills that will allow you to identify every little bump and forms that show on the surface of the human face.\nAfter you obtain the foundation of the facial anatomy, you will apply what you have learned by creating a realistic portrait. We will sculpt and make connections between our references and our anatomy knowledge. I will show you have to retopologize, unwrap, bake and texture. We will create custom skin stamps that we can utilize as high resolution textures for skin pores and wrinkles. Another huge part of creating believable skin is understanding the nodes of Blender and how to construct a network of them to achieve lifelike results.\nWe will make realistic eyes, eyebrows, lashes, facial fuzz, and hair. Vertex group and weight painting are significant methods we will use to control our particle hair system.\nTo create our realistic cloth, we will use Blender's cloth simulation. I will show you how to create fabric and how to project a photo on the mesh to add an extra texture on our jacket.\nOnce everything is done, you will learn how to generate a cinematic film shot of your character that you can use for future job opportunities.\nIf you have the patience, time, and self-motivation, then this course will do extreme wonders for you. If you feel that your character creation skill is not improving, then it is time for you to learn the anatomy. Come and join this course at Victory3D.",

      "description": "WHAT WILL YOU GET WHEN YOU COMPLETE THE COURSE?\nIf you enrol in the 'Learn Blender 3D  - Become a 3D artist today' course you will gain the knowledge to enter multiple fields and professions, such as creating models as a video game artist, animator, 3D print/production, Image creation plus more. In addition the course is structured so that at certain points we present students with challenge lectures where students are encouraged to create models with the tools that they have learned in this course. Students that complete these challenges in their entirety we have dozens of completed models ready for texturing, rigging and animation.\n\n\n\n\"Enrole in this course today to begin your learning journey in becoming a 3D blender artist. Take the first step in creating 3D assets for games, animations, movies and advertisement and add a new skill set.\"\nReviews from current students\n\"Excellent teaching so far. Taking a total newbie to 3d by the hand into the new world of 3d modeling. Joe does not rush you with the ideas or concepts and he repeats when needed so far I've easily understood him and have not felt confused . Am very much looking forward to doing the projects and am confident that Joe will take me through them all successfully.\"\nKeren\n\n\n\n\"This course covers a good amount of what you will need to work in blender. You'll learn the keys for doing items. And, this course will give you the keys to better understanding and therefore better learning comprehension in Blender courses and using Blender for other projects.\"\nJ R\n\n\n\n\"I think that the instructor does a great job of communicating the purpose of the tools in Blender (I'm not on to the modeling section yet). The material is very well organized and the instructor efficiently and confidently covers the subject matter. Also, I have been very impressed by timely responses from the instructor.\"\nSteve Thompson\n\n\n\nWith over 13 hours of content and 50 challenges to complete Blender 3D for beginners aims to take you from being the first timer all to way being able to create your own model, texture it, create animations and even export your creation to other software (ex unity) for creating games or even as a means of creating a NEW FORM OF INCOME!\nLearn Blender and the following subject sections:\nBlender interface and navigation\nIn this section of the course we introduce you to blender for the first time. You will learn how the course is structured and how it benefits you as the learner. This section introduces the blender interface and how to use all of the navigation and selection tools that are required to learn to become a 3D modelling artist.\n\n\nModelling\nIn this section, we go over the topic that blender is best at, 3D modelling. Here, you will learn how to create 3D Models either from scratch or by using one of blenders pre installed primitive objects. We will learn how to use object mode to change our objects properties (such as size and scale) in relation to the world around it, and edit mode which focuses on changing the actual shape and form of the object. We will be using all of the core modelling techniques for our designs and introducing many of blenders modifier tools which can be used to enhance our creations.\n\n\nTexture and materials\nIn this section, we cover how to apply different materials and textures to the models that have been created. Textures are used to change the visual appearance of our mesh by mapping colours and patterns onto its surfaces. Materials are used to determine how our object will react to any light sources that hit it. Applying your materials correctly can make your object look identical to its real world counterpart. We will be using two of blenders rendering engines in this section. The blender render engine creates basic textures suitable for exporting models into other software platforms such as unity or unreal engine. Cycles render is an engine used to create the best materials and textures possible for creating beautiful rendered scenes and animations, but is less optimized for exporting, especially to game engines.\n\n\nRigging\nThis section focuses on the pre production stage of animations, which is the rigging of objects in your scene. Rigging is the creation of a skeleton or armature that is used to help move models in ways similar to their real world counterparts. For example an armature for a human model would allow us to control the model at the joints like puppet strings, allowing us to move our model in the same way that our bodies do in real life. We will go over how to construct a full rig with skeleton bones, control and ik bones, and the weight painting tool which will allow us to change the influence of each bone on our model.\n\n\nAnimation\nIn this section of the course, we bring our creations to life by learning how to create animations by using tools such as the timeline, Graph editor and dope sheet. We will learn about keyframes and you can use these to create your animations the quick and easy way while with the help of the graph editor and dope sheet you can change where these keyframes are used in your animation and how the keyframes interact with each other, giving you complete control other your animations. This section will also go over how to render images and animations so that you can add them to your own portfolio of work.\n\n\nExporting\nThe basic does and don'ts of successfully exporting your creations to other software platforms such as unity 5.\n\n\n\n\nTHIS COURSE IS SUBJECT TO 30 DAY MONEY GARUNTEE, WHERE IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY WITH ANYTHING ABOUT THE COURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY BACK.\nTHIS COURSE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO BAILY COURSE 'IMPROVING FOR THE COMMUNITY SCHEME'. IF THEIR IS A TOPIC THAT STUDENTS WOULD LIKE COVERED IN THE COURSE, THEN WE WILL EITHER LOOK TO INCLUDE IT IN THE COURSE WITH THE NEXT COURSE UPDATE OR ADD IT TO A FUTURE COURSE.",

Through extensive illustrated text-based lectures and over 4 hours of over-the-shoulder, apprentice-style video tutorials, Tony offers the finest foundation material possible in here presenting \"Mastering 2D Animation\"!\nEach of Tony's tutorials embrace a comprehensive, step-by-step, apprentice-style of instruction, using both classically hand-drawn techniques and vector digital ones. Students should note that the core principles of movement taught in this course material however can always be applied to ALL forms of animation - from '3D' to 'Stop-frame', from 'Cut-out' to 'Claymation'!\n(Note: The digital elements of this course are demonstrated using ToonBoom Studio. However, ToonBoom Technologies have since replaced 'Studio' with 'Harmony Essentials'. So students are strongly advised to obtain a rudimentary knowledge of this software before studying the digital aspects in this course. That way they will be better able to translate the 'Studio' instructions with the 'Harmony Essentials' ones without too much trouble.)\nTony believes the 'apprenticeship' style of teaching is the ONLY way to really learn animation and that the instruction offered by some of the big, for-profit animation schools and colleges around the world is entirely inadequate for the modern professional world. Consequently, by literally drawing from his own early apprenticeship experiences with three of the finest master animators of all-time - Richard Williams (3 times Oscar winner), Ken Harris (Warner Brothers) & Art Babbit (Disney) - Tony has crafted here a series of unique and defining courses that are knowledgeable, accessible and perfectly suited to studies in a home-based environment.",

Perhaps, you've seen a few animated films and thought, \"Man, I wish I could do that\"?\n\nYou probably don't have a whole lot of cash (as well as time) to invest in learning 3D character animation from an accredited university. Or perhaps you do, but want to get a head-start without forking a lot of cash to start off with.\nEven if you've done some character animation before, you may have struggled to understand why your character doesn't look...well...alive.\nWhat's in this course?\n\nIn this course, we aim to help you introduce you to the world of character animation as well as imbue life into your character animations. We also aim to ensure that you don't go broke doing so.\nYou will be learning completely from scratch, the whole process of 3D character animation. Specifically,\nYou will learn the skills and techniques of animating realistic and believable characters.\nIn addition to learning all the theory-related stuff, you will also get hands-on experience in animating your own scenes. You can follow along as we will animate walks, runs, waving of arms, etc.\nWe will also look at more advanced character animation skills to further help enhance the believability and realism of your characters. You will specifically learn how to animate eye movements to help make your character look alive, facial expressions, lip-syncing, etc.\n\n\nWith 40 lectures and 6+ hours of content, there are so many different things you can learn. The topic of 3D character animation is so vast and complex and the learning curve can be so high, especially when starting out. I've gathered everything that I've learned over the years and have organized it in a way that will help you understand most effectively.\n\nWho is this course for?\n\nThis will be perfect for absolute beginners as I will walk you step-by-step starting from how to navigate your way around your 3D software towards animating convincing character action. There are no nasty jargon used in this course. Everything is explained in an easy-to-understand manner.\nYou don't need to know anything about animation. You don't even need to have a 3D software installed as we will cover this. It will help if you have some passion for character animation. At the very least, some passion for CGI-related works.\nThis course isn't limited to just beginners. Intermediate and Expert level users may also gain valuable knowledge from this course.\nWhat is expected outcome after the course?\nBy the end of this course, you can expect to have a decent understanding of building convincing and realistic 3D character animation. You will also gain experience and confidence doing your own 3D character animation.\nFrom there, you would be more prepared to start your own projects (imagine being able to create your very own animated short film) or you could start looking at jobs that need character animators. If you choose to do a more formal course on 3D animation, you will most likely get a head start!",

      "description": "Have you ever asked yourself why some seemingly simple videos have such astonishing animations, while some other ones are a pain to watch?\nThat’s because many beginner animators aren’t familiar with the principles of animation or animation theory in general, they don’t know what aspects they should focus on to improve their work, why those are important, and how they should implement such things in their animations.\nIn this course, we will dive into the depths of After effects. you will learn everything from the most basic animation techniques to the most advanced ones practically, so you can achieve astounding results.\nWhat’s more, our journey will not end until I see you becoming a pro motion designer. So, this course is suitable for both beginners and veterans.\n\n\nLet’s see What are you gonna learn during this course?\n\n\nSince our goal is to create motion graphics and the best software for that is after effects, firstly, you’ll get familiar with 'after-effects' and required tools for animation and further on, you'll learn how key frames and graphs work.\nAnd for a better understanding of timing, spacing, and easing which are the most important principles of animation, we'll do a couple of jumping ball exercises that are the most essential practices for getting to know these principles.\n\n\nOur next step would be the 12 main principles of animation which will be used to spice up the animations and you'll learn how to use them in your works properly.\nMoving on, you'll learn how to work with Text layers and how you can create amazing text animations.\nAfterward, learning Lettering animations and their respective principles are in our journey and we're going to create a mind-blowing lettering animation.\nIn the next chapter, we'll spend some time on Loop animations and the principles of creating one, and how to use them to create a beautiful work of such.\nThen you'll learn about Morph animation. you'll learn how to create an exquisite morph animation, alongside following a proper set of rules.\nIn the next chapter, you'll learn the types of Logo animations, methods and rules of making them, and also how to give them sense.\nIn the next chapter, you'll get familiar with one of the most challenging topics of animations yet the simplest one which is Character rigging. In this chapter, you'll learn about the Duik Bassel script and the required tools for rigging characters, from the most basic topic that is preparing the character to rigging a character.\nAfter you've learned to rig, we will work on Animating the character and how to use references properly so we can get better results.\nAfter that, we'll work on Rigging the head and different parts of the face then we'll start animating the head and create different emotions for the face.\n\n\nThis course is focused on doing projects, which means you'll learn whatever you need to know through action, and at the same time, you create beautiful animations and motion graphics that can be very effective in showing your portfolio  powerfully.\nThis  course is the product of years of my experience in motion graphics and It's here for you so you can become a veteran in motion graphics as quickly as possible and so you won't make the same mistakes as I did.\n\n\nI'll be here for you in every step until you become a pro motion designer.\nSo, register now and take your skills to the next level",

      "description": "Corazon Bryant always had an artistic bone in her body. When she was only 2 years old, she would make detailed drawings on her mother's wall. Her mother loved the drawings so much, she decided to keep them. With the encouragement of her mother, she continued drawing and she only got better as time went by. When Corazon was in middle and high school, she earned money making portraits for her classmates and even for her teachers. She pursued a college degree in Media Arts & Animation and later worked for architectural and entertainment companies such as Camm Productions, ID DI Design, and PDT International. She also had an opportunity to do some freelance work for Mega Pickle Entertainment. While working as a 3D artist, she had a chance to teach 3D animation classes in an A+ school. This is when she found her true love - which is not only to talk about 3D endlessly but to also inspire greatness in young upcoming artists. Corazon is currently working on a new project called Victory 3D with fellow industry-experienced artists to provide an affordable and effective learning system that will make it easier for students to get a job in the 3D industry.\nCourse Info\nIf you are struggling to create a good looking character, that's because you have not yet mastered the human anatomy. If you have tried several times to create a realistic character, but saw very little or no improvements at all, that's because you have not taken the time to truly understand the underlying structure of the human body. Don't worry, my name is Corazon Bryant, professional 3d artist and educator. In this course, I will teach you the human anatomy in depth.\nWe will start out by learning all about the bones of the body. By understanding the bony landmarks, we will be able to track the connections of muscles and understand their form. Gaining knowledge of the skeletal system makes it easier for us to sculpt a realistic looking human body.\nWe will learn all about each individual muscle that appear on the surface of the skin. We will understand where each muscle starts and where it ends, that way when we are sculpting, we are placing the muscles accurately. When you are sculpting a character, whether you are using references or straight from your imagination, it's important to accurately depict their correct attachment points, otherwise you will just end up with a very weird looking character.\nWe will learn about proportions and how the  male and female body is different from each other. I will show you how you can study the anatomy the right way so you can achieve great results. By dissecting each surface forms that we see on the real photos, we can get clarity of what we are drawing or sculpting, that way we are not just guessing, but actually sculpting with thought and precision.\nAfter we get acclimated with the human anatomy, we will apply what we have learned to create a character from scratch. We start by defining the basic shape and structure of the character. Then we we will add layers of detail like wrinkles and pores to really make our character come to life.\n\n\nTo make our character pop out, we will go through the process of texturing. We begin by creating clean UVs for our character so our colors and textures will line up correctly and seamlessly. We will then project our high poly details to our low poly mesh and bake our texture map. We will create realistic skin blemishes to provide depth to our character and construct a skin shader that will really make our character look believable. Using Blender's powerful hair system, we go through the process of creating hair for our character's head and body. We will shape the hair by sculpting and using geometry nodes\nTo give our character mobility and personality, we will go through the process of rigging. We start by setting up the skeletal system where we can adjust individual joints to make our character pose in anyway we can imagine. Last we will take our work into Photoshop or any free 2d software that you like so we can enhance our character and create an appealing background.\nIf you are ready to create a 3d character that actually looks like a human character, then the Anatomy and Character Creation course in Blender in just for you. You will learn everything you need to be able to make incredibly detailed and lifelike characters. Take your character creations skills to the next level, come and join this course at Victory3D.",

With the right workflow and pipeline this method can potentially also save you much time in comparison to modelling and texturing manually. Several big production companies use this method for creating their 3D content for these reasons.\nAfter completing this course you will be able to create a 3D model with texture of your own using Agisoft PhotoScan. The same basic principals apply to other photography based photogrammetry software as well.\nThis course is aimed towards those who have no prior experience working with photogrammetry or Agisoft PhotoScan. At the end of the course we will also briefly look at how you can approach retopologizing/decimating your model to fit your end needs, i.e. creating a version of the models with your desired about of polygons.\nThe only prerequisite you will need for this course is a fairly capable computer running Windows, MacOS or Linux to participate. Preferably you also own or have access to a digital camera to work with your own unique projects, but you will get access to a few series of photos that you may use for learning purposes. Agisoft PhotoScan is available as a trial and a demo version for those who do not own the software yet or just want to try it out. These versions will work perfectly fine for this course*.\n* The demo version cannot export the results and therefor you cannot try out the retopology/decimation parts of this course with it.",

      "description": "Stop your “I don’t have time for this” and animate quickly, using a powerful technique that helps you animate with just a few clicks and drags.\nThe most common reason why people neglect to pursue something in their lives is because the lack of time. Lots of work, lots of things to do.\nThat’s the very reason why millions of people love to learn how to do things faster and easier.\nBut how can you do something if there is no such way yet?\nFrustration hurts, but I had to overcome it. And better yet, help others to avoid it.\nWhen I started to take a bit of my sleep time to start a project in animation, I just knew it was going to take me forever, and after the frustration of dropping the project for a couple of months, I came back for revenge! (Not in the negative way, more like in an EPIC WAY!)\nIt was after watching a couple of tutorials for After Effects on Video Copilot that I learned the power of expressions. Got me inspired. There could actually be a way to solve this!\nAs you know, there is no spoiler in saying this, but yes, I found a way. HOORAY!\nFinally, a solution!\nThat solution is what this course is about. Teaching you how to speed up your animation time with an advanced technique: Rigged Characters.\nRigging characters has been used since a couple of years ago, but what I teach you here is how to automate the movements by using expressions (Java code and lots math) inside After Effects to give you the ability to move your characters with just clicks and drags.\nJust check 1 hour of free lessons to see if you find the techniques interesting.\n“What options do I have for animating a character?”\nPicture this. You have a project in your mind, let’s say, a 2 minute animation. You have the plot in your mind, it’s a good story and you even have the main characters drawn and ready.\nYou know how to use After Effects, because you went to Video Copilot and learned the basics for free.\nOption 1: Puppet tool\nYou could put your drawings inside After Effects and put a couple of puppet pins, so you can move the character by changing the position of the pins. Right? Well that takes a lot of time to animate, it’s faster than drawing frame-by-frame, but still takes a lot of time.\nOption 2: Cut out animation\nMaybe you don’t know about the puppet tool technique and you just split the character into the different parts of the body. The arms, the legs, the body and the head. Everything in a separate layer. Animating that “rig” takes a lot of time too. Maybe it’s faster than classical animation but it won't be as fast as a few clicks and drags to change the position.\nWhat can you do to make it super fast?\nOption 3: Advanced Rigging\nUsing a powerful rig that calculates everything for you so you only have to make a few clicks and drags to change the position of your character.\nIt’s so easy that you will remember when you played with toys\nHave you ever played with toys? If you wanted to raise the hand of your Action Figure or your Barbie, all you had to do was to take the hand and raise it right? Imagine if animating was that simple.\nWell, this is what this course is going to teach you. How to change body positions in a snap.\nWhen you find a solution, everybody wants to know it\nAfter I came up with this technique, I brought it to the studio I work for (I do motion graphics for commercials), and they went crazy. They started to ask me for lots of tips because I knew that the secret to be faster in animation was by using expressions.\nAnybody who knows how to use After Effects knows that the secret to speed up your work is by automating with expressions. And the only way I could help everybody, was by organizing the process and create a couple of videos.\nThat’s when the idea for this course was born.\nRigged Characters are the common way to speed your animation, everybody knows that\nRigged Characters are what most professionals under a schedule use. I’m talking about Nickelodeon, Disney TV. They all use techniques to rig characters and animate faster.\nBut until now, there was no way you could achieve all this in After Effects, you had to do your animation in Toon Boom, or Animate Studio. What about us? The After Effects Community?\nWell, this is my contribution. An Advanced Rig that helps you control your character easily and quickly, all inside After Effects.\nIf you haven’t checked yet, take a look at 1 hour of free lessons and see for yourself how easy you can achieve this rig, and how it can help you to animate faster.\n“It all sounds great, but, What level of knowledge do I need?”\nBecause I know there is a lot of people who doesn’t know how to use After Effects, I made an update and included a tour of the software. Everyone is getting it now. And if you are a veteran user, you might discover some advanced little tips that can help you cut your work time in half.\nCheck the reviews.\nAnimating faster is not only something people with little time need, but also big studios who work under a schedule. This course will help you achieve faster times, deliver work earlier and stay ahead of schedule.\n“What if I don’t understand something? What if I need help?”\nIf you have a question, just ask me and I try to reach as fast as possible. I answer all questions, mostly on the same day. I check my inbox twice a day.\nAnd just so you know, this course has had tons of modifications thanks to the many questions I received. Many lessons have been re recorded so anyone can understand the concepts. Really, any doubt you have is actually a way to help improve this course.\nCheck the free lessons now!\nWhat are you waiting for? Preview the free hour of video lessons and if you believe this course is what you were looking for, enroll for the complete 4.5 hour course and discover the secret techniques that can help you cut your working time in half.\nInside you will find the project files to follow along and easy to follow instructions to achieve this powerful technique.\nEnroll today!",

Looking to quickly replace your workflow in other 3D applications with Houdini?\n\nIn this course I've made it easy to learn Houdini. The course is designed to instantly get you up and running in the software, by creating a product-shot. Therefore you can easily replace your current 3D application with Houdini and start diving intro more complex topic from there.\nLike many others I've started learning Houdini by instantly diving into particle networks and fluid simulations. But it actually took me a while before I really started to understand some basic principles, like using normals and UV's in Houdini. Resulting in jumping back and forth between 3D application. Therefore I've created this course to give you a solid foundation in Houdini.\nYou'll learn how to download and install Houdini, how the UI works and how to work with nodes in general. From there we'll dive into topics like working with primitives, creating cameras, working with point colour, bending deformers, groups, copy objects, splines and sweeps, lathes (revolve), booleans, copy to points, extrude objects, normals and UV's.\nLastly we'll look into rendering in Redshift, using attributes, textures, Maxon noise, HDR lighting, dappled light, sunlight, different types of materials, and Postfx.\nSo if you're ready to start your journey in Houdini then sign up today and get started!",

      "description": "Welcome to the Complete Guide to Dynamic Paint in Blender. In this class you will learn everything there is to know about Dynamic Paint and how it works. It was also created for all skill levels. So whether you are a complete beginner or an intermediate Blender user, this class is for you! Not many people know about Dynamic Paint or how it works, so that is why I created this class where more can learn about this amazing modifier and create their own animations!\n\n\nWhat is Dynamic Paint?\nDynamic paint is a modifier and physics system that can turn objects into paint canvases and brushes. Doing this allows you to create vertex colors, image sequences or displacement. This makes effects like footsteps in the snow, raindrops and paint that sticks to walls very easy to create!\n\n\nIn the first couple sections we will discuss all of the different settings and values and how they change how the simulation works. You will see side by side comparisons so it's easy to understand exactly what is happening. A variety of other topics also covered include adding dynamic paint to materials, creating footprints in the snow, paint drying effects and much more.\n\n\nOne of the best ways to learn is to create something yourself, so that is why I have included 3 tutorials in which we use Dynamic Paint to create some high quality animations.\nThe first one is about creating an abstract displacement effect. You will learn how to export an image sequence from Dynamic Paint and use that for the displacement. Then to top it off you will be creating a glowing material.\n\n\nThe 2nd tutorial is about creating a disintegrating fire effect. This tutorial will cover many topics including: fire simulations, dynamic weight painting, proximity brushes and fire materials.\n\n\nFinally the last tutorial will be about creating a seamless rain drop animation. For this one we use particles and dynamic waves to learn how to make the animation seamless so it can loop over and over again.\n\n\nIf you are looking to learn about Dynamic Paint and how it all works in Blender this is the class for you! So hit that enrollment button and let's get started! I look forward to seeing what you create!\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\nStephen",

      "description": "This course and its creator are not affiliated with, maintained, endorsed or sponsored by Unity Technologies or any of its affiliates.  This is an independent, unofficial course.\n\nThis course is authorized by, and made in partnership with, Maxon, creators of Cinema 4D\n\nIf you are interested in developing amazing, commercial quality game art on a variety of platforms, then you've come to the right place. This course is the only one of its kind that is approved by Maxon on Udemy. What better way to learn how to develop game art in Cinema 4D than with their authorized course? \"Learn to Create 3D Character Art with Cinema 4D\" introduces you to Cinema 4D (C4D), a very popular 3D program, used in advertising, design, architecture, movies, the commercial VFX industry, broadcasting, motion graphics, and now, games and visualization.  This course dives into creating your first 3D character using all of the amazing tools provided inside the standard version of C4D.\n\n\nIn this Cinema 4D course, you will:\n\n\nBuild a custom 3D character\nUnwrap the character’s UV channel using C4D’s UV mapping tools\nPaint our characters in 2D and 3D modes simultaneously using Bodypaint\nPaint on individual channels separately to achieve a high level of accuracy\nUse the new sculpting features to apply high-polygon sculpting data while maintaining our low-poly game character\nCustomize hair on our game character\nRig, weight, and animate using Mixamo\nDeliver our character in an optimized state into Unity using FBX tools in C4D\nAnd more!\n\n\n\nThis authorized Cinema 4D course also includes a handful of interactive challenges, (new content added frequently) where you can test your knowledge with concepts you've just learned. These challenges will be a great way to review the techniques discussed and help ensure that complicated techniques such as UV Unwrapping, Sculpting, and Bodypaint are easily grasped and become second nature.  By the end of this course, you will bring this character into Unity, apply its materials and animations, and press play to see your game character come to life.\n\n\n\nWhy Learn Character Art in Unity Using C4D?\nThe gaming industry is a $100 billion industry worldwide. By 2020, that number is expected to near $120 billion. With Unity being the most widely used engine to develop games across multiple platforms, there has never been a better time to get into the field. As an artist, your value to the game development pipeline is extremely important.  The visuals you create can make or break a game.  Unless a consumer is familiar with a game, the first impression they get is through the graphics.  If you create stunning visuals and optimize assets, you will very likely be a key player in the game’s success.  Upon completion of this course, you will be able to build assets not only for games, but also for online sales via the Asset Store.  The skills gained in this course can be applied to the world of advertising, marketing, VFX, and architecture, in addition to game development.  This course aims to take an intimidating subject and make it beginner friendly, approachable, and engaging.  Together, we will walk through UV Unwrapping, Sculpting, and Bodypaint to help you achieve a greater understanding of 3D art concepts that you can use to further your career as a Video Game Artist.\n\n\nWhy Learn From Me\nThis is the first and only Cinema 4D course aimed at game development that has been endorsed by Maxon.  I have been a guest speaker for Maxon USA for years at major trade/convention shows and am an adamant supporter of their technologies. They believe in games, they believe in AR/VR, and they believe that Cinema 4D is the perfect tool to build beautiful game assets.  This course shows my entire workflow, and if you do happen to fall behind, models that are relevant to the current tutorial have been added so you will be able to stay on course.  Coming from 15 years of VFX/Mograph experience, my approach is current, relevant, and actively used today.  I’ve helped others on YouTube with Cinema 4D tutorials since 2008 and though C4D is commonly used in movies, television, architecture, and design, I want to share my knowledge of how to build game art using C4D, a lesser known, but more efficient way of creating game art..\n\n\nI’ve been working in Cinema 4D since version R10 (currently are on R20) and have never looked back.  As a motion graphics designer, I worked for MGM Resorts International and developed/ran a team of designers who built content on marquees on the Las Vegas Strip, on the casino floor, and on in-room channels.  After leaving the company, I started Renderready, LLC and have worked in commercial advertising and marketing.  Clients include MGM Resorts International, Deloitte, Pepsi, Devry, Vegas Golden Knights, T-Mobile and more.  Upon completing this Cinema 4D course, you will understand the basic concepts of character modeling and design. You will also learn advanced topics such as Bodypaint, Sculpting, and UV unwrapping and will be able to confidently create beautiful game art for you and your team.\nJoin me on this adventure today!  I’ll see you inside the course.",

Most of the lessons are easy to follow practical examples where I take you through the design of a product step by step.\nTypically people model for laser cutting using 2D softwares like Illustrator or Inkscape. These work fine for simple designs, but If you really want to create interesting or more complex designs they often fall short. That is where 3D modeling comes in. I have learned and developed methods and techniques to design for laser cutting using 3d modeling, and in this course I want to share them with you!\nBy the end of the course you will be able to create designs that are quite simply impossible to design using 2d softwares, and you will do it effortlessly and while having fun doing so. Some of the topics I cover are: the fundamentals of 3d modeling and working with Fusion 360, parametric product modeling, incorporating movement into your design and how to design for foldable materials like cardboard. You also learn how to Render your designs\nEach lesson builds upon the knowledge gained in the previous lessons, and by the end you will have enough experience and confidence to start creating your own designs for Laser Cutting in 3d.\nThis course is perfect for you if you are interested in laser cutting. The specific factors you need to take into account for laser cutting are thoroughly discussed, and you will also build your 3d modeling skills needed to realize your ideas.",

      "description": "In this course you will learn how to create a fully procedural walk/run animation system for characters, entirely within Unreal Engine 5.1+\n\nThis system will allow you to control every aspect of the characters walk and run style, with manual control over every bone, using custom logic and variables inside Control Rig (which allows for very good performance, allowing it to be used on many characters at once).\n\nWith a fully procedural animation system, your characters will fit within their environment and adapt their movement based on the surroundings. Whether the character is walking, running or anywhere in between, standing with one foot on a ledge, walking across stepping stones, running up a ramp backwards whilst spinning in circles, or any other situation your character may find themselves in.\n\nTo create this level of interaction with traditional static animations, you would need to create hundreds if not thousands of walk cycle variations and a complex system to blend between different animations at the appropriate times. Then if you'd like to make a tweak, such as to change the character's walk style or speed, you would have to start all over again.\n\nInstead, with a procedural system, we figure out the logic that dictates how a human actually walks: where they place their feet, how their speed influences their stride time, how they swing their hips and spine to accommodate for their leg movements; to create an intelligent system that mimics how a human (or any character) would walk.\n\nAfter you've created the system (which is included as a download for use or reference), you can adapt it to any character you may want in the future. For example, you may create a heavier & stronger character for your game, perhaps a robot / mech / monster, and instead of spending hours creating walk cycles to figure out how he should move, you simply tweak a few numbers in the procedural system to see how the character looks when he stamps his feet whilst walking, or takes longer strides, or swings his arms like a madman.\n\n\nWe don't rely on any major inbuilt functions within the engine, and so the same concepts and techniques can apply to any form of procedural animation. For example, after completing the course, you may want to take what you've learnt about creating procedural human animations and use the same concepts to make a procedural swimming animation for a shark. Or procedural weapon recoil controlled by the strength of the gun. Or a parkour climbing system. In theory, anything that can be animated can be animated procedurally. Is it always beneficial? No. But procedural animation is the best solution for any animations which need to be adaptive and change based on the environment, user input, or gameplay events. The best part is, everything we create in this course runs as a single node in the animation blueprint, allowing you to blend it with regular animations, or any input pose for the character.\n\nThis is not a course where I simply tell you what buttons to press. Every single step is explained, and the thought process behind decisions about what to do next is discussed, so you will always have an idea of why we're doing each step. We routinely take a look at what we have created so far to analyse it for further improvements.\n\n\nThe information and ideas in this course are not available anywhere else, trust me; I have looked, as all of the solutions are a result of 7 years of experimentation with procedural animation. This method of animation isn't being done to this degree by any game developers yet, only basic hybrid IK systems, and I strongly believe it will be the primary form of character animation in the next few years.\n\nI have set up a Discord server where you can directly ask me any questions, or see the results of other students of the course. If there are any areas that you don't understand or need further explanations, I'll be happy to help, and look forward to seeing your results!",

We'll have a PBR material overview to learn what physically based materials are.\nWe'll also cover the material blends and domains and find out the differences between each one. Next up, we'll look at the shading models that we will create during the course. The last part of volume one will be a more intermediate level of creating a computer screen material with different components and even creating a material function. Volume 2 will go over just materials, where we will firstly look at creating a basic skin shader and understand what subsurface scattering is. The second material will be a car material which will use the clear coat model and look at creating material attributes. We will then make an ocean shader and then lastly create a slightly advanced material where we will create a dynamic material there has a weather like function to it with snow, rain and dryness.\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nSince graduating university in 2015, Kyle has contributed to multiple small game projects.

However, you will be expected to know the basics like navigating the viewport, using the scale, rotate, move tools, etc.\nIn this tutorial, we're gonna be covering the basics of Modelling, Texturing, Lighting and Rendering in Blender so you can take your 3d art skills to the next level.\nSo what are you waiting for? Just start this class today and take your blender skills to a whole new level!\n\n\nThe project of this class is quite simple, yet very exciting!\nYou will create a product render similar to the ones which I showed in the class but you will add something extra or make some changes to the design, textures, lighting or camera angle so that you are actually learning and not blindly following a tutorial. You can choose any product which you want and there are absolutely no rules so you can be as creative as you want!\nTrust me, when you complete this project, you will feel much more confident and comfortable in Blender!\nWhen you are done, kindly upload your final render to the Project section of this class so I can give you feedback and suggestions.\nThank you!",

You’ll learn how to use layer masks in Substance Painter to quickly create realistic textures for your 3D objects.\nWe’ll set up a Blender export template in Substance Painter, and export our texture maps so that we can use Blender’s Node Wrangler to easily apply the textures to our scene. Next we’ll work on lighting the scene, and rendering using Blender’s Cycles render engine. We’ll animate the camera and use Blender’s Video Sequence Editor to edit our rendered shots together. We’ll even add some music and then render it all out to a single mp4 video file.\nIf you’re interested in creating environments for animation or video games, then this course is for you. You’ll learn how to create a realistic, detailed scene from the first polygon to the final render. So join me as we “Create a Victorian Room with Blender and Substance Painter.”",

You will learn about 3D modeling and UV mapping in Blender, as well as creating materials and textures in Substance Painter. We will also go over lighting and rendering in Blender; and even use Blender’s Video Sequence Editor to edit our final video.\n\n\nWhat do I get?\nThis course contains 116 videos totaling more than 18 hours of content. You will also have access to the course project files which include the Blender scene files, the reference images, and HDR images.\n\n\nWhat will we do?\nWe will begin by setting up our reference images in Blender. We will import side, front, and back views to help us with the creation and placement of our 3D models. You’ll learn about Blender’s modifier stack, how uniform scale can improve the effectiveness of Blender’s tools, and some tips and tricks about staying organized during a large project such as this.\n\n\nOnce the modeling is complete, we will work on UV mapping each of the objects that make up the motorcycle. You’ll learn about the different methods of UV mapping that Blender has to offer, and how to efficiently pack your UV islands within the UV texture space.\n\n\nThen it’s time to export our model out of Blender and bring it into Substance Painter for texturing. You’ll learn how to use layer masks, and generators, and grunge maps to create detailed, realistic textures. And when the textures are complete, you’ll learn how to export Color, Normal, Metallic, and Roughness maps that are compatible with Blender and set them up to the appropriate materials.\n\n\nFinally, we will use HDR images to light the scene and then render multiple shots that can be edited together in Blender Video Sequence Editor.\n\n\nWhy should I get this?\nIf you’ve ever wanted to create detailed, realistic objects in Blender then this course is for you. You’ll learn all of the modeling techniques and texturing tools you’ll need to create impressive, complex models for games and animations. This is a comprehensive course that takes you from the first polygon to the final render and gives you all the tools you need to create your own amazing projects.",

With over 23,000 learners and 1,700+ reviews, I’ve helped thousands of students take their Blender skills to the next level. Now, I invite you to join me in this exciting course where we will create the legendary Jeep Willys MB 1942 from start to finish using Blender.\n\n\nThis course is a complete workflow, showing you how to build a complex and historically accurate vehicle with nothing but Blender. We start by setting up our reference images and aligning them perfectly to lay the foundation for the modeling process.\n\n\nThe modeling phase takes the majority of the course time, as the Jeep Willys is filled with intricate parts and detailed components. Together, we’ll go step by step, starting from simple primitives and transforming them into complex shapes. You’ll also discover hidden tricks and powerful techniques that make the modeling process easier, faster, and more precise.\n\n\nOnce the modeling is complete, we move to the unwrapping stage, preparing the vehicle for proper texturing so every detail looks accurate and clean. In the materials section, we’ll create realistic shaders one by one, adding imperfections, rust, and age to bring the Jeep to life. These touches will make your model look authentic and battle-worn, enhancing the realism to a professional level.\n\n\nFinally, we’ll set up the camera and rendering environment. Using HDRI lighting, we’ll create a natural outdoor look that gives the final render an incredibly realistic result, just like real automotive photography.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have a fully modeled, textured, and rendered Jeep Willys MB 1942, a portfolio-ready project that demonstrates advanced skills in modeling, materials, and rendering. More importantly, you’ll gain the knowledge, techniques, and workflow confidence to tackle any complex modeling project in Blender.\nJoin today, and let’s bring history to life in 3D with the Jeep Willys MB 1942!",

      "description": "Hi and welcome to this new 3D Tudor Udemy course, ‘Blender 2.8 A Beginners Complete Sci-Fi Scene 3D Modelling & Animation Guide’. With this course, I decided to move to pastures anew and explore an art style that I am not as familiar with. Having mainly focused on the medieval genre in previous courses I decided that, this time, I would take my students on a journey into the world of the sci-fi genre. This way, we are learning together, and trial and error will help your workflow as you will be presented with solutions to common problems.\n\n\nThis is one of my most exciting Udemy courses to date. Like my other Udemy course, ‘Blender 2.8 Model Texture Animate & Simulate Complete Guide’, I will be taking you on an extensive 3D modelling journey involving modelling, texturing, freebies, animation, lighting and rendering a sci-fi scene. The focus of this Udemy course is to show you how to make realistic models, to a real-world scale. Enroll in this Blender 2.8 course and experience over 20 hours of content, full of learning opportunities to take your 3D modeling, animation and simulations skills to the next level. By completing this course, you will walk away with a comprehensive view of how to model from the ground up, with a super-fast industry-standard workflow.  All this exclusively in Blender 2.8.\n\n\nUsing everything I learned from previous courses, mainly from all your helpful feedback, I was able to make a course that really has the wow-factor; something you will be proud of accomplishing.\n\n\nThis is my most beginner-friendly and in-depth Udemy course to date. The focus of this new course is to take anyone no matter their level in 3D modelling and teach them how to model from the ground up. The course has nearly 20 hours of content and is a one-stop course to take you on your way to a professional level. By joining this Udemy course you will engage in a journey of in-depth learning focused on the most important aspects of 3D modelling and animation. Blender Procedures will cover modelling, texturing, animation, lighting, and rendering. By the end of the course, you will have created a professional-looking sci-fi animated door scene.\n\n\nThis course has been 3 months in the making. I truly believe that this Udemy course is unique compared to other courses currently on the market. I really hope you enjoy taking the course as much as I have had to create it.\n\n\nModelling\nWe will be creating a sci-fi door scene – a contraption reminiscent of popular cinema titles. This course is coming out just a few months before a major game release that will revolutionize the sci-fi genre, Cyberpunk 2077 by Project Red. The sci-fi door we will be creating will be a more stylized version of the general sci-fi style.\n\n\n‘Blender 2.8 A Beginners Complete Sci-Fi 3D Modelling & Animation Guide’ has a new learning format that will be relevant to beginners. This course is also relevant to those students who more familiar with 3D creation and modelling using Blender software, or those who are transitioning into Blender from another piece of software or from the previous older versions of Blender.\n\n\nThis Udemy course aims to teach you from the ground up. It will cover the very basics of modelling and teach you the tips and tricks that the pros use in Blender 2.8. This course explains everything and will include a step-by-step exploration of all the new shortcuts that have come with this new Blender version. You will be able to keep up with the course’s pace through having an on-screen visual tooltip. Anything that needs some explanation is explained easily using a small pop-up box, so you will never be lost. My goal here is to not only have students re-create this sci-fi door but for them to come away with a comprehensive understanding of how and why. By the end of the course, the knowledge you will have learned can be put to use independent of the direction you take in 3D modelling – following the amateur or the professional path.\n\n\nTexturing\nTexturing is perhaps the most important part of any 3D model. I will show you the most efficient and quickest ways of preparing a mesh for adding materials in Blender. We will be going over how to mark seems, how to correct texture resolutions, and how to UV-unwrap. All these course components would be a course in their own right, so by enrolling, you will be able to develop your skills in a multi-faceted way. To save time on your usual trial and error process, I will show you both the right and the wrong way of doing this. You will be fully prepared and provided with the skills to ‘clean’ a 3D model mesh to an industry standard.\n\n\nWe will also explore the Blender 2.8 node system in depth, where you will learn not only how to import textures and maps, but also how to change the way materials look. We also take a look at importing and using specialized maps like ambient occlusion and emission.\n\n\nAnimation\nHave you ever wanted to learn how to build a full animation cycle? The learning outcomes of this Udemy course include creating a complete animation cycle in Blender 2.8. As part of animating this sci-fi door, we will be working on making its opening motion realistic, working hard to make each individual component move in a hyper-real way. You will learn all about armatures and bones, and you will be shown how to keyframe. We will move on to the complex fundamentals of animations, where we learn how to weight and attach bones to meshes. This is exactly the same process as in Hollywood for computer-generated imaging (CGI) or the respective gaming industry. You can apply these skills to any animations you decide to make in the future, and I would be excited to see you upload animations of other models as part of this Udemy course project.\n\n\nFreebies\nYou will be glad to know that this Udemy course comes with a vast library of over 70 high-resolution texture maps and decals completely free to download with this course. These are resources that you are free to download and reuse in your other projects. You could also utilize them in the sci-fi door scene course project, which you are encouraged to upload as part of this course. I created all these textures and resources using a mix of Substance Designer, Substance Painter, and Photoshop. All textures included for free with this course are custom made specifically for this course.\n\n\nLighting\nI always feel that lighting is one of the key components that tend to be the most overlooked. To be honest, I learned this the hard way, seeing as lighting is important with regards to making a scene look overwhelmingly beautiful or realistic or tragically bad. I went back to the drawing board and developed my skills in Blender and in lighting. Over time, I learned exactly how to light scenes. This knowledge I now pass on to my students. You will learn all about Blender 2.8 lighting and lighting effects.\n\n\nRendering\nFinally, after all the preparations for making a realistic sci-fi scene, we will be rendering two stills in one of the best renderers in the industry - Blender cycles. Because of this course, you will gain the knowledge to create great-looking scenes in both ‘Eevee’ and ‘Cycles’ renderers. We will also be using the Blender 2.8 compositor, and the course will teach you how to make the most of lighting within a render. Finally, we will also be creating a short animation film using Blender’s built-in video editing software. We will be setting up cameras and I will be going through different techniques to help improve the quality of your renders.\n\n\nHappy modelling everyone!\nNeil, 3D Tudor",

      "description": "Corazon Bryant always had an artistic bone in her body. When she was only 2 years old, she would make detailed drawings on her mother's wall. Her mother loved the drawings so much, she decided to keep them. With the encouragement of her mother, she continued drawing and she only got better as time went by. When Corazon was in middle and high school, she earned money making portraits for her classmates and even for her teachers. She pursued a college degree in Media Arts & Animation and later worked for architectural and entertainment companies such as Camm Productions, ID DI Design, and PDT International. She also had an opportunity to do some freelance work for Mega Pickle Entertainment. While working as a 3D artist, she had a chance to teach 3D animation classes in an A+ school. This is when she found her true love - which is not only to talk about 3D endlessly but to also inspire greatness in young upcoming artists. Corazon is currently working on a new project called Victory 3D with fellow industry-experienced artists to provide an affordable and effective learning system that will make it easier for students to get a job in the 3D industry.\nCourse Info\nHave you been looking for a course that shows you how to make a realistic full body character, sculpt likeness, retopologize, unwrap, texture, and render all in one place? Then look no further. This course is for you. In this course, I will take you through the process of creating a beautiful female character and make it production-ready for films and animations.\nThe main topics we will be covering are:\n\n-Sculpting a female character from head to toe\n-Sculpting believable clothing\n-Variety of retopology methods for movie characters\n-Full body UDIM workflow\n-Marvelous to Maya Retopology and UV creation\n-Industry techniques for painting detailed textures\n-Realistic skin shader, metal & cloth materials\n-Creating realistic hair in Xgen\n-High quality lighting and rendering using Arnold\nBefore starting this course, you should have a basic understanding of Zbrush, Maya, and Photoshop. No knowledge of Wrap, Marvelous Designer and Mari is needed as I will teach you the basics of these programs.\nIn this comprehensive course, we will begin by working on our female face and body using Zbrush. I will go over the major forms that you need to know to be able to produce a realistic female character. We will create details such as skin pores and tiny wrinkles to bring life to our character. We will learn about different ways of retopologizing our character, using automatic retopology and manual retopology using Wrap and Maya. We will generate our UV map for our character using the UDIM workflow. I will go over what UDIMs are, and why they are important when it comes to creating high resolution textures. You will learn how to simulate clothing using Marvelous Designer. We will then take our clothes in Maya to retopologize them to create a clean mesh, and then back into Zbrush to create major folds, minor folds, and memory folds. We will use Mari to hand paint our skin from scratch. I will show you exactly how to make different types of maps such as color map, specular map, and sss map step by step. We will create real world shaders such as silk, metal, and skin and we will go through the process of learning how to connect our maps properly. Then we move on to creating our hair using Zbrush and Maya. We will create our main hair using Fibermesh, then we go inside Maya to make Nhair for our braids that we will then use for our Xgen hair. We will create realistic eyebrows, eyelashes and peachfuzz all using one of the most powerful tools in Maya called Xgen. Last, I will show you how to create a nice clean render using Arnold and do some postwork in Photoshop to further enhance our image.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to create your own amazing female character that is fully ready for production.\nIf you are ready to challenge yourself and get out of your comfort zone to be a great artist, then it’s time for you to sign up for this course. There are no limitations on what you can be, have or do, as you are the master of your artistic journey. Make today the day that you take action, come and join this course at Victory3D.",

      "description": "As a 3D artist I am quite familiar with all the pitfalls and difficulties of learning how to work with 3Ds Max and VRAY 5, and my objective for this course is to use my experience in the field to present some of the most essential and useful techniques which could help you in your own projects. As a general rule, I always make use of simplicity and clarity in my tutorials and additionally for this workshop I have tried my best to transfer some of the most important points in VRAY and Interior design and rendering in as short of a time as possible. I have also included my own go-to setting parameters to achieve the best interior renders possible, and explaining the most effective options that are crucial for having the most realistic renders.\n\n\nOne of the biggest problems that 3D artists face is that they do not know what type of render setup to use in their scenes for both their test renders and the final render. Furthermore, they do not know how to light their interior scenes properly to achieve a realistic atmosphere and also take fast renders during their project. They may also have difficulties creating their required materials resulting in a very unnatural-looking render with objects that do not resemble real-life at all.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, in this course I have tried to familiarize you with the easiest and yet the most helpful methods used to place and setup your cameras in your scene in a that you will have an easy time advancing the next phases of your projects. I sincerely believe that if the cameras are placed and adjusted properly, a big portion of the work is done because they play a big role in helping achieve realistic renders that would make the untrained eye doubt whether they are an actual photo or a render. The shared optimal setting for camera setting parameters that I share with you, regardless of what version of 3Ds MAX or VRAY you're using, will help you take the best renders possible.\n\n\nNext, you will learn all the required tips and techniques to implement both natural and artificial lights in your scene so that you could have a great contrast in the scene. These tips, some of which would defy and challenge the popular beliefs regarding lighting essentials, will help you get the best-looking renders really quickly.\n\n\nAfter that we will move on to creating, changing and assigning materials to our objects in a normal interior scene. There are a lot of 3D artist who have taken several courses in 3D design but yet struggle when it comes to creating realistic and life-like materials in their projects. The problem arises from their lack of knowledge in all the different options and maps used when working with the material editor. In this course, I will take you through a step by step and simple review of those maps and options that could just revolutionize your idea of material design and manipulation which will ultimately bring about realistic objects. Additionally, you will learn how to combine several textures and maps to create complex objects.\n\n\nNext, you will learn how to adjust the different parameters in the frame buffer and render setup so that you would not have to use any third-party software like photoshop etc... as a post-production method to elevate and embellish your final renders. A lot of the published renders in the field lack the required sharpness and realism that could the project to the next level, and that is the reason a lot of 3D artists have gone on to use other software to improve their renders. In this workshop I will teach you to take multiple renders without any limitation as to the suitable camera angles and you will not be needing to add anything to your final renders at all.\n\n\nFinally, I will take you through some of the most useful and important features of VRAY 5 such as downloading, installing and implementing a material library that could provide you with a list of great readily-available materials and textures for your work. Also, I will teach you how to change any light parameter in your scene without taking multiple renders or interactive ones, simply using the newly added feature in VRAY 5 called Light MIX.",

Recognized as a Living Master by the Art Renewal Center, Juan is known for his Portrait and Figurative works. His works and commissions hang in public as well as private collections in Canada, US, and Europe.\nAs an educator, Juan was a Senior Instructor at the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto and conducted workshops Internationally. He authored several articles for major art publications. Juan frequently lectures on technical or art historical and other matters relating to representational art and its grand traditions.\nToday, Juan continually develops his body of work and maintains an influence as a teacher and mentor, and as a commissioned portrait painter. He also welcomes inquiry regarding available work, commissions, or about instruction, lectures, and workshops.\n\n\n- TESTIMONIALS -\n\"Juan was instrumental to my growth as a painter, and I would not be the artist I am today without his guidance. He's not only a great teacher but very fun and interesting with knowledge in topics beyond the visual arts that relate directly to them. He is possibly an ancient wizard, despite his age claims, he looks not a day over 40.\"\n\n\n- David Shepherd\n\"I had the great pleasure of working with Juan Martinez during his tenure at the Academy of Realist Art here in Toronto. The school offered a one-week course in 'alla-prima portrait painting' with senior instructor Juan Martinez and I immediately signed up. I had been a drawer for the past 50 years, so I was relatively new to painting having only started to paint in 2003. I felt that an intensive portrait painting workshop with one of the ARA’s principle instructors would be helpful in broadening my abilities.\nDay One of the workshop began with a 3-hour demo by Juan and I immediately knew I was in the right place. Not only was he a superb painter, but his explanations of the process of painting were clear and well-directed to the various student levels in the room. His understanding of light and shadow and (more importantly) his ability to pass this understanding on to his students was remarkable. Over the week I found Juan to be an excellent instructor with personal, individual help for every student and an easy-going charm in the classroom. Would I sign up for the course again? Absolutely.\"\n- Brian Smith AOCA",

In this case, a cute carrot. Even the most simple 3D sculpts can actually be quite complicated depending on how much fine detail you want to put in. The good thing is that is what makes 3D with Nomad Sculpt fun!\n- We'll then move into adding eyes, eye lashes, and details to get it looking a bit more \"real\".\n- Setting up our carrot with the most flattering lighting possible and then adding color. Feel free to experiment\nwith colors and textures! Remember, this is your art so you don't have to follow everything that I do. Rogues are welcome!\n- Once we've finished with coloring and lighting we can start post processing and adjust the scene and character before export.  Exporting or \"Rendering\" means you've successfully created your first 3D character! Or maybe it isn't your first, but I hope you learned some new tricks and ways of thinking throughout!\nThe ideas and ways of thinking are most of what I want to leave you with...shapes are very easy to make, so just think of everything as shapes or part of shapes. Shapes within shapes even. I've found that even the most complicated sculpts aren't so bad when I just break them down into one shape after another. Veggies for instance: A grape is pretty much a sphere. Banana is a stretched sphere. Cucumber slice is a cylinder. A snow cone is a cone with a sphere on top. As you continue to sculpt more and more you'll find the shapes much easier and your sculpting will get faster and faster.",

It is so easy, yet so incredibly powerful that you can start having fun without immediately worrying about technicalities.\nSome positive feedback from current students:\n\"This is an excellent course and I really enjoy your teaching style. I've been over section 2 at least 10 times now and there's so much gold in there. As a musician there's noway I could listen to a topic over and over if the instructor was monotonous, condescending or other, but you speak easily and naturally with highly relevant content and an excellent commend of the subject. By working in an almost free form fashion and uncovering limitations and mistakes in both program and design makes the course much more useful and educational.\"\n--------------------------\n\"Wow, first of all, I MUST say: I'm 14 lectures in and after the 1st or 2nd ... this series is truly awesome. Feel free to quote me on that. I've even told all my design friends about it.\"\n--------------------------\n\"Nobody has put anything together that's quite like this. Some of Javis Jones' tuts are great, but you also add a tremendously strong elements of ideation and practical, captivating design-dev skills along with how the tools work ... kudos, my friend. Also wanted to say: good vocal/video pacing as well, very engaging, never-ever boring!\"\n--------------------------\n\"Such a creative way to use the tools. I am learning new methods for designing complex shapes and I am only about 4 lessons in. I really have to thank you and I am so glad I purchased this course. I've been in a bit of a rut with 3D - Coat, wanting to use it but putting it off and sticking with what I am comfortable with (polygon modelling in MODO) but you have really opened my eyes with your course. Thank you so much\"\n\n\n\n--------------------------\n\n\n\nWe begin the course looking at a variety of ways to create 3D forms. There are lots of tools to use, but we focus on a select few and discover how easy it can be to go from zero to hero - literally!\nBut I don't want to be guilty of just giving you some marketing blurb. Let's keep it real. Some of these tools can be self explanatory and may not merit a whole video related to it. However, what this video series provides is a real world peak into some of the deeper issues you may encounter. I include a video where I have a memory overload and then i explain why it happened because its a typical error you will run into as you start adding lots of geometry. I look into global space issues which occur and break symmetry from time to time as you use certain tools and look at ways of creating smoothness without losing the form which seems to be typical in a voxel based environment - and lots of other little details which can ruin your day if you are not aware of them.\nAfter I explain our little group of tools, I've tried to make the series project based. I explain my process and at one point get inspired by a small detail which totally changed the direction of the model to great success I think.\nThis speaks very highly of 3D Coat . It is very flexible to the creative process and extremely forgiving, allowing you complete fluidity as you work. Z Brush gets all the press, but I am telling you as someone who has been committed to 3d for 20 years, 3D Coat is a special program and the quality of your work will improve massively.\nBut not only that the level of your frustration will correspondingly decline.\nEven if you do not learn the program from me, put the effort in and learn this amazing product for your own sake.\nI am a professional who has worked in countless commercials and have taught 3D and visual effects for 10 years using Maya and Z Brush, both excellent products.\n3D Coat is my secret weapon of choice. You will not regret the time you invest in these videos where I explore many interesting workflows to achieve form and structure which are simple unrivaled in any other program.",

You draw 5 3D models of characters for use in game development or other creations of your choice.\n\nThis course is perfect for beginners. We begin with a thorough introduction to the Blender interface. Blender is a powerful (and free) program that can be used to make art assets. The art you make in Blender is easy to add to games or other projects. Even if you're not an artist, you can make basic art models.\nWhat is a Compact Course?\nA Compact Course is designed to maximize efficiency and teach you a specific skill in an afternoon.\nRather than going through a long course for a long amount of time, this course gives you a visible accomplishment and new skill in a matter of hours.\nWhy take a Compact Course?\nIf you prefer a teaching style that is akin to a bootcamp but with less cramming and more focus on a clear learning goal, try this Compact Course.\nWhen you have a free afternoon, spend it efficiently by learning a new skill that you can put on your resume, with a finished project you can add to your portfolio. Before you know it, your showcase will grow with all the projects that will have built up over time.\nTaking daily steps to grow your toolkit will ensure that you remain a lifelong learner. As they say, there's no such thing as a small step. Every action you take will impact the rest of your career.\nThe source file of the art assets we make is included in this course. Enroll today to join the Mammoth community.",

The main purpose of this character is to be 3D printed or rendered, but the same techniques can be used to create 3D characters for games.\n\n\nWe will start by making the head, as always, a basic hair and then the body, with me giving some anatomical tips while sculpting.\nFollowing will be the arms, hands and legs where we will also talk about forms, shapes and anatomy. Next we will do something extraordinary by making all the armors from single meshes, which i call 3D cketching, so we can better understand and translate the 2D forms from the concept to 3D.\nWhen we finish all 3D sketches of the armors, we will start making the real armor meshes, by retopologizing the 3D sketches. It will be long and painful process, but at the end it will be worth the effort!\nAfter every gold stripe and armor piece is ready, we can get to making the pose, we will do that by posing only the body, and then we will add and adjust all the armors and stripes after we are happy with the pose.\nWhen that super relaxing and fun process is over, we can finish the hair with the curves, and do lights setup and materials to render our model.\n\n\nThis course is for intermediate Blender users, but beginners who are feeling very lucky and like to feel pain, can try it too :). Of course you can always start with one of my two Absolute beginners courses for Blender first, then some of my Anatomy courses, and then get back to this one :).\n\n\nI am warning you that in this course there will be stories, drama, action, memories and lots of advices from this wise bearded man with one eyebrow! Even some songs here and there... sorry about that.\n\n\nAnd now, go, buy the course and start making this nice lady in 3D :)!",

      "description": "Hello everyone, I'm Marwan Hussein and I would like to welcome you to this new course, Blender is one of the very powerful 3D software on the market and it's free for everyone to use, when I started with Blender back in 2019 I didn't know the possibility of this software and what it could do, and when I start to learn it was amazing and easy to understand and it's so friendly for new users, especially the interface.\n\n\nNow almost all my online courses focus on Blender and how to create a lot of complex designs with it.\n\n\nIn this new Blender course, I will go throw the most important things that every 3D artist should start with when it comes to using 3D software like Blender.\n\n\nThese things start with.\nUnderstanding the software interface, that's something very important to start with.\nThe good news though, Blender has a very friendly user interface, it's easy to understand and flexible, I mean it's very easy to manage and change after that we will start to learn how to add objects how to move things understand the navigation system of the software and a lot of things.\n\n\nWhen we complete the principles we will start with the modeling.\nI divided the modeling section into 4 sections, from easy to complex, in the first section\nwe will learn how to create easy geometry, after that, we will learn in section 2 how to create something a bit harder, and some scenarios for the third section and the fourth section of modeling.\n\n\nModeling means you should know your tools to do something inside Blender, for example, if you want to create a simple table, you can't do that unless you know your tools better.\n\n\nThe modeling journey in this course is full of knowledge and I made a full section just focusing on modeling, we will model the easy geometries and as we go forward we will start with things a bit difficult, and we will go through this process step by step.\n\n\nIn the modeling section, I will use a new technic to explain any command, I will start creating things, and any command I use to achieve something I will give a special lecture\nIn this way, we can make the learning process more fun and interactive.\nIn the modeling section, we will discuss those things.\n\n\n* How to add objects and how to use the navigation system.\n* How to scale Rotate and move objects.\n* What are object properties.\n* Object mode and edit mode.\n* Learn how to use Bevel in edit mode.\n* Object shading.\n* Face normal and selection types.\n* Learn how to extrude inside edit mode.\n* How to fix the normal fo face in Blender.\n* Introduction to modifiers.\n* Solidify modifier.\n* Bevel modifier.\n* Inset face command.\n* Transformation orentation.\n* Transform pivot point.\n* Learning the snap system inside Blender.\n* How to use subdivision modifier.\n* Learn what's Quads, Triangles, and N-Gons.\n* Delete and merge menu.\n* Mirror and lattice.\n\n\nThe modeling section is not stopped here, there are a lot of things inside this section you can check them I jest mentioned a little bit of what we waiting for there.\n\n\nThe modeling section is a long journey, when we finish it we will start with the unwrapping.\n\n\nUnwrapping is a very important technic after modeling is done, unwrapping means you need to make what you create ready to receive the texture correctly because if we don't we will get a problem and the texture will apply in a weird way.\n\n\nEverything now is ready to go, now it's the time to give what we created life by adding material to it.\n\n\nAdding the materials is something very important if you want to give your geometry a life\nand make them realistic.\n\n\nMaterials mean you will add color to a surface and make that surface rough or glossy or if you want that surface to be old or new, or make it lucks like glass or like a metal,\nand a lot of stuff.\n\n\nWe will use the designs that we made in the modeling section to give them materials for most of them, and we will do that step by step.\n\n\nAfter we complete the materials section and understand it we will start with the lighting.\n\n\nLighting means after you make t everything ready you need to add a source of light like\nwhat's happen in real life, because without adding lighting you can not make a render.\n\n\nIn the lighting section, we will discuss all sources of lighting inside Blender and the environment lighting like a skylight and HDRI Lighting.\n\n\nLighting section\n* Quick overview about the light source in Blender.\n* Learn how to use spotlight, area light, point light, and sunlight.\n* How to use Emission light.\n* How to use HDRI lighting ( High Dynamic Range Imaging )\n* How to use portal lights.\n* What's an IES light and how to use it.\n* How to illuminate an interior scene with sunlight\n* How to illuminate an interior scene with spotlights\n* How to create volumetric lighting.\nAll of that for cycles and Eevee.\n\n\nAfter all of that, we will learn how to use the camera, now everything is ready and the only thing we need is to set up a camera for our scene, inside Blender, we can't make a render unless we add a camera so it's very important to learn how to use the camera in Blender.\n\n\nNow everything is finished for the course and it's very important to say that what you just read is just a brief intro to the course.\n\n\nThe course videos reached 185 videos 48hr and 30 min of video content.\n\n\nAfter we learn everything we will create together an interior scene from start to finish.\nIn this project we will go through everything from modeling to rendering, we will create all the elements of the 3D scene together and we will unwrap it and make it ready to add the materials, everything step by step.\n\n\nAfter that, I can say we reached the end of this course.\nI hope you find this course useful and thank you for reading.\nMarwan Hussein.",

      "description": "Elevate your 3D design and visualization skills with our comprehensive Master Course, combining the power of SketchUp, LayOut, and Lumion. This Master is tailored for architects, designers, and professionals looking to master the entire workflow from initial concept to stunning presentations.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn:\nSketchUp: Create detailed 3D models with precision and ease.\nLayOut: Develop professional architectural documents and presentations.\nLumion: Bring your designs to life with realistic rendering and animation.\nCourse Highlights:\nStep-by-step instruction from an architect and industry expert\nHands-on projects to build your portfolio\nTips and tricks to streamline your workflow\nAccess to exclusive resources and project files\nCertificate of completion to enhance your credentials\n\n\nWhy this Master course?\nMy name is Manuel Pallarés, I live in Bali, Indonesia, and I have been using SketchUp for over more than ten years. I am a freelance architect and I use to collaborate with diferent architectural firms to model and render their projects.\nFuthermore, I have been teaching SketchUp for several years in different creative schools and this course is the resault of that acumulated knowldge. I have experienced face to face the problems that you encounter in the program. They are always the same. So in this course I will try to resolve all of them step by step.\nThis course is well thought out, carefully planned to teach you exactly what you need to know, without any fluff. In addition to using my own experience with SketchUp, many tutorials require hours of research and experimentation. The result is an easy to follow tutorial to get you modeling quickly and having fun during the process.\nSketchUp is a powerful, flexible, affordable, easy to use 3D modeling software.\nMy goal is to enable you to effortlessly take your ideas and bring them to life in 3D. SketchUp is the best tool for communicating and visualizing ideas, because its simplicity encourages creativity. The tool doesn’t get in the way of the creative process.\nIf you’ve never used CAD or any other 3D modeling program, you are at an advantage because you will not have habits ingrained from other software. You’ll be able to learn the fundamentals quickly, and you’ll be encouraged by the quick progress you are making. Don’t be intimidated if you’ve tried other complicated CAD software, only to become overwhelmed. SketchUp is one of the easiest 3D modeling programs to get started with, and I will help you learn the basics.\nIf you’re experienced with CAD, or are looking for an alternative 3D modeling program from what you’re currently using, you’ll find SketchUp to be refreshing. The simple interface does not inhibit your creativity. You will no longer need to conform to complicated tools or procedures. Create whatever you can imagine. SketchUp is 100% accurate, works with nearly any unit of measurement, with precision up to 0.000001″. Enhance SketchUp with thousands of 3rd party extensions, and use LayOut to create construction documents from your SketchUp Pro models.\nMy Background\nMy first experience with Sketchup was during the last years of my architecture degree in Madrid. I was in my last year and I decided to use the program to represent my project in a three-dimensional way. I started self-taught, but even so, the program completely seduced me and I enjoyed making my 3D model . The truth is that I would have liked to know this powerful tool from the first year of my degree and not in the last. Accustomed to using Autocad, Sketchup was a breath of fresh air. I began to enjoy graphic representation. That is why for all those university students I think it is the perfect tool.\nAfter the degree, I started working in different architecture studios in Lujbljana, Slovenia. Always in charge of the 3D representation of the different projects and their rendering. In this way I began to specialize in the use of Sketchup at a professional level. A program that seemed simple turned out to be more and more complex and powerful while maintaining that fresh air. That intuitive ability.\nIn this way, the next step consisted of working as a teacher in different creative schools. In this way I began to carry out a study program. I gradually polished this program over the years learning from the difficulties my students encountered.\nAnd here came the pandemic. At that moment, I decided to transform my face-to-face course into an online course. In a constant learning process thanks to keeping professional collaborations open, this course tries to synthesize all that knowledge accumulated over the last ten years in a professional and rigorous way, but also honoring the spirit of Sketchup, and proposing a way to learn fun and enjoyable.\n\n\nSketchup course\nIn this Sketchup course we will start from an initiation level to end up mastering the program at an expert level. We will learn all the Sketchup tools such as: materials, styles, scenes, animations, sunlight, connection to Google-Earth, photomatch, dynamic components, terrains, plugins and much more.\nIt is a very complete course equivalent to 30 teaching hours where theory and practice go hand in hand through numerous exercises that will increase in complexity as more knowledge is acquired. It is designed to end with expert knowledge about the program that will allow us to face any project successfully, no matter how complex it may be.\nThe course consists of different blocks:\n\n\nWorkspace block. We will start with a presentation of the program, we will see how to install it correctly, we will adjust our preferences as well as the units and we will begin to familiarize ourselves with the workspace. We will learn how to navigate in the three-dimensional environment of Sketchup, how to move using the different views, we will see the selection tools and the keyboard shortcuts that will make our workflow much faster.\nTheory and concepts . We will begin to learn important and slightly more complex concepts such as the difference between lines, surfaces, groups and components within Sketchup. We will also see the importance of inverting faces at specific moments\nDrawing in 2D. We will explore all the drawing tools in 2D.\nDrawing in 3D . It will be time to delve into the most complex tools of the program such as the extrusion tools, move, copy, rotate, scale, follow me or equidistance. In this block we will also see  operations between solids.\nMeasure and text. Which will focus on the use of other types of tools more focused on measurement, such as dimensioning tools, distance and angle measurement, change of position of the coordinate axes or the text tools and of section.\nDefaut trays. We will see the so-called ¨default trays¨. We will learn how to use the material tray, entity information, components, layers, styles, scenes or sunshine.\nSpecial tools. We will see some other Sketchup tools of special importance. We will study the use of the wharehouse library, the creation of terrains, the geolocation of our projects through the use of Google Earth, the very interesting photomatch tool, the creation of animations, dynamic components and the use of plugins that extend the capabilities of Sketchup to be able to model everything that is in our imagination.\nUtilities. Will deal with functional aspects of the program such as: importing dwg files, exporting images in different formats, as well as useful tips to improve our workflow based on my experience. Finally, the last chapter will make a comparison between Lumion and Vray, the two main rendering software that the market offers us to obtain photorealistic images from our models made in Sketchup.\n\n\nEach of these blocks will be accompanied by practical exercises at the end of each block to establish the theory explained with specific exercises on those specific topics.\nAlso to consolidate knowledge, at the end of all the blocks, a 30-question multiple choice questionnaire is proposed, where the student will test their theoretical knowledge of the program.\n\n\nUpdates block. The course is made in the 2021-2022 version.The truth is that there are hardly any differences with the previous versions. In this block I will update a new class every year explaining the most important improvements in the latest Sketchup version.\n\n\nNew Plugins and Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence is changing the way we work. In this section we will focus on the main plugins that emerge in this topic.\nTo complete the course, the 3D modeling of the iconic Barcelona Pavilion by the German architect Mies Van der Rohe is proposed as a WORK PROJECT. We will work on it during all the course using the tools that we learnt in the previous block.\nThrough this project you will learn:\nControl the scale of the model, correct use of groups and components, using dynamic components, model order through the use of tags, correct use of materials, correct use of furniture and elements outside SKP, correct placement of the north and sunlight of the scene, artistic use of styles, use of sections, dimensions and text and making animations in mp4 format from our scenes.\n\n\nLayout course\n\n\nUsing LayOut with SketchUp offers numerous advantages that significantly enhance your workflow, especially when it comes to creating professional documentation and presentations. Here are some key benefits:\nSeamless Integration\nDirect Link to SketchUp Models: LayOut integrates directly with SketchUp, allowing you to import and update your 3D models effortlessly.

      "description": "Hi, welcome to this course where we will Create and Animate a Vehicle in Blender and Substance Painter. We’re going to create a World War II-era Canadian Ambulance. And we’ll begin with preparing our reference images in Krita, and then taking them into Blender and setting them up in the 3D Viewport.\nWe’ll then start blocking in the basic shapes to get a sense of the size and proportion of the various pieces, and how they should fit together. As we refine the model, you’ll learn about Blender’s modeling tools and modifiers, how to stay organized during a large project, and how to plan ahead for rigging and animating the vehicle.\nYou’ll also learn how to prepare a model in Blender for texturing in Adobe Substance Painter. We’ll go over how to use materials to organize your texture sets, how to bake maps in Substance Painter, and how to use masks and generators to add dirt and wear to your models. We’ll then go over how to configure and export texture maps from Substance Painter and how to apply them to your model in Blender.\nNow we’re ready to start animating our vehicle. But first we need to rig the truck. We will use the free Blender add-on, Rigacar, to create a vehicle rig, configure the suspension, and animate it across a rugged terrain. Once the animation is complete, you’ll learn how to render out an image sequence of the scene, as well as a final .mp4 video file.\nThis course will take you from start to finish, creating an animated scene of a vehicle in an environment. The tools and skills you’ll learn in this course will allow you to take that next step of creating your own amazing animated scenes.\nSo join me! Learn Blender while creating this realistic vehicle and animating it through a rugged terrain. This kind of project is always a lot of fun. It’s got lots of room for customization along the way. But by the end, you'll understand everything you need to know to make your own incredible animations!",

      "description": "Are you ready to take your videos to the next level?\nThis easy to follow course will help you make original, custom animations using Adobe Photoshop that look professional and can be used as stand-alone movies (without needing any other software) or in combination with other video, animation, and multimedia software programs for a full range of effects and purposes. FREE trials of Photoshop are available at Adobe's website.\nIn this course you will learn my very favorite animation and video rotoscoping techniques to create powerful multimedia projects ranging from laughably simple (think stick figures waving) to more sophisticated and complex (such as my own award-winning series of films screened internationally in film festivals and online since 2002.)\nIn this course you'll learn step by step how to:\nHarness the power of Photoshop to create simple or complex frame by frame animations, with or without using Photoshop's timeline.\nEasily turn a regular video into a stop-motion animated video by making simple frame rate adjustments.\nApply a full range of effects to your video to create animated elements or a stand-alone animation even if you CAN'T DRAW.\nCoax Photoshop to animate objects and layers for you (without having to draw anything) by making position, size, and opacity changes, to name just a few possibilities.\nCraft multiple effects at once to create more complex final animations by using multiple layers.\nCapture complex movements by bringing in video, drawing right over it, and (optionally) throwing the video guide out so all that is left is your new animation with its sophisticated movements. (That's rotoscoping!)\nI start from the very beginning using Adobe Photoshop. Free 30 day trials of Photoshop are available from Adobe's website BUT many of the techniques I show you in this course (such as frame by frame animation) can be achieved in virtually any imaging software combined with your favorite video editing program.\n\n\nAll of my techniques are explained so you will 100% understand how they work. You can then decide how much time you will spend on each animation which will then affect your end results.\n--\nWhat Students Are Saying:\n\n\"Loved this course! Kristen is very thorough in her instruction and shows multiple ways to accomplish the various tasks included in the animation process. She discusses everything from where to get video to drawing techniques and final presentation. This was a fun course and I recommend it to anyone interested in learning the basics of animation in Photoshop or a similar program.\" -Deborah Wojcicki\n--\nAs an educator, I’ve taught at universities and organizations on four continents. I co-founded the Digital Media track of the Communication Program at The American University of Rome, where I taught full-time from 2006, earned tenure in 2009, and led the Film and Digital Media Program from 2013 to 2016.

It is a very complete course equivalent to 20 teaching hours where theory and practice go hand in hand through numerous exercises that will increase in complexity as more knowledge is acquired. It is designed to end with an expert knowledge about LUMION that will allow us to face any project successfully, no matter how complex it may be.\n\n\nMy way of teaching consists of first explaining the theory of the tools, so that later the student can repeat the same steps that are shown in the videos and is able to master the program. Likewise, exercises are proposed at the end of each module and a final exercise to definitively learn to use LUMION correctly.\n\n\nLUMION is a rendering program that has revolutionized the 3D viewing software market due to its ease of use, as well as the speed and quality of its renderings. It is a program designed for architects, urban planners, landscapers, engineers, draftsmen, surveyors, interior designers, product designers and actually any professional in the design sector. It stands out, unlike other rendering programs for its intuitive interface and for the fact that it performs a preview of the render in real time, which allows working with a deep knowledge of how my transformations affect the model the moment they are applied.\n\n\nWelcome!",

This course is going to teach you the fundamentals of creating art for animation, including concept art, color keys, layout drawing and final background painting.\nThis is your chance to learn the skills and concepts to become a background designer!\nYou are going to learn how to paint digitally, how to draw backgrounds and how to develop a sketch to a fully realized background for a scene.\nIn this course you’ll work on 2 background projects that I’ve crafted for you so that you can learn and practice different and varied styles of background art.\nAlong the way you’ll also learn all about the principles of background design for animation, as well as tips and tricks that I’ve used as a background artist throughout my career in the animation industry.\nIn the first project, you’ll get to learn:\n• all about the color wheel, and explore color harmony rules.\n•You’ll learn about lighting, and how to use light and shadow in your painting.\n•You’ll learn to use a specific brush pack and show you brush and painting techniques.\n•You’ll also learn how to create amazing atmospheric effects in your paintings and paint up a concept art fantasy scene.\n\n\nThen, we’ll dive into the world of creating a background for a scene in an animated film. The second project is based on my Pirate Project and for this, we’re going to choose a scene from the storyboard, I’m going to show you how to draw a detailed rough layout with all the elements and props. Then I’ll walk you through my entire process of painting this up to a finished background, step by step. I’ll teach you how to block in flat colours, how to craft shapes and objects within the scene and then how to add layers of textures and effects to make the final painting look like you can step into it and experience it yourself.\n\n\nThis course is packed with insights into the creative process of designing artwork for animation. I’ve worked really hard to make sure that in every video you can learn something new, from practical photoshop tips and techniques, to advice on how to speed up your workflow and be a better, more efficient background artist.\n\n\nWhen you join, you’ll have access to the downloads I’ve left for you, you’ll also be able to contact me directly, get feedback on your work and ask me any questions that you have.\n\n\nThis course distills everything I’ve learned over my 15 years experience creating art for animation. I’ve worked as a professional background designer for animation studios in Dublin, and Vancouver, for clients such as Disney, Sony Pictures, HMH Publishing and I’m really passionate about teaching the skills and processes that took me on that journey, so that your can have the opportunity to learn this amazing skillset. In my opinion background art is the best job in animation, it’s rewarding, highly creative and above all it’s easy and enjoyable!\nSo I hope you are ready to start your journey to becoming an animation background artist.\nSee you in the course! :)\nSiobhan.",

It sits right next to the concept development phase hence, it has a great significance in the 3D industry.\nThere are so many learning resources out there that teach you the basics of the software. But here in course, we learn the skill and the correct approach needed along with the software.\nWe all know, practice makes one perfect, this course aims to provide practice that we require by using simple house hold objects.Creating house hold objects is a great way to practice modelling, because it allows you to observe, touch, feel and study the interaction with light.\nThis course is split across 3 Progressive levels containing 3 objects in each level making a total of 9 different objects. We start with simple objects starting from a cloth hanger and progress to objects involving more parts. You will be learning the simplest approach to modelling. The exercises found in this lessons will make you a more confident not just with 3D modelling but also in blender. If you are not using blender, you can still follow this course as the methods for modelling are same and can be translated to other software packages.\nThe techniques that I have included are the ones that I wish I knew when I first started.\nAt the end of the course, you will know the right approach, and techniques to model any object.\nEnroll now and I hope to see you in the class.\nIntroduction background music from bensound",

      "description": "Hi there, the purpose of creating this course was to tell you that it is not always necessary to spend a lot of time and effort to create motion graphic scenes, but you can do it a lot faster and better by learning a few features of \"shape\".\n\n\nOne of the most basic and important things you need in motion graphics is designing and working with design tools. Since designing in After Effects is done using shapes, and also because of the power of the After Effects shape tool in designing and motion graphics, I will not go for design in other software such as illustrator and Photoshop. And I will completely focus on how to work with the shape tool and create beautiful and different scenes by this powerful tool.\nIn the following, you will learn the best capabilities of the shape tool, namely modifiers, which help you through the designing process as well as creating beautiful motion graphics.\nFirst you will get acquainted with the “merge path” modifier and how to combine the shapes together, and then you will get acquainted with its uses in motion graphics.\nNext you will learn the function of the “pucker and bloat” modifier and how to create a star and an attractive motion graphics scene.\nThen you will get acquainted with the “repeater” modifier, which is very useful in creating beautiful backgrounds, crowded and repetitive environments, as well as creating “Burst shapes”.\nThen you will learn how to use “trim path” and creating animation of plant growth.\nYou will learn how to create objects like smoke or steam by combining several modifiers with round corners.\nAnd we will go on until you learn all the modifiers and how they work, as well as how to use them in motion graphic videos.\nfinally apart from learning the shape tool and its modifiers well, you get the ability to create and animate many motion graphic scenes.\n\n\nKnow that I will be around to help - if you get lost you can drop a post on the video 'Questions and Answers' below each video and I'll be sure to get back to you.\nWith the 30-day 100% money back guarantee, there is nothing holding you back from jumping in right now and trying the course out.\nGo ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!",

This course is for anyone wanting to learn about how to create realistic fire or smoke in Blender 4.5.\nIt's specifically designed to take you from being a complete beginner to being able to create any type of simulation you want on your own. Starting out we'll first understand what the fire and smoke simulation is and how to use it on a basic level. From there we'll be jump into the settings and cover each one with side by side visual comparisons so it’s easy to understand. After that we’ll learn about the shading workspace and how to create smoke and fire shaders in both EEVEE and Cycles. To really help everything sink in there are 5 full tutorials in which we use the smoke and fire simulation to create some interesting animations.\nThe first one is all about creating mist in Blender. We’ll go through the process of changing the smoke settings to get that misty effect, add a light white material and render it out. The second tutorial is how to properly render fire in EEVEE. We’ll walk through the EEVEE render engine talking about all the settings and values to get realistic results.\nThe third tutorial is a campfire scene. We will first add the campfire model which is included in this course, simulate the fire and smoke, add spark particles, create materials and adjust render settings to create the most realistic campfire possible.\nYou like explosions? Well for the fourth tutorial we will be simulating a missile crashing down and exploding. Step by step we will learn about curve animation, particle systems, simulating two types of smoke and much more.\nLast but not least the final tutorial is all about creating a glowing smoke effect inside a glass sphere. We'll cover simulating smoke inside objects, creating a glowing materials, and rendering in EEVEE.\nIf you are interested in learning everything there is to know about the smoke and fire simulation and how it works in Blender, hit that enroll button and let's get started! I look forward to see what you create!\nThanks\nStephen",

      "description": "There are few better ways to present a project to your clients than through aerial fly-overs of a proposed building.  Drones have made it easier than ever to aerial footage of your projects sites.  In this course you will learn to take drone footage (or really any kind of footage), whether it is shot by you or someone else, and composite in your 3D creations easily and convincingly. 3DS Max and After Effects already have all the built-in tools that you need for creating visual effects using 3D composited into live footage.  Follow this course and you will be amazed at how quickly and easily you can be up to speed, creating your own movie-like effects, using software you probably already have access to.\nThis course is broken down into three main sections:\nInside of After Effects -- This is where I will show you how to generate and export 3D camera tracking data for later use in 3DS Max.\nInside 3DS Max -- From AE, we will get a camera the exactly matches the zoom angle and movement of our live video footage, but in Max we will have to adjust its scale and rotation in order to get it to match with the real world.  Once we have that, we can add any 3D elements we want to the footage.\nBring It All Back Together In After Effects -- This is where we will do some compositing. The goal is to make the 3D animation elements and the live footage mesh together seamlessly and convincingly.\nThis course is hands on.  You will be following along with me creating a basic aerial fly-over.  You will learn the exact workflow that you need, plus a ton of tips and tricks that will help you to not get hung up when you graduate to your own projects.  I have already done all the troubleshooting for you, so learn from my experience. Check out the promo video to learn more about me, and about the project you will creating in the course.\n\nJoin the course today for lifetime access!\nCheck out my other Arch Viz / 3D courses as well (More about those at the end of this course).  I have learning opportunities for all levels, and courses that cover various different aspects of the industry.\n*This course uses the latest and greatest in the two main software packages that are discussed.\n**Frequent updates and additional lectures\n***Lifetime access to all content and future content",

He has over 20 000 students in his online courses of 3D character creation and human anatomy.\n\n\nThe amazing concept for this character is done by the incredible artist Dario Jelušić\n\n\nIn the course we will start a bit differently with gathering our references, needed for the character creation, and analyzing our concept. We will then start modelling the head, the teeth and tongue. Then we will model the body, arms and legs, where i will speak about the anatomy and shapes of those body parts. After, we will make the basic shape of the dog and continue with the clothes. We will do Lobo's belt, jacket, potnik and pants. A hardsurface modelling will be next when we make the granade and the weapon. Then we will jump to do some knee armor, shoelases, and all kinds of elements this character has on himself, and there will be some modelling and sculpting, mark my word :).\n\n\nI will then, with great pleasure, make one of the skulls on his belt and then make the batman mask, the wonderwoman tiara and a flash helmet. I just love sculpting skulls!\n\n\nThen we will make some chains, which will be also an interesting part of our course. Dog chain, neck chain, and the arm chain. While making all the features of this character i will always talk and show you how to model it to be 3D printer friendly. With bigger and thicker elements and overall attention to the detail.\n\n\nAfter we work few more hours, detailing and finishing Lobo, we will rig the arms and hands, and make the pose from the concept. Then we will do some more cleaning and adjusting untill we are ready to call it done. And for last, we will do a interesting render with the help of Photoshop and a turntable, with the help of Blender himself :).\n\n\nThis course is absolutely made for intermediate Blender users, and although i will talk you trough almost every step i do in it, for the beginners i would recommend taking my Absolute beginners 3D character in Blender course first, and then go back to this one :).\n\n\nSo if you kinda like this crazy and wild looking character, and you want to see the whole process, and even make it yourself i would say you might want to check out the course :).",

Through a series of tutorials, you will develop the skills necessary to start designing and creating your own 3D models.\nOne approach to creating 3D models is to create 3D models from 2D sketches.\nWe create a 2D sketch and add 3D solid features based on that sketch.\nWe'll start with an overview of geometry creation and editing tools. We will discuss basic constraints, which are the relationships between sketch geometries. Constraints make it possible to precisely specify the shape and dimensions of geometry. Next, we'll go over the basic operations of creating and editing 3D solids from a sketch.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a good foundation in FreeCAD and will be able to create simple 3D models. Whether you're creating models for personal projects or for professional work, FreeCAD is a powerful tool that can help you express your ideas in 3D design.\n\n\nFreeCAD is free and open source parametric computer-aided design (CAD) 3D software. It is suitable for engineers, designers, students and hobbyists who want to create 3D models of their projects. FreeCAD can be used for hobby and commercial purposes. And to use FreeCAD, just download the installation file, install the software and you can use it. No need to provide your details. FreeCAD works offline, so you can create your own 3D models even in places with limited internet access.",

      "description": "Instructor Info\nCorazon Bryant always had an artistic bone in her body. When she  was only 2 years old, she would make detailed drawings on her mother's  wall. Her mother loved the drawings so much, she decided to keep them.  With the encouragement of her mother, she continued drawing and she only  got better as time went by. When Corazon was in middle and high school,  she earned money making portraits for her classmates and even for her  teachers. She pursued a college degree in Media Arts & Animation and  later worked for architectural and entertainment companies such as Camm  Productions, ID DI Design, and PDT International. She also had an  opportunity to do some freelance work for Mega Pickle Entertainment.  While working as a 3D artist, she had a chance to teach 3D animation  classes in an A+ school. This is when she found her true love - which is  not only to talk about 3D endlessly but to also inspire greatness in  young upcoming artists. Corazon is currently working on a new project  called Victory 3D with fellow industry-experienced artists to provide an  affordable and effective learning system that will make it easier for  students to get a job in the 3D industry.\nCourse Info\nDo you find it difficult to draw or sculpt a realistic character even after following a step-by-step tutorial? Have you tried multiple times to create a character and failed at making it look believable? Do you wish you can sketch a human figure without always needing a reference? Do you wish you can sculpt or draw faster? If you said yes to any of these questions, then it’s time for you to dive into The Human Anatomy for Artists course. My name is Corazon Bryant, professional 3D artist and educator. I will be your instructor for this course. In this course, you will learn the human anatomy in depth. You will learn the important differences between the male and female anatomy. You will understand how the muscles are constructed from its origin to insertion, the way each individual muscle functions and how the muscles appear on a real human body depending on the pose, movement, or gender. If you are a 3D modeler, an animator, or a traditional artist, you will benefit from this course. Learning the anatomy is an enjoyable and very enlightening experience. Not only will you have fun but you will gain a deep sense of accomplishment knowing that you’ve become a better artist than you were yesterday. You will be taken to the process of drawing and sculpting the human anatomy and by the end of the course, your skills will be highly improved. The way you perceive the human body will never be the same again. Get out of the rut, upgrade your skills and join this course.",

Along the way you’ll learn a lot of advanced techniques that you can then use to make any materials you can think of.\nAll the while we’ll be showing you how to make your workflow more efficient and much faster, using the node wrangler add-on.\nYou’ll learn procedural texturing, which is where you create your materials and shaders without using any image based textures. So anytime you need a particular pattern or look you’ll create it entirely using nodes (and some interesting maths!).\nThis means you don’t need to worry about sourcing images or copyright issues. It also means that anytime you want to create a roughness map, or a bump map, or a normal map, you can do it right in the node editor without having to worry about figuring a way to convert your images into those other types of maps.\nYou can also use procedural textures to create roughness maps or dirt maps to put on your own image based textures.\nThis course is suitable for all levels of Blender users. We’ll provide you with all the assets, and start from scratch with every single material you make, taking you through it step by step.\nThis course is for you if you want to…\nCreate realistic shaders without relying on images.\nIncrease your knowledge of dozens of utility nodes for math, vector math, and colour & value manipulation.\nTake your procedural texturing skills to the next level.\nCreate your own customisable procedural materials & textures for any Blender project.\nYou’ll get full lifetime access for a single one-off fee. The creators are qualified and experienced with modelling and coding, so are able to explain complex concepts clearly, as well as entertain along the way.\nYou’ll also gain access to a course forum where you can discuss topics on a course-wide basis, or down to the individual video. Get plugged into our communities of amazing developers on Facebook (nearly 20k), in our own TA-curated Community (17k views/day), and our student chat group (10k live at any one time).\nCreate spectacular textures and become a Blender Material Nodes Master today!",

It is also about turning a sloppy drawing into a refined piece that is ready to rig and subsequently animate.\nDrawing for those who lack the natural ability can be a struggle. If you however do have some natural ability when it comes to drawing, this course will translate to you on a different level. Anime Studio Pro makes it as easy as humanly possible to draw what you imagine. The drawing tools are simple but unlike anything else out there. Once you master their tools, it's a matter of playing it smart and using a reference image to achieve the character you want. IT IS THAT SIMPLE.\n=======================\nWhat material is included?\n=======================\nThis course like our others is a no fluff, straight to the core, course. In it we dive right in to actually using the tools Anime Studio offers to draw our characters. Each character we draw is free for you to use commercially for any of your projects!\nWe are constantly drawing in Anime Studio and as a result we will be constantly updating this course. At the moment there are 4 ready to rig characters for you to follow along with and or use. But as you check back we will be updating the course with more and more characters and start building an Anime Studio character design community.\n=======================\nWhy take this course?\n=======================\nIn this course we will walk you through step-by-step how to draw and organize a character ready for animation. We will talk about why Anime Studio Pro works for character animation and demonstrate how we use it as a premiere drawing tool. These lectures are gold for those who have had trouble in the past drawing digitally but even more so as we continue to update, these lectures will give you the experience in character design you have been missing!\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nIs this course right for me?\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThis course might not be right for you if you are already a well equipped digital artist. But even if you are comfortable at drawing you can still learn how we make ready to rig characters that utilize Anime Studio to its full extent.\nI hope you will join us in the ever increasing world of character design!",

      "description": "Hello everyone and welcome to the Cloth Simulation Guide in Blender 3D! In this course you will learn all about the cloth simulation and how it works in Blender.  Simulations are very confusing and sometimes hard to understand so I created this course so that you will know exactly how to use the cloth simulation and what the functions are.\nIn the first couple sections we will be going through how the simulation works and what the settings do.  After that I will be showing you how you can have multiple cloth objects interact with each other, how collision objects work and more. We will also jump into Blender version 2.82 and learning about a new feature called Internal Springs and Pressure.\nFinally the last 2 sections will be complete tutorials. The first one being a blanket falling on a couch. In this section we will be importing a couch model that I am giving away in this course. From there we will simulate it, add textures and render it out!\nThe second tutorial will be a balloon exploding simulation. We will be using the new feature in Blender 2.82 called pressure and learning how to animate it.\n\n\nIf you want to learn about the cloth simulation or want to improve your Blender skills this course is for you! So hit that enroll button and lets get started!\n\n\nThe program that is used in this course is Blender 3D.\nBlender 3D is a free open source program that allows you to create literally anything on the computer!\nYou can download by going to their website.\n\n\nSong in the promo was from bensound\n\n\nI can't wait to see the renders and animations you create!\n\n\nThanks\nStephen",

      "description": "In this course you will learn everything you need to know to rig a 3D character in Cinema 4D using the Character Object. I'm going to cover everything, from the very basics, all the way to the more advanced stuff.\nWe will start by learning about the great importance of character symmetry and character optimization. And you will learn how to properly optimize your characters before rigging them.\nThen, we will create the base rig using the Character Object. We will create the full skeleton including the spline, legs, arms, fingers, head and eyes. And to make the rig more useful, it will have both IK and FK controllers which we will be able to switch with just one button.\nAfter that, you will learn how to adjust the Character Object, so the skeleton fits the character mesh. Then, we will bind the Character Rig and the character mesh together. Later, you will learn different techniques to properly weight your character. And, as a bonus, we will pose the character in a very dynamic running pose.\nThose are the main topics we will cover, but you will also learn how to work with the Cloth Surface Object when rigging a character. How to properly use the Weight Tool. You will also learn the basics of normalization and auto-normalization in Cinema 4D. And of course, you will also learn about Inverse Kinematics (IK) and Forward Kinematics (FK).\nThis course is packed with lots of valuable information that you'll be able to apply in any character rigging project you work in the future.\nBy the end of this course you will have a clear understanding of how the 3D character rigging process works in Cinema 4D, and you will also be able to create your own rigs for your own characters.\nSo, get ready to learn a lot, and I'll see you inside.",

Her mother loved the drawings so much, she decided to keep them.  With the encouragement of her mother, she continued drawing and she only  got better as time went by. When Corazon was in middle and high school,  she earned money making portraits for her classmates and even for her  teachers. She pursued a college degree in Media Arts & Animation and  later worked for architectural and entertainment companies such as Camm  Productions, ID DI Design, and PDT International. She also had an  opportunity to do some freelance work for Mega Pickle Entertainment.  While working as a 3D artist, she had a chance to teach 3D animation  classes in an A+ school. This is when she found her true love - which is  not only to talk about 3D endlessly but to also inspire greatness in  young upcoming artists. Corazon is currently working on a new project  called Victory 3D with fellow industry-experienced artists to provide an  affordable and effective learning system that will make it easier for  students to get a job in the 3D industry.\n\nCourse Info\n\nWelcome to The Facial Anatomy and Likeness Character Sculpting. In this course, you will learn about the construction of the human face. You will understand the bony parts, muscles, and fat that makes up the face anatomy. You will also learn how to observe and create a facial likeness of your choice. Starting with a sphere in Zbrush and turning it into a hyper realistic face with wrinkles and skin pores. You will even gain knowledge on how to achieve realistic hair using fibermesh. By the end of this course, you will have the skills that you need to create a more believable portrait.",

You may be pulling your hair out, because your speed and process have been thrown out the door. You may be knowing what you want to create but getting nowhere trying to accomplish it.\n\nMost tutorials for learning Maya are fundamentals videos that are long and drawn out, covering topics that you already understand. You're just looking for the information on how to transfer the skills you already have from working in 3ds max. You may be spending large amounts of time scanning through tons of beginner videos only to find the videos overlook the advanced techniques you use. Sometimes the techniques you use aren't even available in Maya. This becomes irritating and wastes your time.\n\nThis video series is designed to get you up to speed inside of Maya and have you wondering why it ever seemed so hard to transfer between software in the first place. All of the main tools and techniques that are used in everyday video game art development (modeling, unwrapping, and baking) will be explained and cross referenced to what you would use inside of 3ds max. So if you're in need of getting up to speed inside of Maya for a new job position or are a student looking to improve your resume to become more attractive to employers this video series is perfect for you.",

They are useful, easy to use and modify, so they can be styled your way.\n\nYou will cover the three Transitions Presets Groups:\nThe Movement Presets (28 Presets)\nThe Wipes Presets (21 Presets)\nThe Dissolve Presets (29 Presets)\nYou will gain many new skills including:\nHow to apply the Transitions Presets\nHow to change and style the Presets\nHow to use every Effect applied to create the Presets\nHow to Create a proper Slideshow from these Presets\nHow to Create, Save and Use your own Presets\nHow to convert the old-fashioned NTSC and PAL Presets to modern Transitions\n… and lots of other details that you never had the chance to explore\nYou will also learn how to take advantage of the major effects used to create the Presets such as:\nTurbulent Displace Effect\nTransform Effect\nBlock Dissolve Effect\nIris Wipe Effect\nLinear, Radial and Venetian Blind Effects\n… and many more extremely useful effects\nA little bit about me - Better said by Stephan:\nThis isn't my first course with Louay, and there are good reasons for that. Louay's courses are some the most well thought out, intelligently designed, and clearly structured for all levels of experience…\nOne of my favourite aspects of Louay's instructions is that, while engaging the students, he doesn't waste time with verbal nonsense. As a student you will not have your time wasted with poorly edited videos with audio content that has nothing to do with the course. But don't read that as Louay isn't engaging or lacking interest. It's the opposite. He wants his students to learn and achieve a higher skill set in After Effect.\nAnother top remark about Louay is that he is always there for his students. I've read several questions from other students (and even asked a few myself), and Louay's response time is great.\nSo, get ready to jump in and be challenged.\nStephan S Nilson (Louay’s student in After Effects CC: Complete Course from Novice to Expert)\n\n\nStart using After Effects to its fullest potential\nYou do not need to be an advanced After Effects CC user to join this course. Simple knowledge on how to animate is enough. I will guide you step by step in every lesson\nBy the end of this course you will have mastered all the Transitions Presets and will be able to use and style them in any of your projects. Soon you will be able to create outstanding Slideshows on the fly.\nSee you inside the course.\nLouay\nCheers",

Anime became greatly popular around the world.\nMost Japanese anime series have recognizable traits and use various storytelling tropes associated with their genre. In storytelling, it is essential to explain the five Ws: who, what, when, where and why. Novelists do this with words. Manga Artists or Animators, however, can use background illustrations to tell much of the story. Understanding perspective is essential when drawing backgrounds. The correct use of perspective is very important as it can make a flat image appear to have depth and volume.\nLet our professional Japanese animator, Kimiharu Obata-sensei, guide you from the basics, right though to the skills you will need to draw your own anime heads from scratch.\nObata-sensei will illustrate the basics of perspective drawing, perspective when drawing characters, and explain how these are applied in drawing manga and anime.\nWhether you’re a complete beginner, or intermediate at Manga & Anime drawing, you’ll learn things you never knew you never knew.\nAll videos are subtitled.\nCome and join us!",

      "description": "It seems that most people want to do as little work as possible. If you are one of them, I advise you to explore Houdini. This program will help you speed up the modeling process especially if you need to create many variations of one model. Of course, you can model everything on your own, but why don’t let a computer do it for you?\nIn this course, I'll show you how to do it in real practice. Using a stylized house as an example, you will learn procedural modeling. We will develop a system that will allow you to create an almost infinite number of model variations. For this, we will use point clouds, learn how to work with attributes and a little bit of VEX coding. For rendering we will use Redshift, but you can use any other render engine of your choice.\nOf course, I will not teach you only how to model this house but give you knowledge that will help you create your own models. Also, after completing this course, you will get another project into your portfolio.\nI really like Houdini and hope you will enjoy it too!",

The videos build upon previous video as I show you how I go about creating a 3D animation, based off of some flat 2D Illustrator artwork.\nYou don’t have to get into big and fancy 3D applications to have fun with 3D. Use your current Photoshop and Illustrator skillset in combination with After Effects to bring your flat-designs to life – it’s not such a big jump to go from Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop to Adobe After Effects. They all play really nicely with each other.\nBesides getting into 3D with Adobe After Effects, there are a bunch of tips and tricks you’ll pick up even if you’re an After Effects and 3D pro. That being said, this class is meant for beginner to intermediate students, who have a little bit of experience in Adobe After Effects.\nCome have fun and create an awesome piece of motion graphics with me!\nHere’s what we cover:\nIn this class we cover everything from importing correctly set up files to rendering awesome animations. There are in-depth videos about 3D layer properties, different types of cameras and camera settings, the kinds of lights you can add to your scene, precomposing and parenting layers, being productive in After Effects, adding multiple views, animating layers in a 3D space, and many more tips and tricks.",

We will also go through the concept behind each walk cycle. It will give you a full understanding and working knowledge to achieve any other walk you can think about.\nThis course does not use any complicated plugin such as Duik.\nThe walk cycles that we will cover:\n1. Fun Walk Cycle animation\nThis is a special animation where we'll animate bezier paths to create the walk cycle. I find it important to start with path animation because there are after effects default.\n2. Basic/Classic Walk Cycle\nWith a simple character design, we will cover all the rules and working methods that we will use for any other work cycle later.\n3. Run Cycle\nWe will cover how to create the run cycle animation. The run cycle is short and energetic. It's a lots of fun to create this cycle. It's a fast wide walk cycle of just half second.\n4. The Sad Walk Cycle\nIt's a simple walk cycle with a slow animation for two seconds and small steps. We will start by animating meeting the shoes and other elements will follow the rhythm. For this walk and especially this character, we are going to animate the hands using certain effects.\n5. Sleepy/Sad Walk Cycle animation\nI'll be suggesting this as an assignment: A sad sleepy walk for a banana character. You might try your hand to recreate the animation and maybe give it more personality.\n6. Double Bounce Walk Cycle animation\n…The double bounce is a special walk cycle where the character Bounces twice for every step. It's actually not difficult to achieve this walk cycle if you set and follow the markers at the right time.\n7. Sneak walk Cycle animation\nThis is our three second long sneak walk animation. It's actually pretty interesting and not so hard to achieve. There are couple of animation principles you need to take care of.\n8. Proud/Pompous Cycle animation\nHe his proud with chest and head up and forward. Walking in a proud, pompous way.\nI provided you with projects files that you can download and start animating. So, you will have the opportunity to practice because we will be creating practical and easy to replicate walk cycles. The aim is for you to understand the concept behind a certain walk and create the walk.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be equipped to create some more amazing walks.\nJoin me now and let’s get some character walking and running.\nCheers\nLouay",

      "description": "Hey Guys ! Welcome to Advanced Texture Character Creation! the second part of this MasterClass. My name is Abraham Leal and in this course I will be sharing my workflow for texturing a game ready character. In this course we will explore the retopology, texturing and material process of our character. I will be sharing pretty much all the knowledge I have gathered in my 12 years of experience and I will guide you so that you too can create amazing looking characters.\n\n\nNote: In this course, We will only retopo, UV, bake and texture the character. The high poly sculpting part is done in another course called \"Advance Zbrush Character Creation\".\nYou don't need that course to follow along this one, as we have included the high poly in this course resource files. but enrolling to that course is highly recommended to learn the entire pipeline of character creation.\n\n\nBy the End Of This Course, You Will Be Able To:\nRetopology your high poly model with animation reddy edge flow.\nTexture characters in a way that they are aesthetically looking good.\nTexturing costumes and Props with matching the overall look.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn:\nRetopology\nUving\nBaking\nTexturing\nXgen Hair Creation\nPosing\nand Rendering\n\n\n\n\nCourse Project Overview:\nWe will start the project by going over the retopology process of our high poly assets, we will focus on generating proper animation topology, good edge flow and optimised assets.\nAfter that we will jump into Uving and prepare our assets for texturing. We will go over efficient ways to pack and bake all of our props inside of Substance Painter and I will share all of my tricks to generate great looking textures.\nFinally we will create the hair using Xgen and we will pose our character to create great renders inside of Maya and Unreal Engine.\n\n\n\n\nWho is This Course For?\nThis course is for those who wants to become a professional character artist. Who wants to texture their 3d characters in a professional way.\n\n\nWho is Not The Ideal Student For This Course?\nThis course is not ideal for absolute beginners.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Are The Requirements Or Prerequisites For Taking This Course?\nYou should have basic working experience with Maya, Zbrush, Unreal Engine, Substance Painter and Photoshop\nBasic knowledge of Blender is recommended but not necessary\nCovering the first part of the series is recommended but not necessary\n\n\nJoin Me Now:\nIf you want to increase your 3D Level and become a master at Character Production this is the course for you!

      "description": "TinkerCAD is the perfect software to learn the basics of 3D modeling. The software allows you to create 3D models that can then be sent to a 3D printer or CNC machine to be made. If you are interested in learning how to create your own models to print on your 3D printer then TinkerCAD is the best place to start. It is fairly simple to use, allows you to create a wide range of objects and best of all, the software is completely FREE!.\n\n\nIt is important that you learn to model correctly from the start if you want to become a proficient creator and TinkerCAD gives you a great grounding in this area. By learning to create objects from basic shapes you are forced to use your imagination to edit these shapes into the parts you require. This skill is an important part of modelling that will stay with you as you progress on to more complex software.\n\n\nTinkerCAD is also great for kids to learn as its simple and colourful interface make it fun to learn and create. After taking this course you will be able to teach your children to model a wide variety of objects limited only by their imagination.\n\n\nIn this course, we not only teach you how to use the software but let you follow along as we model some items such as a sign for a bedroom door or workshop and a toy train.\n\n\nThe course also includes some quizzes to help you ensure you understand the basics of TinkerCAD before moving on.\n\n\n3D printing is fast becoming one of the easiest ways to create your own objects at home. It's becoming more and more popular every day and the ability to create objects yourself rather than relying on finding objects created by others will become a more important skill in the future.\n\n\nIf you have a 3D printer or CNC and would like to learn to create your own models rather than just relying on downloading others then this course and TinkerCAD is the perfect place to start. Even if you don't have a 3D printer but would like to learn to use this totally free software then you will find this course enjoyable and informative. You can always send your models out to be printed.",

Many great workflow tips.” - David Erickson, student\n“Relaxed person to person way of explaining, so you understand it deeply..” - Peter Jensen, student\n“I learn a lot by watching the instructor thought processes while she builds out the project. She not only shows what she is doing, she shows why she is doing something. Nice.” - Ira Camp, student\n“Excellent, step by step but not tedious. And I learning to a point that I don't have to constantly go back and refernce.” - Kenneth Vanwright, student\n“Awesome stuff.....best money I have spent here on Udemy. I am really learning so much about after effects through the project...and the repetition on the same hotkey behavior has helped me learn immensely. As someone that is learning animation I have learned more from this project based course than I have in many larger \"all inclusive courses\"...I will be taking every other course she offers.” -  Jeremy Hazel, student\n“This is awesome training!!!” - Daniel Martinez, student\n“Clear and detailed explanation, many tricks and trips, I can't really imagine number of animation can I do by following this method, make me feel that I am designing like professional , or maybe I am already professional after this course. Very recommend” - Ahmed S Safwat, student\n“High quality course offering many well explained tips and tricks applicable to Interface motion graphic animation and beyond! Recommended!” - Amanda Jessup\n\"The course is very good and easy to understand. Thank\" - Kanawat, student\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI remember when I wanted to create HUD graphics. I was lost. How do they get that kind of detail, those glows, how did they set up their shots?\nAfter many years on the job, I learned some effective workflow tips to help me create this HUD animation relatively quickly, and now you can too. I’ll be covering a lot of important workflow concepts as well as tricks so that you can create this animation.\nWe'll start with a Thumbnail sketch and bring it into Illustrator to create our assets.  Then we'll bring them into After Effects.\nWe'll take our Illustrator file into After Effects and convert the layers to 3D layers and animate them using shape layers.  We'll comp these assets and create the text in After Effects.  We'll apply effects and filters to create the final look.\nAt the end of the course, you'll have built up a library of assets that you can re-use in addition to creating this animation.\nAlso, throughout the course I will be supplying my working project files so that you can use them as a downloadable resource.\nI want you to succeed. If you have any questions reach out to me in the Q&A section of the course. I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have.\nLet me help you master animating in after effects and illustrator by clicking the red button on the right to enroll now.",

      "description": "Course Description\n\n\nHave you ever wanted to breathe life into the 3D assets you create, moving their limbs, letting them swing to the wind or morphing them into different shapes?\n\n\n'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ is very different to any other Blender course out there! Most Blender courses show you 3D modelling, texturing, and rendering tips and tricks. 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ focuses on creating a variety of animations from basic, to intermediate, to advanced, all completely made in Blender - one of the top open-source and free 3D modeling software out there.\n\n\nWe will not be using any other software to animate all that you see in the thumbnail, except Blender. You will also learn about multiple armatures, walk cycles, and turntables, and as an added plus, you will learn about how to animate a full scene reminiscent of adventure films with different deadly traps.\n\n\nThis is great because it means you will get to see how we animate organic and inanimate objects from scratch for video games. I am sure 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ will be the one course that you will want to keep handy anytime you need animate an asset.\n\n\nOur 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ top 6:\n\n\n1. Following through a full introduction to animating in Blender with basic animations;\n2. Learning how to animate tank tracks so that they stick to any type of terrain;\n3. Creating create handles and drivers to have your tank tracks move realistically;\n4. Mastering the art of character rigging and animating walk cycles;\n5. Finding how to make moths move around a light source using Blender’s particle boid system;\n6. Maximising the benefits of animated textures to create flames and fire streams.\n\n\nNow, there are courses out there that can show you how to animate specific assets from start to finish, but there is nothing that covers the entire process from grass to wheels, to trees, to fish, to tank tracks, to fire, to light, and clouds, and even deadly adventure game traps. 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ is intended to be the complete guide to animating in Blender.\n\n\nStage 1: Basic Animation\n\n\nThis part of 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ will cover the basics of animation. No bones or rigs, just key frames. We will also be looking into interpolation modes and how we can use them to smooth out animations.\n· Move - Rotate - Scale\n· Interpolation modes\n· Basic simulations\nStage 2: Swing Animation\n\n\nUsing the skills we learn from stage 1, we take this up a notch by creating our first rig and single bones. This is the basis of most animations. This part of 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ will teach you why a root bone is important.\n· Swing Animation\n· Simple Rig\n· Root Bone\n\n\nStage 3: Wheel Turning\n\n\nWhen working with anything that can spin, it is important to understand how frames and keys work. In this stage, we will be explaining how to create a spinning wheel. Our goal is for its movement to look realistic. The best thing about wheel animations is that this can be achieved in the shortest amount of time.\n· Key Frames\n· Blank Frames\n· Linear Interpolation\n\n\nStage 4: Basic Weighting\n\n\nIn this part of 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’, we will be looking at how weighting works and you will learn how to add weight to bones. This is important for creating a certain level of realism. We will also be looking at when and how to use bendy bones.\n· Bendy Bones\n· Tree Swaying\n· Weight Chart\n\n\nStage 5: Shape Keys\n\n\nShape keys are a very powerful animation tool that we have at our disposal. We can not only change the shape of objects in ways that rigs simply cannot do but we are also able to combine multiple shape keys.\n· Shape Keys\n· Animated Texture\n· Growth Animation\n\n\nStage 6: Multiple Bones\n\n\nAs a 3D artist, at some point or another, you will have models that will need a lot more than just one single bone. In this part of the course, we learn how we can create animations with multiple bones working independently.\n· Multiple Bones\n· Combining Keyframes\n· Timelines\n\n\nStage 7: Animated Fish\n\n\nRealistically animating wildlife can be difficult. Luckily, we have a fair amount of Blender that can speed up your workflow and enhance the realism of an animation. Within the graph editor, we will look at modifiers and how to combine them with displacement.\n· Noise Modifier\n· Animated Paths\n· Displacement\n\n\nStage 8: Morphing\n\n\nMorphing is the process of taking one object and turning it into another over a set number of keyframes. Now, this is not as simple as clicking a button. In this part of 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’, we will look at how to set up this process and how to change the textures along with the object.\n· Shrink Wrapping\n· Morphing\n· Texture Setup\n\n\nStage 9: Tank Tracks\n\n\nIn my opinion, tank tracks are the number one asked-for animation, coming second after character rigs. This is why it is included in the course. We will be going through how to stick our tracks to any terrain. You will finish this part with the skills to create handles and drivers to have your tank tracks move realistically.\n· Drivers\n· Handles\n· Curve Modifier\n\n\nStage 10: Fire & Light Flicker\n\n\nThere will always be an abundance of models that require flames in some shape or form. This means that knowing how to animate flames is a key component of 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’. You will not only learn how to create flames from scratch, but you will also learn how to animate them. Empties and displacement will be the key to creating realistic flames without the need for complex simulations.\n· Texture Coordinates\n· Animated Lighting\n· Moving Flames\n\n\nStage 11: Moths & Light\n\n\nIt is the little things that can bring a scene to life. In this part of the course, we will be covering object tracking. Object tracking can be used to create moths flying around a light source. Wherever the light goes, the moths will follow, all thanks to boid brain which is an amazing Blender feature that comes with the particle setup.\n· How to use empties\n· Object Tracking\n· Particle Boids System\n\n\nStage 12: Clouds\n\n\nThe main focus of 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ is to create animations without the need for simulations. This means we need to find other ways of creating things like smoke. In this part of the course, we create a stylized smoke effect using Blender’s particle system. This also means that it is really easy to see results in real-time.\n· Meatballs\n· Velocity\n· Inverse Timelines\n\n\nStage 13: Complex Chains\n\n\nThis part of 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ will involve bringing much of what we have learned so far and applying it all together. This will involve us creating a complex rig and will also introduce you to inverse Kinematics or IKs for short. We will also look at bone tracking and take the level of learning animation up a notch.\n· Inverse Kinematics\n· Bone Divisions\n· Complex Armatures\n\n\nStage 14: Walk Cycle\n\n\nWell, we left the best part of 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ near the end. Here, we will be focusing on character rigs and animation. This will be done over many lessons as there is a massive amount of learning to take in. Not only will you be rigging a character, but you will learn just how easy it is to make a basic walk cycle. This is a must if you intend to create your own games and characters.\n· Character Rigging\n· Walk Cycles\n· Pole Bones\n\n\nStage 15: Camera Turntable\n\n\nThis is the final part of 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ before we animate a huge scene. To be honest, anyone who is thinking of getting into modelling should learn the basics of camera animation. More importantly, to show off your work, you will need a simple but effective camera turntable setup. This is what we will be learning in section 15.\n· Turntables\n· Smooth Motion\n· Camera Controls\n\n\nStage 16: Indiana Jones Large Scene\n\n\nWe finally made it to the last part of the course, and you should now have the skills to animate your very own large scene. This will include rolling boulders, shaking ceilings and much more. This adventure scene with deadly traps around every corner will be a great way to put everything you have learned into practice.\n· Large Scene\n· Multiple Armatures\n· Skills Test\n\n\nAre you excited about all the different skills you can learn in this unique animation masterclass course?\n\n\nSo, come join me on this amazing course and you will never be stuck again when it comes to bringing your scene to life!\n\n\n\n\nYour project will be to animate 16 different scenes, going through an equal number of distinct skill-level stages. Of course, you could set yourself a challenge and diversify aspects or details of the animations such as using assets you already have from your other projects. You could change the length or complexity of animations to make your environments more alive as your skills increase.\n\nI imagine you using these animations in 3D Tudor’s other courses!\n\n\nTo get you pumped, imagine how well this 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ 16-stage animation masterclass fits in with your other 3D Tudor projects.\nBe creative! Feature the animations you created in another project such as from ‘Blender 3: Stylized Scene the Ultimate Guide’. See your palm trees sway to the wing and create the effects of a high or low tide in the sea. Also, think about using them in other environments and complete all sorts of projects such as:\n\n\n- Animating different inanimate objects in your ‘Blender 3 to Unreal Engine 5 Dungeon Modular Kitbash’ dungeon through ‘Blender to Unreal Engine Become a Dungeon Prop Artist’;\n- Transforming the landscape of the ‘Blender 3D Model a Ghibli Art Stylized Scene’;\n- Populating and making your ‘Blender 3 The Ultimate Medieval Scene Course’ farmstead even more beautiful;\n- Moving and creating an animated scene video for your wagon in ‘Substance Painter to Unreal Engine 5 Masterclass’.\n\n\nThis course will give you access to just under 8 hours of 3D art in around 46 comprehensive lessons.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Resources & Freebies\n\n\n\n\nThe 'The Ultimate Guide to Blender 3D Rigging and Animation’ resource pack includes 15 individual scene set-ups as seen in the stages of the course, and another separate scene featuring a massive adventure scene with deadly traps inspired by film.\n\n\nJoin this course and come be part of an animation masterclass journey of over 8 hours of learning that will see you creating all the Animations you Perhaps will ever need in just 46 lessons.\n\n\nI am excited for you to share your renders and turntables of how you used your new animation in different environments for your portfolios with me. Go beyond the taught material and make new animation templates for assets and props not seen in the course.\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down!\n\n\n\n\nUntil next time, happy modelling everyone!\n\n\nNeil – 3D Tudor",

Updated pyro lectures are being uploaded to show the most recent sparse workflows( Houdini 19.5.640 as of this update )\nWe will explore the Vellum solver and how to create Squish-able, deform-able, and tear-able objects and how to art direct our tearing to our liking.\nWe will explore Flip Fluids and see how to use animated geometry to push our way through fluids, collide geometry with fluids, how to create spraying fluid sources like water from a hose and how viscosity works to create sticky fluids.\nYou will learn how many of the DOP networks are very similar and how to use multiple types of solvers in the same DOP network.\nYou will see the unlimited power Houdini software gives the user to create incredible FX rigs.\n\n\nCOURSE UPDATES:\n10/24/2020  - Extra Lecture added  - \"Exploring the Ripple Solver\"\n11/09/2020   - Extra Lecture added - \"Custom Delete with wrangles\"\n11/09/2020   - Extra Lecture added  - \"Copy random geometry to points\"\n12/06/2020  - Extra Lecture added - \"Flipping Faces\"\n01/23/2021  - Extra Lecture added - \"Electrical Arcs\"\n02/26/2021 - Extra Lecture added - \"Exploring Natron: Soda Can Comp\"\n03/29/2021 - Extra Lecture added - \"Redshift Basics\"\n11/01/2021   - Extra Lecture added - \" Deleting points with a changing Count\"\n07/13/2023 - Extra Lecture added - \" Using the minpos() Function\"\n08/05/2023 - Extra Lecture added - \" Using the AttributeBlur Node\"\n\n\nWhy Houdini is the program of choice in leading visual effects studios?\n\n\nHoudini is the most powerful single piece of software available for creating blockbuster level visual effects in the entertainment industry. Unlike many of the other software packages out there, you will not see a bunch of plugins available for Houdini, you do not need any with Houdini.\nHoudini offers all the tools an artist needs to create practically any kind of effect you can think of, all within the base Houdini environment. From its pre built shelf setups, you can get a long way to creating a great effect, but we are going to focus mainly on creating FX rigs from the ground up throughout this course, using the shelf setups sparingly.\nWhen you create your own rigs from scratch, you know everything that goes into it, you know what every node does, and you know you have added only what is needed to finish your work and you have a more efficient network.\nWe will start with the very basics, and build upon what we have learned in every lecture to create more and more advanced rigs. We are going to use a lot of VEX within wrangle nodes, but I will show alternatives to a VEX workflow for artists that are not as comfortable writing code, you will learn to code as we go. VOP’s nodes are writing VEX code under the hood when you wire networks together inside them, so you are creating code and might not even know it!\nWe will start exploring Houdini with examples showing how to use some of the most frequently used nodes and then go into creating a few rigs that look dynamic but aren’t actually simulating anything.\nFrom there, we will go into Particle setups to get comfortable within the DOP network. The next step is to check out the Wire Solver. We will then advance into RBD’s, some of my favorite FX to create. We will see how our knowledge form the particle lectures will give us a head start to creating advanced setups with the Bullet solver.\nAfter RBD’s, we move into Smoke and Pyro sims. I will show you how to create custom fields to manipulate and control your Pyro with volumes and show how you can import pure point data to create fields to control your Smoke and Pyro directly in the DOP network.\nUPDATE: There is a new workflow for Houdini versions 19+ and the shelf explosion options have changed, I will be recording updated lectures for the Pyro related lectures that need to show this new workflow for Houdini 19+ and adding them into the course, a few are already uploaded. You can still load all the example hip files that come with this course for the original lectures and they will all work but  a warning message will show when loading due to shader differences from when the course was created and the current shading model.\nWe will then jump into Vellum, a relatively new addition to Houdini that adds incredible tools for simulating softbody style dynamics such as cloth, inflatable and deflating objects, squish-able objects and objects that can tear apart.\nOur final section will show some examples of using the Flip Solver to create detailed splashing water and liquids that can be aimed out of an emitter like water from a garden hose. We will see how once again, our particle knowledge comes in handy when working with Flip by utilizing pops nodes to help control our fluids.\nBy the time you are finished with this course, you will have learned all the major areas of Houdini that are used the most frequently in major production studios in the entertainment industry and have a solid foundation to continue learning more advanced setups in Houdini.\nAnyone from a beginner to a working professional can benefit from this course. There is no one single way of creating anything in Houdini, and seeing how other artists work will always reveal a new trick or method you might not have been aware of before.\nIf you are interested in seeing how to create real world visual FX rigs that are used in production everyday, then this is the course for you.",

Taking a look at the effects and customizing the look and feel depending on what your project calls for.  Although Lumion is very forgiving in what you import into your project it is always advisable to prepare your file for export by making the file as light as possible. Strip out all the unnecessary items that wont be seen in the project and delete items that can replaced by an optimized model that Lumion provides.

Whether you are a game creator, an architectural visualization specialist, or just aspiring artist, this class is right for you.\nCOURSE STRUCTURE\nWhen this course was first designed, it was intended to show the exact process of taking your 3d models from static image, to a fully interactive and navigable scene. Originally, this was all done via the real time rendering capabilities of Unreal Engine. The great benefit to you as a student is that the instructor cuts through all the nonessential stuff in order to get you up and running quickly. Unreal Engine can seem like a daunting software, but not in this course. During this original portion of the course you will learn the following things:\n\nHow to prep your 3d models. The instructor uses 3ds Max, but various different 3d packages will suffice\nImporting your project into a game engine, Unreal Engine 4, which is totally free\nThe basic interface, and getting around in Unreal Engine\nLighting, Materials and rendering for real time\nAnimating in real time, and exporting full animations that render in just seconds!\nHow to export your project for navigation on any computer using basic arrow key navigation + mouse.\nBasically, create your own custom video game level!\nSince this portion was created, Unreal Engine and real time technology have advanced a great deal. Also, some students will want to dive into the software even deeper. This is why more updated sections have been added that deal specifically with Virtual Reality via a high-end VR headset (Occulus Rift, HTC Vive, etc). During this second portion of the course, you will be able to explore your projects in an entirely new, and extremely immersive way (You will need a headset in order to the most out of this part of the instruction). The exciting things that will be learned in this portion of the course include:\nChange your existing real time project into a fully immersive / interactive Virtual Reality project\nLearn how to customize objects using blueprint scripts with no previous knowledge of coding\nCreate interaction using blueprints, i.e. pick up objects, turn on and off lights, change materials dynamically, etc.\nDownload source files and develop a VR project from start to finish.\nCreate your first scripts!\nImmerse yourself in your own project using the best technology available for communicating your design ideas.\nExport your VR projects for others to view.\nNOTE: This class is taught by Adam Zollinger, a successful 3d artist, author, and Udemy Instructor. Adam has over 9,000 satisfied students already and has proven to be a wealth of knowledge in the field of 3d and digital art. He can also be your companion on the path to becoming a professional, as he is always willing to answer student questions, share personal insights, and help diagnose technical problems.",

But you have no idea how or where to even start?\nYou could spend thousands going to a college specializing in 3D graphics and spend years learning the art of 3D character development and other things 3D related. Or better yet, get straight into making your own 3D characters in much less time without having to spend thousands.\nIf you've chosen the latter, then you've come to the right place!\nWhat's in this course?\nThis course will introduce you to the world of 3D character development in the open-source 3D software Blender. You will learn all the skills and techniques involved in creating your 3D character in a learn-by-doing manner.\nStarting from scratch, you will learn:\nCharacter Modeling - You will start with just a cube and you will work your way through modeling your complete 3D humanoid character. We will be using a combination of box modeling and polygonal modeling techniques. Along the way, you will learns some cool and useful modeling tricks to make your 3D modeling experience more enjoyable. Apart from modeling your character, you will also learn how to model clothes for your character.\nBasic Human Anatomy - While the course doesn't heavily focus on anatomy, you will be introduced to some basic human anatomy that will help in making your characters look more believable.\nTexturing and Shading - You will learn the skills needed to paint realistic skin textures and create a realistic shader for it so that your character's skin looks and feels like actual human skin. You will also create textures and shaders for your character's clothes.\nRigging - You will learn handy techniques to quickly rig your character in Blender so that it can bend and pose in various ways.\nHair and Beard - You will use the Particle System in Blender to create and style your character's hair, beard and eyebrows.\nPresentation - You will finish the course by creating a portrait rendering of your character to show off to the world and add to your own portfolio.\nWith over 6+ hours of content and 50 lectures, there are so many things to learn!\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is perfect for anyone interested in creating 3D characters. No need to have any formal background in arts or 3D graphics. There will be no technical jargon in this course and everything will be explained in an easy-to-understand step by step manner.\nWe will be using Blender in this course to create our character. It will be mostly advantageous if you are also a Blender user. You will also further benefit from this course if you know your way around Blender and are able to carry out basic 3D modeling within Blender.\nIf you are not a Blender user, the skills taught in the course can still be followed along and also be applied to your preferred 3D software.\nWhat is the expected outcome after this course?\nBy the end of this course, you will have created your first 3D character model which will be fully modeled, clothed, rigged, textured and shaded. The character you create can then be handed over to an animator for a film or game ready to come to life.\nIt is highly recommended that you follow along with me throughout this course as you will benefit from a learn-by-doing approach. This will give you confidence to later on create your own 3D characters and one day become an awesome 3D character developer yourself.\nThis course could be the first stepping stone to a 3D art school or becoming a freelance 3D character developer.

Do you want to learn how to make nice muscular body anatomy, mechanical parts and model great guns only in Zbrush, fast and efficient?\nThen i welcome you to Nexttut education's \"Orc Cyborg Character Creation in Zbrush\"course.\n\n\nINSTRUCTOR :\nMy name is Niko and I am a 3D character artist for games for about 10 years now. I have worked for numerous games and currently work for one of the world's most famous game companies -  Gameloft.\n\n\nGOAL OF THE COURSE :\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to model nice muscular orcs with armors, guns, artificial cyborg arm and a base in Zbrush from start to finish.\n\n\nYOU WILL LEARN :\nSculpting the orc head\nSculpting the orc muscular body\nRefining the head and body with skin detail\nMaking the 3D sketch of the whole model\nMaking the robotic arm\nMaking clothes, belts and armor\nMaking a bulky gun\nMaking a base and a monster head\nPoly paint the character\nPosing the character\nRendering the character with passes\nComposing a final render in Photoshop\n\n\nWe will start by spending 30 minutes to customize our workflow in Zbrush so we could work much faster and efficient. Then we will make the head of our orc where i'll explain what you should watch for, when modelling head from a concept.\nThen we will make some metal parts on the head and the metal skull. After that we will make the body, again from sphere, following our concept.\nAfter we are done with the body, we will start making 3D sketch of our model, to get the correct placement of all our accessories, clothes and armors. This is a pretty important stage, in the end of which we will have very good idea how our model will look when it's finished.\nThen it will be time to start extracting belts, armors and boots.\nAfter that we will start refining all those things that we have made, and the model will start to look pretty good. Then it will be time to do the weapon of our character, which will be a hard surface gun done entirely in Zbrush, and add it to the scene.\nWe will also make a base with a monster head below the orc, so he could look more grounded.\nOnce we are happy with the overall look of our character i will show you how to make good pose with the transpose master in Zbrush.  Finally we will make the render passes in Zbrush and combine them in Photoshop, to achieve the best possible look for our model.\n\n\nIDEAL STUDENTS :\nI have designed this course for intermediate 3d modeling students, who wants to model beautiful looking production ready bulky and muscular characters but they struggle to get it because they don't find a tutorial which is step by step, no fast forward, no skip and coming from a production artist who is doing this for years.\nThe course is also for artists who wants to speed up their workflow in Zbrush and improve their skill in making muscular male anatomy, clothes, accessories, guns and a robotic arms.\n\n\nWHO IS NOT THE IDEAL STUDENT :\nThis course is not designed for absolute Zbrush beginners, I expect you to have some sort of Zbrush experience. But intermediate Zbrush users, and even professionals could learn a lot from the techniques and workflow I show in this course.",

We will be using several cameras and animating between them using Unity timeline. We will look at pacing and timing to get the imagery to match the pacing of background music.\n\n\nProject 2 - Speed Tournament (Universal Render Pipeline (URP) Template)\nWe will be creating a photorealistic environment and importing a race track and race car to create a dynamic animated cut scene for a racing style game. The shots will be more dynamic and exciting and we will be creating these by using Cinemachine. We will be using virtual cameras and dolly cameras with tracks. We will be incorporating physics elements alongside keyframed animation. We will look at techniques for creating impressive slow motion effects. We will be blending between different post processing effects to create depth of field shots, lens flares and more, to give the animation a AAA quality feel to it.\n\n\nProject 3 - Shootout (High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) Template)\nWe will setup a low poly desert scene with a cowboy shootout involving three cowboy characters. We will use the Animation rigging package to setup multiple constraints to control the cowboy characters using Inverse Kinematics (IK). We will incorporate Two bone IK, Position constraints, rotation constraints,  look at, parent constraints and finger IK to create a fluid animation rig for each character to make it easy to make complex character animations. We will continue to use Cinemachine to create the shots that will tell a short story.\n\n\nProject 4 - Blendshapes (Standard 3D Template)\nUsing a pre made character, we will create our own blend shapes for the face and clothes in Blender. We will then import the character and animations into Unity and assign the correct avatar. We will animate the character's facial expressions and this time we will use the animator window to create a non linear structure of animations that are controlled by Parameters that are controlled by C# script. This will make the final animation more interactive.\n\n\nYou can complete the projects in any order you like to develop different skills.\nBy the end of this course you will have developed a wide range of skills and techniques that will improve your own animated cut scenes and animated movies using the Unity real time game engine.\nWhy not enrol today and I'll look forward to seeing you in my course.\n\n\nMusic:\nAn Epic Story by MaxKoMusic\nEnchanted by Keys of Moon\nMusic promoted by free-stock-music",

      "description": "Hi! Thank you for checking out Drawing for Storyboarding. This is a fun, engaging course that will teach you how to draw for Animation Storyboards.\nFirst, you’ll learn how to draw characters - how to draw good expressions and poses\nFrom there, you’ll learn the best approaches to drawing suggested backgrounds for your boards - from rough blocking, to adding perspective, and how to draw depth and space in your panels.\nYou’ll also learn the best practices for story artists - these are the top directors’ tips and I’ll share them with you so that you know what is expected of professional story artists.\nI’ll also share with you some sample storyboards of other students in the course series - this is going to be an amazing opportunity for you to not only see diverse examples of different styles of drawing; but importantly, to see how fellow students are approaching their assigments, and working.\nThere is an opportunity in this course to complete assignments and exercises for each of the topics covered; plus at the end, the class project for this course is to take a page of script and storyboard it out entirely yourself. I’m going to give this project to you as though you were working for a studio - so you’ll get model sheets and layouts, as well as the script and then it’s over to you to put everything that we’ve covered in the course into practice.\nThis course is a supplement to my successful storyboarding courses:\nLearn to Storyboard for Film & Animation\nand\nAdvanced Storyboarding Techniques\nBoth those courses cover in depth everything you need to know to about storyboarding - the technical aspects, the filmic language and the nuts and bolts of communicating your ideas for a story visually.\nThis course takes all of those concepts and principles and dials down into the actual process of drawing.\nThis course is aimed at beginners, so you don’t have to have taken the other storyboarding courses in the series - you could use this as a starting point in fact. If you have taken the other courses in the series, this is going to bump you up to the next level and ensure that you are able to draw fast, fluid, efficiently.",

I have more than 22 000 students in my courses on Zbrush, Blender, 3D character creation and anatomy.\n\n\nThe concept is made by Sora Kim\n\n\nWe will start by making the head (as always with the creations of my characters), then we will make the rest of the body, where i will tell you the specifics of the female body sculpting. After that we will do the sword and turn special attention to its handle. Next will be time to do the dragon. We will make the curved body, and then add scales efficiently using some interesting techniques. After the dragon is ready, we will jump to make some ropes, which will take some time. Then we will refine various things to get ready for the lighting and render. Lights, material tests and render as well as turntable and shadow plane will be last in our list.\n\n\nThe Dragon girl in Blender course is probably one of the most complicated courses in Blender i have done, it is mainly for intermediate and advanced users. But beginners with alot of patience could also try it :). But for them i recommend taking one of my two beginner courses before you do this to yourself :).",

      "description": "Student Reviews :\nE Days says : Really well paced and everything is explained in detail as of right now. Nothing is left out and the tutor makes it fun by throwing some random jokes here and there. Looking to finish it up and see how it turns out in the end and see if it remains consistent throughout.\nJunaid says : He is a legend, amazing skills and he knows what's he is doing, He comes prepared ,like with a lot of practice before teaching.\nPlus he is amazingly entertainer, you never get bored or feel sleepy.\n\n\nDO YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS : Do you have problems modelling female anatomy, face and hair? Do you have issues with hard surface in Zbrush? Are you ready to learn how to make a realistic high poly model, leather, clothes, weapons and everything only in Zbrush, fast and efficient?\nThen I welcome you to Nexttut education's \"Girl and the Dog Creation in Zbrush for Intermediate Level\" course.\nINSTRUCTOR : My name is Niko and I am a 3D character artist for games for about 11 years now. I have worked for numerous games and currently work for one of the world's most famous game companies -  Gameloft.\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to model good looking female characters with clothing, accessories, guns and knives and even a dog in Zbrush from start to finish.\n\n\nTOPICS COVERED :\nSculpting the female head\nSculpting the female body\nSculpting the dog\nMaking the 3D sketch of the whole model\nMaking clothes, belts and boots\nMaking a rifle, shotgun, pistol and knives\nPoly paint the character\nPosing the character\nRefining the head and body with skin detail\nMaking the hair with Fibermesh\nMaking the eyelashes with tubes\nRendering the character with passes\nComposing a final render in Photoshop\n\n\nWe will start by spending 30 minutes to customize our workflow in Zbrush so we could work much faster and efficient. Then we will make the female head where I will explain what you should watch for in a female head modelling.\nThen we will make a placeholder hair, and we will make the teeth, and eyes from scratch. After that we will make the female body, again from sphere, following our concept.\nWe will also sculpt the sitting dog from scratch.\nAfter we are done with that, we will start making 3D sketch of our model, to get the correct placement of all our accessories and clothes. This is a pretty important stage, in the end of which we will have very good idea how our model will look when it's finished.\nThen it will be time to start extracting clothes, belts, boots and bandages.\nWe will also make the watches, gloves and belt buckles. We will spend time to model the pistol, the shotgun, the rifle and two knives, by utilizing the hard surface modelling techniques inside Zbrush.\nAfter that we will start refining all those things that we have made, and the model will start to look pretty good. Once we are happy with the overall look of our characters we will pose them as they are in the concept, Finaly we will make the Fibermesh hair and make the eyelashes, export render passes from Zbrush, and compose a final beauty render in Photoshop.\n\n\nIDEAL STUDENTS : I have designed this course for intermediate 3d modeling students, who wants to model beautiful looking production ready female characters for games but they struggle to get it because they don't find a tutorial which is step by step, no fast forward, no skip and coming from a production artist who is doing this for years. The course is also for artists who wants to speed up their workflow in Zbrush and improve their skill in making female and dog anatomy, hair, clothes and weapons.\nNOT IDEAL STUDENTS : This course is not designed for absolute Zbrush beginners, so I expect you to have some sort of Zbrush experience. But intermediate Zbrush users, and even professionals could learn a lot from the techniques and workflow I show in this course.\nENROLL NOW : So if you want to model production ready female characters, enroll now, and take your skills to the next level.",

So now, my 15 years of experience in the game industry help me help you make the best characters you possible can :).\n\n\nThis course is mainly for intermediate Zbrush users, and if you are a complete beginner, you should look for my Absolute beginner Zbrush course or my other Zbrush, Blender, Substance painter course for beginners, and then get back to this one.\n\n\nIn this course we will start by loading my interface and hotkeys, i will explain why you will work 2 or 3 times faster with it, and at the end of the course if you don't like to work that fast, i will tell you how to revert back to default Zbrush UI.\nThen i will talk about my process of thinking when i start working from concept a bit. After that we will do a dragon's head, which is not even in the concept, but it will definitely be fun.\n\n\nThen we will went on to model the body and the arms, talking a bit about how real anatomy affects even the cartoon characters. We will make the legs and then we will concentrate a bit on the horse, by talking a bit about horse anatomy and the importance of references when we sculpt.\nWhen we are ready with the overall shapes of the horse, we will do the horse and dragon tails, the spiked ball and the mighty dragon wings! We will do some of the horse clothes and straps too. Then it will be time to start the helmet of our dragon knight. It will be a process full of pain and difficult obstacles, but also with joy and new knowledge. When we are ready with the basics of the helmet we will do the pike and start detailing various things like the horse hair and doing some polypaint. We will also work few videos on the helmet to polish and finish it, because it is a pretty important part of our model after all.\nWe will then continue detailing the dragon rider by adding some fine details here and there to prepare it for posing.\n\n\nAfter that we will pose the character using the latest Zbrush technologies of posing, that i use for about a decade now. When we are done with the posing and we are happy with how our character look, it will be time for the bonus section of our course - Keyshot. I will get you familiar with everything you need to know in this pretty easy program, capable of handling all the millions polygons and the polypaint, from Zbrush. We will make some materials, lights and finally i will show you how to make a render and a turntable video for your characters.\nThis course is for intermediate Zbrush users, but if you are a beginner, don't worry, go to thе \"Absolute beginner Zbrush course\" or my other \"Zbrush, Blender, Substance painter course for beginners\", and then get back to this one and you will be fine.\n\n\nSince the dawn of time people were afraid of dragons and they were facinated by them. So after thousands of years all the stories and fables of dragons and knigts, are finally combined in to one character. It is up to you to explore how this character is modelled and rendered in Zbrush and Keyshot, and even do your own version! So lets dive in to it!",

This character rigging course covers everything you'll need to know to animate characters. Very informative great way to learn!!!! Thank you so much Reza!\nJack Jackson  ⫸ Great course!! One of the best courses i have ever taken. This is an incredibly complete course on Duik Bassel 16. The course explains Duik Bassel almost from A to Z. Thank you very much, the course was excellent. A++++\n\n\nDuik Bassel:\nThe goal of Duik is to make the life of animators (and riggers) easier. The priority was to make Duik as easy to learn as possible, while keeping it very quick to use. The other important goal was to make the interface as small as possible, so it won’t take much place in the After Effects interface; we think it’s very important to be able to focus on the timeline and the viewport of the application, without any other tools interfering when you’re animating.\nIf you wanna to be great in the 2D animation, this course will be useful for you.\nBe Professional with Master Rigging and Animation tutorial in the After Effects and free Duik Bassel plug-in.\nYou will Learn:\n✔ Character rigging for human and animals\n✔ Walk cycling\n✔ Face Rigging\n✔ Puppet pin rig and walk cycle\n✔ The best tips and Trick for Animation\n✔ Camera Rigging\n\n\nSubjects:\n▣ Introduction\n▣ What is Duik Bassel?\n▣ Download and setup Duik Bassel\n▣ Character instructure design before rig\n▣ Rigging and walk cycling\n▣ Advance walk cycle\n▣ Add Bones Character Rigging\n▣ Animals Rigging And Animation\n▣ Controller Basic\n▣ Face Rigging & Blinking & Lips Syncing\n▣Keys\n▣ Animation Blender\n▣ Effector\n▣ Wiggle\n▣ Spring\n▣ Wheel\n▣ Swing\n▣ Move away\n▣ Random\n▣ Paint Rig\n▣ Looper\n▣ Camera Rigging\n▣ 2D Camera\n▣ Scale Z-link\n▣ Frame Guides\n\n\nAre you ready?\nLet's get start it.",

I am also here for you.\n\n\nMy name is Niko and I am a 3D character artist and teacher. I started working in the game industry 14 years ago and after numerous games and characters, I am already teaching in some online platforms .\nIn this course we will learn Zbrush, Blender and Substance Painter from scratch. You will learn how to make characters like this one from the high poly,  through retopology and UVs ( all in Zbrush) fix your mesh and prepare it for baking in Blender and then bake and make textures in Substance Painter.\n\n\nAs a bonus we will make a pose and render both the high and the low poly to make a better presentation.\n\n\nFirst we will start with basics of Zbrush. We will then learn how to sculpt by making a female head. After that we will bring the most used brushes on the main Ui, to have easier access to them and at least double our speed. Following will be bringing our concept into Zbrush and start sculpting it from sphere. We will have a detailed look into all sculpting methods and techniques, required for making this character. After we colorize and refine it, we will pose our superhero in Zbrush, make render passes and combine them in Photoshop for portfolio render.\n\n\nThen we will take the t-posed version and start retopologizing it by hand in Zbrush. I will tell you all you need to know about how and why I do my retopology in Zbrush. After we are done with retopology we will unwrap the character again  in Zbrush.\nAnd at last it will be time to bring it into Blender. I will get you familiar with Blender interface and the features to get you started. Then we will quickly fix some problems on our mesh and resize and arrange our Uvs inside Blendet to fully prepare captain Fenex for texturing.\n\n\nThen  we will export our hero from Blender, open Substance Painter and get familiar with its interface and features. After that we will import out model there, bake all necessary maps and start making our materials. We will experiment and even have a little bit of fun with the materials, maybe. When we finish with the fun, we will concentrate on exporting the textures out of Substance Painter.\n\n\nAnd then will come the bonus and experiment section of the course. We will put the textures in Blender to see our model there in it's full glory. Then i will show you how to get a ready skeleton for your meshes from vintage Blender, adjust it to our model and attach our model to the bones of the skeleton. After that we will move and pose the model witht he help of the bones. When we are ready with the pose i will teach you how to render in Blender and even make a turntable animation for better presentation.\n\n\nAt the end we will spend 30 minutes to talk about Artstation, portfolio and successful presentation with examples and some practical advices.\n\n\nSince this is Absolute beginners course, no previous knowledge of Zbrush, Blender or Substance Painter is required. I just always recommend with my courses that you practice and do the things i do, in order to get the best possible learning experience. So lets open Zbrush and dive in to the world of 3D characters.",

Photoshop always felt awkward to me for painting and making concept art but by starting with a sillhoute, mixing and matching and running through the techniques he provides it actually makes the step enjoyable and fun.\"\n- Nicholas Brajkovic",

Then this course is NOT for you.\n\n\nBut if you don't feel quite at home when drawing or sculpting human anatomy, and more specifically - female anatomy, then you've come to the right place!\n\n\nMy name is Niko, and i am a 3D character artist for about 11 years now. I started studying anatomy 20 years ago but at some point I realized that female anatomy was my weak point so  I was searching for such course. Sadly there were almost none available. And although female and male muscles and bones are pretty much the same, the forms are pretty different. So now, after alot of studying and practice, i decided to do a female anatomy course myself and i am doing this course by real time sculpting in Zbrush, because i think the best way to explain anatomy is to sculpt it in 3D and view muscles and forms from all angles.\n\n\n\n\nWe will start this course by making the overall shape of a female head, and i will explain its forms and proportions. Then we will make the torso shape and i will explain its muscles and forms. Next we will make the legs, and we will talk about their forms and muscles too. Feet are pretty much ignored by most artists, but we will learn about them too . After that, we will jump to the muscles and bones of the arms, which are also pretty interesting, so make sure not to miss it!\n\n\nThen we will make the basic form of the breasts, followed by hands and fingers. At this point, we will start detailing the face, where we will talk about proportions, sculpt, and draw all the face features, like nose, mouth, eyes, and as a bonus - the eyeballs.\nWe will continue with duplicating the head, and make a male head out of it. We will do the same with the torso, arms, legs, feet and hands, so we will have a separate male model for comparison.\n\n\nThen it will be time to combine all the parts of the female body and refine some areas. We will add eyebrows and eyelashes, nails, and we will cover certain areas for a bit of a decency :). Last, we will learn how to paint human skin and makeup and also make hair for better presentation.\n\n\nThis course doesn't require previous knowledge of anatomy, although it could be useful. I would also like to thank the Anatomy 4 sculptors for letting me use images from their amazing book. I really think it is a must have for all artists interested in anatomy. Although this course will give you practical knowledge about muscles, forms and bones, I do recommend using this book to refresh your knowledge when necessary.\npp. The red dress in the title photo is not included in the course. It is just to comply with Udemy nudity violations on the search pages :).",

Your 3d characters will be more realistic looking.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\nProper Anatomy of the Face\nMatching the face with the reference images\nRealistic wrinkles and Skin detailing of the face\n\n\nAbout Me:\nMy name is Victor Yamakado, I'm a 3d character artist with 10 years of experience in 3d art. I've been working for many years with Character Sculpting for collectibles and character modelling for production.\n\n\nWho is This Course For?\nThis course is focused on Intermediate Zbrush users who really want to take their sculpting and perceptions skills to a next level.\n\n\nWhat Are The Requirements Or Prerequisites For Taking This Course?\nYou should have prior working experience with Zbrush. This course is not for complete beginners.\nYou need Zbrush and a Graphic Tablet.\n\n\nDescription:\nIn this course, I want to share with you all the way I do for creating a complete and realistic portrait of Anthony Hopkins and make you fully introduced into this amazing journey of studying and recreating famous portraits. This surely is the most challenging skill that a 3d character modeller can have, once we needs to be always concerned on developing our perception and sculpting skills.\n\nBy sharing my process, I really want to make you open your eyes and take a whole new look at how do you perceive your references and how could you translate it in the sculpture process.\n\nWe will develop a stronger perception, by using many techniques for comparing distances, comparing a lot specific facial shapes and also understanding some of the most important features on the anatomical structures of the human face.\n\nWe will learn to identify these features in the reference and check if they are quite the same on the model. We start by building a pretty simple and generic basemesh, focusing on a good topology for doing portraits. Then we're gonna to sculpt firstly the Primary forms, capturing the overall likeness on volumes and silhouettes.\n\nAfter we break the symmetries and we start the fun! We're gonna try to match even more the overall volume, but now we start to sculpt realistic skin wrinkles and folding on the face.\nAnd finally, we'll cover my whole process of doing the surface details like skin pores or the Tertiary forms, as they are usually called. And for this, we will focus on using just the default alphas we have on Zbrush, this way everyone will be able to make an amazing realistic skin detail, blending and fully understanding how to apply each one of them.\n\nNot satisfied yet? Moreover, we'll also cover how do I modelled, sculpted and detailed his cloths, how did I do his hair with fibermesh and also how to do a really nice polypainting on your model, even on a greyscale presentation, simulating skin tones and a realistic eyes painting.\n\n\nJoin Me Now:\nSo if you want to make a realistic environment, then join me now, and take your skills to the next level. Don't forget that investing in yourself will pay for the rest of your life. Hope to see you in the course.",

      "description": "Using motion capture data in Blender is a great way to create amazing animations, and it has never been easier to get started.  In this course you’ll learn how to create, import, and configure motion capture data to be used in Blender.\nTo do this we will need a character, so we'll use Character Creator 3 to quickly create a character to be used for this process. You can also just download the finished character, or use a character of your own.\nWe will then import the character into Blender and set-up the rig using a Blender add-on called Auto-Rig Pro. It has some great tools to retarget the motion capture data to the character, and to adjust the character to get good looking animation.\nNext we'll use the Perception Neuron motion capture suit to create character animations. It’s a relatively low-cost system that allows you to get some really nice motion capture for your characters. But in a lecture at the end of the course, I’ll also show you how to use a pre-made motion capture file downloaded from the Mixamo website.\nIn the next section you’ll learn how to import the motion capture file and retarget it to your Blender character. We’ll talk about how to create a Bones List preset file and how to use Auto-Rig Pro’s Interactive Tweak tool to adjust the rig for better animation. And we will do a bit of Weight Painting to fix any deformation issues.\nFinally, you’ll learn how to bring your animated character into an existing scene and render out the final animation to a video file.",

It assumes some basic knowledge of Lumion already, therefore, during the course you will be able to achieve something more advanced than in our previous Lumion course. This time, instead of exterior renderings, we will be focused on interiors. These require much more complex lighting and materials settings that we will go over in the course.\nAfter downloading the project and following along through the first project (everything is provided for you) you will have the tools and knowledge you need to start creating your own photorealistic interior renderings. At this point in the course, we will start a new section with an additional project that applies everything we have learned, from beginning to end into a real life project. So, by the time you are done, you will have created two projects from beginning to end in Lumion, and you will know all the tips and tricks necessary to get good results in your own projects with Lumion.\nStudents will go through:\nStarting a new project\nIdea of assembling moodboards\nLoading in materials\nPlacing lights\nCreating realistic interior light setups\nCreate realistic materials\nThought process during production\nAdding post processing effects\nCreate photorealistic final renderings\nThis course is brought to you by LearnArchViz, a trusted source for architectural visualization training. The instructor, Andy, has partnered with LearnArchViz in order to bring his expert knowledge of Lumion to you. Andy and LearnArchViz will be here to provide support in the Q&A section of the course in a timely manner.\n\n\n*Satisfaction Guarantee: If you are not happy with the course for any reason, simply get a refund through Udemy within 30 days, no questions asked.",

This bundle will help you improve your 3D prop modelling and texturing skills massively as we go through each step together and learn many different techniques.\nAfter finishing the courses, you would easily be able to create the renders shown in the trailer and also create high quality props of your own.\nWe will start with modelling the prop in Blender, and we will learn different modelling techniques and learn a lot about different modifiers. After finishing the modelling, we will apply all the modifiers and UV unwrap our model for export.\nThen after that we will export our model to Substance Painter and start baking mesh maps for our model, after that we will start to texture our model. We will learn how to create realistic textures for our models by using different features in Substance like Smart Masks, Smart Materials etc.\nAfter we finish texturing in Substance Painter, we will take our model back to Blender and render it. We will set up the material, lighting, and the camera. We will also learn how to use HDRIs to light our scenes. We will finish every course by taking a portfolio ready render for every prop.\nThis course is for everyone who has a basic understanding of Blender and Substance Painter and wants to upgrade their skills.",

      "description": "Are you ready to start creating beautiful and engaging watercolor renderings from your SketchUp models using simple Photoshop techniques? If so, this is the only course for you on Udemy.\nCheck out the course details below for more information.\n\n\nWhat You Will Do In The Course\nCreate a \"digital watercolor\" in just a few hours!  Arch Viz professional, Scott Baumberger, walks through the process of how to make effective and beautiful architectural visualizations utilizing only SketchUp and Photoshop to produce a simulated watercolor technique.\nThe course will cover setting up a SketchUp model for efficient exporting, lighting, layer management, digital painting, and composition techniques, as well as strategies for incorporating feedback and revisions efficiently.\nThe course is hands-on, walking you through the workflow from start to finish.\nYou can either utilize the SketchUp model and entourage provided, or you can follow along with your own 3D model.\n\n\nWhy Use This Technique?\nSometimes our clients are not ready for photorealism. Maybe it is because the design is still in the conceptual phase, or just out of personal preference. This kind of technique can also be more conducive to quick iterations. Perhaps you are already an expert in SketchUp and just need a quick, easy and cheap way to add some life to your models. Whatever the reason, Scott offers the definitive course on how to take your SketchUp models from a basic modeling look, to a stunning watercolor rendering that is sure to engage the viewer.\n\n\nNotes On The Course\nInstructor and co-Instructor will be available to answer questions in the Q&A section of the course as quickly as possible.\nThe project files are available for download, so this course is very hands on (plus, free models for you!!!)\nSatisfaction Guarantee - This course has a 30 day money back guarantee. You can seek refund through Udemy for any reason during that time.\nInstructors\n\n\nScott Baumberger\nScott has been doing renderings for over 20 years, and in the design and architecture industry even longer. He is the founder and owner of Baumberger Studio and has done renderings for many of the biggest architectural firms in the country. He has also been been featured prominently on many important industry websites (cgarchitect, ronenbekerman, etc.) teaching his unique approach and workflow to arch viz. In addition to photorealistic renderings, Scott has also become known for his trademark digital watercolor technique (also known as NPR, or non-photorealistic) as shown in this course.\n\n\nAdam Zollinger\nAdam has been an arch viz professional for 15 years, in addition to several years as a draftsman and designer in the architectural industry. He is the founder of learnArchViz, a website dedicated to educating aspiring arch viz artists in the techniques and software that they need to succeed in the industry. As of this year, Adam has been able to teach about 70,000 students from all over the world with his digital learning courses. He has successful training courses in 3ds Max, V-Ray, Photoshop, Unreal Engine, After Effects, Lumion and more, all specifically catered to the needs of the arch viz community.",

      "description": "Hello and Welcome to Learners Guide to 3D Character Creation Vol 1: Zbrush & Retopology A new course dedicated to teaching how to sculpt, retopologize, 3D Characters all within Zbrush!\n\n\nHere not only are we focused on teaching you how to make 3D characters but also give emphasis through the course in \"practicing\" your skills as a sculptor OR beginner sculptor when creating 3D characters, therefore we chose a fun character theme challenge :  The Cyberpunk Hacker!\n\n\nTo that end, we crafted a course that will deliver 2 new unique approaches in teaching character creation by affording you the opportunity to sculpt through Split Screen Mode OR Multiple 2D Orthographic References\n- Split Screen Mode was introduced back in Zbrush version 2019.1 which has become more of a updated method of practicing your sculpting techniques geared toward the beginner but also intermediate users who are interested.  This is where we the instructors break up our character into sections of decimated meshes and demonstrate how they would be imported into your zbrush file.  Next we go over the basics of how to turn on split screen mode in your Zbrush viewport to have 2 screens, our mesh on the left and your mesh on the right! From there you interactively work with us when we sculpt this character out! ( checkout our the promotional video above right corner for demonstration in what to expect).\n- Multiple 2D Orthographic References -  Of course for more intermediate to advance users don't need to take Split Screen Mode  approach, alternatively we will be providing you multiple 2D orthographic references of the character in many of the areas to help aid in your sculpting process as we guide you in the sculpting of this character course.\n\n\nFeel free to learn through either approach OR a combinations of both!\n\n\n\n\nWhat we will teach\n\n\nZBRUSH CHARACTER SCULPTING:\n- A quick section breakdown to the basics of Zbrush for the beginner so no one gets left behind before we start.\n- How to create your own base mesh from scratch. (In addition we will be supplying you our own course learning base mesh for you to use as a bonus option)\n- How to pull clothing off of a blank  base mesh to sculpt full body clothing of a Cyberpunk Character as is done commonly in the industry pipeline.\n- Illustrate how to create seams utilizing fun combinations such as group loops with masking\n- Learn to craft hair within Zbrush through it's built in hair system Fibermesh, and demonstrate several methods to apply the hair upon the mesh\n\n\nRETOPOLOGIZING:\n- Learn several methods of retopologizing (process of creating Low Rez 3D models from High Rez sculpted meshes) Those methods below are:\n1.  The first is: Is an auto retopologizing approach with Zremesher 3.0 utilizing the Zremesher Guides Lines Brush as a method of directing clean edge flow.\n2. The second method is a manual retopologizing approach where we use Zmodelers 3D modeling tool Edge Extrusion to provide  more flexible option in 3D Character Modeling, over a finished High Rez sculpt.\n\n\n\n\n- (Disclaimer - this course is a 2 part course series with this first course being the focus of 3D character sculpting, retopologizing a character into a low rez character model as a primary focus of curriculum.  The upcoming second course focuses more to UVing, texturing and rendering)",

That is why I created this course.  In this course you will learn all about the soft body simulation in Blender! Basically, if you don't know, the soft body simulation is a way to add physics to your objects. It allows you to create flags, clothing, cushions, bouncing balls, and about anything you can think of.  We will be going into detail on each setting and how it all works. In the first couple sections we discuss the different options and values and how they effect the simulation.\nAfter that we will be creating 3 different complete scenes using the soft body simulation. The first one is a soda can getting crushed. We will first start out by modeling the soda can adding a texture to it and then using the soft body simulation we will crush it.\nThe second tutorial we will be creating Tetris in Blender. After modeling the pieces I will describe how to add the soft body simulation to each one and render it out.\nFinally the last section we will be learning how to create an obstacle course for a sphere to go through. In this section you will learn about modeling, animating materials, hair dynamics and much more!\nIf you are wanting to learn more about Blender's Soft body Simulation or if you just want to improve your skills in Blender this course is for you!\n\nPrograms that are used in this course: Blender\n\n\nI hope you are excited to jump into this course and create your own simulations!\nCan't wait to see what you create.\nThanks\nStephen",

      "description": "This course covers EVERYTHING that goes into producing a AAA 3D environment animation!\nDesigned for both experienced and beginner 3D artists, I'll bring you through all the steps I took while creating my most ambitious render... that includes modeling, texturing, lighting, tree creation, animating, rendering, color grading, and MUCH more. It's 13 hours of organized, super fun, and fully narrated chapters, without a single drop of my workflow left out. I took the production for this course very seriously... basically it won't waste your time. I also have tons of experience in streaming, teaching, video editing, audio work, etc. so I can guarantee that everything is super high quality and digestible! There's TONS of information here that I have accumulated over the past couple years as a full time 3D artist and I know there's something for everyone in here no matter your skill level. Speaking to beginner artists, I would have LOVED to had a course like this when I first started 3D, because sometimes all you need is that initial boost to really get rolling and I can't imagine this course wouldn't be the perfect thing for the job.\nThe softwares used for this project are Blender, Substance Painter, SpeedTree, and Davinci Resolve. Each are invaluable to my workflow and their jobs and functions are covered extensively, however they are not essential to everyone's pipeline. For example, the section covering my entire texturing process in Substance Painter serves as a great Substance tutorial but also a show of texturing knowledge that could certainly be applied in Blender or any other texturing software. I'll also add that if you are only interested in a specific part of the project, for example just the modeling or color grading, it's worth grabbing too! Super exciting to have you on board.\nThings covered:\nInspiration and reference gathering\nModeling - Blockout to High Poly\nUV Unwrapping\nTexel Density Calculations\nSubstance Painter - Basics to Advanced Material Creation & Texturing\nLighting\nFoliage - Scattering, wind systems using Geometry Nodes, more\nGeometry nodes\nBuilding concepts\nSpeedTree - Tree creation basics + advanced tree breakdown\nVarious animation tasks - Camera, grass, etc.\nRendering - Render settings breakdown\nBlender compositing - Atmosphere, etc.\nColor Grading - Complete color grading workflow using Davinci Resolve\n(and more)\nSoftwares covered:\nBlender\nSubstance Painter\nSpeedTree\nDavinci Resolve\nVarious - GIMP, etc.\nCourse format:\nThere are 19 total chapters, each with sub sections and overviews. The length of each section is usually between 10-30 minutes, edited to leave in as much process as possible while also not making you watch hours of boring in-between. Basically it's optimized to the best of my abilities. The process for the project is covered progressively however feel free to skip around to what chapter interests you. Everything is fully narrated of course and it runs a total of ~13 hours, enjoy!",

I'm more interested in this subject with every lesson I watch. Thank you!\"\n\"Even though I am experienced in CAM, I've had a career break and needed a refresher course before starting my new job. This course is perfect for my needs and the instructor has a clear idea on what he is teaching which makes it really valuable. Keep up the good work and Thank you!\"\n\"Clear and concises, I learned what I expected to and can now operate a CNC mill with confidence.\"\n\"So far this course is showin me the things I was wanting to learn, finding in it very intuitive and methodical in the approach\"\n\"That course is perfect for absolute CAM beginners who want to know how to wisely operate a CNC Router .\"\n\n\nIn this class you'll learn to control your CNC router with the help of Fusion 360. The process of creating toolpaths is what's called CAM (Computer-aided manufacturing).\nWe will use a real world example which you can follow along and recreate at your own pace. Each section is designed to teach you how to create a specific toolpath while also discussing important concepts that will deepen your understanding of machining\nMore precisely, here are the chapters and what you can expect to learn :\n\n\nIntroduction - we'll go over the project we are tackling and what you can expect.\nWorkflow of CAM, vocabulary and g-code - This lecture is about the general workflow followed in CAM. We get accustomed to the vocabulary and take a look at a g-code to understand what it's all about\nPreviewing the end result and importing a part - We'll learn to import parts and preview the end result of the class (so you know where we're going)\nCreating your first toolpath - In this first toolpath we keep things simple. We first define our stock and WCS, then we create a tool with the relevant speeds and we go through the steps to create a toolpath.\nCreating a 2D pocket operation - The main goal is to take a deeper look at the different parameters of a toolpath, especially feeds and speeds.\n3D toolpaths - We explore 3D toolpaths and have a discussion about the order of operations\nDrilling operation - We learn to create a drilling operation and discuss the different speeds associated with drilling\nCutting away the shape with 2D contour - We learn to cut away a shape with 2D contour and discuss tabs and tool length\nExporting g-codes and discussing tool offsets - We export g-codes, discuss post-processor and how to manage different tool lengths on your CNC\nPlanning tests and creating toolpaths from 2D drawings - We create toolpaths from a 2D drawing and discuss the importance of preliminary tests on your CNC\nDouble sided machining - We discuss the intricacies of double sided machining and provide an easy solution for it\nFinal thoughts - We take a look back at what we've learned and emphasize on the important stuff you should takeaway\nEXTRA : Tool Selection Guide - This section covers end mills in details, from the geometry to the material in order to help you choose the appropriate end mill.\nDo you have a CNC and don’t know how to use it?\nDo you feel like you know how to use it but are really just guessing?\nDoes your local maker space has a CNC and you’re intimidated by it?\nDo you already know CAM but want to improve your understanding of it?\nDo you want a machine to do all the hard work and make money for you? (Of course you do!)\n\nIf you see yourself in any of these statements then this class is for you. I’ve made this class for anyone who wants to learn CAM through Fusion 360. CAM stands for Computer-aided manufacturing so in this class we’ll be creating toolpaths that a CNC can follow to machine different kinds of material and shapes. In other words, we’ll be doing the prep work and the CNC will be doing the heavy and precise lifting for us.\n\nMy main motivation with building this class was this : Fusion has made it too easy to create toolpaths for a CNC router. With a few clicks you’ll have a set of instructions for your CNC and as much as this is great, it’s also terrifying. We’re not dealing with a small 3D printer here, we have a spinning tool moving at a rapid pace that is very dangerous if not tamed properly. So for this reason, I wanted to not only show people how to use Fusion, but more importantly provide you with the knowledge you’ll need to make smart decisions and learn to program your CNC safely and efficiently.\n\nWith hobbyist CNCs becoming more affordable and accessible (which is great!) I believe that it’s important to educate people as much as possible to the world of CAM. And with Fusion 360 offering a great and free CAM solution, the timing has never been this good for us to dive into this wonderful subject together!\n\nThis class covers everything from importing parts to exporting a g-code with everything in between, including 2D and 3D toolpaths, calculating feeds and speeds, running tests, double sided machining and much more.\n\nSo I want to welcome you and thank you for joining my class. Feedback is appreciated, and remember to stay safe!",

      "description": "Most of the features in SolidWorks are called\" sketch-based features\", that is why in this course, we have extra attention to 2D sketching. Then the attention is directed to three main topics, the first one is to learn SolidWorks features, the second one is to have practice so you can use these features and the third one is to have real life examples on using these features. By completing this course your level in modeling will be intermediate. Three types of modeling are covered:\n\n\n1- Solid modeling. Here you will be able to create 3D models using SolidWorks solid modeling features which is the main technique in creating 3D models in general.\n\n\n2-Sheet metal modeling. Since Sheetmetal design is a basic element is metal fabrication and it is widely used in manufacturing, this course focuses on teaching the theory and techniques in order to be able to create models using Sheet Metal features.\n\n\n3-Structural steel modeling (SolidWorks Weldments). Since Structural steel modeling is a basic element is metal fabrication and it is widely used in manufacturing, this course focuses on teaching the theory and techniques in order to be able to create models using Structural steel modeling.\n\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, the topics covered in this course must be known by mechanical engineers.",

I just wanted to learn Cartoon Animator as quickly as possible so I could spend more time creating my own animations without getting stuck on things I had yet to learn.\n\n\nWith just over three and a half hours of video tutorials The Lazy Animator Beginner's Guide to Cartoon Animator is a crash course in all the main features you need to know in order to make 2D animated cartoons with Cartoon Animator. Suited to complete beginners or even if you've already been learning Cartoon Animator for a while.\n\n\nFollow along but there are no step by step projects to complete. The course is a structured walkthrough of all the essential features you need to know to make amazing animations. Note that while this course does not cover the new features of Cartoon Animator 5 (which was released a year after this course was published) all the animation tools you will learn about remain unchanged in Cartoon Animator 5. Animating the new Vector Characters and props is exactly the same as animating the raster based characters and props.\n\n\nDesigned to teach you the easiest concepts first, gradually moving up to harder, more complex features, that you will not be intimidated by, if you follow through all the videos in order.\nThere are six main video topics (with each topic section split into about ten minute bites so you're never too far from taking a break). You'll learn about:\n\n\nNavigating the stage, Scenes, Converting Props, Saving Scenes and Projects (2 Videos).\n(New Video has been added comparing Cartoon Animator 4's Content Manager to Cartoon Animator 5's new Smart Content Manager to help you find where the sections in CA4's manager are now located in CA5).\n\n\nHow to animate the camera using the Timeline and Transition Curves (1 Video).\n\n\nAll the types of Props and how to transform, deform, and animate them using Transitions, Transition Curves or Elastic Motions, plus where each system creates key frames in the timeline. (3 Videos).\n\n\nAll the types of Characters and how to animate G3 Characters using pre-animated motions, pre-animated root motions, and the 2D Key Motion editor, as well as how to modify, make, and save custom motions. You'll also learn where motion files and the 2D Key Motion editor make key frames in the timeline and how you can apply transition curves to them. (6 Videos).\n\n\nHow to make your characters talk with auto lip syncing, and how to manually adjust the lip sync in the timeline. You'll learn how to animate G3 character faces using the Face Puppet Editor or the Face Key Editor. You'll learn where both systems create key frames in the timeline and how you can apply transforms, deforms, and transition curves to facial animations. You'll also learn about character layers and where to find the key frames for those. (6 Videos).\n\n\nFinally  you'll learn how to add sound effects and music, adjust their volume, and how to edit audio in the timeline. Then you'll learn how to export your work as a single frame, frame sequence, transparent video, or standard video ready to import into your preferred video editor. (2 Videos).\n\n\nAs you can see, even the course outline goes from easy to progressively harder concepts because so much thought has gone into the learning order.\n\n\nAgain, I highly recommend you watch all the videos in order, at least once, even if you think you already know the earlier stuff (those sections are short, you'll power through them!). The order matters because later videos assume you've seen what has been shown before. It's how I can teach so much in such a short time.\n\n\nThe included Office and Business Woman Project Scene\n\n\nIf getting you up to advanced level with Cartoon Animator as fast as possible wasn't enough, the course comes with a free Office scene project that is Render Styles compatible (you'll know what that means by part 3 of the course if you're completely new), and includes a G3-360 head, bone hands, Office woman character that you can use in your own personal or commercial projects.\n\n\nWhen you're finished the course there is a PDF document with all the time codes for what you learned in each video so you can easily find anything you wish to revisit without having to scrub through each video trying to remember where that information was.\n\n\nEssentially this is the last beginner's course you'll ever need. It doesn't teach you everything (how could it in just over three and a half hours) but it goes so much further than any other beginners course. Even advanced users might find a thing or two they haven't tried or didn't know about.\n\n\nCreated by me (David Arandle (TET)), a Certified Reallusion Trainer, I've been animating with Cartoon Animator 4 since its first iteration as CrazyTalk Animator Pro, released in 2010.",

With it, one can take filmmaking and editing to the next level. Objects or backgrounds can be removed from video footage and replaced with new content. Logos, text, or doodles can be inserted into the frame and animated. Shaky scenes can be smoothed, weather elements added, and flat shapes converted into three-dimensional images. Simply put, After Effects lets artists digitally perfect whatever was caught on camera, regardless of skill level. From home movies to class projects to professionally shot videos, After Effects provides the tools necessary to make one's vision a reality. After Effects can be purchased individually or as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite.\nWhat are some alternatives to Adobe After Effects?\nAlternatives to Adobe After Effects include HitFilm Pro, Apple Motion, and Filmora. HitFilm Pro, now on its 15th edition, features over 875 visual effects and presets, color grading tools, three-dimensional rendering, and camera tracking. Apple Motion is an option only compatible with Mac operating systems. With it, one can render unique, three-dimensional movie titles, add realistic elements like rain or smoke, professionally correct color, and more. Filmora is made by Wondershare and comes in two versions: Filmora X and FilmoraPro. Filmora X is recommended for beginners, offering numerous filters and color-matching tools as well as video and sound effects. FilmoraPro is better for intermediate- to professional-level filmmakers and editors, delivering more advanced and customizable effects. Both feature intuitive interfaces for users.\nWhat careers use Adobe After Effects?\nAdobe After Effects is used in a wide variety of professional industries. Filmmakers, YouTubers, bloggers, social media marketers, website designers, television producers, and video game artists use After Effects to create realistic and compelling visual stories. Those in the film and television industry benefit from Adobe After Effects’ extensive title and credit sequence capabilities, as well as scene transitioning. Directors and editors also have more control over the creative process with After Effects. For small business owners and entrepreneurs, After Effects lets them take control of their advertising and marketing. Without having to rely on advertising firms, small businesses can create their own commercials and social media content. Adobe After Effects can also help polish the personal websites and portfolios of anyone trying to break into these and other industries.\nWhat are the system requirements for Adobe After Effects?\nAdobe After Effects can be installed on both Mac and Microsoft Windows operating systems. For Mac, the following minimum specifications are required: multi-core Intel processor with 64-bit support; Mac operating system, versions 10.13 or later; 16 GB; two GB of GPU VRAM; six GB of available hard-disk space (although more space may be required while installing); monitor display resolution of 1440 x 900 or higher; and a reliable internet connection.

Before installation, subscriptions must be paid and validated.\nWhat skills or experience do I need before starting to learn After Effects?\nYou don’t need any basic digital animation, filmmaking, and editing skills or experience to learn After Effects. However, familiarity with other Adobe programs may help (Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro). There are plenty of video tutorials, articles, blog posts, and Udemy courses you can take to help you understand the skills you need to successfully use After Effects.

My name is Jan Boode, professional creator and educator in gamedesign and 3D. In this course I will be your pragmatic guide and show you step by step how to create an awesome poseable fighter girl in Blender!\n\n\nSplit up in modules the course will go over every discipline needed to accomplish beautiful renders. This is the way.\n\n\nWe start out with a blockout following the reference art provided with the course. Then with only a few brushes we create a highly detailed sculpt keeping accurate anatomy in mind. After we create a really clean retopology we can project all of that detail back on a mesh with only a fraction of the vertices used in the sculpt.\n\n\nIn the modeling section we add hair, jewelry, clothes, belts, an arm bandage, high heels and a wizard staff so our girl is ready to fight evil.\n\n\nWe create clean UV's for texture painting and forge detailed PBR textures for the clothes and wizard staff using nodes. To view all of this we build a simple studio with lights and a HDRI image.\n\n\nAfter we create a rig and learn about various ways to bind objects to it our character is ready to be posed in countless ways using shape keys and the pose library.\n\n\nThen it's time to build an environment for our fighter girl to exist in. We create walls, floors, pipes, a neon logo and other objects to go around the scene. All of these elements will of course receive PBR materials and textures.\n\n\nFinally we make sure our render settings and passes, camera and all of our lighting is on point and render out a studio version and an environment version of our model using cycles. After that we do some postproduction in the compositor and you will be ready to save out your images.\n\n\nAll of this is done using nothing but Blender. There is no use of any paid addons.\n\n\nBy doing this course you will have a thorough understanding of all the disciplines needed to create a detailed character in Blender. Join today!",

      "description": "Ok, so you prepared a character in illustrator and you want to animate it inside after effects.\nThe problem is that you have to put every single piece of the body in a new position and that can be very tedious.\nEven for simple movements, like weaving good bye to a friend.\nYou need to do a bunch of clicks and repositioning each single part.\nWell, there is a faster way to do it.\nYou can connect each part of the body, so you can move it easily, with just a few clicks and drags.\nAnd if you need to change the hand, you don’t have to disappear the hand, and reappear another one, no. You can set a rig with replacement animation, and just by moving a switch layer you can easily change to any version of the hand you want.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nHow to rig a character inside after effects.\nHow to set forward kinematics: So you can move your character easily, without having do draw each frame\nHow to set up inverse kinematics: An advanced mathematical formula that lets you control your character easily, and all done automatically without you having to scratch your head figuring out any formula.\nThe clear difference between Forward Kinematics, and Inverse Kinematics, two concepts that a lot of animators are not familiar with.\nHow to set up replacement animation: A technique in which you can change for example, the mouth of your character, to express different phonemes, so then, you can add some lip sync.\nEvery step is explained in detail, and I also take the time to tell you why we do the things we are doing, so you will always know what we are doing, why and to what outcome.\nVery nice.\nEnroll now and start rigging your character for your next animation.

Sign up for the course today!\nWHAT IS SPINE?\nSpine is an animation tool that focuses specifically on 2D animation for games. Spine aims to have an efficient, streamlined workflow, both for creating animations and for making use of those animations in games.\nBENEFITS\nAnimation in Spine is done by attaching images to bones, then animating the bones. This is called skeletal or cutout animation and has numerous benefits over traditional, frame-by-frame animation:\nSmaller size Traditional animation requires an image for each frame of animation. Spine animations store only the bone data, which is very small, allowing you to pack your game full of unique animations.\nArt requirements Spine animations require much fewer art assets, freeing up time and money better spent on the game.\nSmoothness Spine animations use interpolation so animation is always as smooth as the frame rate. Animations can be played in slow motion with no loss in quality.\nAttachments Images attached to bones can be swapped to outfit a character with different items and effects. Animations can be reused for characters that look different, saving countless hours.\nMixing Animations can be blended together. For example, a character could play a shoot animation while also playing a walk, run or swim animation. Changing from one animation to another can be smoothly crossfaded.\nProcedural animation Bones can be manipulated through code, allowing for effects like shooting toward the mouse position, looking toward nearby enemies, or leaning forward when running up hill.",

      "description": "Blender 2.8 Model Texture Animate & Simulate Complete Guide\n\n\nCourse Description\n\n\nHi and welcome to this new 3D Tudor course, ‘Blender 2.8 Model Texture Animation & Simulation full Guide’. This is my most exciting course to date. The focus of this course is to show you how to make realistic models, to a real-world scale. Enroll in this course and experience 30 hours of content, full of learning opportunities to take your 3D modeling, animation and simulations skills to the next level. By completing this course, you will walk away with a comprehensive view of how to model from the ground up, with a super-fast workflow.\n\n\nModeling\nWe will be creating a medieval catapult – the ultimate war-time machinery for ultimate casualty numbers. You will be familiar with those from your war simulation games, and this course will help you recreate this engineering masterpiece on your own. We will be creating a fully functioning medieval catapult, including the bolts and beams needed for everything to work in a hyper-realistic way. As this is part of my Blender 2.8 courses, we will be going through all the new shortcuts to model, texture, animate, and simulate a model. Advanced modeling techniques are included in this course.\n\n\nTexturing\nTexturing is perhaps the most important part of any 3D model. I will show you the most efficient and quickest ways of preparing a mesh for adding materials. We will be going over how to mark seems, how to correct texture resolutions, and how to UV unwrap. All these course components would be a course in their own right, so by enrolling, you will be able to develop your skills in a multi-faceted way. To save time on your usual trial and error process, I will show you the right and wrong way of doing this to fully prepare you and give you the skills to clean a 3D model mesh to industry standard.\n\n\nFreebies\nYou will be glad to know that this course comes with a library of resources that you are free to download and reuse in your other projects, or in the catapult project you upload as part of this course. I created all these textures and resources using Substance Designer, all custom made, specifically for this course.\n\n\nBones\nThis course will show you basic to intermediate skills of animating using Blender 2.8 software. We will be completing a complete armature from scratch, and you will learn how to place bones to help you make animating feel like a breeze. Using the techniques I will teach you, you will be able to export your animations into game engines like Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity. To help you keep up with the course progress, we will break down parts of the armature creation process, and I will show you how to organize everything efficiently.\n\n\nAnimation\nHave you ever wanted to learn how to build a full animation cycle? The learning outcomes of this course include creating a complete animation cycle in Blender 2.8. As part of animating this medieval catapult, we will be working on making it's propelling motion realistic, working hard to make each individual component move in a hyper-real way. You can apply these skills to any animations you decide to make in the future, and I would be excited to see you upload animations of other models as part of this course project. You will also be shown how to keyframe, and advanced components of this course within a course will show to create rope where the textures change as the animation rolls.\n\n\nSimulation\nFire is an essential component in every medieval catapult, and this course will also show you how to simulate a boulder’s flames. We will be simulating realistic fire and smoke using nothing more than Blender 2.8 to make a fully operable war machine. You will also learn how to create materials from scratch using the Blender 2.8 nodes system. We will be combining this fire simulation with your animation to create a medieval catapult model you can be proud of.\n\n\nRendering\nFinally, after all the preparations for making a hyper-realistic medieval catapult model, truly worthy for a gruesome battlefield, we will be rendering the animation into a short film. You will learn how to use lighting from three high-dynamic-range images (HDRIs) – also include in this course for you to use, as a freebie. We will be setting up cameras and I will be going through different techniques to help improve the quality of your renders. Our render will be set out in the Blender 2.8 video editor.",

      "description": "Stylised 3D Game Model: Complete Beginners’ Guide\n\n\nHi and welcome to this new 3D Tudor Udemy course, ‘Stylised 3D Game Model: Complete Beginners’ Guide’. This is complete beginner’s guide to creating a 3D stylised game model. This course will teach you how to create a stylised 3D model from scratch to a professional level, following industry pipelines. If you ever wondered how AAA assets are made by some of the biggest players in the industry, then stay tuned and find out what this course is all about.\nLike my other Udemy courses, I will be taking you on an extensive 3D modeling journey involving modeling, texturing, freebies, lighting and rendering a game ready 3D asset. The focus of this Udemy course is to show you how to make realistic models, to a real-world scale. Enroll in this Blender 2.83 course and experience over 8 hours of content, full of learning opportunities to take your 3D modeling, sculpting, texturing, lighting and rendering skills up by quite a few notches. By completing this course, you will walk away with a comprehensive view of how to model from the ground up, with a super-fast industry-standard workflow. All this exclusively in Blender 2.8.\n\n\n‘Stylised 3D Game Model: Complete Beginners’ Guide’ has a new learning format that will be relevant to beginners. This course is also relevant to those students who are more familiar with 3D creation and modeling using Blender software, or those who are transitioning into Blender from another piece of software or from the previous older versions of Blender.\nUsing everything I learned from previous courses, mainly from all your helpful feedback, I was able to make a course that really has the wow-factor; something you will be proud of accomplishing.\n\n\nModelling\nThis course will teach you how to model stylised assets from the ground up, using Blender 2.83. Whether you are an absolute beginner or someone who is looking to elevate their skill level, animations will be telling you all about modifiers, Blender functions, and key commands, which will guide you along the way – popping up right when you need them. This course explains everything and will include a step-by-step exploration of all the new shortcuts that have come with this new Blender version. Best of all, this unique course functionality also lets you set your own pace. This allows the course to be viable for Blender users of any level.\nBy the end of the course, the knowledge you will have learned can be put to use independent of the direction you take in 3D modeling – following the amateur or the professional path.\n\n\nSculpting\nNext, to take our 3D model to the next level, we take a deep dive into Zbrush. You will learn various simple Zbrush techniques to bring your 3D creation to life. This course will take you through the very basics of the Zbrush UI, all the way up to preparing a model for export. What is more, you will be learning new sculpting skills, in addition to learning how to optimise your model to make it game ready.\n\n\nTexturing\nIn this section, we will be using Substance Painter. Substance Painter is an industry standard software. You will learn how to create complex stylised materials from scratch. We will also go over how to lay or apply multiple materials to meshes. As we texture, we will take an in depth look at how to create texture bakes using high- and low-poly models. In the end, you will come away with a broad understanding of maps and textures, all in just a few hours.\n\n\nRendering\nFinally, to present our model in the professional way and make it really stand out in any portfolio, we will be rendering out in Marmoset Toolbag 3. We look at the best texture maps to use for rendering, and we will go over how to set up not only just one render, but three, including a fully textured and wireframe turntable. You will come away with renders which you will be proud to show off on your social media. By the time we have finished rendering in Marmoset Toolbag 3, you will have the knowledge and confidence to create stylised assets that look like they fell out straight out of a game.\nI always feel that lighting is one of the key components that tend to be the most overlooked. To be honest, I learned this the hard way, seeing as lighting is important with regards to making a scene pop. I have taught you how to set up your lighting in my previous course, ‘Blender 2.8 Model a Lightsaber for Beginners’, within Blender, but this time, we will take it a step further. All lighting including environment lighting and extra light were set up within Marmoset Toolbag 3.\n\n\nDownload Pack\nBest of all, this course also comes with a free download pack, full of everything you will need for the course. This will include things like full references, Zbrush brushes, and textures just to name a few. The ‘Stylised 3D Game Model: Complete Beginners’ Guide’ course download pack will include 3 different brushes, one resolution map, five rope textures (albedo, height, metallic, normal, roughness), a skull decal, and a wood grain illustration.\nThese are resources that you are free to download and reuse in your other projects. I created all these textures and resources using a mix of Substance Designer, and Adobe Photoshop (e.g., for the smoke decal). All textures included for free with this course are custom made specifically for this course.\n\n\nSo, with all that said, I hope I have whetted your appetite to start your journey into stylised 3D game asset creation. Check out the free introduction and I am sure you won’t be able to put this course down. Check it out. You have nothing to lose, but everything to gain.\n\n\n\n\nI had a blast making this course and I am sure you will too!\n\n\nHappy modeling everyone!\nNeil, 3D Tudor",

Well, now what do you do? Welcome to Learn Toon Boom Animate & How to Create Your Own Cartoons! In this course, I’ll show you the essentials for creating your own animation, using the professional software, Toon Boom Animate 3.\nIn this course, you'll learn to:\nCreate, and animate your own 2D digital puppet!\nAnimate your character, and even give them a simple walk cycle\nMake your scenes look complex, by using simple camera moves.\nMake your characters talk, using Toon Boom's automatic lipsync\nAdd Photoshop, and Illustrator files to your animations\nand much, much more!\n\n\n\nToon Boom is an industry leader in creating 2D animation software, and has been used for animating The Simpsons, Family Guy, Bob’s Burgers, Sponge Bob Square Pants, and even Disney’s The Frog Princess.\nIn 2D animation, there are basically 2 types of animation, full animation, also referred to as hand-drawn, or “Disney” animation, wherein each frame of animation is drawn… think classic Bugs Bunny cartoons. The second type of 2D animation is called limited animation, also referred to as cut-out, or Flash animation… most prime-time animation, The Simpsons, etc. use cut-out animation. The major focus of this course is cut-out animation, where we will create, rig, and animate a 2D digital puppet… our main character, Bob.\nFor the traditional animator, Toon Boom software has the feeling of 2D animation software, built for animators. Throughout the course, I’ll be showing you the different tools and windows, all of which are based on traditional animation terms like pegs, fields, color cards, onionskin, light tables, and more.\nFor the more seasoned digital animator, if you’re familiar with working with programs like Flash, throughout the course I’ll be demonstrating how Toon Boom Animate differs and what makes it a powerful program. Just one example, Animate has a camera that works in 3D space. Imagine setting up a multiplane scene in just minutes, without you having to install any additional plugins or software!\nThe best part of this course? Even if you don’t own Toon Boom Animate, you can download a FREE fully functioning demo. Toon Boom creates PLEs (Personal Learning Editions) for virtually all of their software.\n\nSo, if you’re ready to learn how to animate, purchase this course and let’s get started!",

In this course you will learn everything there is to know about the rigid body.\n\nWe will first start out by understand what the simulation is and how to use it properly. After that we will jump into Blender and learn all about the different settings and values and how they effect the simulation. We will also learn about rigid body constraints and exactly how to use them. Other things you will learn about include rigid body world, rigid body dynamics, collision groups and more.\n\nThere are 3 different tutorials that we go through to demostrate the simulation. The first one is a the render you see on screen. We will be using an array modifier and simulating every single cube to get this effect.\nThe next one is an obstacle course for a sphere to go through. This section we will be using different rigid body constraints and techniques to push the sphere where we want it to go.\n\nFinally the last section we will be exploding a wall with a monkey head. You will learn about animation and keyframes and more. Every tutorial in this course we use the Eevee to render!\n\nIf you want to learn all about the Rigid Body simulation and all its features hit that enroll button and lets get started!\nPrograms used in this course: Blender 3D\nOutro Song provided by Tasty:\nTitle: VOIID - Azure\nLabel Channel: TastyNetwork\nThanks!\nStephen",

Starting from a simple concept, we will create a base mesh for our creature, move into sculpting, and finish with Retopology and UV layout. The tutorial focuses heavily on sculpting fundamentals in ZBrush, as well as the necessary tools to create a game resolution mesh using Maya. By the end of the module you will have a game resolution character ready for the texturing process.\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nAn adopted son of San Francisco and the Academy of Art University, Ryan Ribot lives a small apartment with 3 cats and a Wacom. Currently working as a texture artist and character modeler with Telltale Games, Ryan spends most of his time painting and sculpting. ZBrush, Photoshop, and Maya are like breathing to him, and he is always looking to share his knowledge. Ryan has been teaching for several years, and is experienced as both an instructor and an industry professional.",

Its powerful, updated regularly and its free. What's not to love? In fact its now reached the point where you can begin creating objects procedurally using a brand new system called geometry nodes. With geometry nodes we can:\nCreate basic shapes with just a view nodes\nEasily generate base assets that can be adjusted into various shapes and sizes\nBuild modular pieces for larger objects and for game design\nApply particle instances to fill up an entire scene with objects.\n\n\nWe start things off easy in this course. Focusing on a few of the core nodes for building basic objects to give you the chance to learn how to use the geometry node editor from the ground up. As we move through the sections we introduce more and more nodes and more ways of using the node editor, but don't worry, because each time we introduce a new node we make sure that you know exactly how it works, why its used and how you can use it too.\n\n\nBailylDesign has over 30 courses to date related to Blender and 1000's of students have participated in those courses. Our main goal is to ensure that you as the student gets the best educational content and resources to upskill in the world of CG, whether it be modelling, texture painting or animation.\n\n\nIt is important to note that this course is Project Based. This means that learning comes as a result of completing various projects that scale up in difficulty as we move through the course. Additional resources will also be provided as a means of improving student learning throughout. Some of these include:\nQuizzes\nProject Reviews\nReference Material\nVarious Additional Challenges\n\n\nBy the end of this class students will be able to create almost any object using geometry nodes and be able to do so in a way that allows them to adjust models procedurally. They will be able to combine various nodes to adjust the behaviour of the object any create new parameters for control. Students will also be able to generate entire scenes using a combination of point and attribute nodes, which are the node editors version of the particle system.\n\n\nRegardless of if you are a beginner or an experienced user, this is the perfect course for you to begin learning about these incredible new tools in Blender.\n\n\nWith a single one of fee, you can get lifetime access to the entire course, now and forever. The course is also subject to a no risk 30 day money back guarantee so if you don't think the course is for you then you can get your full refund within the time frame.\n\n\nSo lets get Blending with geometry nodes!",

Includes every detail and training on a variety of stop motion animations apart from in depth knowledge about any equipment or software involved in its execution. With special stress on how to do it on a budget.\nSTOP MOTION ANIMATION is either perceived to be too easy by some, until they try a hand at it, or too difficult, until they try a hand at it. The art of Stop Motion animation is neither too difficult nor too easy. It is just too interesting.\nIn this course you shall be guided on every nuance you need to know to be able to execute almost every type of Stop Motion Animation.\nWe shall cover every step in details, ranging from what and how a story for stop motion animation should be and how does it differ from other forms of story telling. We cover how to create an environment that finally leads to the execution of that story.\nWe learn every essential technology involved in the production of a stop motion animation and even discuss a few trade secrets, tips and tricks.\nThe language of the course is simple English, and we have not tried to come off as hard core geeks who use unfathomable words. And even if we do mention such words here and there, we always follow it with explanation and relevance.\nthe HIGHLIGHT OF THIS COURSE is that you not only learn how to make a great stop motion animation but also become comfortable and then confidant in VIDEO EDITING ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO CS6 and LEARN PHOTOGRAPHY ON DSLR WITH IN DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF MANUAL SETTINGS. This course will make you a master in things that may open more creative doors for you in the field of media.\nYou could complete the course in 1 day if you wanted, but we recommend you take it slow and take at least 7 days to complete this course.\nThe structure of the course is like a seed that grows into a tree. Every following lecture will make more sense as you go along and seem effortlessly organic.\nStop Motion animation, if used intelligently, if really charming and amazing. But the best part about this animation is, that you don't even need to be a professional animator to be able to execute this. It will just be a shame to not know this one.",

      "description": "Hi and welcome to this new 3D Tudor Udemy course, ‘Blender 2.8 Model a Lightsaber for Beginners’. Sci-fi is here to stay and I am happy to announce that I am releasing another 3D Tudor modeling course under this genre. I have not moved to pastures anew permanently, but 3D Tudor courses aim to be versatile in helping you explore different art styles. The sci-fi genre would not be the same without certain archetypes, and with ‘Blender 2.8 Creating a Lightsaber for Beginners’, we will be learning how to make a lightsaber. As before, we are learning together, and trial and error will help your workflow as you will be presented with solutions to common problems.\n\n\nThis is one of my most exciting Udemy courses to date. Like my other Udemy course, ‘Blender 2.8 Beginners Guide To 3D Modeling A Sci-fi Scene’, I will be taking you on an extensive 3D modeling journey involving modeling, texturing, freebies, animation, lighting and rendering a sci-fi asset. The focus of this Udemy course is to show you how to make realistic models, to a real-world scale. Enroll in this Blender 2.8 course and experience over 8 hours of content, full of learning opportunities to take your 3D modeling, animation and simulations skills to the next level. By completing this course, you will walk away with a comprehensive view of how to model from the ground up, with a super-fast industry-standard workflow. All this exclusively in Blender 2.8.\n\n\nUsing everything I learned from previous courses, mainly from all your helpful feedback, I was able to make a course that really has the wow-factor; something you will be proud of accomplishing.\n\n\nMy move into the sci-fi scene has been met with remarkable student feedback, such as:\n\n\n“I found the course great. And the asset is shaping to be something that looks at home in Metroid or Halo- I really think the end asset does look that good. Plus for a little extra spice, you could also bring the asset into Substance Painter and truly make it your own. Overall whether this is your first Blender course or you have been around before, the course is worth it. The instructor does not go too fast or skips about how he did; a, b, c -everything is explained.”.\nThrough my introduction of on-screen tooltips, 3D Tudor courses have become much more beginner-friendly and in-depth. The focus of this new course is to take anyone no matter their level in 3D modeling and teach them how to model a lightsaber from the ground up. The course has nearly 9 hours of content and is a one-stop course to take you on your way to a professional level. By joining this Udemy course you will engage in a journey of in-depth learning focused on the most important aspects of 3D modeling and animation. Blender Procedures will cover modeling, texturing, animation, lighting, and rendering. By the end of the course, you will have created a professional-looking sci-fi asset most commonly known as a lightsaber.\n\n\nModeling\nWe will be creating one of the most famous sci-fi assets – the lightsaber – a contraption reminiscent of popular cinema titles. This course is coming out just a few months before a major game release that will revolutionize the sci-fi genre, Cyberpunk 2077 by Project Red.\n\n\n‘Blender 2.8 Creating a Lightsaber for Beginners’ has a new learning format that will be relevant to beginners. This course is also relevant to those students who are more familiar with 3D creation and modeling using Blender software, or those who are transitioning into Blender from another piece of software or from the previous older versions of Blender.\n\n\nThis Udemy course aims to teach you from the ground up. It will cover the very basics of modeling and teach you the tips and tricks that the pros use in Blender 2.8. This course explains everything and will include a step-by-step exploration of all the new shortcuts that have come with this new Blender version. You will be able to keep up with the course’s pace through having an on-screen visual tooltip. Anything that needs some explanation is explained easily using a small pop-up box, so you will never be lost. My goal here is to not only have students re-create this lightsaber but for them to come away with a comprehensive understanding of how and why. By the end of the course, the knowledge you will have learned can be put to use independent of the direction you take in 3D modeling – following the amateur or the professional path.\n\n\nTexturing\nTexturing is perhaps the most important part of any 3D model. I will show you the most efficient and quickest ways of preparing a mesh for adding materials in Blender. We will be going over how to mark seems, how to correct texture resolutions, and how to UV-unwrap. A new thing in this course will be learning how to mark sharps, so that you can create hard and soft edges for your 3D models within Blender 2.8. You will also be able to keep these edges you create even if you are exporting to Substance Painter or Unreal Engine 4. All these course components would be a course in their own right, so by enrolling, you will be able to develop your skills in a multi-faceted way. To save time on your usual trial and error process, I will show you both the right and the wrong way of doing this. You will be fully prepared and provided with the skills to ‘clean’ a 3D model mesh to an industry standard.\n\n\nWe will also explore the Blender 2.8 node system in depth, where you will learn not only how to import textures and maps, but also how to change the way materials look.\n\n\nAnimation\nHave you ever wanted to learn how to build a full animation cycle? The learning outcomes of this Udemy course include creating a complete animation cycle in Blender 2.8. The lightsaber we will be creating will be animated with light coming out and in. The animation will be set up in such a way that the light (i.e., blade) will be following the assigned movement consistent with how the lightsaber moves – making it perfect for fight scenes!. You will learn all about armatures and bones, and you will be shown how to keyframe. We will move on to the complex fundamentals of animations, where we learn how to weight and attach bones to meshes. This is exactly the same process as in Hollywood for computer-generated imaging (CGI) or the respective gaming industry. You can apply these skills to any animations you decide to make in the future, and I would be excited to see you upload animations of other models as part of this Udemy course project.\n\n\nFreebies\nYou will be glad to know that this Udemy course comes with a small resource pack of five 2k resolution texture maps including all albedo (i.e., color), normal, roughness, metallic, and displacement maps free to download with this course. These are resources that you are free to download and reuse in your other projects. You could also utilize them in your lightsaber course project, which you are encouraged to upload as part of this course. Freebies also include two references, created in Adobe Photoshop, created specifically for this course: a dual lightsaber, and a small lightsaber. I created all these textures and resources using a mix of Substance Painter, and Adobe Photoshop. All textures included for free with this course are custom made specifically for this course.\n\n\nLighting\nI always feel that lighting is one of the key components that tend to be the most overlooked. To be honest, I learned this the hard way, seeing as lighting is important with regards to making a scene look overwhelmingly beautiful or realistic or tragically bad. I went back to the drawing board and developed my skills in Blender and in lighting. Over time, I learned exactly how to light scenes. This knowledge I now pass on to my students. You will learn all about Blender 2.8 lighting and lighting effects.\n\n\nRendering\nFinally, after all the preparations for making a realistic sci-fi scene, we will be rendering two stills in one of the best renderers in the industry – Eevee Render. Through this course, you will gain the knowledge to create great-looking scenes in Eevee rendering engine. We will also be setting up studio lighting to create a nice render for a portfolio piece. You will spend a lot of time on getting your emission nodes correct. We will be setting up cameras and I will be going through different techniques to help improve the quality of your renders.\n\n\nHappy modeling everyone!\nNeil, 3D Tudor",

We'll start off by reviewing the concept art and blocking out some base shapes, and from there jump into the wonderful world of UV unwrapping. Next, we'll be taking a look at the different stone, metal, and wood surface types we'll be painting, discuss and decide where we can save some texture resolution by sharing UV space, and then get moving on bringing the texture and visual look and feel of this low-poly cabin to life!\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nAn adopted son of San Francisco and the Academy of Art University, Ryan Ribot lives a small apartment with 3 cats and a Wacom. Currently working as a texture artist and character modeler with Telltale Games, Ryan spends most of his time painting and sculpting. Zbrush, Photoshop, and Maya are like breathing to him, and he is always looking to share his knowledge. Ryan has been teaching for several years, and is experienced as both an instructor and an industry professional.",

The animation possibilities are virtually infinite, and effectively complement traditional animation using keyframes or Mograph. You can even combine the three at the same time!\nDrape, fly and twist clothes in extraordinary abstract animations! Or use them to dress your characters with stunning realism.\nYou will model a dress entirely on a dancing cartoon character. The fabric follows the character's movements naturally and dynamically, for maximum realism. The entire workflow is covered, from dress modeling and finishing to testing and caching for easy playback.\nSoft bodies simulate anything plastic, rubbery or easily deformed. It makes for very smooth, fun animations and can be easily combined with rigid bodies.\nThis module is the ideal complement to the one devoted to Mograph, as it takes up certain elements and completes them.\n\n\nAs usual, all the videos are clearly named and organized so you can quickly access the one that interests you. Mini-projects complete the videos to help you put the skills you've learned into practice.\n\n\nPlease note that this tutorial is intended for Cinema 4D version 2024.2 and higher, which uses the new unified simulation system.\n\n\nAll source files are provided. I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have !\n\n\nEnjoy the tutorial!",

I developed the first version of this course in 2015 and I continually update and improve the content. In 2020, Version 2.0 covered the new Blender 2.8 UI, but the latest Blender 3.2 update meant it was time for another major overhaul. Version 3.0 has fully updated course material recorded in Blender 3.2 and 4.1, so you can follow along with ease.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\n· Blender basics, just enough to follow this course (fully documented with handbook)\n· Creating grass (Geometry nodes )\n· Creating trees (Geometry nodes )\n· Building a ruined landscape\n· Blending displaced materials\n· Creating a river scene\n. Creating a snow scene\n· Creating a procedural sky with clouds\n· Working with photo scanned structures\nAnd much more!\n\n\nWhat included in this course?\nAs always, I offer a course full of content, this time it’s bigger than ever. The course uses free content from the Polyhaven CC0 platform, which I started with Greg Zahl in 2018 to provide textures, models and HDRi’s for everyone to use. Simply go and pick the assets you like. A selection of 4K textures and models are included in the course, but feel free to download up to 16K from the Polyhaven platform.\n\n\nYou’ll also receive exclusive content you won’t find on Polyhaven:\n· Photo-scanned rocks, tree barks, wooden beams, plants, ruins and a castle\n· Photo references (landscapes, buildings, flowers)\n· 125 pages of documentation for the introductory chapter\n· All Blender scene files (Blender 3.2 + 4.1).\n\n\nChapter overview\n\n\nChapter 1: Course introduction\nA short introduction what you will learn in each chapter. Also, some explanation about workflow and organization, motivation and inspiration and course related questions.\nChapter 2: Blender basics\nThis chapter learns you the Blender fundamentals. If you are new to Blender, this chapter helps you on track with a quick introduction of the interface and viewport and some of the most used tools. We also build a simple table/chair scene and build a dice scene with geometry nodes. This chapter comes with 125 pages of documentation.\n\n\nChapter 3: Creating a grass scene\nIn this chapter we start with making grass strands. We pack the strands in Geometry nodes and build a simple but realistic grass scene with the geometry Nodes system. We use proxy models to speed up the viewport and add some variation by modeling some flowers. In the end of this chapter, we animate the grass so you can render the scene in motion.)\n\n\nChapter 4: Creating a forest path scene\nBig topic in chapter 4 is tree creation. We use photo-scanned barks in combination with generated branches. We add twigs on the branches with the geometry nodes and provide this with an animation. We upgrade the grass template by adding a path generator so you can simply adjust the scene by drawing a path. (\n\n\nChapter 5: Creating a ruined scene\nIn this chapter we use the grass template and trees from the previous chapter and spend most of the time on the ruin structure. We build an advance material node to blend a brick and plaster material. We also model some bricks and scatter these on the structure with Geometry nodes.\n\n\nChapter 6: Farmhouse river scene\nThis course comes with lots of scanned rocks, this chapter is the ultimate scene to blend all the rocks to make a river scene. First we shape the terrain so we have a river bed. Most of the lectures cover the creation of the farmhouse. , this is the main structure of the scene. In the end of the chapter we scatter the river with rocks and animate the river.\n\n\nChapter 7: Sunset castle scene\nThis time we use a photo-scanned castle and blend the structure with the terrain. We build a sky with volumetric clouds and use the Nishita skylight to blend the sky to create a sunset.\n\n\nChapter 8: Mountain ruin scene\nThis large landscape combines all the best from all chapters. We use the grass, trees and path to create a mountain path. We fill the scene with scanned ruin structures and blend the sky with distance mountains.onderful environmental scene. All content and textures come from Texture/HDRI Haven and are included in the course.\n\n\nChapter 9: Creating a frozen lake\nEmbark on the creation of a serene frozen river set within a dense forest. Master the art of blending materials to achieve a seamless transition between rocks and water. Add life to your scene with realistic trees, finishing with snow and mist effects for a breathtaking result.\n\n\nChapter 10: Creating a cabin in the snow\nEmbark with me on a personal journey through the realms of digital creation with my Blender 4.1 bonus chapter, crafted to guide you into the silent beauty of snow environments and the detailed charm of a medieval cabin, all nestled in a winter wonderland.\n\n\nAbout me\nMy name is Rob Tuytel and I have been a environment designer for the past 17 years. I have a huge passion for the Dutch 17th century and mainly focus on medieval architecture. I am Co-Founder of Polyhaven together with Greg Zahl. I love to study old environment paintings and use these as an inspiration for my work. You might know me from the Tears of Steel open Blender movie or from my previous environment course for Blender 2.81.",

This will be available for all student members, so join the course now before the price is increased to $69.\nThis is a basic introduction and overview of modelling complex 3D Freeform shapes in the context of architectural design.\nHave you ever wondered how certain architectural designs are actually created? You might assume that it is helped by software, but which system is suited for this? In regular CAD software that architects often use, such as AutoCAD or SketchUp, the creation of organic models and surfaces is hard to impossible.\nWe use Rhinoceros, a quite popular NURBS modelling software for McNeel. This is very popular within several innovative architectural offices where it is used for complex forms, organic architecture and extensive tweaking of 3D models. The software can also be used complementary to other architectural design software, although it is quite complete in itself.\nThe course starts with a basic introduction and overview of the software and then a few example projects are developed. They are inspired by famous and iconic architectural projects, but are not full reconstruction. We use the examples to inspire you and focus on a certain part of element which we will strip down to the basic geometric operations, giving you insight in how to approach more complex projects.\nYou don’t need any other software then Rhinoceros, on Windows or OSX, but be ready to try and fail, often. As many modelling tasks require a specific order of operations. We cannot prepare a solution for every possible task, but by building upon a few basic examples, you learn an approach which focuses on dividing the task at hand into smaller problems, that are easier to tackle. And these can then be applied in other situations.\nSo come join us and learn the basics of 3D Freeform Modelling with Rhinoceros.",

      "description": "Are you interested in breaking through content clutter and making your brand stand out from the crowd?\nAre you ready to learn how to create videos (with no design skills) that attract ongoing waves of traffic & generate massive leads?\nAre you interested in selling video services as a freelancer and generate a full-time income to quit your day job?\nIf you are, then we're excited to announce a FAST-PACED, HIGH-VALUE COURSE that'll help you accomplish these goals!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntroducing 'ANIMATED INFOGRAPHICS IN POWERPOINT': A Course Tested and Trusted By 1400+ Learners Globally!\nThis is a step-by-step course where we'll teach you how to create unique and professional animated infographics in a jiffy using a simple tool like Microsoft PowerPoint.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBut Wait, What Are Animated Infographics?\nAnimated infographics combine graphical elements like graphs & charts with motion & audio elements to bring boring data to life. In simple terms, they are the video equivalent of static infographics.\nSo, Why Should You Create Them?\nTo Grab Your Target Audience's Attention\nPeople are naturally drawn towards graphical elements which includes facts, stats, data and figures. Now, combine graphical elements with motion elements and you have a product which is compelling enough to grab eyeballs from the right audience.\nTo Increase Your Brand Awareness\nAnimated infographics are designed to include relevant information which also include your brand elements and contact details. They also help you showcase your brand, products, and services to people in a visual manner, which is far more superior than using text.\nTo Make Your Content Go Viral\nAccording to Buffer, visual content is more than 40x more likely to get shared on social media. Video infographics are really attractive that most people would want to share them through their social networks. This would result in the content going viral as more people 'like' and 'share' the content.\nTo Position Yourself As An Expert\nAnimated infographics make use of charts, graphs, and other relevant information. This signifies the amount of research and efforts the creator poured in to produce content that is useful and visually appealing. This will increase your online credibility as a brand and establish you as an expert.\nTo Create A Lucrative Income Source\nAccording to Adobe, 51.9% of marketing professionals worldwide named video as the type of content with the best ROI. As a result, many brands have dedicated marketing budgets for video content creation. You can grab a slice of this pie by offering your services and eventually generate a full-time income.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlright, But Why PowerPoint?\n\nIt's Readily Accessible\nYou probably have PowerPoint already on your computer. You might have even used it to create presentations and slideshows. Now, think of PowerPoint slides as images or video frames. You'll be able to see how this versatile tool could be useful for designing stunning visual content. You don't need any fancy software like Photoshop or Illustrator, PowerPoint can do the job for you!\nIt's Easy To Use\nIf you can type, drag, point-and-click, you can use PowerPoint to create amazing graphics and videos. It comes with a clean and uncluttered interface, which makes it one of the easiest \"design\" tools to navigate. In fact, you don’t need any design skills. You don’t need to be a PowerPoint expert either. We’ll teach you the exact techniques to follow to get the results you need.\nIt's Sleek and Powerful\nPowerPoint comes with powerful features for editing content. The ease with which you can insert & format images, add multiple layers, choose colors & fonts, change layout & designs in PowerPoint is unmatched. In fact, it is continuously evolving and getting sleeker with options to add audio, embed videos, add powerful animations & transitions, and export videos in full HD.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is the same system we've used to create animated infographics for Fortune 500 clients.\nRight from choosing color schemes & icons, adding various animation & transitions, to adding narration & exporting videos in high definition. We've got it all covered! This course is completely 'hands-on' with highly actionable steps - you can put into practice what have you learned immediately.\nNow, You've Got Two Options...\nYou could keep trying to figure all of this stuff out on your own (which often takes even the most hard-working and intelligent people months to do).\nOR...\nYou could use our proven techniques and guidance to get massive results immediately.\nYou can use the step-by-step process we teach in this course to help you achieve your brand-building and money-making goals faster than you thought was possible.\nWhat will you choose?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLet's Make It Easier For You to Decide...\nWe Teach 8000+ Learners Across 138 Countries\nOver 8000 learners across 138 countries have enrolled in at least one our courses to create visually-engaging content for their brands and clients. This course alone has been tested and trusted by over 1400 learners globally.\nEarn 3X - 25X With Your Very First Sale\nAccording to industry standards, businesses pays anywhere between $300 to $2500 to designers for creating a 60-second video infographic. However, your one-time investment for learning this skill is just $95. You do the math!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis Course Is NOT For You If...\n\nYou are just not interested in creating visual content for your brand. You do not value the importance of videos in today's marketing and think it's a total waste of time!\nYou are a \"get-rich-quick\" wannabe. You think that buying this course will suddenly help you earn millions without putting in the work!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRISK-FREE 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE!\nThis course combines our very best PowerPoint techniques into a fool-proof system that has worked for over 1,400 learners.

      "description": "Learn to design your own parts and machines with Autodesk Inventor. Whether it's for 3D printing, mechanical design or woodworking Inventor is the perfect software to design in 3D. Inventor is used all over the world by professionals to design everything from small models to airliners and spacecraft.\n\n\nThis course is aimed at beginners with no previous experience or little knowledge of Inventor who wants to learn to use the software properly and gain a sound understanding of basic modelling of parts and assemblies. I do not just skim over each subject but go in-depth to really give you an understanding of the foundations on which you can then build on in subsequent courses.\n\n\nAs a CAD user and instructor for over 23 years, I have developed a unique method to teach CAD software. A lot of books and courses out there spend the first parts describing every single command and instruction which can leave the student feeling bored and overwhelmed. It is no good learning what a command does if you don't understand why you need to do it.\n\n\nIn any CAD software, there are a few basic commands you use all the time and many that you don't need to know in order to get started. I believe in teaching these basic actions and getting the student creating drawings straight away. Using the type of drawings you may be asked to create or amend in a real working environment gives the student the confidence to then use what they have learned to create their own designs. More advanced techniques can then be taught as they progress which shows the student why they are being used in various situations.\n\n\nI have used this method successfully to teach many students whether they are learning for their own hobby use or for professional reasons and hope to teach you the same way.\n\n\n\n\n**Please Note: This course was recorded on the PC version of Inventor. If you use a MAC then the commands and locations may vary. I do not have a MAC so am unable to help with this but a quick Google search should help you.**",

This 'motion typography' makes your videos look more professional and engaging. While it seems complicated, creating your own kinetic typography videos in Adobe After Effects is quite simple when broken down into the basic animations that are actually happening.\nThat's what this course is all about - breaking down a complicated motion graphics video, and teaching you how to animate each type of text animation.\nWhat will you be able to do with this course?\n\nUse traditional cuts to introduce new words\nReveal text with scale and position animation\nRotate and flip text onto the screen\nRevolve text onto the screen (like they do in so many commercials!)\nImprove animations with motion blur, easy ease, and graph editing\nExport and upload your videos\nMuch more!\nIf you've ever wanted to jump right into creating kinetic typography videos, but didn't know how - this is the perfect course for you.\nHow does this course work?\n\nThis course is taught using Adobe After Effects. We used the latest Creative Cloud version of After Effects, but you can use any previous version (CS6 or earlier) because the process is the same. In this course, we dive right into creating kinetic typography in After Effects. While it will be easier to follow along if you have some experience with After Effects, it is not a requirement. If this course goes too quickly or seems too advanced for you, try enrolling in our full Kinetic Typography or Complete Adobe After Effects courses, which are for complete After Effects beginners.\nThroughout this course, you will be working on your own kinetic typography project. Each lesson breaks down one scene from the sample video, going over a new technique in revealing text (cut, scale, position, and rotation animations).\nWhat bonuses are included in this course?\n\nFollow along by using the downloadable After Effects project file. This way, you can follow along with everything we do in the course.\nWhy should you enroll?\n\nYou should enroll if you want to quickly learn the basic building blocks of creating advanced and intricate text animations. Phil, the instructor, is always available to help out - as if you were in a live course. So if you ever get stuck or need something explained, you will find an answer. By the way, Phil has taught over 100,000 students here on Udemy and really knows how to explain complex ideas - like motion typography - to beginners like you.\nWe can't wait to see you in the course!",

      "description": "Are you looking to learn how to design realistic interior renders in Blender? Are you struggling on getting your materials to look real? Architecture visualization is a huge part of the 3D community and when you are just starting out it can be hard to get right. In this course we will be creating a modern interior in Blender from start to finish. I will be showing you step by step on how to model the room, texture it, add in professionally made models and more.\nIn the first section we discuss the basics of interior design. We talk about color schemes and why certain colors go well together. In the next section we start creating the room by modeling it and getting the dimensions just right. We will also learn about the Archimesh addon and how to easily add in a window.\nAfter that, we move onto materials and models. You will learn how to model and texture a modern couch, use the cloth simulation to simulate the cushions and pillows, then we will be learning about the Asset Browser to import it into our scene!  In this course I am giving away 17 different professionally made models in which we use to fill up our interior.\nThe last section we focus on the camera and getting the right position and depth of field. We'll learn about rendering multiple camera angles at once, post processing and using the compositor! What about a night time version of the render? Yup, there is also a video on that.\nAs a bonus section we will also render the scene using Eevee! In this section you will learn all about how Eevee works, how to bake lighting and how to render an interior the right way using this render engine. This video requires Blender version 4.2+.\nIf you are looking to get into architecture visualization and rendering or you just want to improve your Blender skills over all, this course is for you! I have structured it so that beginners or advanced Blender users can follow along easily. To get started Click that enroll button and jump right in!\nYou are free to use the models provided in this course for personal or commercial use but you are NOT allowed to sell or give the models away.\nI look forward to seeing what you create!\nThanks\nStephen",
