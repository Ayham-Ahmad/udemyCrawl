It’s simply a new approach to cybersecurity to “never trust, always verify,” or to eliminate any and all trust, as opposed to the more common perimeter-based security approach that assumes user identities have not been compromised, all human actors are responsible and can be trusted. The concept of trusting anything internal to our networks is fundamentally flawed as evidenced by all the data breaches in the news, with most of the breaches caused by misuse of privileged credentials.",

      "description": "If you want to learn ethical hacking the fun and easy way like playing a computer game, then this course is for you. There exists on the Internet several websites which allows people to hack and learn hacking.  These websites typically have different levels from easy to advanced. By hacking each level and gradually levelling up, you will learn hacking.  Traditionally, ethical hacking is taught by installing virtual machines on your PC and hacking the virtual machines inside your PC. This way of learning hacking can be pretty boring as there are no challenges or rewards. Also it can be quite laggy unless you have a high end machine. In addition, some people find learning Linux and installing virtual machines too troublesome.\nIn this course, I will show you an alternative way, which is more fun and where you will enjoy the thrills of hacking real websites legally and solving each level and going from easy and gradually to more advanced levels - just like paying online games.  The website we will be hacking is HackThisSite!! which is a popular hacker's playground where hackers play hacking games reminiscent of CTF (Capture the Flag) and learn at the same time. However, without some help and guidance you will find it quite challenging. Hence this course. I will walk through each level from Basic to Realistic\nYou do not need to go through the hassle of installing virtual machines  or Linux on your computer. All you need is a PC. In this course I am only using a Windows PC to do hacking.\n\n\nGreat way to learn Web Development & Information Technology (IT):\nIf you had always wanted to learn HTML, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, etc, what better way than to learn how to hack. So, I invite you to learn to hack and in the process, you will also learn web development and IT. This is much more fun & exciting than learning it the traditional way - the boring way through formal IT courses and books. You will be killing 2 birds with one stone, i.e. learning how to hack and also learn IT.  So let's get started in your journey of hacking to learn.\n\n\nBug Bounty:\nLast, but not least, the site creators of HackThisSite encourage you to literally hack their site  to explore the security of their site and they will reward those who responsibly disclose their exploit with an entry into the HackThisSite hall of fame.\nThis course is backed by a 30-day money back guarantee.  So, go ahead and enroll in this course now and start hacking the fun and easy way!",

      "description": "Software Security is one of the most important aspects of Software Architecture these days.\nAlmost every day you hear about new security incidents which caused data leaks, disruption of service, and often - billions of dollar in damages. In fact - some companies even shut down because of that.\nYou, as as software architect, have the responsibility to make sure your architecture is as secure as possible.\nYou simply cannot allow yourself to release a system that is not secure. These days, it's simply unacceptable.\nAnd with microservices systems - the challenges are even bigger.\nSecuring microservices architecture is more difficult than regular, monolith systems. There are unique challenges with microservices that should be taken care of, and if you're designing such an architecture - you have to be well aware of them.\nNow, in order to design secure microservices architecture, you must be well versed in all security aspects of software design.\nAnd this is exactly what this course is for.\nThis course will teach you all you need to know, as an architect, regarding microservices security. When completing the course, you'll have the necessary knowledge to design secure microservices architecture.\nNow, I strongly believe that talking just about secure microservices architecture is not enough. In order to be a really great architect you must have a holistic view of all aspects of software security.\nAnd because of that, this course covers all the bases of software security.\nHere is a partial list of what we'll talk about in this course:\n- What is Security?\n- Threat Modeling\n- The Five Perimeters of software security\n- Some common attacks and how to defend from them\n- Authentication and Authorization\n- Encryption\n- Secure Communication\nAnd lots and lots more...\nIn addition, in this course we'll cover the basics of microservices architecture, so that you'll get a pretty good idea about this great architectural pattern, and also discuss the unique challenges of securing microservices architecture.\nIn this course you'll also learn the terminology of Software Security, and you'll encounter terms such as SQL Injection, MFA, MITM and more. Don't worry - we'll explain everything, and will make sure you fully understand these terms.\nIn fact, you don't have to have any prior knowledge of software security. We'll start from the very beginning.\nAfter completing this course you'll have everything you need in order to design a microservices architecture that is as secure as possible.\n\n\nBut that's not all...\nAt the end of this course, you'll be able to download the Secure Microservices Architecture Checklist, a comprehensive checklist that will guide you through the process of designing secure microservices systems, and provides a step-by-step guidance for each step.\nUsing this checklist will ensure your system is as secure as possible, will make your client happy, and, most important - will make you a better architect.\n\n\nThis course takes you from the absolute basics of Software Security to the most advanced topics, known only to a few. Completing this course will give you all the knowledge required for designing secure systems, and, as a bonus, will put you in a great position when looking for your next job.\nNo other course covers this topic in such a comprehensive and thorough way. I've put all my 20+ years of experience with hundreds of clients in this course, and I'm sure you will greatly benefit from it.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do my students have to say about my courses?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"well done - The course was very practical\" - Sam\n\"Absolutely what a software architect needs to know about Microservices architecture, great explanation!!\" - Saibal\n\"[The course] given me the confidence to go out to the market and advertise myself as such [an Architect]\" - Mathew\n\"Life Changing\" - Arivazhagan\nAnd lots more...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is this course for?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAny person who is involved in development, even system analysts, can profit from this course.\nThat includes:\n- Junior developers\n- Senior developers\n- Architects\n- Anyone who is interested in software security.\nIf you're not sure if this course is for you - drop me a note!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat are the prerequisites for this course?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIt's a good idea to have some basic knowledge about microservices architecture, but it's not a must.\nIn any case, you don't have to have any prior knowledge of software security!\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Me\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been in the software industry for more than 25 years, and a Software Architect for more than 20 years, working with a variety of clients - Fortune 100 enterprises, start-ups, govt. entities, defense, telco, banking, and lots more.\nI'm a certified Azure Solution Architect & Security Engineer.\nI'm also an avid speaker and trainer, having trained thousands of students in various courses.\nI love what I do, and my greatest passion (well, besides my family...) is designing modern, practical, and reliable systems for my clients, using the best possible architecture patterns.",

Understanding how to exploit servers, networks, and applications means that you will also be able to better prevent malicious exploitation. From website and network hacking, to pen testing in Python and Metasploit, Udemy has a course for you.\nOur Student says that: This is the best tech-related course I've taken and I have taken quite a few. Having limited networking experience and absolutely no experience with hacking or ethical hacking, I've learned, practiced, and understood how to perform hacks in just a few days.\n\nI was an absolute novice when it came to anything related to penetration testing and cybersecurity. After taking this course for over a month, I'm much more familiar and comfortable with the terms and techniques and plan to use them soon in bug bounties.\n\nFAQ regarding Ethical Hacking on Udemy:\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network. An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals.\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system. An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement. An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer. They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them. With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles.\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk. For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks. When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing on Udemy:\n\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched. Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack.\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results.\n\nSince free tools and platforms are used, you don’t need to buy any tool or application.\nYou will have the hands-on practices to find out and exploit the most common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery).\nBefore starting to learn how to “ethically” hack a website, you’ll learn how to set up a lab environment and install the needed virtual machines such as Kali Linux and OWASP Broken Web Applications. This will allow you to practice and hack “safely” without affecting your main systems.\nThen, you’ll learn the basic terms, standards, technologies and protocols of web applications: HTML, URL, HTTP etc.\nWhen you’re ready to start hacking, you’re going to start with information gathering. In addition, you will learn how to use search engines to find out if there are known-vulnerabilities in the website. While discovering the website, you’ll analyse the configurations to understand if they cause any vulnerability.\nThen, you’re going to learn the most important part of hacking web applications: how to manipulate input fields and the outputs produced by the application. You’ll see the most famous and dangerous vulnerabilities including SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in this section.\nYou will not only learn how to find out the vulnerabilities, but also learn how to exploit and hack those weaknesses. In addition, the methods to prevent hacking of these weaknesses will be taught.\nAfter that, you’re going to learn how to discover authorisation, authentication and session management flaws. You’ll learn how to find usernames and passwords using brute force attacks, how to fix a session, how to escalate a privilege, how to discover and exploit Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and more.\nIn this course, you will find the clean and pure information. When preparing the training, we especially avoided unnecessary talk and waiting; we have found these parts for you and gotten them out.\nWhen you finish the course, you’ll understand\n\nthe reasons of vulnerabilities,\nhow to find/discover the vulnerabilities,\nhow to exploit/hack them, and\nhow to prevent them\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\n\nEnroll now to become professional Ethical Hacker!\n\nSee you in the \"Hacking Web Applications & Penetration Testing: Web Hacking\" course!\nLearn Ethical Web Hacking, Bug Bounty, Web Penetration, Penetration Testing and prevent vulnerabilities with this course\n\n\nIMPORTANT: This course is created for educational purposes and all the information learned should be used when the attacker is authorized.",

It means there are a lot of jobs out there in this field, the need for fiber optic professionals is high. I am here to teach you the basics of fiber optics. A lot of this course is based off of the curriculum I teach at the University of Riverside that gives students a CFOT(Certified Fiber Optic Technician) Certificate from the FOA(Fiber Optics Association).\nThis course is intended for anyone who wants to learn the basics of fiber optics, maybe you are curious about the buzz around fiber optics, or maybe you are a systems administrator and IT manager that wants to gain knowledge of fiber optics. Whatever the case, this course is for you!",

Made up of a collection of hardware and software tools, these systems are the foundation of the telecommunications industry. While OSS and BSS serve different purposes in different areas of telecommunications, both systems help telecom organisations streamline day-to-day processes, boost productivity and overcome an array of industry challenges. Both systems are essential to the smooth operation of telecommunications networks, but they have different roles.\nBSS systems are responsible for managing the business aspects of a telecommunications company. This includes functions such as customer management, billing and invoicing, product management, and revenue management. BSS systems help telecommunications companies to manage their operations more efficiently, reducing costs and increasing revenue.\nOn the other hand, OSS systems are responsible for managing the technical aspects of a telecommunications network. This includes network monitoring and management, fault management, performance management, and provisioning. OSS systems help telecommunications companies to manage their networks more effectively, reducing downtime and improving the quality of service.\nBoth BSS and OSS systems are critical to the success of telecommunications companies. While BSS systems help companies to manage their business operations, OSS systems help companies to manage their technical operations. Both systems work together to ensure that telecommunications companies can provide high-quality services to their customers.\nOverall, BSS and OSS systems are critical components of modern telecommunications networks. They help companies to manage their operations more efficiently, reduce costs, and improve the quality of service. As telecommunications networks become more complex and the demand for high-quality services increases, BSS and OSS systems will continue to play a crucial role in the success of telecommunications companies.",

      "description": "Learn Network Automation with GNS3 and Ansible.\nDo you want to program networks using Ansible, but not sure where to start? Well, this course will show you how you can start programming Cisco networks within 30 minutes.\nThis course was created for network engineers. There are too many other Ansible courses out there that try to make network engineers server administrators. They concentrate on server administration, installation of software packages and other server admin tasks.\nThis course is different.\nThis course is practical. I won't talk about programming in abstract terms and make you wait before you can start automating networks. I will show you how you can quickly and easily start network programming by using GNS3, Cisco IOS and Ansible.\nYou will see demonstrations of the configuration of both Cisco routers and switches in GNS3. For example, how to configure multiple VLANs on a multiple switches, or how to configure OSPF on a router and more much more.\nLearn how you can use Ansible to troubleshoot networks! Use a single Ansible command to retrieve mac address table information from multiple switches in seconds. Then pipe the output to a regular expression to filter down to a single MAC address.You will never troubleshoot networks the same way again!\nThis course shows you practical examples of using Ansible to programmatically configure Cisco network devices rather then just talking about it.\nThe days of configuring Cisco networks only with the command line interface (CLI) are drawing to a close. You need to add network programmability using Ansible to your skill set.\nLearn how to automate networks using:\n- SSH\n- Ansible Network modules\n- Ansible Playbooks\n- Ansible ad hoc commands\nDon't reinvent the wheel. Use the tools available to you to quickly and easily automate your networks.\nHere are some comments about my automation courses:\n\"Knowing the material from just the first video would have saved me hours of work and rework in the past.\"\n\"It's the easiest, most fun, and most valuable course I've completed yet on Python Programming for Networking. Love it! Thanks again David!!!\" Darby Weaver\n\"Excellent course on Network Programming using Python with lot's of practical network configuration examples.\"\n\"Great way of explanation.Nice video and inspiring words! Thank you so much David. You are genius.\"\n\"I've been doing network automation for a while, even so, I've learned new things through this course. The instructor start from a basic example, adding improvements in each step. It's a skill that's worth it.\"\n\"A must for all network engineers who want to learn python!!! I had very \"very\" basic programming skills, and couldn't just get the bridge between network and programming (mainly Python - since that's where the hype is now), this course was amazing, I have never been glued to a training course since I can remember. The couple of things I loved the most about this course: 1- David's clear voice. 2- Real world application, not only will David interduce different real-world practical modules that you can import and use, but he shows you how to apply them on ios devices.\"\n\"Excellent course on Network Programming using Python with lot's of practical network configuration examples.

I lecture to my students about cyber threat intelligence sources and types, basic definition and terms like IOC, TTP, Cyber Kill Chain Model, Incident Response Steps. I critisize security devices capabilities for explaining why we need monitoring and SIEM infrastructure. In the second module I give you therotical knowledge about real attack techniques like SQL Injection, Buffer OverFlow Exploit Codes, SSH tunneling methods and more... I teach to my students how to collect full pcap traffic and which tools should be used for analysing. In module two I analysis tunnels, pivot points, web attacks, Remote Code Execution Exploits, Web Shells and Web attacks traffic from pcap files and I share my real world analysis experince with my students. In third module, First I present the fundamental windows processes and process injections, hollowing techniques and tools, pe injection and thread injection techniques and tools as theoritically. Then I teach you dumping memory samples for memory forensic and I analyze Stuxnet attack's memory image, Cridex, Zeus, Darkcomet Rat's Memory images and DLL injection event's memory image. In fourth module I perform therat hunting over ELK. First I explain the event id numbers which are used common for hunting and I analyze a real life scenerio. I detected malicious word documents, hta files, unsigned exe files, vbs files and more. I teach you how to detect and investigate tunneling methods, persistency methods like registeries, services, schedule tasks.

      "description": "Discover the secrets of successful ISO 27001 implementation without breaking the bank! Our comprehensive course is designed to demystify the process and empower you to establish an effective ISMS effortlessly. No need to be an expert - we guide you step-by-step, ensuring you have the knowledge to succeed. Don't worry if you're new to ISO 27001; our recommended ISO 27001 Foundation course provides a solid introduction. Safeguard your organization's sensitive information, protect valuable assets, and gain the trust of stakeholders. Say goodbye to scattered controls and hello to a cohesive security strategy. Join us now and unlock the true potential of ISO 27001 for your organization's security success!\n\nISO/IEC 27001 is widely known standard, providing requirements for an information security management system (ISMS), though there are more than a dozen standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family. Using them enables organizations of any kind to manage the security of assets such as financial information, intellectual property, employee details or information entrusted by third parties.\nMost organizations have a number of information security controls. However, without an information security management system (ISMS), controls tend to be somewhat disorganized and disjointed, having been implemented often as point solutions to specific situations or simply as a matter of convention. Security controls in operation typically address certain aspects of information technology (IT) or data security specifically; leaving non-IT information assets (such as paperwork and proprietary knowledge) less protected on the whole. Moreover, business continuity planning and physical security may be managed quite independently of IT or information security while Human Resources practices may make little reference to the need to define and assign information security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization.",

      "description": "Hey there! Mike Meyers, your favorite nerd, here to present a fun, casual, and informative conversation on cryptography. I partnered with my good friend, Bill Saichek, to talk about one of my very favorite topics: cryptography. I've loved the idea of cryptic codes, secret agents, and deciphering hidden text since I was a kid. And because I've had so many questions on this topic, I decided to try a different kind of course to help my students understand the more complex concepts in cryptography.\nThis Conversation on Cryptography course was designed with YOU in mind, whether you're just curious about cryptography (like me), or you took my CompTIA Security+ (SY0-501): The Total Course (or any other cyber security course) and would like a better understanding of this intriguing subject. Here's a rundown of what Bill and I talk about:\nCaesar and Vigenere ciphers - These fascinating ciphers form part of the basic foundation of cryptography, back before the digital age when militaries, powerful leaders, and spies had to pass messages that couldn't be deciphered if they fell into enemy hands.\n\n\nBinary - In order for ciphers to be useful today, cryptographers had to figure out how to translate them into the language of computers (1s and 0s).\n\n\nHashing - If all our digital data are just strings of 1s and 0s, how can we make sure we have the real deal? Learn about authentication in this episode.\n\n\nAsymmetric cryptography - We discuss how generating a key pair offers more security, though at the price of taking more time.\n\n\nSymmetric cryptography - This quick and dirty cryptosystem uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt.\n\n\nAsymmetric methods - Dig into how these methods actually work, and how prime numbers are keeping your data safe. Did we\nmention we play with paint in this episode?\n\n\nCertificates - The Web is full of hackers who want to take advantage of your personal and private information. So, who do we trust? That's where certificates come in.\n\n\nPublic key infrastructure - How do we pass out those certificates? And assure the authenticity of them? PKI to the rescue!\n\n\nLiving with certificates - We get our hands on some of those certificates and teach you how to troubleshoot them when something goes wrong.\nSo sit down, grab a cup of coffee, and join Bill & I for a conversation on cryptography.",

      "description": "Hack The Box has quickly surged to become the premiere place for flexing your hacking talent, learning new skills and preparing for penetration testing exams such as the OSCP.\nIn this course you will quickly set up a hacking environment in VMWare Workstation and then immediately nose-dive into compromising hacking boxes ranked as easy and medium.\nThe chief benefit to you in taking this course is that it will greatly enhance your ability to perform well on the exam. I will not only thoughtfully, and carefully, show you how to takeover Windows and Linux boxes, but I will also give you a behind-the-curtain peek into my thought process so you'll know why I'm doing what I'm doing and why it makes sense.\nYou’ll also see how I setup my system. I’ll take on you on a tour of my lab so you can replicate everything at home.\nI created this course as a means of helping me pass the exam.  I currently don't have the OSCP cert.  I've taken the training material and took the 24 hour exam but failed it.  BUT! Instead of letting that get me down, I decided to create an online course as a means of helping me master the concepts I encountered in my training and on the exam.\nWe are about to have a lot of fun and I can hardly wait to come along side you on your journey to earning your OSCP. Are you ready to have fun studying for this thing?\nGet prepared to go on a ride. You’re about to learn a lot and many of the tactics and techniques we leverage align with real world scenarios.\nAll attacks and techniques are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.\nSo here's the thing:\nIf you're a software engineering dreaming about how to pwn boxes then this course is for you.\nIf you're the curious type who wonders what could have been done differently after rooting a box or if you want to know WHY exploits fail... then this course is for you.\nIf you want to stop feeling like an imposter who acts like you know what you're talking about and want to finally feel the confidence, pleasure and peace that comes from REALLY knowing what you're talking about.. then this.... course.... is for you.\nLet's go!  You got this baby!\nCourses were being added every two months.\nLast lecture named \"Union\" was added Feb 1st 2022",

      "description": "Last Updated: March 2021\nThis course is all about working in a security operations center (SOC). It is designed to produce SOC analysts with excellent understanding of cyber security essentials, technology solutions, security operations, and incident response. Upon completion, learners will be capable of hitting the ground running from day 1 on the job. Additionally, learners will gain an excellent understanding of common tools, people and operational processes and procedures that make a value delivering SOC function effectively. The door to the SOC is ever revolving therefore SOC analysts will always be in high demand. This training is guaranteed to equip learners with everything required to work as an entry level SOC analyst who will be capable of giving intermediate analysts a run for their money.\nThe SOC has become one of the most important cyber defense capabilities in enterprise environment today. A key tenet of cyber security is prevention is ideal, but detection is a must, which means that where you're not able to prevent an adversary from breaching your defensive layers, detecting their presence in your environment in a timely manner is crucial. It is for this reason that organizations are constantly in the hunt for SOC analysts. As of March 2021, there were approximately 2,500 vacant SOC analyst job positions across the United States (source: LinkedIn), which is a clear indication that those with the requisite skill set will always  be in a job.\nThis course covers technology solutions and their respective vendors across multiple cyber defense domains, therefore learners are going to gain an excellent understanding of security products that are typically leveraged in enterprise environments, such that they are able to have meaningful conversations with potential employers.\nBy the time students get to the security operations and incident response section of the course, they would appreciate why it was important to build the necessary foundational knowledge of security technologies. This is because the main tool used in the SOC (i.e. the SIEM) relies on all these other security technologies to deliver value. As a SOC analyst, you want your SIEM tool to give you that much needed situational awareness of security events that are unfolding on the network, therefore, you need the various sources of security events to push logs to your SIEM tool for analysis, correlation and alerting.\nThe course is packed with a lot of relevant and realistic information and scenarios, so be rest assured that you're going to get the full value for your money!",

      "description": "NOTE: This is independent from Hands-on Penetration Testing Labs 1.0 and 2.0. All three are standalone courses and can be taken in any order, or on their own.\nHello students, and welcome to my Hands-on Penetration Testing Labs 3.0 course. If you're familiar with my previous courses, this is part three of the series.\nWe're going to be diving straight into hands-on technical labs with little focus on theory, as in my opinion this is the best way to prepare for the actual job and for hands-on practical certifications such as OSCP. There's no better way as a penetration tester to gain the raw skills that are needed on the job than to actually use and master the necessary technology and skills.\nI should mention right now that this course requires a reliable Internet connection, and a decent laptop or PC which can support at least two virtual machines. I suggest that you have at least 8 GB of RAM, but the more the better, especially if you want to make an advanced virtual lab in which to practice and hone your pentesting skills. Ideally, you should have 16 GB or 32 GB of RAM and a decent processor, but you can get away with less.\nDuring our course work we'll be using Virtual Box as a software hypervisor in order to spin up Kali Linux, which is an industry standard penetration testing operating system. We'll also be setting up several intentionally vulnerable VMs to demonstrate vulnerabilities within a variety of network services and web applications, walking through various tactics, techniques, and procedures to simulate adversarial activity. I'll be providing all of the necessary software, which is completely free and open source.\nWe'll be covering enumeration, vulnerability scanning, and automated and manual exploitation. More specifically, we'll be going over key essential pentesting skills such as port scanning and service enumeration, local file inclusion, web directory brute forcing, buffer overflows exploit development, SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting, various types of reverse shells, a variety of local privilege escalation, and much more.\nAll of the technology which is utilized within these recordings is current as of June 2019. Technology is constantly changing, so some of the software seen in these videos may be different when you take the course. However, it should be similar enough for you to figure out with quick Google searches, or with my assistance if needed. You can always reach out to me via the messaging or Q&A system, although I highly encourage you to perform troubleshooting on your own, as the ability to research and troubleshoot is one of the single most important skill sets as a penetration tester and IT professional in general.\nI'm looking forward to working with all of you, and hope you enjoy my course. Please leave a review if you enjoy my course, as it allows me to reach more and more dedicated students and existing or aspiring cyber security professionals.",

The incident response methodology aims to identify, contain, and minimize the cost of a cyberattack or a live incident. A well-built incident response (IR) plan can fix a potential vulnerability to prevent future attacks, but it is not the sum game. Response is a part of Incident Handling which in turn looks at the logistics, communications, synchronicity, and planning required to resolve an incident.",

      "description": "If you've struggled setting up Kafka Security, or can't make sense of the documentation, this course is for you\nFirst of all, an insecure cluster is a big problem:\nanyone can read / write to any topic, and this can lead to bad data or data leak\nyou don't know who is connected to your cluster\ndata isn't encrypted in flight and could be intercepted by hackers\nIn this course, you'll learn Kafka Security, with Encryption (SSL), Authentication (SSL & SASL), and Authorization (ACL).\n\nOver 1800 students and 160 reviews later, we're convinced this course can save you a lot of time.\n----------------------------\n\nKafka Security is important for the following reasons:\nEncryption (SSL) for Apache Kafka\n> Ensure data is securely transported from machine to machine\n> Prevent MIDM (man-in-the-middle attacks) on your Kafka Cluster\n> No more PLAINTEXT data going around in your network\nAuthentication (SSL & SASL) for Apache Kafka\n> Ensure only clients with credentials can access your clusters\n> Give each of your clients a user-id, therefore enabling the possibility of controlling their access using ACL\nAuthorization (ACL) for Apache Kafka\n> Ensure the clients can only read / write topics based on administrator rules\n> Ensure clients cannot create / delete topics\n> Provide the audit team the guarantee that the cluster is secure\n\n\nHands On & Theory Based Course\nNote: This course only deals with SSL for encryption & Authentication and SASL Kerberos, not other mechanisms. It also does provide an overview to enable security in a multi-broker setup, but that last part is left for the student to investigate and practice.\nThis course is the first and only available Kafka Security Course on the web. Get it now to become an Apache Kafka expert!\nSection outline:\nCourse Introduction: Let's learn why we need Security in Apache Kafka\nKafka Setup: Quickly setup Kafka in AWS EC2 and test it, as a pre-requisite to setting up security on it\nSSL Encryption in Kafka: Setup a Certificate Authority and create certificates for your Kafka broker and Kafka client\nSSL Authentication in Kafka: Learn how to force clients to authenticate using SSL to connect to your Kafka Cluster\nSASL Authentication - Kerberos GSSAPI in Kafka: Setup Kerberos on an EC2 machine and create credentials for Kafka and Clients.\nAuthorization in Kafka: Learn how to enforce ACLs in Kafka and use the CLI to authorize clients.\nZookeeper Security: Learn how to secure Zookeeper using Kerberos\n\n\n===============================\nInstructor\nMy name is Stephane Maarek, and I'll be your instructor in this course. I teach about Apache Kafka, the Kafka ecosystem and Kafka Certifications with my focus always on helping my students improve their professional proficiencies. I am also the co-founder of Conduktor: an enterprise Apache Kafka platform & UI to help everyone use Kafka.\nThroughout my career in designing and delivering these certifications and courses, I have already taught 1,000,000+ students and gotten 350,000+ reviews!\nGerd Koenig is one of the instructors of this course. He is an Apache Kafka Expert, and has done countless of production deployments and security setup at many of his clients. He will be taking the leads on all the Hands-On Lecture.\nWith Apache Kafka becoming much more than a buzzword out there, I've decided it's time for students to properly learn how to be a Kafka professional. So, let’s kick start the course! You are in good hands!\n===============================\nThis Course Also Comes With:\nLifetime Access to All Future Updates\nA responsive instructor in the Q&A Section\nLinks to interesting articles, and lots of good code to base your next applications onto\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nThis is the course that could improve your career!\nApache Kafka is a skill in high demand and there are not enough people to fulfill all the open positions.

      "description": "BGP Configuration is always a big task to do. This Course has made it very easy for students to understand the BGP Concepts. It has many labs which will eventually make you comfortable working with BGP.\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) is considered a “Path Vector” routing protocol. It is an exterior gateway protocol (EGP) that is used to exchange routing information among routers in different autonomous systems. It is the only protocol which enables Internet to function. So it is very robust and scalable routing Protocol.\nOnce BGP peers form a neighbor relationship, they share their full routing table. Afterwards, only changes to the routing table are forwarded to peers.\nBGP metric is BGP attributes. It has 3 tables, neighbor table, BGP table and Routing table. The AD (Administrative Distance) for eBGP routes is 20, iBGP is 200. It uses TCP-179. It's Peers use incremental and triggered updates(5 sec interval for IBGP and 30 sec interval for EBGP). It uses AS numbers to keep track of different administrative domains. 1-64511 are public, 64512-65535 are private autonomous numbers.\nThis course has many Labs which will make you very strong and comfortable in Implementing this protocol in your organization or at your home lab. You will get expertise on Attributes of BGP such as Weight, Local Preference, AS Path, MED , ORGIN and Communities. Since It runs the Internet, so we need a protocol which gives flexibility, that is why BGP is used. Only drawback is that It is extremely slow to converge.\nMany more things like Route Reflectors, Confederation are also covered so that you get complete information about this BGP.\nHere is the list of topics covered in it\n1. Simple BGP Configuration\n2. BGP with Non-Connected Neighbors\n3. IBGP Vs EBGP\n4. How to Read BGP Table\n5. Advertising Subnet in BGP\n6. Auto Summary in BGP\n7. BGP Neighbor Adjacency States\n8. BGP Messages\n9. Troubleshooting BGP Neighborship\n10. Troubleshooting BGP Network Advertisement\n11. Weight Attribute\n12. Local Preference\n13. AS Prepend\n14.Origin Code\n15. MED (Multi Exit Descriminator)\n16. BGP Communities\n17. No-Advertise Community\n18. No-Export Community\n19. BGP prevent Transit AS using Filter List\n20.

      "description": "If you are working in the IT industry or hope to get your first job soon then you simply must understand IPv6 internetworking. IPv4 is currently being phased out and many companies are no longer using it in fact. Over 25% of traffic on the internet is using IPv6.\nMany people avoid learning IPv6 because they think it's hard to understand but nothing could be further from the truth. IPv6 addressing is far easier to learn than IPv4 and (unlike IPv4) can be mastered by beginners in just a few hours.\nOur IPv6 Internetworking Masterclass takes you from complete beginner to advanced level so you can ace technical interviews and configure and troubleshoot IPv6 networks with ease. Feel free to take the optional hands-on labs if you want to deepen your understanding or come back to them later.\nEvery subject is accompanied with a quiz to check your understanding. As your confidence grows you can progress to harder subjects until you are finally ready to take on the super hard advanced lab where we combine all the technologies you have learned so far.\nYour course has been created by a highly respected network consultant who plans, installs and troubleshoots complex IPv6 networks on a daily basis. He breaks down each subject into easy-to-understand chunks so you can easily digest the subjects and apply them in your day-to-day role.\nYou will learn:\nIPv6 address types\nSubnetting IPv6 addresses\nConfigure and troubleshoot IPV6 for BGP, OSPF, EIGRP\nConfigure IPv4 to IPv6 transitions\nUsing DHCP and DNS with IPv6\nIPv6 network security\nand much more\n\n\nFeel free to take just the beginner course if you want to prepare for helpdesk or junior networking roles or progress onto intermediate and advanced modules if you work in network support or consulting roles or want to prepare for advanced IT exams such as Cisco CCNP.",

There are some bonus examples that you can use to practice, and you're more than welcome to post your questions, ideas or struggles in the Q&A section.\nAll of the code is thoroughly explained, so you don't need much prior Java knowledge, but basic understanding of programming in general is a plus.\nGenerally, network applications differ from non-network applications in their distributed nature, reliance on network protocols, client-server architecture, handling of network-related challenges, and utilization of web-based technologies. The networking aspect of these applications opens up opportunities for collaboration, remote access, and resource sharing, making them essential in today's interconnected world - which is why we'll learn about them in this course!\n\n\nAll feedback is welcome, so I encourage you to suggest ways to improve this course, but also criticize where needed. :) Hope you find it useful & learn something important here!",

Vulnerability management is a key aspect of cyber security that isn't going away anytime soon. As long as software exists, there will be vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to hack into organizations. Vulnerability management is a great field for those new to cyber security. The technical knowledge required for Vulnerability management is not as complex as other Blue team and Red team positions like Incident Response and Penetration Testing. However the skills that you will learn as a vulnerability management analyst, will benefit you regardless of which path you decide to go down.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn about the process that helps organizations identify, assess, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities in their systems and applications. This process helps minimize the risk of cyber attacks, data breaches, and other security incidents that can result from exploitation of vulnerabilities. By continuously monitoring and addressing vulnerabilities, organizations can maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data and systems, and demonstrate compliance with industry standards and regulations.\n\n\nGain hands on experience with top industry tools that will boost your resume and make a great talking point in your future interviews.",

The course is structured in a way that will take you through the basics of networking and how clients communicate with each other, then we will start talking about how we can exploit this method of communication to carry out a number of powerful attacks.\nThis course is focuses on the practical side of wireless penetration testing without neglecting the theory behind each attack, all the attacks explained in this course are launched against real devices in my lap.\nThe Course is Divided into four main sections:\nNetworks Basics: in this section you will learn how networks work, how devices communicate with each other and how the information is transferred in a wireless networks. You will also learn about basic terminology, what is a channel ? What is MAC address and how to change it ?\nInformation Gathering: In this section you will learn how to map the current network, ie: discover all the connected devices (clients), not only that but you will also learn how to gather important information about these clients, such as their MAC address, their IP, Operating system, open ports, programs that are using these ports and maybe even the exact version of the program.\nMITM Attacks: in this section you will learn a number of very powerful attacks that you can launch against the network and the connected clients, these attacks will allow you to gain access to any account accessed by any client connected to your network, read all the traffic used by these clients (images , videos , audio passwords, cookies, urls ...etc), and gain full access to any client in your network.\nProtection: In this section you will learn how to detect these attacks and protect yourself and your network against them.\nAll the attacks in this course are practical attacks that work against any device connected to our network, ie: it does not matter if the device is a phone , tablet laptop ...etc. Each attack is explained in a simple way first so that you understand how it actually works, so first you will learn the theory behind each attack and then you will learn how to carry out the attack using Kali Linux.\nNOTE: This course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih and No other organization is associated for certification exam for the same. Although, you will receive Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that No OTHER ORGANIZATION IS INVOLVED.",

Our focus is on the enterprise facility, which can be in a dedicated stand-alone structure or in a space within an office building, hospital, airport, sports stadium, or university campus, to name a few examples.\nA data center serves as the central repository of an organization’s intellectual property. It requires state-of-the-art security, fire suppression, environmental controls, power distribution, network equipment, and tools for continuous monitoring and maintenance.\nThe network cabling system is a critical component of reliable communications within the data center and with sites and networks outside the data center.\nThis is an introductory course, intended to give you a detailed overview of standards-based guidelines and recommendations for data center infrastructure design.\nWe know that your time is valuable. Our objective is to provide you with the maximum amount of information in a minimum amount of time, so we have tightly scripted each of the lectures. We hope you find the contents useful and interesting.\nCory and Steve",

Our professional work, our personal lives—even our vehicles—depend on connectivity and technology that runs on complex software.\nToday in the Automotive autonomous driving, connected cars, electric vehicles, and shared mobility—have dominated the agenda of automotive industry leaders in recent years. These innovations, built on the digitization of in-car systems, the extension of car IT systems into the back end, and the propagation of software, turn modern cars into information clearinghouses while also making them tempting targets for cyberattacks,\nLets have a short look about interesting information of last 4 years\nThe frequency of cyberattacks on cars increased 225 percent from 2018 to 2021\nNearly 85% of attacks in 2021 were carried out remotely, outnumbering physical attacks four to one.\n40% of attacks targeted back-end servers.\n2021 saw 54.1% of attacks carried out by Malicious actors, up from 49.3% in 2020\nThe top attack categories were data/privacy breach (38%), car theft/break-ins (27%), and control systems (20%).\nKeyless entry and key fob attacks account for 50% of all vehicle thefts. Thieves only need to be close to the key fob for a Black Hat hacker to pick up and reproduce its signal.\nIn very few years Cybersecurity will raise as a mandatory element in Automotive and this course will be helpful understanding the overall view about Cyber security concepts.",

In this course I share my knowledge about KEY and MOST IMPORTANT features of the Computer Networks. No obsolete info!\nAlso I've taught hundreds of students in person in classes because during 7 years I was working as Cisco Certified Systems Instructor (CCSI).\nThis course is all about Computer Networking and Internet.\nUnderstand HOW Computer Networks work and learn key Networking Protocols\nEthernet, IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, NAT, DHCP, DNS, private and public IP addresses, subnetting\nIf those terms are new to you - jump in and you will learn all about them with help of multiple easy-to-grasp diagrams and using multiple practice activities. Most practice activities require just your computer and program called Wireshark.\nIt helps to perform analysis of different protocols and TCP/IP layers headers.\n\n\nBecome a master of Computer Networking!\nIf you prepare for the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) exam, this course is a perfect start for you!\nThis is the most complete Computer Networking Guide here on Udemy that includes tons of practical activities.  You could have zero knowledge about Computer Networking. All will be taught from scratch, from basic to advanced features. If you want to get deep knowledge of Computer Networking this course is for you!\n\n\nWe will start by taking about TCP/IP and OSI models. This knowledge is required in order to understand how different hosts communicate with each other and that all communication processes are strictly defined. This is like languages that people need to use to be able to understand each other.\nNext starting from the Physical layer (bits and bytes) we will move to Data Link layer (Ethernet, MAC addressing and Switching). Next layer will be Network (Routing, IPv4, IPv6, subnetting, network masks, IP addressing, ARP, ICMP). On Transport layer we will discuss in details TCP and UDP protocols and their purpose. On Application layer I will tell you about such important protocols as DHCP and DNS that your computers and mobile phones use very often. Also I will tell you difference between private and public IP addresses and purpose of the NAT.\nYou will also learn how DNS(core of the hierarchical naming structure in the Internet) works and how resolution of each domain name to the IP address happens by involving DNS root nameservers, TLD nameservers and authoritative nameservers.\nAlso it's important to know how routers in the Internet build their routing tables and make routing decisions.

      "description": "Information security incidents have become a common occurrence in today's landscape, where every organization, regardless of its size or dependence on IT&C, can be the victim of an attack.\nSecurity controls and policies alone cannot guarantee a total protection of information, networks, systems or services, because  there will always be residual vulnerabilities that may be exploited by threats, leading to information security incidents. Furthermore, it is inevitable that new instances of previously unidentified threats cause incidents to occur.\nThe consequences of an information security incident can go from minor disturbances to the regular operations, up to the collapse of the entire organization. The insufficient preparation to deal with incidents will make the response of the organization less effective and will increase the degree of potential adverse business consequences.\nTherefore, it is mandatory for each company to design and to implement a robust information security programme, with a key part of that programme dedicated to the handling of incidents.\nThis course presents the guidelines for managing information security incidents provided by ISO/IEC 27035.\nThis international standard proposes a process that includes 5 phases:\n- plan and prepare where plans and policies are developed, training and awareness are provided, the necessary resources are identified and made available, forms are established and organizational structures, such as the incident management team and the incident response team are set up;\n- detect and report, where information security events are identified, reported;\n- assess and decide, where incidents are categorized based on their impact on the organization and analyzed to determine the most suitable solutions for the response;\n- respond, where the incident is contained first, then eradicated and in the end the systems and services affected by the incident are recovered; and\n- learn lessons, where the organization uses the information collected while handling incidents to improve its process, its security controls and organizational processes.\nA section of the course is dedicated to each of the five steps of the incident management process and along the way there are examples and case studies to make your learning journey more useful and pleasant.\nBy participating in this course you will understand the concepts and tools of incident management; you will learn about how to categorize and analyze information security incidents; you will improve your skills in the information security management field and you can confidently apply for a certification as incident manager.\nYou can use the information in this course to design or to improve your company's processes for managing information security incidents. You can use the course as support for your consulting services or for auditing purposes. Or, you can use this course as a method to advance your career in information security management.",

      "description": "Last Update: May 2024\n\n\nWelcome to this comprehensive course on Network Hacking! In this course, you will start as a beginner with no previous knowledge about penetration testing or hacking and by the end of it you'll be at an intermediate level being able to hack into networks and connected devices like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts.\nThis course is focused on the practical side of penetration testing without neglecting the theory. Before jumping into hacking you will first learn how to set up a lab and install needed software (works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux), then the course is structured in a way that will take you through the basics of linux, computer systems, networks and how devices communicate with each other, then you will learn how to exploit this method of communication to carry out a number of powerful attacks.\n\n\nThe Course is Divided into three main sections:\nPre-connection attacks: In this section you will learn how networks work, how devices communicate with each other and how the information is transferred in a wireless networks. You will also learn some basic terminology, what is a channel ? MAC address ? what is managed mode ? What is monitor mode  and how to enable it ? what is sniffing and what is it limited to ? so in this section we still don't know much about penetration testing , all we have is a computer and a wireless card connected to it, you will learn how to start gathering information using your wi-fi card (packet sniffing) and you will learn  how to control connections around you (ie: deny/allow devices from connecting to networks) without knowing the password of the target network.\nGaining Access: Now that you gathered information about the networks around you, in this section you will learn a number of methods to crack the key and get the password to your target network whether it uses WEP, WPA or even WPA2.\nPost Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this section you will learn a number of powerful techniques that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, see anything they do on the internet (such as login information, passwords, visited urls, images, videos, etc.), redirect requests, inject evil code in loaded pages and even gain full control over connected clients! All the attacks here work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to create a fake WiFi network, attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.\n\n\nAll the attacks in this course are practical attacks that work against any wireless enabled device , ie: it does not matter if the device is a phone , tablet laptop, etc. These attacks also work against all operating systems (Windows, OSX, Linux IOS, Android, ect.).  in each technique you will understand the theory behind it and how it works, then you'll learn how to use that technique in a real life scenario, so by the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques or combine them to come up with more powerful attacks and adopt them to different scenarios and different operating systems.\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis course is created for educational purposes only and all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against devices that I have permission to test\nThis course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih & zSecurity, no other organization is associated for certification exam for the same. Although, you will receive Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that No OTHER ORGANIZATION IS INVOLVED",

      "description": "Last Update: June 2024\n\n\nNote: Although social engineering is covered in one of my other courses, that course only covers the basics where this course dives much deeper in this topic covering more techniques, how to hack more operating systems, advanced exploitation, advanced post exploitation, bypassing security and more!\n\n\nWelcome to this comprehensive course on Social Engineering! This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in hacking, it starts with you from scratch and takes you step-by-step to an advanced level. By the end of it you'll be able to hack all major operating systems (windows, Apple Mac OS, Linux and Android) like black-hat hackers and secure yourself from hackers.\n\n\nThis course is highly practical but doesn't neglect the theory, we'll start with basics to teach you how to install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Apple Mac OS). Then we'll start hacking straight away, you'll learn everything by example, no boring lectures! You will understand the theory behind every attack first and then you'll learn how to use that attack in a practical real life scenario to hack Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS and Android. So by the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques or combine them to come up with more powerful attacks and adopt them to different scenarios and different operating systems.\n\n\nThe course is divided into a number of sections to represent the steps you'd take to successfully hack a target using social engineering.\n1. Information Gathering - First you need to know your target, in this section you'll learn how to gather information about your target whether it is a company, a website or just a person. You will learn how to discover anything that is associated with your target such as websites, links, companies, users, emails, phone numbers, friends, social networks accounts, etc. You will also learn how to plot all of this information on a graph and use it to build smart attack strategies.\n\n\n2. Generating Malware  - Now that you gathered enough information about your target and came up with an attack strategy, the next step is to create custom malware that is attractive to the target. This section will teach you how to create backdoors, keyloggers, credential harvesters and more, these files will work on all operating systems (Windows, Apple Mac OS, Linux and Android). You'll also learn how to enhance these files to make them bypass all anti-virus programs, and make them look and function just like any other file such as an image or a pdf,  or even embed them in legitimate Microsoft Office documents.\n\n\n3. Delivery Methods - Now that you have your custom-made trojan ready, in this section you will learn a number of social engineering techniques to deliver it to the target, you will learn how to create fake websites that look identical to websites the target trusts, send emails that appear like they're send from trusted sources and use fake login pages and fake updates to hack the target. You'll also learn advanced social engineering techniques to lure the target to visit your malicious website without even interacting with them.\n\n\n4. Post Exploitation - In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised whether they use Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS or even Android. You’ll learn how to access the file system (read/write/upload/execute), maintain your access, escalate your privileges, spy on the target, use the target computer as a pivot to hack other computers and more! If your target uses Android then you'll also learn how to read their messages, find their location, access their other accounts (such as Whatsapp, Facebook, etc.) and more!\n\n\nFinally at the end of the course you will learn how to protect yourself and your systems from these attacks.\n\n\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\nCheckout the curriculum and the course teaser for more info!\n\n\nNotes:\nThis course is created for educational purposes only and all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against devices that I have permission to test.\nThis course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih & zSecurity, no other organization is associated with it or a certification exam. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that NO OTHER ORGANIZATION IS INVOLVED.",

      "description": "We are entering an era in software engineering where we rely on libraries and frameworks to do most of our work. While this is useful and save tremendous dev hours, it creates leaky abstractions that manifest in form of performance degradation, unexpected errors, 100% CPU , network and disk usage, hangs, latency and many other. It becomes difficult to articulate what goes wrong on the backend and how to fix it when engineers don't understand the basic building block of what they are interacting with.\n\n\nNetwork communication is one of the most critical pieces in backend engineering. And the TCP/IP Internet suite is the basic fundemntal building block of communications that link the frontend to the backend. Any protocol we use eventually gets encapsulated into either a TCP segment or UDP datagram. That packet is wrapped in an IP packet which is placed into a frame and then sent across the network. These layers are important to understand for backend engineers in order to optimize the stack, minimize latency, and increase throughput. What matters  is the true understanding of these pieces and not just memorizing definitions and packet headers to pass an exam. If an engineer truly understood what is happening when their backend API receives an HTTP POST request for example, they will be astonished at how much is happening behind the scenes. They would completely change the way they approach backend API designs, they will try to select the best protocol for the job, and they will tune that protocol to its maximum potential. They will start asking questions about frameworks and libraries that nobody else does. It is those questions that will make them fully utilize those framework to their maximum potential.\n\n\nThis course is primarily designed for backend engineers who built applications, services or APIs and want to take their skillset to the next level. If you are a frontend engineer who are interested in the backend and have attempted to build backend apps before this course is also for you. If you are a network engineer who already know the basic fundamentals and want to start building backend applications effectively this course might help you bridge the gap\n\n\nThis course is not designed for those who want to pass network certification tests (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE etc..)",

      "description": "This is Master Class  course on TCP/IP protocol - Transmission Control Protocol. Since it is Master Class course, this course discusses the internal design and functioning of complex transport layer protocol - TCP.\n\n\nAlmost all traffic on internet today is transported by TCP protocol. TCP, as where it stands today, mature and solid, is the result of over 25 yrs of research by network gurus. TCP is complicated and difficult to understand, therefore i have paid utmost attention to present the concept in most simplest way as possible without any loss of information.\n\n\nIn this course, we unwrap internals of TCP and try to understand how it works and why it is so designed. So, be ready and place yourself in first gear !\n\n\nTCP is difficult to understand and confusing if not done in the right way. In this course, I shall be covering all aspects of TCP internal functioning STEP BY STEP with beautiful diagrams, Assignments, Questions and exercises. At no point you shall be left with doubts is my promise.  There is no programming in this course.\n\n\nThis is a little Advanced Course, if you are absolute beginner in networking, I would recommend you to first enroll in my other course \"Networking course - Network Concepts and Programming from Scratch\" and cover important sections on L2 routing, L3 routing, and Transport Layer at-least before jumping into this course.

Microsoft retired all of its MTA certifications on June 30, 2022, to refocus its certifications on the cloud-computing platforms (Azure, M365, etc.).\nBecause this has been such a successful course, and it provides a lot of value to aspiring and entry-level IT professionals, I’ve updated it to be a non-certification beginner’s Microsoft networking fundamentals course.\nWHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE IN THIS COURSE\n15 Hours of Lecture & Live Demonstration Videos\n17 Section Quizzes\nDownloadable Course Videos for Offline Viewing with Udemy Mobile App and PDF Lectures of Course PowerPoint Slides\nWHAT STUDENTS ARE SAYING\n“Alton is very easy to understand and is thorough with his explanations.

Would definitely recommend his classes to others.”\n- Matthew\n“I took this to help someone else. But Alton had a free subnetting class he offered that I took and it was fantastic. SO, thought I would pay for this and he did not disappoint. On point teaching and loads of helps. Very good person to learn from.”\n- Wayne\n“I've taken a few IT courses here at Udemy and by far Alton is the best instructor in my opinion. His English communication is clear & concise. Some other instructors are almost near impossible to understand. Alton is well organized & his content is prepared very well. He always teaches the background information first before he proceeds with the next section. This course has lots of lab content so not only is there excellent theory, but it is demonstrated. This makes absorbing this material that much easier. I have already taken other courses from Alton that is relevant to my profession and I am just as impressed.”\n- Matt\n“This course is great! I had very limited knowledge of this material before your course. It has been many years since I have studied anything, but you did a superb job of laying things out and explaining them. Now off to take my exam! Thank you very much Alton! I look forward to taking more of your courses in the future!”\n- Alan\nKEY COURSE TOPICS\nOverview of Computer Networks\nHow Computer Networks Work\nNetwork Topologies\nNetworking Components\nNetwork Cabling\nThe OSI Model\nThe TCP/IP Protocol Suite\nIP Addressing Version 4 (IPv4) Addressing & Subnetting\nIP Addressing Version 6 (IPv6) Fundamentals\nUnderstanding Switches & Routers\nWindows Networking Services\nThe Name Resolution Process\nWireless Networking\nWide Area Networking\nNetwork Security\nTCP/IP Command Line Tools\nOnce you complete this course, you'll understand how computer networks work and how to plan and design a computer network!\nSo What Are You Waiting For?

You think that by clicking on a button that tells you to \"Click here to scan your PC\" or receiving a phone call from Microsoft warning you that you have a virus, that you are doing the right thing.\nBut, it's these exact things that are opening up your systems to the bad guys!\nCyber Security: Beginner's Training Guide to Online Safety is a course that comes from over 23 years of working with computers and seeing how making some simple changes can protect you and your PC from potential threats. Whether a single user, family, or business with hundreds of employees, these lectures and videos will walk you through step-by-step what to do and not to do.\nLet's build a community of users that can learn from each other!\nCyber Security: Beginner's Training Guide to Online Safety will be updated over time with advice and examples from you, our users, so that we can all benefit from shared experiences and grow in the process. Remember, there's no shame or judgement if you accidentally ran across something that tricked you into getting infected or worse.

Passwordless authentication improves the strength of security and reduces the friction involved for end users.\nIdentity security describes the proactive approach to safely controlling user and system information that is used to authenticate and authorize user identities for access to secure resources. It is an essential aspect of the identity and access management (IAM) space and serves as the cornerstone for security in any organization.\nIn this Course you will learn about various fundamentals about Identity management. It is a foundational security component to help ensure users have the access they need, and that systems, data, and applications are inaccessible to unauthorized users.\nWhat You will learn\nWhat is Identity Management\nAccess Management\nAuthentication and Authorization Difference\nActive Directory and LDAP Concept\nSecurity Token Service Concept\nIdentity Security\nWhat is IDP\nDecision for Choosing Right IDP- Identity Provider\nIdentity Provider and Service Provider\nRelation Between IDP Provider, Service Provider, Relying Party\nWhat is Open ID Protocol\nWhat is SAML Protocol\nWhat is OAuth Protocol\nOAuth Flow\nWhat is AWS Cognito\nDifference Between SAML vs OpenID vs OAuth\nRole Based Access Control (RBAC)\nRule Based Access Control\nMandatory access control (MAC)\nDiscretionary access control (DAC).\nOverview of the Common implementation process\nUser Access Review\nSystem account access review\nProvisioning and De provisioning\nTake Action now with a 30-day money back guarantee.",

      "description": "Hello,\nWelcome to my Complete Web Application Hacking & Penetration Testing course\nHacking web applications, hacking websites, bug bounty & penetration testing in my ethical hacking course to be Hacker\nWeb Applications run the world From social media to business applications almost every organization has a web application and does business online So, we see a wide range of applications being delivered every day\nWhether you want to get your first job in IT security, become a white hat hacker, or prepare to check the security of your own home network, Udemy offers practical and accessible ethical hacking courses to help keep your networks safe from cybercriminals\nPenetration testing skills make you a more marketable IT tech Understanding how to exploit servers, networks, and applications means that you will also be able to better prevent malicious exploitation From website and network hacking, to pen testing in Python and Metasploit, Udemy has a course for you\nOur Student says that: This is the best tech-related course I've taken and I have taken quite a few Having limited networking experience and absolutely no experience with hacking or ethical hacking, I've learned, practiced, and understood how to perform hacks in just a few days\n\nI was an absolute novice when it came to anything related to penetration testing and cybersecurity After taking this course for over a month, I'm much more familiar and comfortable with the terms and techniques and plan to use them soon in bug bounties\n\nFAQ regarding Ethical Hacking on Udemy:\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing on Udemy:\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results\nIn this course, you will learn how to use black hat hacker tools and follow their ways to compromise Web Applications\nThis course will take you from beginner to advance level You will learn Web Application Hacking & Penetration Testing step-by-step with hands-on demonstrations\nWe are going to start by figuring out what the security issues are that are currently in the field and learn testing methodologies and types Then we are going to build a lab environment for you to apply what you get from the course and of course, the lab is gone cost you nothing Then we are going to start with some theory, you know, you should have the philosophy so we can always stay on the same page\nBasic web and internet technologies such as HTML, HTTP, Document Object Model and so on, these are absolutely needed so that we can complete testing experience And then we are gonna cover the reconnaissance section, we will gather information about the target and how to use that information to model an attack After that, we will tackle the user management issues Apart from that, we will also try to expose the session management problems\nIn the input validation section, we are gonna show why data validation is absolutely important for web applications So attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection and many more we are gonna examine the whole bunch of different types We also have a cryptography section with some basic attacks After that, we will discuss some known web application attacks (such as Drupal SQL injection aka Druppageddon)\nAt the end of the course, you will learn;\nTesting Methodologies and Types,\nBasic Web and Internet Technologies such as HTML, HTTP, Document Object Model and so on,\nTo Gather Information About the Target and Use This Information to Model an Attack\nUser Management Issues\nExposing The Session Management Problems\nData Validation\nAttacks such as Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection and many more\nSome Basic Attacks in

It makes the process of stealing money or even stealing someone's entire identity way more efficient.\nThe worst part? You are a target.\nMany people neglect taking steps to protect themselves online because they think, \"Why would anyone want to steal my information?\"\nWell, for starters, if you have any money to your name at all, there are plenty of tech-savvy criminals out there who are patiently waiting for the opportunity to take it from you.\nBeyond that, they can also steal your identity to run up charges on your credit cards, open new utility accounts, get medical treatment using your health insurance, or take advantage of your friends and family by impersonating you on social media.\nSo what can you do?\nYou can protect yourself and your private data, and you don't have to be an IT expert to do it.\nThis course outlines a step-by-step roadmap that you can follow to build a tight wall of security around your digital life.\nMore specifically, here are some of the things we'll cover:\nWhy security matters, and how to best approach it\nThe most common security threats you should be aware of\nHow to develop the right mindset and browsing habits\nHow to secure your smartphone and all the private information it knows about you\nThe 25 most commonly used passwords (is yours on the list?)\nWhat makes a good password (123456 is not a good password)\nHow to create and manage strong, unique passwords for all of your accounts (without needing to remember them)\nHow to lock attackers out of your accounts even if they manage to steal your passwords\nA security hole that attackers can use to gain unfettered access to your accounts without knowing your passwords (and how you can defend yourself)\nHow to use the power of encryption to make your private data unreadable to attackers\nAgain, this is a beginner-level course. These are technical topics, but I hope to walk you through everything in a way that's actionable and easy to understand. (And if you have any questions along the way, all you have to do is ask.)\nI'm confident that this course will change the way you look at security, and my confidence is backed by Udemy's 30-day money back guarantee.

It impacts individuals and organizations all over the world, and even some of the most widely publicized (and damaging) data breaches / ransomware infections all started with a successful phishing attack.\n\n\nGiven the massive role that phishing has had in recent (and historical) high profile cyberattacks it would be reasonable to conclude that its \"days are numbered\". Unfortunately, the opposite appears to be true with phishing attacks continuing to grow in number and sophistication every day.\n\n\nThis course will help you understand exactly what phishing is (and where it all started), how phishing works (through live hacking demonstrations), and how to defend against it (using a new \"low-tech\" approach you've likely never seen before)!\n\n\nNo advanced technical knowledge is required, and if you've ever sent or received an email before you're ready to take the course!\n\n\nNo matter who you are, learning to defend against phishing attacks is one of the smartest investments you can possibly make when it comes to cyber self-defense, and the skills you learn in this course are likely to serve you well into the future.\n\n\nIf you're and employer, providing this training to employees serves as a \"win-win\" as the skills they learn in this course can easily be applied to their personal lives as well as their professional ones.\n\n\nTo summarize, there has never been a better time to develop the skills needed to recognize and defend against phishing attacks, and this concise and engaging course was created to help you do just that!",

      "description": "With the extremely fast pace of technology development, electronic evidence has become a potential part of nearly all court cases. For this reason, many more people are now faced with the need to understand electronic evidence. This could be a legal representative, the person involved in a case or simply someone who would like to know more about the things we often see on television.\nDuring many years of forensics consulting, we have seen how difficult it is for legal professionals and other people faced with legal action to gain an understanding of the principals of electronic evidence, especially when there is limited time available and they do not have a strong technical background. A proper understanding can go a long way to strengthen a case as it often exposes weaknesses in the procedures and evidence used by the opposition.\nFew resources exist that gives an overview of the field and what is available, is often of a highly technical nature. Normally many resources need to be consulted to get an understanding of even some of the basic principles. By summarising many years of practical experience, the course aims at providing a solid understanding of the important principles in a short time without the need for a technical background.\nThe purpose is not to create experts, but to give enough background knowledge to individuals to know the possible areas of importance that need further research for the cases they are involved in. Like any other court case, cases involving electronic evidence will have unique complexities, but knowing where to look will often simplify matters considerably.\nOnly a very basic knowledge of computers and no legal background is assumed. Even so, the course contains material that will be useful to many people with a strong background in one or both of these fields.\nAt the end of the course students will:\nKnow what type of permission is needed to obtain electronic evidence.\nKnow the procedures that must be followed to ensure that electronic evidence remains unchanged and admissible in court.\nKnow how electronic evidence is collected from computer equipment.\nKnow how electronic evidence is collected from mobile equipment.\nKnow how electronic evidence is analysed.\nKnow the types of evidence that is likely to be found on computing devices.\nKnow what needs to be included in a proper forensic report that can be used by the court.\nBe able to identify weaknesses in evidence and the processes used to collect it.\nThe course should also be useful for anyone considering a career in digital forensics, to understand the difference between digital forensics and computer security. This is important, as the perception is often that digital forensics is just a part of computer security that involves exciting opportunities for hacking, something that is certainly not the case.\nA list of freely available software that can be used by students to do basic forensic investigations is also given for those who would like to expand their skills.",

      "description": "What is the IFCI Cybercrime Investigator's Course?\nIFCI’s flagship training program is the IFCI-CCI (Cybercrime Investigator) Training course. The IFCI-CCI teaches students the skills necessary to respond to all kinds of cybercrime incidents, from initial incident response and digital crime scene evidence acquisition to advanced forensic analysis and tracking International cybercriminals across the Internet.\nThe main goal for this course is to empower the nation’s cyber investigators with the knowledge, skills and abilities to undertake and successfully carry out their own investigations. This course is the first step for investigators to turn the tables on cyber criminals who are fleecing legitimate economies worldwide of billions of dollars every year.\nSome Course highlights include:\n15 hands-on labs - devised of real world scenarios\nAnalysis of Windows forensic artifacts\nVolatile memory analysis\nNetwork intrusion investigations\nInternet activity and email analysis\nNetwork traffic data analysis\nInternational cybercriminal profiling\nAttack vector identification\nDynamic malware analysis\nWho Should Take this course?\nAnybody whose job requires them to respond to cyber incidents, or anyone with an interest in cybercrime investigation, should take the IFCI-CCI training course. This course will help you by providing fast solutions to the following emergency situations:\nCorporate Risk/Security - Intellectual Property Theft Case: Your Research and Development Director quits and goes to work for a competitor.\nCan you determine if he copied your company’s secrets to a USB drive to take with him?\nPolice Investigations - Kidnapping Case: A child is taken from his home at night and the family receives an email with a proof-of-life picture and ransom demand.\nCan you extract IP addresses from the email headers to track the offender back to his location, or extract lat/long coordinates from the picture’s EXIF data to determine the exact location the picture was taken?\nIT Security Team - Rogue Malware Case: You discover malware on an internal corporate computer but you don’t know what it does or why it’s there.\nCan you analyze the malware, determine its capabilities, identify its target data, and destroy its data exfiltration file before your corporate proprietary information is lost?\nFederal Cyber Agent - Botnet Investigation Case: You’ve tracked botnet malware back to a specific set of command and control servers, but what’s the next step?\nCan you determine the server’s physical location in the world and research current and historical whois information? Are you able to research other malicious domains associated with the same IP address and track Command and Control proxy servers back to specific malicious actors?\nE-Discovery Analyst - File access case: You’ve recovered and indexed thousands of PDF files on a computer. One was flagged as key to the case and you are asked if the computer owner knew of and accessed this file.\nCan you examine the Windows registry and link files to determine the exact time and date that specific users accessed individual files?\n\n\nWhy take this course?\nCybercrime is epidemic. The headlines declare it daily:\n2015 - SONY is devastated by an attack that destroys its internal systems, steals terabytes of private data, posts unreleased movies on Internet torrent sites, and humiliates corporate executives. The cost to corporate image and revenue stream is uncountable.\n2014 - Home Depot is hacked, losing an estimated 55 million credit cards to the cybercrime underground.\n2013 - Russian Hackers steal 40 million credit cards from Target, resulting in approx $1 billion in losses to the company.\n2012 - The Shamoon virus destroys nearly 30,000 Saudi Aramco Computers, temporarily shutting down one of the world’s largest corporations.\n2011 - SONY data breach lost personal details and payment information for approximately 77 million customers, resulting in massive monetary loss and the temporary closure of the PlayStation Gaming Network.\nThe corporations victimized in these situations were unprepared to respond to the attacks causing delayed investigations and reduced information flow to decision-making executives. Eventually, they contracted out the investigations to high-priced consultants, whose investigative results were often too little, too late.\nIFCI-CCI’s mission is to provide our students the knowledge and skills necessary to respond to network attacks immediately, analyze the evidence, produce actionable cyber-intelligence, and implement it to shore up security vulnerabilities before they become massive breaches like those mentioned above.\nThere is a dearth of quality training in computer forensics, even less for hacker and malware focused investigations, and almost nothing that is available in a convenient online format that can be studied from the comfort of your own home, and fit to your own schedule. IFCI fills this void by providing the finest cybercrime investigation training in the world, created and delivered by some of the world’s foremost experts in their field, and streamed directly to any Internet-connected device you choose to employ.",

        "While this is a beginner's course, the material gets more and more complex as the class continues. It is in-depth, detailed, and hands-on and requires maximum effort for maximum benefit - therefore it is not recommended for casual observers not interested in putting forth the effort required to learn the material."

      "description": "In this course you will learn absolutely everything about android app hacking. This course teaches you the ethical principles and enables you to become the top expert of your company regarding to app security. We learn really complex attacks in the most funny way that's possible, by hacking a mobile game.\n\n\nLegal note:\nThe game we are going to hack is licensed under the GNU GPL, which means, we are allowed to perform such modifications. Hacking apps without having the permission of the author is strongly forbidden! The things you learn are related to security research. I am teaching you all of this in a legal and ethical way.\n\n\nCourse - Structure:\n\n\nIn the installation chapter we will analyze different smartphone setups, their strength and their weaknesses. We unlock our device and use certain features to already start hacking our first apps. We will learn how to analyze bluetooth low energy connections and get familiar with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).\n\n\nWe move on to the android app structure. Here we gain a rock solid understanding about the key components of an android app. We will analyze the AndroidManifest.xml and learn how to exploit activities, broadcast receiver and content provider. We will write our own small apps to exploit SQL injections and path traversals.\n\n\nAfterwards we take a deep dive into reverse engineering. We will learn how to decompile an android app and reconstruct the Java code. We will have a look at different decompilers and create flow- and call graphs to deal with highly obfuscated apps. Finally a nice application is waiting for us to practice all the things we have learned so far.\n\n\nThen we have the treasure of this course, the SMALI chapter. SMALI is like an assembly language of an android application and gives us unlimited power in hacking them. We practice our skills by modifying our mobile game to have infinite lives, become invisible or invincible. We add multiple player shots, manipulate the fire rate and many more.\n\n\nIn the man-in-the-middle chapter we will learn how to analyze the network traffic of a mobile app. We will gain an understanding about HTTPS and how to analyze these connections. We will learn how certificate pinning works and bypass several different types of it.\n\n\nThe last thing that is missing is FRIDA, which is an amazing framework to perform runtime manipulations within an app. We will hook into the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) to modify a dice application. We will learn how to scan the memory for certain instances and how to interact with the UI thread of an app. We will create new objects and practice all of this by writing our own trainer for a gaming application. The cherry on top will be the analysis of a native c function with Ghidra and the manipulation and modification with FRIDA.\n\n\nAfter getting through all these chapters you will be the top expert in android app security of your company. Therefore, what you are wainting for? :)",

Email is also one of the primary attack vectors that can introduce malware, ransomware and other malicious code into your environment. These attacks can come in many forms including email spoofing.\nDMARC is designed to help mitigate this risk and ensure that spoofing your company domain is identified and blocked, including communication targeted at your organization or customers.\nDMARC standards for Domain Based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance. DMARC utilizes both SPF and DKIM in order to make a determination on how to handle email that is coming inbound to your organization as well as messages that are sent outbound from your domain.\nSPF stands for sender policy framework, and this specifies the servers that are allowed to send email on your behalf.\nDKIM is an acronym for Domain Keys Identified Mail. This allows your mail server to digitally sign each message that is sent out from your domain. The recipient can then verify that the email was sent from your server and has not been altered in transit.\nThis course will help you understand the fundamental concepts of these three protocols and how they work in conjunction with each other to help mitigate the risk of email spoofing from your domain.",

If you've taken my previous courses with similar names, you already know what's in store. I'll be providing a bunch of vulnerable Virtual Machines which we'll be hacking with Kali Linux using VirutalBox. At the time of this recording, all of the technology is cutting edge, and real-world relevant. Just to give you an idea of what to expect, we'll be focusing very little on theory, and putting a high emphasis on practical hands-on application of offensive security skills.\nFor example, we're going to be utilizing some of the industry standard penetration testing tools such as nmap, Metasploit, dirb, netcat, Burp suite, and a bunch of custom exploits. We'll be focusing on automated and manual enumeration and exploitation, which is a key essential when training to be a subject matter expert in our field. Some of the attack techniques we'll be covering are remote web application and service exploitation, privilege escalation, directory traversal, SQL injection, local file inclusion, and much more. If you're not quite sure what some or any of these words mean, don't worry, you'll see soon enough their effectiveness in action.\nEach lecture has a set of resources which are included as a text file. In order to access it, simply click on the Resources drop down box for the particular lecture, and download the text file. This includes all commands which are utilized in that specific lecture, as well as URLs which I deem useful.\nI really hope that you enjoy my course, and encourage you to reach out to me via the Udemy messaging system either in the Q&A section or direct message if you have any specific technical questions or simply want career advice.",

      "description": "CISSP is the gold standard for security certifications. It covers the breadth of information security’s deep technical and managerial concepts. Learning to effectively design, engineer, and manage the overall security posture of an organization.\n\nThis course covers Domain 1 - Security and Risk Management. This domain is one of the most important domains in the CISSP exam. It lays the foundation, covering security concepts that all the other domains build upon. Understanding exactly what security means and the core concepts around assessing and managing the wide array of risks we face is fundamental to every domain in the CISSP.\nDomain 2 - Asset Security. An asset is anything we value. When we have highly valued assets, such as sensitive data, securing those assets throughout their lifecycle is paramount. We will learn about data standards, classification, regulations, retention, and controls to protect organizational value.\nDomain 3 - Security Engineering. Engineering is about understanding and designing systems that work. Security is a fundamental part of any well-designed system. This domain will help you understand the engineering lifecycle and various models and security components required in data structures and physical facilities. We also learn how cryptography fits in to information security.\nDomain 4 - Communication and Network Security. Information is not just stored; it is also transmitted and must be secured in transit. Understanding networking models, protocols, hardware components, and possible attack vectors is vital to information security. It is one of the most important domains on the CISSP exam.\nDomain 5 - Identity and Access Management. Controlling who can access valuable resources can lead to proper confidentiality, integrity, and availability. A CISSP must understand mechanisms and techniques to verify a subject’s authenticity before authorizing access. They must be able to assure that only proper interactions have occurred and mitigate potential attacks.\nDomain 6 - Security Assessment and Testing. Understanding the effectiveness of your security measures is vital. As you collect and review logs, verify software development security, and undergo security audits and certification you can have some assurance and insight into your security status and needs.\nDomain 7- Security Operations. From incident response that involves investigation of evidence to facility access management and disaster recovery planning, testing, and implementation, this domain requires putting security principles and concepts into practice.\nDomain 8 - Security in the Software Development Life Cycle. Many of the most publicized security issues have stemmed from flaws in the software code. While a CISSP does not have to be a software developer, they must understand and be able to communicate software development security needs. In this domain you will learn important terminology and concepts of software development.",

      "description": "Last Update: June 2024\n\n\nWelcome this comprehensive Ethical Hacking course! This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge! It starts with you from scratch and takes you step-by-step teaching you how to hack systems like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts!\n\n\nThis course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory; we'll start with ethical hacking basics, breakdown the different penetration testing fields and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Apple Mac OS), then we'll dive and start hacking straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by analysing and exploiting different systems such as networks, cloud servers, clients, websites, etc. No boring dry lectures.\n\n\nThe course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to practically exploit theses weaknesses to hack this system. As we do this I will also introduce you to different hacking and security concepts, tools and techniques. Everything will be taught through examples and hands-on practicals, there will be no useless or boring lectures!\n\n\nAll the techniques in this course are practical and work against real systems, you'll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you'll learn how to use it to hack the target system . By the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to suit different situations and different scenarios .\n\n\nBy the end of the course you will have a strong foundation in most hacking or penetration testing fields and you'll also learn how to detect, prevent and secure systems and yourself from the discussed attacks.\n\n\nThe course is divided into four main sections:\n1. Network Hacking - This section will teach you how to hack and secure both wired & wireless networks. First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:\nPre-connection attacks: in this subsection you'll learn a number of attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without the need to know the network password; you'll learn how to gather information about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections (deny/allow devices from connecting to networks).\nGaining Access: Now that you gathered information about the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to crack the key and get the password to your target network whether it uses WEP, WPA or even WPA2 .\nPost Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of powerful techniques that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, see anything they do on the internet (such as login information, passwords, visited urls, images, videos, etc.), redirect requests, inject evil code in loaded pages and much more! You will also learn how to create a fake WiFi network or a honeypot, attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.\n\n\n2. Gaining Access - In this section you will learn two main approaches to gain remote access or hack computer systems:\nServer Side Attacks:  In this subsection you will learn how to gain full access to computer systems without user interaction. You will learn how to gather useful information about a target system such as the operating system, open ports, installed services, then use this information to discover weaknesses / vulnerabilities and exploit them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will learn how to automatically scan servers for vulnerabilities and generate different types of reports with your discoveries.\nClient Side Attacks - If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to hack it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by hijacking software updates or backdooring downloads on the fly. This subsection also teaches you how to use social engineering to hack secure systems, so you'll learn how to gather comprehensive information about system users such as their social accounts, friends, their mails, etc. You'll learn how to create trojans by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use the gathered information to spoof emails so they appear as if they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with, to social engineer them into running your trojan.\n\n\n3. Post Exploitation - In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’ll learn how to access the file system (read/write/upload/execute), maintain your access, spy on the target (capture key strikes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots, etc.) and even use the target computer as a pivot to hack other systems.\n\n4. Website / Web Application Hacking - In this section you will learn how websites work, how to gather information about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies, etc.) and how to discover and exploit the following dangerous vulnerabilities to hack websites:\nInformation Disclosure.\nFile Upload.\nCode Execution.\nLocal File Inclusion.\nRemote File Inclusion.\nSQL Injection.\nCross Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n\nThroughout the course you'll learn how to use use the following tools to achieve the above:\nVMware.\nKali Linux\nNmap.\nBettercap.\nWireshark.\nOWASP Zap.\nMetasploit.\nNexpose.\nSQLmap.\nMaltego.\nVeil Framework.\nCrunch.\nNetdiscover.\nZenmap.\narpspoof.\nEvilgrade.\nThe Backdoor Factory.\nBeEF.\nDirb.\nKnockpy.\nNetcat.\nAircrack-ng suite .\nAirmon-ng .\nAirodump-ng .\nAireplay-ng .\nAircrack-ng .\n\n\nAt the end of each section you will learn how to detect, prevent and secure systems and yourself from the discussed attacks.\n\n\nCheckout the curriculum and the course teaser for more info!\n\n\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\nNotes:\nThis course is created for educational purposes only, all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against systems that I have permission to test.\nThis course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih & zSecurity and no other organisation is associated with it or a certification exam. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that NO OTHER ORGANISATION IS INVOLVED.",

      "description": "Welcome all to my cyber security “Ethical Hacking: Network Security & Network Layer Attack\" course\nLearn Ethical Hacking with Network Security, Sniffing, Subnetting, Networking, Password Cracking & implement MitM attack\n\nWhether you want to get your first job in IT security, become a white hat hacker, or prepare to check the security of your own home network, Udemy offers practical and accessible ethical hacking courses to help keep your networks safe from cybercriminals\nOur Student says that: This is the best tech-related course I've taken and I have taken quite a few Having limited networking experience and absolutely no experience with hacking or ethical hacking, I've learned, practiced, and understood how to perform hacks in just a few days\n\nFAQ regarding Ethical Hacking :\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at…\nTo become Ethical Hacker and to learn hacking my Network Layer Attacks and Network Fundamentals course is a perfect start for you This one gets kind of fun because we get to actually look at data going on the networks like: how to sniff the network and gather information from the network We’re going to use some tools such as TCP Dump and Wireshark We will also be doing a deep dive into the Subnetting, ARP Spoofing and MitM attacks and Password Cracking\nThis course is highly practical just like my other courses But which also does not mean that I will neglect the theory That`s why this course is formed in two parts\nFirst part, “The Network Fundamentals” is for the beginners to explore the Network Fundamentals but also could be also a good refresher for advanced level students\nIn Network Fundamentals section I will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of data networking operation including IP addressing and subnetting, ethernet operation, ports and protocols, and the OSI model By the end of this course, you will understand the relationship between IP addresses and MAC addresses, as well as the difference between a router and a switch\nAfter learning theoretical background ( I promise that second part is totally fun ), in Network & Data Link Layer ( Layer 2 ) Attacks part you will first learn how to set up a lab and install needed software to practice penetration testing on your own machine Then we’re going to use some tools such as TCP dump and Wireshark and we’ll see some attacks and techniques to expand the sniffing surface:\nMAC Address Table Overflow attack, also known as MAC flooding,\nARP Cache Poisoning attack, also known as ARP spoof,\nDHCP Starvation attack and DHCP spoof,\nAnd VLAN hopping techniques\nethical\nEthical Intelligence\nnmap nessus\nnmap course\nnmap metaspolit\nComplete nmap\nKali

      "description": "Hi there,\nWelcome to \"Metasploit Framework: Penetration Testing with Metasploit\" course\nIn this course, you will learn ethical hacking with the best ethical hacking distribution Kali, and the tool: Metasploit\nThis is not a pure Penetration Testing course but Complete Penetration Testing with Metasploit course\nIn this course, you will learn the capabilities of the Metasploit Framework while you are doing a penetration test\n\nWhether you want to get your first job in IT security, become a white hat hacker, or prepare to check the security of your own home network, Udemy offers practical and accessible ethical hacking courses to help keep your networks safe from cybercriminals\nPenetration testing skills make you a more marketable IT tech Understanding how to exploit servers, networks, and applications means that you will also be able to better prevent malicious exploitation From website and network hacking, to pen testing in Python and Metasploit, Udemy has a course for you\nOur Student says that: This is the best tech-related course I've taken and I have taken quite a few Having limited networking experience and absolutely no experience with hacking or ethical hacking, I've learned, practiced, and understood how to perform hacks in just a few days\n\nI was an absolute novice when it came to anything related to penetration testing and cybersecurity After taking this course for over a month, I'm much more familiar and comfortable with the terms and techniques and plan to use them soon in bug bounties\n\nFAQ regarding Ethical Hacking on Udemy:\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing on Udemy:\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results\nNo Previous Knowledge is needed!\nYou don’t need to have previous knowledge about all This course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level with hands-on examples\nLearn the

Broadcast Domain and Collision Domain\n\n\nWe Understand - Networking by its nature is inclined towards being a theoretical subject of study. To arouse the interest of the students ,we elaborate each and every topic of this course through an assignment or project.\nThis course is thorough. We explain the design, discuss the code flow and then guide the audience how to implement the particular concept design in detail in a step by step manner. All you need is a Linux OS running on your system to do this course.\n\nWho should do this course ?\nThis course is meant for UG Computer science students, job seekers and professional developers. This is MUST do course for those who want to join MNCs as a developer. The topics covered in this course are of utmost importance from interviews aspects and students graduating in computer science and looking to seek an opportunity in MNCs as a developer should have Networking concepts at his/her finger tips. Better to have done Networking under graduate course, not mandatory. Job seekers trying for the position of Networking developers in product based MNCs System software development including Networking is an evergreen area. Internet will not going to be doomed ever.\n\n\nPre-requisite\nThere is no pre-requisite for this course, however, it shall be advantage if you know a little of C. We designed this course assuming student is a complete beginner in Networking and we raise the level of course gradually as we move from Basic to advance Networking concepts.\nAlso, Please just do not sit and watch my codes. Write your own codes, even if it is same as mine !\nWe have a strong reasons to choose C as a language for this course:\n1. The entire core networking development work is being done in C in industry. So, this reason alone is good enough that you should learn network development in C if you are aiming to join industry as a network protocol developer.\n2. Network equipment need to interact with underlying hardware - the ASIC chips. What could be a better language other than C when it comes to interact and program the hardware.\n3. C is middle level language - not as low as assembly, neither as high as Java/Python. In C, its the programmer's responsibility to write every line of code to get the task done, unlike Java/Python which provides rich rest of libraries to do the most tasks for you. Using High Level Languages for learning network programming would obscure the low level details of networking - that is what is going behind the scenes. If you are are beginner in network programming, you must learn things from scratch and only C provides you the opportunity to do that. So, you must do all your assignments in C.\n4. Networking is all about cooking up the packets and sending it out of wire. C will allow you to cook packets exactly the same way as you would like them to appear on wire. Lot of Bit level programming.\n5. If you are a beginner in Networking, pls refrain from learning network programming in High Level Languages such as Java Or Python. It is not job oriented thing to do in networking domain.\nNo Third Party libraries\nWhatever logic you implement, you need to implement it from scratch. This course do not suggest taking help of any third party library to get the jobs done. Use of external libraries completely defeats the purpose of the course. However, it is recommended to use third party libraries for commonly used data structures such as linked lists/Trees/Queues etc which saves a lot of time implementing these data structures.\n\n\nWhat else along with the course ?\nIf you are aiming to become a developer, then, besides strong in Data structure and Algorithms, you should have clarity of concepts related to other Linux utilities. Networking is all about system programming, and you would be interested in learning other linux concepts of prime importance such as Inter Process Communication, Remote Procedure Calls etc. Please take a look at my other courses in this regard. These courses will summed you up as a more competitive developer in Networking & System Programming domain.\n\n\nSee what students are saying about this course\nJust Take a Look at These Top Rated Reviews (Browse review section to verify these reviews)\n***** What a Fantastic Course!!! I really appreciate the efforts Abhishek has put in this course. He has put his sweat and heart into it. The way he explains things keeps you hooked on to this course. He directly gets TO THE POINT without beating around the bush. No author of any networking book can explain things like Abhishek is doing. What Abhishek is doing is that he is explaining the Meat of the subject. One would have to read 10 books to understand this. or perhaps more. There was a hunch in my heart that dont know networking clearly. This course meets my expectations with respect to content, clarity and teaching style with proper presentations. This course improves your understanding and removes the fear of not knowing...not only that, it injects a good amount of confidence about your knowledge of Networking...Thanks for coming up with such a course. Thanks Again.\n***** Come across right course at right time. This course seems cover all important areas of networking. Author explains the topics in good detail and with good pace. This course looks like designed to beat technical interviews.\n***** Great Course, instructor is very thorough and provide quick guidance and clear any doubts promptly with high availability. I really enjoyed this course. Networking has been a tough subject for me to learn, but this course has made it quite easy. I now have my concepts thoroughly clear ! Thanks Abhishek, and Udemy.\n***** I am working as Firmware/Embedded engineer, and the courses from this guys are goddamn blessing. In the real industry, as he mentioned earlier, all network programming or Linux system programming must be implemented with C cuz C is a perfect language for accessing memory spaces and customizing serial communication with other chips. In the real industrial fields, no one is gonna teach you. You are the only one who needs to figure it out by yourself cuz everyone wishes you not to excel in workplace. Only one person can be a manager or supervisor. Take this guy's courses. Needless to say, quality guaranteed. If I could do hacking on this site, i am gonna crash his lectures. I do not want other people to get benefits from his lectures. It would be best if he makes a lecture for \"making Operating System from scratch\" :)\n\n\nWarning : This course has auto system-generated subtitles which may not be perfect.

The course covers Network Architecture for Fixed and Wireless networks for a Service Provider. The architecture is explained using hierarchy like Core, Aggregation and Access.\nNetworking is basically communication or an interconnection of computers and other devices including client computers, servers and, network devices, such as hubs, switches, routers, and firewall. Participants will also learn about network components, network topologies, transmission media and TCP/IP protocol suite.\n\nThe course covers  Open Systems Interconnection or OSI model, which is a theoretical framework for understanding and explaining networking protocols. The purpose of the OSI model is to open communication between different systems without any changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software. All OSI Layers are independent from each other, which makes introducing changes easier as no other layers are effected. The OSI model has been discussed giving good understanding of the different layers and their functionalities in detail.\nThe course learning concludes with the wireless access basic concepts related to frequency and spectrum.\nThe assessment quiz at the end will help participants to check their learning.",

You will have the skills and knowledge necessary to investigate digital crimes, catch hackers, and recover digital evidence. You will learn:\nThe basic concepts of digital forensics\nThe legal framework governing digital forensics\nThe best practices used in\nWhat is computer forensics?\nComputer forensics is the application of investigation and analysis techniques to gather and preserve evidence from a particular computing device in a way that is suitable for presentation in a court of law. The goal of computer forensics is to perform a structured investigation and maintain a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Computer forensics -- which is sometimes referred to as computer forensic science essentially is data recovery with legal compliance guidelines to make the information admissible in legal proceedings. The terms digital forensics and cyber forensics are often used as synonyms for computer forensics. Digital forensics starts with the collection of information in a way that maintains its integrity. Investigators then analyze the data or system to determine if it was changed, how it was changed and who made the changes. The use of computer forensics isn't always tied to a crime. The forensic process is also used as part of data recovery processes to gather data from a crashed server, failed drive, reformatted operating system (OS) or other situation where a system has unexpectedly stopped working.\nWhy is computer forensics important?\nIn the civil and criminal justice system, computer forensics helps ensure the integrity of digital evidence presented in court cases. As computers and other data-collecting devices are used more frequently in every aspect of life, digital evidence and the forensic process used to collect, preserve and investigate it -- has become more important in solving crimes and other legal issues.",

Unlike traditional servers, NGINX doesn’t rely on threads to handle requests. Instead it uses a much more scalable event-driven (asynchronous) architecture. This architecture uses small, but more importantly, predictable amounts of memory under load. Even if you don’t expect to handle thousands of simultaneous requests, you can still benefit from NGINX’s high-performance and small memory footprint. NGINX scales in all directions: from the smallest VPS all the way up to large clusters of servers.",

You will be getting live video demonstrations, lectures, and in some video's ill be on camera explaining something.\nWe talk about the process of hacking, from gathering information in the Recon phase, to more involved looks at our targets in the scanning phase. Enumeration and System hacking bring the basic \"hacking process\" to a close, but that is not the end of things, far from it.\nMany of today's large hacks and data breaches that you see all over the news are the result of very clever & persistent social engineers. Social Engineers figure out that you can't always hack the machines, and sometimes its much easier to hack the unsuspecting person using the machine. Learn valuable skills in conducting Social Engineering Penetration Tests as well as how to protect against social engineering attacks.\nYou are going to enjoy the demos in the course as they will walk you through the whole process and not just the highlights. You can follow along with every single demo and make them into practice courses for yourself.\nin just a few hours, you will already be figuring out new ways to use the software tools and tricks I have shown you and come up with new things to try. It is kind of addicting once you get into it.\nI can't promise a prestigious job right out of the gate, but I can promise you that you will learn way more in this course than you thought was possible, and you will want to learn even more.\nGet rid of the mystery and learn what real hackers know.

      "description": "Hi there,\nWelcome to my “Ethical Hacking with Metasploit: Exploit & Post Exploit” course\nLearn Ethical Hacking from scratch with Metasploit, exploit vulnerabilities and become a white hat hacker | Ethical 2022\n\nWhether you want to get your first job in IT security, become a white hat hacker, or prepare to check the security of your own home network, Oak Academy offers practical and accessible ethical hacking courses to help keep your networks safe from cybercriminals\nOur Student says that: This is the best tech-related course I've taken and I have taken quite a few Having limited networking experience and absolutely no experience with hacking or ethical hacking, I've learned, practiced, and understood how to perform hacks in just a few days\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at…\nThis course is a monster!!!\nIt covers the fundamental building blocks of hacking, penetration testing (Kali Linux), gaining control using Metasploit and application development\nDo not worry You don’t need to have a previous knowledge about all This course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level\nGood news is since free and popular tools are used you don’t need to buy any tool or application\nAll my students will have a chance to learn how to set up a lab environment and install the

      "description": "Hacking ICS/OT on shodan or in your own company? Better not!\nI believe that the best way to learn is with practical experience. ICS/OT Security is a new and important skill for all technicians and engineers working on industrial control systems. There are quite a few open source tools that can be used to investigate the cyber security of industrial control systems, but unfortunately there is no suitable training opportunity.\nFor learners of IT pentesting, there are plenty of opportunities like HackTheBox or VulnHub, where pentest tools and hacking skills can be tried out. Training platforms with ICS focus either don't exist or come in the form of a boring seminar with over 1000€ participation fee.\nIn this workshop you will learn important pentest tools from Kali and open source tools and you can try them out in 6 interactive simulations of industrial controllers. Of course the simulations are not perfect, so I will show you the tools and techniques on two real PLCs.\nThe workshop has a high practical part and encourages you to participate! There are more than 30 exciting tasks waiting for you, with which you can deepen your skills bit by bit!\nImportant: The pentesting of ICS cannot be compared to the typical pentesting of the IT world. Industrial plants need to be continuously available and hardly any plant operator wants to risk a production stop. Typically, security testing is performed at the lowest or second lowest aggressiveness level. So if you are hoping to pwn your device with buffer overflows, kernel exploits, privilege escalation and root shells, you are in the wrong place.\nAre you interested in security analysis of ICS and do you already have basic knowledge of industrial cyber security? Then this is the right place for you!\nAre you currently studying for the (CEH) Certified Ethical Hacker? From v12 on knowledge in OT is required! This course offers you a hands-on introduction to understand the typical vulnerabilities of OT hardware!\nCurious about safeguarding of ICS/OT devices? Join my course Assessing and Protecting Industrial Control Systems.\nPlease note that the software used is not mine. I can only offer limited assistance in case of problems. Please contact the publisher of the software for help. The installation instructions were created to the best of my knowledge, but the responsibility for the installation lies with the participants.",

The course is beginner friendly and comes with a walkthrough videos course and all documents with all the commands executed in the videos. The course is based on our years of experience of breaking Windows and AD environments and research.\nWhen it comes to AD security, there is a large gap of knowledge which security professionals and administrators struggle to fill. Over the years, I have taken numerous world trainings on AD security and always found that there is a lack of quality material and specially, a lack of good walkthrough and explanation.\nThe course simulate real world attack and defense scenarios and we start with a non-admin user account in the domain and we work our way up to enterprise admin. The focus is on exploiting the variety of overlooked domain features and not just software vulnerabilities.\nWe cover topics like AD enumeration, tools to use, domain privilege escalation, domain persistence, Kerberos based attacks (Golden ticket, Silver ticket and more), ACL issues, SQL server trusts, and bypasses of defenses.",

These processes are very complex and can only be implemented by teams of security experts. Constant quality assurance, maintenance and adaptation also belong to an IT security process.\nIt does not matter if a company develops products or runs an online shop, IT security is a characteristic feature.

      "description": "\"Amateurs hack systems,professionals hack people.\" (Bruce Schneier)\nIn this course, meant for beginners with no previous knowledge about penetration testing or hacking, that will start with the basics of social engineering, and by end of it you'll be at an advanced level being able to hack into all major operating systems (windows, Android and so on), generate different types of trojans and deliver them using smart social engineering techniques.\nTo completely understand computer security, it's vital to step outside the fence and to think outside the box. Computer security is not just about firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems or antiviruses. It's also about tricking people into doing whatever a hacker wishes, for their benefit. A secure system, network or infrastructure is also about informed people. That's it what about this course is all about. Knowing how easy is for a hacker to make a regular user to do something harmful for himself, even being aware that is making a bit mistake.\n\nThis course covers both theoretical and practical aspects and contains hands-on labs.\nLearn how to get Facebook, Gmail iCloud, Linkedin password trough social engineering, create backdoors and get remote control.\n\nThis courses have demos and labs using Kali Linux.\nDisclaimer: this course is intended for ethical hackers and those who want to protect against this kind of attacks. Those are only theoretical examples in a lab environment. Hacking is illegal without legal permission!",

      "description": "O-RAN (or Open RAN) opens new avenues of service innovation and agility for telcos by breaking the Radio Access Network (RAN)  into its component parts, each of which can be separately reconfigured. O-RAN standards are freely accessible to all third-party software developers, who can develop new types of services and innovate on the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) by building xApps and rApps. This enables telcos to make their networks a much more relevant resource for both enterprise and consumer applications.\nArguably the open RAN’s biggest claim is the potential to enable telcos to avoid vendor lock-in by replacing vendor-proprietary interfaces with a fully disaggregated RAN based on open standards.\nAutomation will be key to managing the lifecycle of disaggregated, cloud-native RAN functions. O-RAN can bring down the network deployment and operation cost by evolving the network in a continuous integration/ continuous delivery (CI/CD) manner rather than through generational investment cycles.\nThis course covers all the important topics that are required to have a good and comprehensive learning of the O-RAN technology. The relevant standards of the O-RAN alliance have been discussed to describe the O-RAN architecture and working, as well as the O-RAN open interfaces.\nThe contents of the this course are:\nSection 1: Introduction\nThe Main components of a 5G Network\nDesign Goals of Open RAN\nSection 2: Evolution to Open RAN\nTraditional Basestation Architecture\nEvolution to the Contemporary Basestation\nEvolution to Virtualized RAN (vRAN)\nFrom Virtualized RAN (vRAN) towards Open RAN\nDifference Between Distributed RAN and Centralized RAN\nDifference Between Centralized RAN and Cloud RAN\nPath to 5G Open RAN: Horizontal Dis-aggregation\nSection 3: RAN Splits-Logical View\nDifferent RAN Functional Splits\nRAN Split Option 1\nRAN Split Option 2\nRAN Split Option 8\nRAN Split Option 6\nRAN Splits Logical View\nOption 7.2x for Open RAN\nEnhanced CPRI (e-CPRI) Protocol\nSection 4: Overview of O-RAN Architecture\nDifference Between Open RAN and O-RAN\nControl Plane & User Plane Dis-aggregation in O-RAN\nEntities & Interfaces Introduced in O-RAN Alliance Architecture Functions\nOptions For Aggregation of O-RAN Nodes\nO-RAN Control Loops\nMajor Entities in O-RAN Ecosystems\nSection 5: Virtualization techniques for O-RAN\nEvolution of Virtualization: Physical Network Functions (PNFs)\nVirtual Network Functions (VNFs)\nMonolithic Applications as VNFs\nCloud Native Network Function-Distributed Applications\nO-Cloud Deployment Options\nDEVOPS CI-CD in O-RAN\nNetwork Automation to Reduce CAPEX and OPEX\nSection 6: Detailed O-RAN Architecture\nService Management and Orchestration (SMO)\nNon Real Time RIC (non-RT RIC)\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) Format Example\nA1 Policy Format and Examples\nNear Real Time RIC\nCentralized and Distributed Near-RT RIC\nSection 7: O-RAN Traffic Steering Use Case\nO-RAN Traffic Steering (TS) APP Example-Problem of Traditional TS\nAdvantages of TS using O-RAN\nRequired Data (KPI) collection for TS\nRole of Non-RT RIC in TS\nRole of Near RT RIC in TS\nRole of E2-Node in TS\nTS Example Scenario\nSection 8: Network Slicing in 5G O-RAN\nWhat Is A Network Slice\nExample of Network Slicing in 5G\nSingle Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI)\nNetwork Slice Subnet Instance (NSSI)\nNetwork Slicing Management Model: CSMF, NSMF,NSSMF\nNetwork Slice Template (NST)\nOpen Network Automation Platform (ONAP) Architecture\nONAP based O-RAN Network Slicing Architecture\nNetwork Slice Instance Creation Procedure Using ONAP based Network Slicing\nSection 9: Other O-RAN Use Case\nUse Case: NSSI Resource Allocation Optimization\nNSSI Resource Allocation Optimization Procedure\nFlow Diagram: NSSI Resource Allocation Optimization\nUse Case: Flight Path Based Dynamic UAV Radio Resource Allocation\nFlight Path Based Dynamic UAV Radio Resource Allocation Procedure\nFlow Diagram: Flight Path Based Dynamic UAV Radio Resource Allocation",

      "description": "Welcome to the most complete Ethical Hacking and Threat Hunting course available online, where both topics in offensive security, as well as defensive security, are professionally covered. This course includes two crash courses about Linux and Python as well.\n\n\nThe following seven pillars constitute the foundation of this life-changing course:\n\n1- Ethical Hacking\nLearn how to think and act like a hacker and work with various techniques and tools to achieve this goal. As an ethical hacker at the end of this course, you will be able to help your customers mitigate various attack vectors and their corresponding details practically based on various security standards and best practices. Also, you will learn how to execute various ethical hacking phases as Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, Clearing Tracks, and others.\n\n\n\n2- Penetration Testing\nLearn how to hack easy to hard real-world simulated virtual machines on HackTheBox Live Hacking! using unique exploits, tactics, and techniques. Learn the art of intrusion with these CTFs (Capture the Flags) which will help you in the future on every real work project.\nAlso work on pentest methods in web, network, vulnerability assessment workflows, and “Defense in Depth” best practices which will help you hack like black-hat hackers, defend or secure them like security experts and harden your corporate environment against malicious actors.\n\n\n\n3- Red-Teaming techniques and tactics\nLearn beginner to advanced pentesting techniques. Learn how to think and act like threat actors to stop them at various phases of the attack life cycle.\nMITRE ATT&CK Framework: reconnaissance, initial foothold, lateral movement, privilege escalation, command and control, active directory attacks, Linux, and mac os x malware and attack techniques.\nLearn scripting languages for the Cobalt Strike Framework and other red-team engagement frameworks to perform development and operations on them.\nLearn how to develop your C2 infrastructure to avoid detection by blue teams and SOCs during red team operations.\n\n\n\n4- Elastic Stack Wazuh Manager (SIEM)\nLearn how to set up a complete SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) using Elastic Stack (formerly ELK Stack) using Wazuh Manager. Also, learn how to ingest various log formats from different log sources such as Linux and Windows servers, Fortigate firewall appliances, and so on. You will learn how to activate different functionalities (capabilities) of the Wazuh manager such as vulnerability monitoring, File Integrity Monitoring, CIS Hardening Benchmark Monitoring, and much more. Also, you will learn how the underlying decoders and rules are programmed to detect an unlimited amount of security events across an enterprise network.\n\n\n\n5- Threat Hunting (Blue-Teaming)\nThere is a complete section for threat hunting where you put what you've learned into work and run attacks such as Spawn Session and Process Injection, ShellShock, MSHTA, Brute-Force, Mimikatz, and so on from your Parrot OS and detect them with your SIEM tool that you've set up and completely configured during the course. During this section, you get familiar with how different IoC (Indication of Compromise) will appear in your SIEM tool.\n\n\n\n6- Python Scripting for Security\nLearn how to create scripts and programs to do what you want whenever you are required to, from small scripts that are needed during pentest to more sophisticated ones during Red Team Ops. there is a crash course about Python basics included in this course to promote you in this must-know language field.\n\n\n\n7- Linux (Kali Linux and Parrot OS)\nLinux runs the world, especially when it comes to the cybersecurity world. There is a crash course about Linux basics in this course. However, during this course and after many hours of exciting hands-on practices on the different offensive and defensive security methods you will become a Linux expert at the level of a cybersecurity expert. You will learn Kali Linux and Parrot OS as the main Linux distros used in this course.\n\n\n\n\nHere is an overview of the main content of the course:\nSections 1 to 3 are for introduction and preparation. Here you set up your offensive lab and will learn the basics of Linux to get prepared for the ethical hacking sections. You will also install Kali Linux and Microsoft Visual Studio Code as your main IDE (Integrated development environment). Then you move on to create your vulnerable labs such as dvwa, bwapp, webgoat, and so on. Also, you will do your first capture-the-flag (CTF) and create your HTB (HackTheBox dot com) account if you haven't before.\n\nYou will start your professional white hat hacking training from sections 4 to 10. Here you will learn a broad range of hacking tools, attack vectors, technics, and procedures. They start from Reconnaissance, enumeration, vulnerability scanning to exploitation, post-exploitation, password cracking. You will continue with network attacks (wired and wireless), social engineering attacks, Web applications attacks (OWASP Top 10), and much more.\n\nYou'll take your second crash course in Python in section 11. Here you learn Python geared towards IT Security and Hacking purposes.\n\nNow you have earned all the requirements, a professional hacker needs in the pentesting battlefield. In section 12, you get to know the interesting world of CTFs (Capture the Flags), especially on HackTheBox dot com and will hack 8 machines:\n3 Easy machines: BLUE, DEVEL, NETMON\n4 Medium: SNIPER, MANGO, BLUNDER, POPCORN\n1 Hard: CONTROL\nBy the end of this section, you are an ethical hacker who feels incredibly confident with penetration testing in different hacking scenarios.\n\nEverything is standardized in modern times. Giving a break to practical hacking, in section 13 you will learn the must-know security standards such as MITRE, OWASP, PTES, OSSTMM and their terminologies as well as methodologies in the IT Security field.\n\nWe did everything up to here to be a great Red Teamer, here you learn how to use all that practical ethical hacking techniques along with MITRE ATT&CK Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures to conduct a comprehensive Red Teaming assessment on your customers. In section 14 you will learn how to work based on various MITRE TTPs with a powerful Red Teaming Framework. You will also learn how to customize your C2 to be like what you want and also learn how to do various operations with it.\n\nMore than half of today's APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) are experts on active directory attacks and you as an ethical hacker or Red Teamer should also know how to do that and report vulnerabilities to your customers. In section 15 you will learn how to configure AD, create a vulnerable AD lab and perform some of the most important attacks in this category. Having this category of attacks in a separated section is because of the importance and amount of common attacks by APTs on this module in the victim’s environment.\n\nIn section 16 we tried to cover every tactic, its corresponding technique, and also the procedures behind it standardized by MITRE ATT&CK all in one. We will study most of the operations done by threat actors and APTs. Their TTPs are covered line by line and in near future, with some updates, we are going to practice every technique after its explanations. Also, most of these TTPs are covered during the course without knowing what category of TTPs it is. It is really important to stick to MITRE ATT&CK and that’s why we put a small section on it.\n\nUp to section 17, you finished your pythonic offensive security with all possible aspects. Now you are a professional and ethical hacker. From this section on, you start your defensive security journey, where the focus is mainly on defense against offensive technics and tactics you've learned up until here. In this section, you learn terminologies and methodologies such as \"Defense in Depth\" on the defensive side, where the SIEM tool is in the center of attention.\n\nIn section 18 you start building up your fully customized Linux-based and 100% open source SIEM tool using Elastic-Stack and Wazuh Manager (The Open Source Security Platform). In this section, you set up Wazuh Manager Server, Open Distro for Elasticsearch, Filebeat, and Kibana.\n\nThen in section 19, you move on to endpoints such as Windows and Linux Servers, Windows 10, and Fortigate firewall appliance, to integrate these different log sources into your ELK-Stack SIEM server. Also, you will learn how you can roll out authenticated Wazuh agents on a network of Windows machines using Domain GPOs in an automated form.\n\nSection 20 covers index management in Elasticsearch where the life cycle of the indexes will be managed. In this lecture, you will learn how to manage your accumulated alerts in your Elastic Stack to improve your server disks and storage.\n\nIn section 21 you will extend your configured SIEM with its capabilities such as File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), Linux Syscalls monitoring, Enterprise continuous vulnerability monitoring, CIS Hardening Benchmarks (SCA), Windows Defender, and Sysinternals Sysmon Eventchannel.\n\nHow one can create new alerts out of ingested logs in Wazuh Manager is the topic of section 22. In this section, you will learn how decoders and rules are constructed behind the scenes and how you can create your own custom decoders and rules for your own requirements.\n\nAnd finally, you will finish this course with hunting IoCs (threat hunting) in your fully customized SIEM. In section 23, you will run some of the attacks you have learned during the course such as Mimikatz, HTA, Brute Force, etc. from your Cobalt Strike on your Parrot OS against your endpoints (Wazuh agents) and you will examine generated alerts for these specific security events.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis course is created for educational purposes only, all the attacks are launched in our own lab or against online Lab systems that are legally permitted to run tests against them.\nThis course is totally a product of the two instructors of this course and no other organization is associated with it. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that NO OTHER ORGANISATION IS INVOLVED.",

      "description": "Welcome to the \"The Complete Social Engineering & Malware for Hacking Course\" course.\nEnroll and learn how to hack Windows, Mac OS X, Linux & Android by Using Social Engineering and how to secure yourself from hackers.\nWhether you want to get your first job in IT security, become a white hat hacker, or prepare to check the security of your own home network, Udemy offers practical and accessible ethical hacking courses to help keep your networks safe from cybercriminals.\nOur Student says that: This is the best tech-related course I've taken and I have taken quite a few. Having limited networking experience and absolutely no experience with hacking or ethical hacking, I've learned, practiced, and understood how to perform hacks in just a few days.\n\nFAQ regarding Ethical Hacking on Udemy:\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network. An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals.\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system. An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement. An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer. They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them. With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles.\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk. For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks. When a script kiddie gets angry at…\nFacebook, iPhone, Gmail, Android, SmartWatch etc. If we ask any person about these terms 15 years ago than now you would not get an answer. However, they are a big part of our life in today's world. Even we can not imagine a life without them. This easiness also brings a huge weakness. We depend on these technologies for our sensitive information. and they are just secured with just one password.\nSince most people are using the same password in most of the services. If a service is compromised or a hacker gain access to just one of our passwords all our identity, private and sensitive information can be stolen, deleted or can be used as a blackmail to us.\nHackers can access our sensitive information by phishing, vishing, social engineering, putting malware, trojan horse to our devices. By the increase in the number of platforms, there may be an enormous amount of backdoors which hackers acquire our information and exploit. Also if you write \"how to hack facebook account\" or \"how to hack a phone\" thousands of resources can be found which shows the seriousness of the situation. Hackers can also collect your sensitive information by information gathering, a.k.a. reconnaissance.\nIn this course, I will cover all aspects of social engineering with different techniques and tools. I will start with terminology and integrate it the practical usage and hand on experiences. I will emphasize import key points throughout the course. At the end of the course, you will easily understand necessary information about social engineering and take necessary precautions for yourself or for your organization.\nThis course includes the beginner levels so you don’t need to have a previous knowledge of social engineering, reverse engineering, malware, the Metasploit framework or information security. You’ll learn how to ethically apply social engineering.\n\nIn this course I tried to show the importance of using free tools and platforms, so you don’t need to buy any tool or application.\nBy registering the course you will have lifetime access the all resources, practice videos and will be able to ask questions about related topics whenever you want.\n\nHere’s just some of what you’ll learn by the end of course,\n\nUnderstand the main terminology of Social Engineering\nCreate and distribute malware\nHow open source intelligence (OSINT) can be gathered and used for hacking into systems\nHow to send fake emails\nLearn about vishing (Voice Phishing) tools and techniques\nHow to use Empire Project, MSFvenom, Veil, and TheFatRat\nAnd much, much more...\nethical\nEthical Intelligence\nnmap nessus\nnmap course\nnmap metaspolit\nComplete nmap\nKali linux nmap\nethical hacking\npenetration testing\nbug bounty\nhack\ncyber security\nkali linux\nnetwork security\nhacking\nsecurity\nsecurity testing\nnmap\nmetasploit\nmetasploit framework\npenetration testing\noscp\nsecurity testing\nwindows hacking\nexploit\nbug bounty\nbug bounty hunting\nwebsite hacking\nweb hacking\npentest+\npentest plus\nOSINT (Open Source Intelligent )\nsocial engineering\nphishing\nsocial engineering tool kit\nNetwork Security\nAlso after completion of the course, a certificate will be created for your arsenal.\nIn this course, you will find the clean and pure information. When preparing the training, we especially avoided unnecessary talk and waiting; we have found these parts for you and gotten them out.\nAs your instructor, I have over 10 years experience as a security expert. As a result of this expertise, I'm working with a handcrafted detail for creating the best and necessary content for my students. This approach also can be seen in my previous course's reviews.\n\nSee what my fellow students have to say:\n\n\"Very good experience, I always wanted such type of training which is filled with deep explanation and demo. I am interested in the security field and want to make my career in this domain, I really enjoy the learning.\" - Pragya Nidhi\n\"Easy teaching, no unnecessary statements.

With networks, a single program can regain information stored in millions of computers positioned anywhere in the world. Java is the leading programming language composed from scratch with networking in mind. Java Networking is a notion of combining two or more computing devices together to share resources.\nThe first section of our udemy course introduces the essential network terminology and concepts. The networking support that Java provides is illustrated with brief examples. A simple client/server application is presented along with a threaded version of the server. We will also cover in our udemy course how nodes on a network use addresses. How Java represents these addresses is introduced along with support for IPv4 and IPv6.\nThis section of our udemy course also covers how Java can configure various network properties. NIO Support for Networking, explains how the NIO package provides support for communication using buffers and channels. These techniques are illustrated with a client/server application. The support that NIO provides for\nasynchronous communication is also demonstrated.\nWe will also cover in our udemy course how HTTP is an important and widely-used protocol. Java provides support for this protocol in a variety of ways.\nThese techniques are illustrated along with a demonstration of how cookies are handled in Java. We will also cover in our udemy course how peer-to-peer networks provide a flexible alternative to the traditional client/server architecture. The basic peer-to-peer concepts are introduced along with demonstrations of how Java supports this architecture. FreePastry is used to illustrate one open source peer-to-peer solution framework.\nWe will discuss about UDP and Multicasting and how it provides provides a less reliable but more efficient way for applications to communicate across the Internet. Java's extensive support for this protocol is demonstrated, including NIO support, and how UDP can support streaming media. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Scalability, I will explain how, as more demands are placed on a server,  systems need to scale to address these demands. Several threading techniques supporting this need are demonstrated, including thread pools, futures, and the NIO's selector. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Security, you’ll learn how applications need to protect against a variety of threats. This is supported in Java using encryption and secure hashing techniques. Symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques are illustrated. In addition, the use of TLS/SSL is demonstrated. We will also cover in our udemy course covers how Java applications may need to exchange information with other applications that are written in different languages. The issues that impact an application's interoperability are examined, including byte order. Communication between different implementations is demonstrated using sockets and middleware.\nAll the Java program communications over the network are done at the application layer. The java . net package of the J2SE APIs comprises various classes and interfaces that execute the low-level communication features, enabling the user to formulate programs that focus on resolving the problem. The Java platform is highly regarded in part because of its suitability for writing programs that use and interact with the resources on the Internet and the World Wide Web(WWW). In fact, Java-compatible browsers use this ability of the Java platform to the extreme to transport and run applets over the Internet.\nJava is a premier language for network programming.  java . net package encapsulate large number of classes and interface that provides an easy-to use means to access network resources. Here are some important classes and interfaces of java . net package.\nSocket is the foundation of modern networking, a socket allows single computer to serve many different clients at once. Socket establishes connection through the use of port, which is a numbered socket on a particular machine. Socket communication takes place via a protocol. Socket provides a communication mechanism between two computers using TCP . There are two kinds of TCP sockets in Java. One is for server and the other is for client.",

      "description": "Warning\nBefore enrolling in the course, please read the following carefully.\nDon't enroll in the course just out of curiosity.  This course is not for everyone. OSINT requires a special mindset, including analytical abilities, flexibility of thinking and patience.  If you suppose to find in the course a magic button that'll give you an ability to find everything about anyone in a click, you'll be disappointed. You'll find many OSINT tools in the course but none of them is a magic button.  In any OSINT investigation, you should use a bunch of different tools to get the result you need.  Depending on circumstances, some tools can give you fantastic results,  some can be helpful and others won't work at all. This is how OSINT really works.  It's not just about tools, it's about your thinking and creativity in using them.\nLet's be honest, not so many people are appropriate to working in the intelligence sector, be it the physical or the digital world.\nBut if you feel you're one of those extraordinary people, I'm glad to welcome you. Let's see what exactly you'll gain from taking this course.\nThe course description\nInformation is the king today. If you have it, you’ll be able to make the right decisions and win. If not, you will be taken advantage of and lose. It relates to any area of your life – business, work, family, relationship and, especially, security.\nWouldn’t it be dreamy if you were able to get the truth about your business partners? Spot scammers before they have ripped you off? Locate a bully that pursues you or your child in social media? Find a criminal? Be sure a person you speak with does not lie to you? Get the darkest secrets of a company that deceived you? Gain information that helps you to get the job of your dream or get along with your boss? Have powerful leverage in negotiations? And even find the college sweetheart you’ve never met since then?\nYou’ll be able to do every item of the list and even much more after taking my course. And, more of that, you'll be able to get paid good money for finding information of such kind for other people/companies who don’t know the OSINT secrets revealed in this course.\nAnd what are these techniques exactly? Here you go.\n\n\nWhat the course covers\nSection 1, “Going undercover” is about your security, privacy and anonymity. You’ll know how you can be (and, in fact, constantly is) tracked on the Internet and how to prevent it. You’ll find out why a VPN does not provide you with total anonymity and what to do with this issue. Then we’ll learn how to harden your browser and test it for privacy so you can be sure you’re protected from adversaries' eyes. You’ll get a pack of tools and tricks that will let you feel sure no one is after you. You’ll set up search engines that don’t track you. And ultimately, have a browser James Bond would appreciate.\n\n\nIn Section 2, “Recruiting Intelligence Sources” you’ll get to know with the OSINT investigation chain and learn to use it. We’ll consider how to obtain plenty of valued information about a target having only its IP- address, name, email, phone number or image. You’ll gain various techniques for analyzing, tracing and combining these items to dig out the data hidden in them. And more of that, you'll be able to detect a faked image with digital forensics tools. Of course, any theory means almost nothing without practice, so I’ll demonstrate a real-life example of catching a gang of scammers with these techniques for you to be sure they really work.\n\n\nIn Section 3, “How to make search engines talk”, you’ll learn how to ask search engine questions they won't able to ignore. You’ll get to know with the special search engine language – advanced operators - and be able to gain information that 98% of people will never do. And it’s not only about Google. You’ll also learn some special search engines that can be used to find the exact information you look for. And you’ll even know how to recover information from websites that were closed and destroyed years ago. Of course, you’ll find an example of using these techniques in a real-life situation. This time you’ll know the compelling story of spotting the bully in social media and revealing a two-tongue politician.\n\n\nIn Section 4, \"How to interrogate social networks\", you’ll learn the tools and techniques to extract floods of information about your targets, be it a person or a company, from social networks. We’ll discuss Twitter advanced search operators and you'll be surprised how much information can be obtained with them. You’ll learn how to dig into LinkedIn deeply. Find out how to reveal the real name of a person hidden under a nickname account. Know what valued data you can obtain from Facebook even after they blocked its Graph Search. Finally, you’ll get the story that demonstrates how to spot a criminal using his pictures on Instagram. And there is even more stunning case: how internet-trolls that interfered in the US election were spotted on Twitter. And you’ll be able to use this strategy to discover any group of trolls.\n\n\nFinally, in Section 5, “Loading heavy guns”, you’ll get to know with the favorite tool of many OSINT investigators – Maltego. We’ll combine the OSINT investigation chain we’ve learned in Section 2  with the powerful capabilities of Maltego. You’ll know how to build connections between IP addresses, domain names, persons’ names, emails and phone numbers to create visual graphs like those you see in popular movies about police or intelligence work. Thus, your ability to conduct investigations will skyrocket and help you to get insights by seeing the big picture. And you’ll be able to get a bunch of information about a person or a company in a couple of clicks.\nThe art of OSINT is not about techniques and tools only. First of all, it’s about mindset and strategies. In the last video of the course, I’ll give some useful advice about these factors, for you to know how to build your OSINT investigations to get the best results.\nUltimately, you’ll find a bonus video. Let it be a pleasant surprise for you.\n\n\nWho this course is for\nThis course is for everyone who wants to get more information to make the right decisions, avoid losses and secure their assets. Creating this course, I had in mind in the first place security-related professionals: private investigators, law enforcement officers, journalists, HRs, penetration testers, ethical hackers, state and business intelligence specialists and so on.\nBut in reality, I’m sure that everyone needs to have these skills because OSINT techniques will help anyone in the usual life. For example, these techniques will be extremely helpful when you try to hire a nurse for your kid or starving to get a job in the company of your dream. In the first case OSINT techniques will help to avoid hiring a bad person; in the second they’ll raise your odds to get the job.\nThat’s why I aimed to create a unique OSINT course. Firstly, I left aside the dullest theoretical parts to make the course powerfully hands-on. That means you can use all these techniques right after you’ve learned them. Secondly, the course does not require any special IT knowledge. Unlike other OSINT courses, it even does not require learning Linux. I specially picked up the tools that are available for anyone but at the same time are extremely effective.",

      "description": "Join Author Tyler Wall and Presenter Michael Archuleta in this course for the next evolution in cybersecurity skilling based on the popular book Cloud Security Career Handbook: A beginner's guide to starting and succeeding in Cloud Security by Timothy Isle.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\n\nCloud Computing as a trend has grown leaps and bounds in recent years since the pandemic hit. The cloud is also the driving force behind red-hot technologies like Artificial Intelligence and thus one of the safest career bets one can make for the future. There is a huge shortage of cloud professionals across the globe and an even bigger shortage of cloud security professionals. It is understandable as making the transition from on-prem to a cloud security model can be overwhelming for newcomers and even experienced cyber-security people who are looking at this topic for the first time. A few years ago, I was in the same problem as I realized that my on-prem skills simply did not translate into the cloud and most of what I knew had to be broken down and re-learned for a cloud environment. Although not happy at first to be starting over; I quickly realized that while different; security in the cloud was also faster and more efficient than on-prem (provided it was done correctly!)\n\n\nThrough a lot of trial and error, I discovered the best techniques to learn the cloud and secure it. This course is a lecture based and hands-on collection of all that experience so you can benefit from it without jumping through all the hoops I had to jump through.\n\n\nThis course WILL:\n\n\nTeach you the fundamentals of Cloud in general and Cloud Security including a deep dive into the Cloud Security Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and Cloud Deployment Models (Public, Private, Community, Hybrid, Multi)\nTeach you about the Cloud Service Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba, IBM..etc), their popularity ranked and strengths.\nTeach you about the various tooling you'll need to be familiar with (CWPP, CSPM, CIEM, CASB, CSPM, SSO)\nTeach you about what cybersecurity risks are inherent and specific to the Cloud (Lack of Cloud Security Skills, Misconfigurations, Increased Attack Surface, Lack of Focus on Identity, Lack of Standardization and Visibility, Data Leakage, Data Privacy/Sovereignty, Incident Response)\nShow you the different cloud security career paths that are present and which one is the easiest for you to transition into (Cloud Security Engineer/Architect/Manager)\nTeach you about the biggest certifications and their strengths and weaknesses with strategy on how to pass them (CCSK, CCSP, AWS Certified Specialty - Security, Azure Security Engineer, Google Cloud Security Engineer)\nGuide you on getting that valuable multi-cloud security experience without having an enterprise environment to practice\nGet you hands-on with Terraform and Serverless functions in both AWS and Azure.\nGet you hands-on with checking Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for misconfigurations with an open source static code analysis tool (Checkov).\n* Please see the learning objectives for a full list of topics that we cover\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier; cloud adoption has exploded over the past couple of years with numerous companies transitioning into a hybrid or fully cloud environment. With the economic ups and downs that keep happening and in this post-pandemic world, companies are no longer interested in the hassle of maintaining data centers and hardware.\n\n\nThis rapid increase has also meant that skills have NOT kept pace resulting in a huge shortage of qualified cloud professionals.\n\n\nIf you are still not convinced, then consider the blow three points:\n\n\nCloud is not going away anytime soon\nCloud Security skills WILL replace on-prem skills\nCyber-criminals are already using the cloud\n\n\nFollow along with us in this course as we start from square one and work our way from high level fundamental and management concepts right down to what tools you'll be working with, certifications you'll need, interview questions to be prepared for, and getting hands-on with the skills you'll need to be successful.\n\n\nWhat is included:\n\n\n- High Quality Lectures\n- Practice Quizzes and Test\n- Hands-On Assignments\n- Certificate and Badge\n\n\nNo Risk: Preview videos from the course now for FREE, and enjoy a 30-day money-back guarantee when you enroll - zero risk, unlimited payoff! And, we've made this course easy to afford so anyone can get started now!",

      "description": "Welcome to my comprehensive course on Bug Bounty Hunting & Web Security Testing course. This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge, it starts with you from scratch and takes you step-by-step to an advanced level, able to discover a large number of bugs or vulnerabilities (including the OWASP top 10) in any web application regardless of the technologies used in it or the cloud servers that it runs on.\n\n\nThis course is highly practical but doesn't neglect the theory, we'll start with basics to teach you how websites work, the technologies used and how these technologies work together to produce these nice and functional platforms that we use everyday. Then we'll start hacking and bug hunting straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by discovering security bugs and vulnerabilities, no boring dry lectures.\n\n\nThe course is divided into a number of sections, each aims to teach you a common security bug or vulnerability from the OWASP top 10 most common security threats. Each section takes you through a number of hands-on examples to teach you the cause of the security bug or vulnerability and how to discover it in a number of scenarios, from simple to advanced. You'll also learn advanced techniques to bypass filters and security measures. As we do this I will also introduce you to different hacking and security concepts, tools and techniques. Everything will be taught through examples and hands-on practicals, there will be no useless or boring lectures!\n\n\nAt the end of the course I will take you through a two hour pentest or bug hunt to show you how to combine the knowledge that you acquired and employ it in a real-life scenario to discover bugs and vulnerabilities in a real website! I will show you how I approach a target, analyse it, and take it apart to discover bugs and vulnerabilities in features that most would think are secure!\n\n\nAs mentioned you'll learn much more than just how to discover security bugs in this course, but here's a list of the main security bugs and vulnerabilities that will be covered in the course:\n\n\nInformation Disclosure.\nIDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference).\nBroken Access Control .\nDirectory / Path Traversal.\nCookie Manipulation.\nCSRF (Client-Side Request Forgery).\nOAUTH 2.0.\nInjection Vulnerabilities.\nCommand Injection.\nBlind Command Injection.\nHTML Injection.\nXSS (Cross-Site Scripting).\nReflected, Stored & DOM Based XSS.\nBypassing Security Filters.\nBypassing CSP (Content Security Policy).\nSQL Injection.\nBlind SQLi.\nTime-based Blind SQLi.\nSSRRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).\nBlind SSRF.\nXXE (XML External Entity) Injection.\n\n\nTopics:\nInformation gathering.\nEnd point discovery.\nHTTP Headers.\nHTTP status codes.\nHTTP methods.\nInput parameters.\nCookies.\nHTML basics for bug hunting.\nJavascript basics for bug hunting.\nXML basics for bug hunting.\nFiltering methods.\nBypassing blacklists & whitelists.\nBug hunting and research.\nHidden paths discovery.\nCode analyses .\n\n\nYou'll use the following tools to achieve the above:\nFerox Buster .\nWSL .\nDev tools.\nBurp Suite:\nBasics.\nBurp Proxy.\nIntruder (Simple & Cluster-bomb).\nRepeater.\nCollaborator.\n\n\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\nCheckout the curriculum and the course teaser for more info!",

      "description": "This training will teach you how to install Asterisk in an Ubuntu Server, build a complete, fully functional PBX with basic and advanced features.\nAsterisk is a great opportunity for thousands of developers, resellers, system integrators, ITSPs, contact centers and small to large companies. You will have the freedom to deliver your own solutions. No more time spent discussing complicated licensing schemes. In our region 9 out of 10 Contact Centers use Asterisk do deliver its services.\nA large amount of students who took our classes are now providing services or founded companies to work with Asterisk, Many of them developed dialers, call centers and other applications. Other students grew their businesses by  leasing Asterisk boxes as a service, many in the cloud.  There are many opportunities for professionals with Asterisk knowledge and experience. From 2005 to 2018 we have taught more than 2500 students at VOffice.\nAsterisk is about generating real life results, the cost per T1/E1 port is less than 20% of the incumbents. You won't pay a penny for features such as Interactive Voice Response, VoiceMail, Fax, Queues and Computer Telephony Integration.\nAsterisk is much easier than you think, any person with a small knowledge in Linux is capable to build a complete PBX.\n\nThe reason I jumped at Asterisk in 2004 was that I was frustrated with the cost of proprietary IP PBXs. I was upset by our vendors forcing us to invest thousands of dollars to sell their products controlling the market. I wanted to deliver for my customers, the best, the simplest and be the real trusted advisor, not only the sales pitcher. Sorry,  I can't sell what I don't believe.   I decided to investigate Asterisk and from the moment I installed at the first time, I knew it would lead to a revolution in telephony. Asterisk is not only a PBX, it is a sophisticated phone system. With Asterisk you can build PBXs, Voicemail servers, ITSP providers, Contact Centers and Application Servers.\nI decided to write a book and it was published in 2005, named \"Configuration Guide for Asterisk PBX\", translated to Portuguese and Spanish. After this experience, I got my dCAP (Digium Certified Asterisk Professional) in 2006, easily passing the test in the first attempt. Since then, Asterisk has become an important source of work and income. We have installed hundreds of systems. I have actually created a new company called SipPulse Routing and Billing Solutions for SIP based on the experience with Asterisk and OpenSIPS.\nThis training covers some of the most recent developments of Asterisk such as the version 15 and  chan_pjsip.\nWhat is the promise of this training:\nBy the end of this training you will be able to:\nInstall an Asterisk box from scratch compiling the source code\nConnect your Asterisk to ITSPs and phone companies using SIP trunks\nBuild a complete PBX with IVRs, Voicemail, Follow Me and Conference Rooms\nActivate music on hold\nTransfer, Capture and Park calls\nUse Asterisk behind NAT in a cloud such as AWS\nUse clients behind NAT\nLearn to develop advanced dialplans\nGenerate a CDR in a database\nDeploy the required security to avoid being hacked in the first week",

The course enables students to setup a secure base from scratch or review an existing security skeleton for their IT environments. The course targets the IT security beginners as well as professionals to enrich their knowledge about cyber security and to pursue their career in such field. The course material is based on my understanding of several IT security curricula such as SANS, CEH, etc..\nThe course is meant to be brief to fit security specialists, IT admins, and developers\nIt is imperative that all of any organization personnel be trained on the proper cybersecurity procedures. Staff should be aware of potential cyber interference or hacking attempts, and this is what is offered in this course as awareness and knowledge.\nMany times cyber threats come from partners within your supply-chain network. In order to increase efficiency in the logistics industry, you and those in your network must access shared online platforms. Therefore, you need to be cognizant of new vulnerabilities that may arise. Even though you cannot control others’ security measures, you can choose to work with partners that conduct regular security audits or have external security certifications. You could also devise a contract that requires your partners to adhere to basic cybersecurity measures and that is what this course tries to help you to plan and figure out the right way to do.",

      "description": "Welcome to this advanced network hacking course, this course is designed to build up on what you already know about network hacking, therefore I recommend finishing the network hacking section of my general ethical hacking course or finishing my network hacking course before starting this one.\n\n\nJust like all of my other courses, this course is highly practical, but it will not neglect the theory, since this is an advanced course we will be breaking each attack into its smaller components and understand how each of these components work, therefore by the end of the course you will be able to mix these attacks and adopt them to suit different situations and different scenarios, you will also learn how to write your own man in the middle scripts to implement your own attacks. You will learn everything by example in real world practical scenarios, no boring dry lectures.\n\n\nBecause this course builds on what you learn in the courses mentioned above, the main sections here have similar titles to the main sections in these courses, but the topics covered here are more advanced.\n\n\nThis course is divided into three main sections:\nPre-Connection Attacks - in this section you will learn how to extend the pre-connection attacks you already know, for example you will learn how to run these attacks against networks and clients that use 5Ghz and extend the deauthentication attack to target multiple clients and multiple networks at the same time.\nGaining Access - In this section you will learn a number of advanced techniques to gain access to various network configurations and various network encryptions. First you will learn how to overcome some security features that would prevent you from even trying any attacks, you will learn how to discover and target hidden networks and bypass MAC filtering whether it is implemented using a black-list or a white-list. As you go through all of the lectures in this section, you will learn how to manually configure and create a fake access point, you will understand exactly how it works and the services it relies on, therefore by the end of this section you will be able to create custom fake access points to suit your needs. You will be able to create fake captive portals, steal WPA/WPA2 passwords or use it to spy on clients that connect to it. This section is divided into a number of subsections each covering a specific topic:\nCaptive Portals - captive portals are open networks that require users to login after connecting to it, they are usually used in hotels and airports. In this subsection you will learn three methods to hack captive portals.\nWEP Cracking - Even though this is an old and weak encryption, this is still used in some networks and you can not call yourself a hacker if you can not crack it, by now you should know how to rack WEP if OPEN authentication is used, in this section you will learn how to gain access to WEP networks that use Shared Key Authentication (SKA) as all of the methods that you learned so far will NOT work against SKA.\nWPA & WPA2 cracking - In this section you will learn more advanced techniques to gain access to WPA & WPA2 networks, this section is divided into even smaller subsections:\nExploiting WPS - in this subsection you will learn how to debug reaver's output and exploit the WPS feature on more routers using reaver's advanced options, you will also learn how to unlock some routers if they lock after a number of failed attempts.\nAdvanced Wordlist Attacks - in this subsection you will learn how to run more advanced wordlist attacks, this will increase your chances of cracking the key; you will learn how to use huge wordlists without wasting storage, save the cracking progress so that you can pause and resume and crack the key much faster using the GPU instead of the CPU.\nEvil Twin Attack - Finally if none of the above methods work, the last resort is to use social engineering to get the key, in this subsection you will learn how to get the password for a target WPA/WPA2 network using social engineering, without guessing and without using a wordlist.\nWPA & WPA2 Enterprise - These networks are usually used in companies and colleges, these are secure networks that use WPA or WPA2 but also require users to login with a username and password after connecting, in this subsection you will understand how they work and how to hack them.\nPost-Connection Attacks - In this section you will learn a number of advanced attacks that you can run after connecting to a network. All of the attacks in this subsection work against WiFi and ethernet networks, you will learn how to manually bypass HTTPS and capture sensitive data, you will be able to use this method regardless of how you became the man in the middle so you will be able to use it with any scenario or situation when interesting data is flowing through your computer. You will also learn how to inject javascript/HTML in HTTPS websites, bypass router-side security and run ARP poisoning attacks without raising any alarms. You will also learn how to manually analyse data flows and build your own MITM attack ideas. Not only that but I will also teach you how to write your own scripts to execute your own MITM attacks. By the end of this section you will learn the right methodology of building your own attack, you'll learn how to analyse network flows, run a simple test, translate that into a working script that implements your attack, and finally test that script against a remote computer.\nFinally at the end of the course you will learn how to protect yourself and your systems from these attacks.\n\n\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis course is created for educational purposes only and all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against devices that I have permission to test.\nThis course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih & zSecurity, no other organization is associated with it or a certification exam. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that NO OTHER ORGANIZATION IS INVOLVED.",

My goal is to show you how to complete a security Assessment and Authorization process (also known as system A&A). If you don’t know what all those terms mean, don’t worry, we will break it all down in this course.\nI like to cater to beginners, because well… I used to be one. So before we get into FISMA compliance, chapter 1 will  teach you some foundation IT concepts. I do this by getting you to understand what an enterprise network is and what is takes to support one.\nAfter that I’m going to show you how to draft an System Security Plan (SSP), How to assess the SSP, document your POA&M and submit your authorization package. These are key components to completing the RMF process.\nThis course is taught from a true to life approach. That means that I put you in a simulated work environment where you’re the security analyst working with me on our system A&A project. I did this because I think that’s the best way for you retain the information you will learn in this course.\nOh! And since we’re dealing with security compliance, it can start to feel a bit monotone at times, so I try to throw in a few jokes here and there to make sure you’re alert and keeping up. Some people call my jokes corny, others call them dad jokes. I call them funny! You be the judge.\nOk, enough talking let’s get to work. Fasten your keyboard, we’re blasting off to FISMA!",

Learn \"Cisco Nexus Training: Go from Beginner to Advanced!\" in a way that will advance your career and increase your knowledge, all in a fun and practical way!\nHere are some of the users who appreciated the course with below comments\nAjaz Ahmed - One of the finest course on Udemy for learning Cisco Nexus Devices, the Instructor ( Ashish ) used his best way to explain everything about Nexus which you can find in Production Networks. I was just a beginner when I started this, but after completing this course, I got a very good grip / Knowledge on Nexus Family. The instructor is always ready to clear your doubts. I insist ,if anyone wants to learn about Cisco Nexus, then this course is FOR YOU!!Thanks Ashish for the course, the way you explain it just OUTSTANDING.\n\nJustin Swanson - Exceptional course put on by Ashish. I just started having to configure some Nexus switches at work; mainly 3500 series but the concepts, etc. are the same. I gave 4 stars at first as some of the drawings/handwriting using MS paint are a bit messy, but after continuing through the course, the content far outweighs this. I especially like in the vPC portion that he doesn't just go over a configuration once and the subsequent expects you remember it all already; he really drills into your head all the necessary steps. I would whole heartedly recommend for anyone interested in learning NX-OS and its features.\n\nCyrus Ramirez  - Excellent detail.. Real world information. I've used these videos to help me with my day to day work in my nexus environment. Thank you\n\nSandeep Prajapati - It's a Good Overview course of nexus 5K, 7K learning. Trainer is skilled pretty good & enough.\nI wish this could have been in more details. But over all it's a nice one for grabbing a fair understanding to pick up the other advanced learning materials comfortably.\nRon Ferriolo - I thought the course was very good. It was much more than just an overview of Nexus. It contained theory, detailed configuration, and numerous show command outputs from beginning-to-end including many real world scenarios such as installing, updating, and backing up license files. There was a lot of emphasis on vPC & FabricPath configuration and troubleshooting which will be the focus of any interview. There were also several \"show\" commands that I never encountered in my CCIE Data Center studies. I would recommend this course to anyone, whether they have studied Nexus previously or not. If you have access to Nexus physical or virtual devices, the course will be even that much more valuable. Hopefully there will be more to follow.\n\nTim Pastick - Love it have been working on Nexus switches for 6 months now in a production environment and never had one show me so much useful information behind the scenes. Normally just adding port-profiles etc.\nDarby Weaver -  Excellent Review Course. Clear Essentials. Much needed. Thanks Darby Weaver The Cisco Network Architect\nDevinder Sharma - Excellent course at great price. The OS version used is bit old based on what is best available to him ,and instructor can add a slide lecture, without actual configuration tutorial, highlighting the new features in versions 7 and 8 as well as mention newer platforms like 7700 and 9000 and new line cards. Overall great product.\nIf you have any issues or questions, send it to me or ask in course forum. I will jump to assist you.",

The best part is you can practice using GNS3 and Cumulus VX locally on your laptop!\nCumulus Linux combines the power of Open Networking with a network operating system that runs on top of industry standard networking hardware from vendors such as Dell, HP, Quanta and others. Founded by veteran networking engineers from Cisco and VMware, Cumulus Networks makes the first Linux operating system for networking hardware and fills a critical gap in realizing the true promise of the software-defined data center. Just as Linux completely transformed the economics and innovation on the server side of the data center, Cumulus Linux is doing the same for the network. It is radically reducing the costs and complexities of operating modern data center networks for service providers and businesses of all sizes.\nBy providing a software-only solution, Cumulus Linux is enabling disaggregation of data center switches akin to the x86 server hardware/software disaggregation. Data-center networking is rapidly standardizing on merchant silicon and with Cumulus Linux, networking is adopting the principals of Linux and disaggregation of the compute world.\nOutline\nCumulus Linux Introduction\n* Why you should consider using white box switching\n* What is disaggregation?\n* Is Cumulus Linux actually Linux?\n* Demonstrations\nGNS3 and Cumulus VX\n* Download Cumulus Linux VX\n* Import OVAs into GNS3\n* Configure OVAs for use with GNS3\n* Create a lab topology using Cumulus Linux switches and VPCS\n* Configure VLANs\n* Test the network\nInitial Setup\n* ONIE and physical switches\n* Basic set up\n* Demonstration\nLayer 2 Features\n* Configure switch interfaces\n* Demonstration\n* Network Tools\n* Demonstration\nConfigure Routing\n* Configure OSPF using multiple methods\n* Demonstration\nNetwork Automation using Ansible\n* Automation overview\n* Ansible options\n* Demonstration\nImage Management - Physical switches\n* How to upgrade a switch\n* Demonstration\nNote: this course is not endorsed by or sponsored by Cumulus Networks.

      "description": "Every company is a software company, and it' becoming more difficult to secure applications.\nIn an era where cyber threats are ever-evolving and increasingly sophisticated, securing applications from the ground up is more essential than ever. This course is a robust, all-encompassing course designed to equip software developers, and security professionals with the knowledge and tools necessary to protect their applications throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).\nThis course begins by introducing participants to foundational security concepts such as \"Defense in Depth,\" where we explore the anatomy of attacks, including vulnerabilities, exploits, and payloads, using real-world examples like the \"PrintNightmare\" vulnerability. We will examine how to implement multiple layers of security to build a comprehensive defense strategy against these threats. As participants progress, they will gain a deep understanding of essential security principles, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), alongside key practices for managing authentication, authorization, and session management.\nA significant portion of the course is dedicated to modern challenges in application security, such as API security. Participants will learn how Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) function within web applications, the risks they pose, and the strategies to secure them effectively. This includes a deep dive into industry standards and frameworks like the OWASP Top 10, which highlight the most critical security risks to web applications today. We’ll explore the nuances of implementing robust security controls, risk rating methodologies such as those from NIST, FAIR, OWASP, and CIS RAM, and how to develop and enforce these controls to counteract various security threats.\nParticipants will also delve into advanced topics like software supply chain security, ensuring the integrity of software from development to deployment. The course covers the full spectrum of vulnerability management, from identification and evaluation to remediation and reporting, providing participants with the skills needed to maintain the security and integrity of IT systems continuously.\nA thorough exploration of cryptographic techniques, including hashing, encryption (both symmetric and asymmetric), and the use of digital certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), will be provided to ensure that participants can protect sensitive data and secure communications effectively. We will cover JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Signatures (JWS) to illustrate how these technologies are used to secure data transmissions in web applications.\nAs the course progresses, participants will explore the critical integration of security within the DevOps process, known as DevSecOps. Here, we emphasize the importance of embedding security practices early and continuously throughout the development lifecycle. We’ll examine the security of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, understanding how to secure these processes against unauthorized access, code tampering, and other threats. Participants will learn to implement security testing tools, including Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST), Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP), Web Application Firewalls (WAF), and more!\nMoreover, the course will cover emerging areas like Application Security Posture Management (ASPM), which offers a comprehensive view of the security health of software applications by integrating various security practices and tools. This holistic approach ensures that organizations can manage vulnerabilities, configuration weaknesses, and compliance with security policies across the entire application lifecycle.\nPractical demonstrations and hands-on activities will allow participants to apply what they’ve learned in real-world scenarios. From exploring attack trees and threat modeling techniques to conducting penetration tests and leveraging tools like CodeQL for secure coding, participants will gain valuable experience in identifying, mitigating, and responding to security threats.\nBy the end of this course, participants will have developed a deep, nuanced understanding of application security. They will be able to integrate security practices seamlessly into the SDLC, ensuring their applications are not only functional but resilient and secure against the full spectrum of cyber threats. Whether you're a seasoned security professional or a developer new to application security, this course will empower you with the knowledge and skills to build and maintain secure, reliable software in today’s digital landscape.",

and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing :\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results\nHere is the list of what you’ll learn by the end of

      "description": "Welcome to my Kali Linux Web App Pentesting Labs course!  This course will be 100% hands-on, focusing specifically on exploitation of vulnerable web applications. We’ll be building a lab environment consisting of Kali Linux, and several intentionally vulnerable web applications including Beebox, SQL injection labs, OWASP Juice Shop, and WebGoat.\nThrough the duration of this course, we’ll be focusing upon the most prevalent web application vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. As a framework for our learning approach, we’ll be using the most recent version of OWASP at the time of this recording, which is OWASP 2017 top 10. OWASP is an organization which focuses upon improving the security of web applications and is a fundamental and necessary component to learn for aspiring pentesters. We'll be covering OWASP 1-9, because 10 does not apply specifically to pentesting, and is focused on the defensive side. Additionally, we'll be covering each of these in great detail over this course.\nThe primary topics within this course are both manual and automated methods of detection and exploitation of web application web application vulnerabilities. You'll be getting hands-on exposure to industry standard tools such as Burpsuite, Nmap, Nikto, Sqlmap, and many more. From what I've seen over the years in cybersecurity academia, including certifications, hands-on skills are highly lacking, save for the offensive security certs. This is because the majority of courses I've seen only teach theory, and have students prove their competency through writing and answering multiple choice questions. This does not prepare one for the real world, especially for pentesting where technical skills are paramount. This course aims to bridge that gap.\nThe beginning of this course will consist of downloading, installing, and configuring the components necessary for comprehensive hands-on web application penetration testing in a lab environment. Please get ready to hit the ground running and follow along with these labs, as we’ll be getting started right away in the subsequent lecture.\nI really look forward to working with all of you. If you have any questions during any of the labs, please feel free to reach out to me directly with the messaging system or Q&A section.",

Combining Zaid's experience in ethical hacking and teaching over 1 million students world wide, with Saad's amazing and focused OSINT skills.\n\n\nThis course will teach you how to use Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather information about anything. With no prior knowledge required, this course takes you from a beginner to an expert at performing advanced OSINT techniques, giving you the ability to gather information about individuals, companies, email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, physical locations, images and more.\n\n\nJust like our other courses, this course is highly practical, but it won't neglect the theory. We'll start with the basics of open-source intelligence, then we'll dive and start using OSINT to investigate people, companies and individual pieces of information straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by gathering real information online — no boring dry lectures. By the end of the course, you will be an expert in open-source intelligence (OSINT).\n\n\nTo achieve this the course is divided into a number of sections,  each aims to teach you a specific OSINT technique. You'll first learn what is OSINT, why it is used, and who uses it. Then you'll learn how to use OSINT to find real information about targets, starting with just one piece of information (such as a name, email, username) and discovering all kinds of linked information such as hidden accounts, phone numbers, social media presence, leaked information, passwords and much more.\n\n\nAs we proceed, you will be introduced to different OSINT methodologies, tools, and techniques. Everything will be taught through examples and hands-on practicals—no useless or boring lectures!\n\n\nAll the techniques in this course are practical and work against real targets, you'll understand how to investigate each piece of information individually. Therefore by the end of the course you'll be able to start with any piece of information and carry out a full investigation to uncover rated data and information.\nBy the end of the course, you'll be able to modify these techniques to launch more sophisticated OSINT investigations and adapt them to suit different situations and scenarios.\n\n\nHere are some of the topics that will be covered in the course:\nPeople OSINT\nUsername OSINT\nPhone OSINT\nSOCMINT - Social Media OSINT\nMaps and Satellite OSINT.\nImage OSINT\nWebsite OSINT\nSearch engines operators.\nCustom search operators.\nSearching with AI\nSetting up an OSINT virtual machine\nCreating a Sock Puppet account\nSearching for leaked / breached databases\nDownloading leaked / breached databases\nLeveraging leaked / breached databases to find sensitive information.\nFinding passwords in leaked / breached databases.\nScraping & downloading posts from Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, etc.\nFinding hidden content, posts, comments, accounts, etc.\nDiscovering linked usernames, accounts, phone numbers, emails, etc.\nTracking phone numbers, images, online accounts, etc.\nInvestigating locations with various maps and satellite services\nDiscovering subdomains, hidden website owners, linked websites and more!\nUsing people search engines\nReverse image search\nGeolocation of photos\nAI image tracking\nManual image tracking\nFacial recognition\nVoter records lookup\nSearching Wedding/Baby/Gift registries\nOSINT automation.\nWriting OSINT reports.\n\n\nYou'll use the following tools to achieve the above:\nTracelabs OSINT VM\nTrue People search engine.\nPhoneinfoga\nSherlock\nSpiderfoot\nGhunt\nHttprobe\nSublist3r\nInstaloader\nWPScan\nGoogle Dorks\nDorkGPT\nGoogle Hacking Database GHDB\nExif Tool\nDeHashed\nLeakPeek\nBreach Directory\nHave I Been Pwned\nIntelX Tools\nVirtualBox\nTrue People Search\nOSINT Industries\nCyberChef\nOpenStreetMap (OSM)\nDNSDumpster\nWayback Machine\nFOCA\nGeoSpy\nOsintracker\n\n\n\n\nOther topics:\nLinux basics\nUsing the Linux terminal\nLinux commands.\nInstalling virtual machines\n\n\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\nCheck out the curriculum and the course teaser for more info!\n\n\nNotes:\nThis is the official course to prepare you for the C|OSINT|P (certified OSINT professional) certification.\nThis course is created for educational purposes only.

One thing I added (that I haven't seen in the other courses) is summarization - this topic may not be interesting to beginners, but if you plan on getting familiar with advanced routing techniques, you may want to practice summarization.\n\n\nIP addressing is a fundamental component of computer networks - enabling devices to communicate, facilitating data transfer, and supporting the growth of the internet. It provides a unique identifier for each device, assists in routing and forwarding data, allows for network segmentation, supports various network services, and ensures scalability for the expanding number of connected devices. Without IP addressing, the internet as we know it would not be possible, thus, let's learn about it together!\n\n\nI'll be checking the Q&A section daily, so feel free to ping me if anything's unclear, or even with an assignment not related to this course.",

At that time I couldn’t find good resources to understand Operational Technology very well, Most of the time I found articles, videos, or outdated books! and they were misleading sometimes and confusing other times. And found some very expensive training that I couldn’t really afford at the time, however, out of studying, reading, hands on, and working as a Cybersecurity expert in the field of Operational Technology in the following years I found it’s really a good idea to make it easier for those who are going through the same path I had to go through, so I put this training together for you.\nThis training is about Operational Technology Fundamentals, it will give you the key to understand the different systems within OT and get you ready to leverage your IT Cybersecurity knowledge in the world of OT.\nI Will begin by explaining the basic operations, then I will discuss and explain Distributed Control Systems, following to that will cover the subject of SCADA.\nWill continue to discuss the other OT terminology and differences with IT along with explaining the OT Network and Purdue Reference Model.\n\n\nAt this point, you will have a good understanding of OT systems components and logical designs.\nThen will move into advanced subjects of OT protocols and communications, and will have deep technical dive into industrial protocol followed by several labs, and finally, in the last section, I will explain the OT Cybersecurity Controls and solutions.\n\n\nThis course will be regularly updated, and presented with more bonus and gifts videos and some interesting and advanced subjects around OT Cybersecurity.",

      "description": "We assure you that this is not a theory class. Except for this introduction, there will be no other PPTs.\nWe have designed the course in such as a way that it simulates on-the job kind of training. This course is primarily designed for the beginners/freshers in information system audit and hence we will start from basic aspects of IS audits.\nWe assure you that after completion of this training program, you will be able to independently handle the IS audits.\nFor effective and efficient audit program, we have bifurcated Information System audits into 12 step processes. For your easy understanding we have designed exclusive video for each step.\nFor each step we will guide you about data requirements, audit procedure, evidence to be evaluated and how to write the audit report.\nAlso, you can download readymade templates from resource section of this course.\nStep-wise Audit Program:\n\n\nStep 1 is about checking the information security policy. In this step, as an auditor you need to check:\n\n\no availability of the policy,\no whether policy is approved by appropriate authority?\no whether policy is updated at periodic interval and other aspect with respect to policy?\n\n\nWe will discuss in detail about how to audit and validate these controls in our step 1 video.\n\n\nStep 2 is about auditing the controls related to applications. In this step, as an auditor you need to check:\n\n\no whether application is appropriately categorized?\no Whether each application is owned by dedicated owner?\no How many factors of authentication is applied?\no Whether user access review in conducted for each application at periodic level?\n\n\nWe will discuss in detail about how to audit and validate these controls in our step 2 video.\n\n\nStep 3 is about auditing the controls related to database. We check\n\n\no whether database is appropriately categorized?\no Whether each database is owned by dedicated owner?\no Whether Operating system is updated? Organization should not be using end of life/end of support OS.\no Whether backup arrangement is appropriate?\n\n\nWe will discuss in detail how to audit and validate these controls in our step 3 video.\n\n\nStep 4 is about auditing the controls related to datacenter. You need to check\n\n\no whether datacentre is audited at periodic interval?\no Whether SLA is available for external datacentre?\no Whether secondary datacentre is at offsite location?\n\n\n\n\nStep 5 is about auditing the controls related to network devices. You need to check\n\n\no Whether device is owned by dedicated owner?\no Whether device configuration is reviewed at period interval?\n\n\nStep 6 is about auditing the controls related to endpoint devices like computers, laptops, tablets, mobile etc. You need to check\n\n\no Whether asset inventory is maintained and updated?\no Whether end point device is owned by dedicated owner?\no Whether anti-virus is installed for all the devices?\n\n\nStep 7 is about auditing the controls related to email. You need to check\n\n\no whether SPF is enabled? Don’t worry about technical terms. We will simplify the same while discussing the step 7.\no whether DMARC is enabled?\no whether attachments are scanned before downloading?\n\n\nStep 8 is about auditing the controls related to outsourcing. You need to check\n\n\no Whether service level agreement is available for the outsourced services?\no whether service provider is audited at periodic interval?\n\n\nStep 9 is about auditing the controls related to desktop security You need to check\n\n\no Whether operating system is updated and licensed?\no Whether anti-virus is installed and signatures are updated?\no Various user restrictions are implemented?\no Use of latest browsers.\n\n\nStep 10 is about auditing the controls related to BCP and Incident management. You need to check\n\n\no Whether Business Continuity Policy & Incident Management policy is available?\no Whether Business Continuity plan is tested at periodic interval?\n\n\nStep 11 is about auditing the controls related to users. You need to check\n\n\no Whether users are trained at periodic interval on information security?\no whether background verification is conducted for new hires?\n\n\n\n\nThese 11 steps cover almost all the important and critical information security requirements. As a step 12, you need to review all other checkpoints as required by the objective of audit.",

Become part of that legacy with HeapLAB.\nThe GNU C Library (GLIBC) is a fundamental part of most Linux desktop and many embedded distributions; its memory allocator is used in everything from starting threads to dealing with I/O. Learn how to leverage this vast attack surface via different heap exploitation techniques, from the original \"Unsafe Unlink\" to the beautiful overflow-to-shell \"House of Orange\".\nIn this hands-on course, students will alternate between learning new techniques and developing their own exploits based on what they've learned. We'll make use of the pwntools and pwndbg frameworks to drop shells from vulnerable practice binaries, and you'll take on challenges that test what you've learned.",

      "description": "You will learn how to secure microservices with using standalone Identity Server 4 and backing with Ocelot API Gateway. We’re going to protect our ASP.NET Web MVC and API applications with using OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect in IdentityServer4. Securing your web application and API with tokens, working with claims, authentication and authorization middlewares and applying policies, and so on.\nThis course will led you get started securing your ASP.NET based microservices applications with IdentityServer4 using OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect on distributed microservices architecture. And Also you’ll learn how to secure protected APIs backing with Ocelot API Gateway in a microservices architecture.\nCheck the overall picture\nYou can see that we will have 4 Aspnet core microservices project which we are going to develop one by one and together.\nMovies.API\nFirst of all, we are going to develop Movies.API project and protect this API resources with IdentityServer4 OAuth 2.0 implementation. Generate JWT Token with client_credentials from IdentityServer4 and will use this token for securing Movies.API protected resources.\nMovies.MVC\nAfter that, we are going to develop Movies.MVC Asp.Net project for Interactive Client of our application. This Interactive Movies.MVC Client application will be secured with OpenID Connect in IdentityServer4. Our client application pass credentials with logging to an Identity Server and receive back a JSON Web Token (JWT).\nIdentity Server\nAlso, we are going to develop centralized standalone Authentication Server and Identity Provider with implementing IdentityServer4 package and the name of microservice is Identity Server.\nIdentity Server4 is an open source framework which implements OpenId Connect and OAuth2 protocols for .Net Core.\nWith Identity Server, we can provide authentication and access control for our web applications or Web APIs from a single point between applications or on a user basis.\nOcelot API Gateway\nLastly, we are going to develop Ocelot API Gateway and make secure protected API resources over the Ocelot API Gateway with transferring JWT web tokens. Once the client has a bearer token it will call the API endpoint which is fronted by Ocelot. Ocelot is working as a reverse proxy.\nAfter Ocelot re-routes the request to the internal API, it will present the token to Identity Server in the authorization pipeline. If the client is authorized the request will be processed and a list of movies will be sent back to the client.\nAlso over these overall picture, we have also apply the Claim based authentications.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a practical understanding of how to secure .Net Microservices with IdentityServer4 using OAuth2, OpenID Connect and Ocelot Api Gateway.\nSecure Existing Microservices Architecture\nIn the last section, we will give an assignment for security operations with identity server integration for an existing microservices reference application. We had developed run-aspnetcore-microservices reference application before this course.  We will extend this application with IdentityServer OAuth 2.0 and OpenId Connect features with adding new Identity Server Microservice.\n\n\nIs this course for you?\nThis course is very practical, about 90%+ of the lessons will involve you coding along with me on this project. If you are the type of person who gets the most out of learning by doing, then this course is definitely for you.\nTools you need for this course\nIn this course all the lessons are demonstrated using Visual Studio 2019 as a code editor. You can of course use any code editor you like and any Operating system you like as long as it's Windows or Mac.",

      "description": "Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. A primary use of TLS is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers, such as web browsers loading a website. TLS can also be used to encrypt other communications such as email, messaging, and voice over IP (VOIP).\nTLS evolved from a previous encryption protocol called Secure Socket Layer (SSL), which was developed by Netscape. TLS version 1.0 actually began development as SSL version 3.1, but the name of the protocol was changed before publication in order to indicate that it was no longer associated with Netscape. Because of this history, the terms TLS and SSL are sometimes used interchangeably.\nIn this course, you will learn the skills you need to plan, implement, and maintain a public key infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem that supports SSL/TLS security certificates.\nWe'll get into how to install and configure PKI solutions in both Windows and Linux. Learn about how certificates are issued and managed throughout their lifetime; how hashing provides integrity and digital signatures provide authentication and much more in this course.",

The math or algorithm that you use to scramble the information just needs to be good enough so that other people can’t decipher your encrypted data. What could be simpler? If all you wanted to do was hide information from everyone else…this would be pretty much it.\nThe application of encryption in the real world, however, is a bit more involved. It is true that you don’t need to understand the complex math behind encryption to deploy it or use it. However, you do need to understand the various types of encryption and the implications and applications of using them.\nMy name is Paul Mahon and welcome to my hands-on course on encryption. I’ll teach you about symmetric encryption, public key encryption, digital signatures, hashing and digital certificates with SSL/TLS\nWe’ll use some basic python code and other open source applications to implement what we have learned. No worries if you’re not familiar with python – it’s a few simple lines of code. However, this will be a good application of python if you are.\nAt the end of this course you should have a thorough understanding of encryption and the importance of things like key lengths, ciphers, hashing algorithms and certificate authorities.\nThis course is designed for anyone that wants to tinker around with encryption to understand how it actually works in the real world. It’s also helpful for professionals that need to know about encryption for their job or students of information security.",

      "description": "This training is about writing secure software. We chose to deliver secure coding practices using a perspective where widespread coding security mistakes are classified into understandable chunks. We hope that this will make more sense and be more helpful to hardcore developers and analysts.\nSecurity should be an intrinsic part of any software production methodology and its implementation. However, development is a complex process and it is extremely hard to keep a software secure as it ages. There are numerous security tools, methodologies and knowledge to produce a secure software. However, still vast number of applications include critical security bugs. Most of these bugs stem from bad coding patterns that we call software security anti-patterns or in simpler term, mistakes.\nAn anti-pattern is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective or worse carry risks. In other words, anti-patterns are commonly reinvented bad solutions to problems.\nFor example, one of the most famous anti-patterns in software development is the Spaghetti Code. In early phases of being a developer, we are usually not familiar with the importance of modularity or find little time to design first. So, we tend to produce extremely complicated, hard to understand unstructured software. This way of coding produces Spaghetti Code which is hard to maintain and write test code, however, the end product may still run perfectly and serve well in production. But then it is extremely hard to adapt to any possible new changes. Since the code is not modular or structured, it is hard to add new features. Moreover, any modification to the code effects other flows in an unpredictable manner. The maintenance is also crippled since the code’s complex form will make the life of new developers’ difficult when they are adjusting.\nSimilarly, there are bad design or coding choices that repeatedly lead to security bugs. It is important to be aware of these software security anti-patterns in order not to fall prey to hackers. This course will contain eight different core mistakes. Some are more prevalent than the others, however, all of them produce deadly results. In each lesson, we will first try to explain what the specific anti-pattern is all about. Then, we will move on giving one or more demos on what can go wrong when that mistake is made. At the end of each lesson, we will look at different sound and widely acknowledged solutions against insecure design or coding choices. You will also have the opportunity to apply what you have learned by solving hands-on coding exercises prepared for various programming languages.",

Having multiple devices and having to manage them independently is inefficient and even insecure. Thanks to the functionalities that FortiManager offers us, we can centralize all the management and administration of our Fortinet equipment as well as the deployment of configurations to multiple devices with a few clicks, thus allowing not only to be more efficient and comply with the most high quality standards, it also provides us with tools when it comes to managing our teams among several employees, avoiding configuration conflicts and thus avoiding the loss of information or downtimes in our infrastructure, we can define approval workflows that allow us to see all the changes that were made through revisions and revert them in case of failure, backup centralization, locate objects and policies that are not used to maintain a clean and updated inventory, and much more! And like all my courses, this will not be the exception and will have a laboratory at no additional cost that you can install on your computer so you can practice without the need to invest in equipment using EVE-NG virtual environment.\nProduct Versions:\nFortiOS 7.X and FortiManager 7.2.0",

to be certified ethical hacker\n\nWhether you want to get your first job in IT security, become a white hat hacker, or prepare to check the security of your own home network, Oak Academy offers practical and accessible ethical hacking courses to help keep your networks safe from cybercriminals\nPenetration testing skills make you a more marketable IT tech Understanding how to exploit servers, networks, and applications means that you will also be able to better prevent malicious exploitation From website and network hacking, to pen testing in Python and Metasploit, Oak Academy has a course for you\nEthical Hacking is in demand Learn Ethical Hacking penetration testing, web hacking, Metasploit & become an ethical hacker\nWhether you want to get your first job in IT security, become a white hat hacker, or prepare to check the security of your own home network, Oak Academy offers practical and accessible ethical hacking courses to help keep your networks safe from cybercriminals\n\n68% of business leaders say cybersecurity risks are increasing As threats rise, companies are trying hard to attract and retain more IT security talent\nBut filling IT security roles is proving difficult Many businesses are facing serious recruitment challenges There are not enough qualified candidates to fill the roles needed\nThe industry faces a skills gap that looks set to increase as cyber threats rise It is predicted that there will be 3 5 million unfilled cybersecurity roles by 2021 If you are considering a career move, the skills gap represents an excellent opportunity This course is a great start for you\n\nThis course starts at beginner levels so you don’t need to have previous knowledge of Ethical Hacking In this course, we will also cover the topic of Wi-Fi Hacking because Wi-Fi hacking is easier than hacking a device connected to that WiFi There are many free tools that can hack the less secure Wi-Fi router Apart from this, there are also advanced tools that work on backtrack and can even hack Wi-Fi router with high security\nWe are going to start by figuring out what the security issues are that are currently in the field and learn testing methodologies and types Then we are going to build a lab environment for you to apply what you get from the course and of course, the lab is gone cost you nothing Then we are going to start with some theory, you know, you should have the philosophy so we can always stay on the same page\nBasic web and internet technologies such as HTML, HTTP, Document Object Model, and so on, these are absolutely needed so that we can complete the testing experience And then we are gonna cover the reconnaissance section, we will gather information about the target and how to use that information to model an attack After that, we will tackle the user management issues Apart from that, we will also try to expose the session management problems\nIn the input validation section, we are gonna show why data validation is absolutely important for web applications So attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection, and many more we are gonna examine the whole bunch of different types We also have a cryptography section with some basic attacks After that, we will discuss some known web application attacks (such as Drupal SQL injection aka Druppageddon)\nIn this course I tried to show the importance of using free tools and platforms, so you don’t need to buy any tool or application\nBy registering the course you will have lifetime access all resources, practice videos, and will be able to ask questions about related topics whenever you want\nA step by step approach will help you to track your progress on the go and learn needed skills gradually at your own pace At the end of this course, you will both have the knowledge and a practical skillset about using network scanning, finding vulnerabilities on systems, and learning the general competencies of ethical hackers\n\nFAQ regarding Ethical Hacking :\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing :\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test

      "description": "Just updated with all modern ethical hacking tools and best practices! Join a live online community of over 900,000+ students and a course taught by industry experts. This course will take you from absolute beginning of setting up your own hacking lab (like Kali Linux) on your machine, all the way to becoming a security expert that is able to use all the hacking techniques used by hackers and defend against them!\n\nWhether you are a complete beginner looking to become an ethical hacker, or you’re a student looking to learn about securing computer systems, or you are a programmer who is looking to improve their security online and prevent attacks from hackers on your website, this course will dive you into the world of hacking and penetration testing. We even teach you Python programming from scratch for those that want to learn to program their own tools for hacking and penetration testing.\n\nThis course is focused on learning by doing. We are going to teach you how hacking works by actually practicing the techniques and methods used by hackers today. We will start off by creating our hacking lab to make sure we keep your computers safe throughout the course, as well as doing things legally, and once we have our computers set up for ethical hacking, then we dive into topics like\n\n\n1. HACKING LAB - In this section we are building our own lab where we can perform our attacks. What this lab essentially is, is a virtual machine that we will use for hacking and throughout the course we also create additional virtual vulnerable machines that we can practice our attacks on. The reason we use virtual machines is because we are not allowed to test our attacks on real life websites and networks so we create our own environment to do that.\nDownloading Virtual Box and Kali Linux\nCreating Our First Virtual Machine\nInstalling Kali Linux Operating System\n5 Stages Of A Penetration Test\nNavigating Through Kali Linux System\nCreating Files and Managing Directories\nNetwork Commands and Sudo Privileges In Kali\n\n\n2. OPTIONAL: PYTHON 101 - Learn python 3 programming from scratch. This section is not mandatory and is optional for those that want to learn to programming so you are able to build your own ethical hacking tools\nLearn Python Basics\nLearn Python Intermediate\nLearn Python: Error Handling\nLearn Python: File I/O\n\n\n3. RECONNAISSANCE  - Here we learn what we call Footprinting, or in other words, Information Gathering. Once we choose our target, our first task is to gain as much information about the target as possible.\nWhat is Information Gathering\nObtaining IP Address, Physical Address Using Whois Tool\nWhatweb Stealthy Scan\nAggressive Website Technology Discovering on IP Range\nGathering Emails Using theHarvester and Hunterio\nHow To Download Tools Online\nFinding Usernames With Sherlock\nBonus Email Scraper Tool In Python 3\nMore About Information Gathering\n\n\n4. SCANNING - This is where things get real. In this section, we also gather information but we try to gather only technical information\nTheory Behind Scanning\nTCP & UDP\nInstalling Vulnerable Virtual Machine\nNetdiscover\nPerforming First Nmap Scan\nDifferent Nmap Scan Types\nDiscovering Target Operating System\nDetecting Version Of Service Running On An Open Port\nFiltering Port Range and Output Of Scan Results\nWhat is a Firewall & IDS\nUsing Decoys and Packet Fragmentation\nSecurity Evasion Nmap Options\nNote: Time To Switch Things Up!\nPython Coding Project: Port Scanner\n\n\n5. VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS - In this section we use the information that we gathered from scanning (such as softwares that the target has running on open ports) and with this information, we try to determine whether there is any known vulnerabilities.\nFinding First Vulnerability & Nmap Scripts\nManual Vulnerability Analysis and Searchsploit\nNessus Installation\nDiscovering Vulnerabilities & Nessus\nScanning Windows 7 Machine With Nessus\n\n\n6. EXPLOITATION and GAINING ACCESS  - This is the exciting part of the course. This is where we attack and gain access to the target machines. Throughout this section, we will be covering many different vulnerabilities and different targets. We perform these attacks on our virtual machines and cover another really important tool for an ethical hacker: Metasploit Framework. The goal of exploitation is to get on that target machine. This means we must drop a payload on that target machine so we can use it to navigate through their systems, look through their files, execute anything we want, and delete anything we want without the target knowing anything about it. We will also learn to create our own Viruses and Trojans that we can deliver to the target whether through an email or through an USB.\nWhat is Exploitation\nWhat is a Vulnerability\nReverse Shells and Bind Shells\nMetasploit Framework Structure\nMsfconsole Basic Commands\nOur First Exploit with vsftp 2.3.4 Exploitation\nMisconfigurations Happen with Bindshell Exploitation\nInformation Disclosure with Telnet Exploit\nSoftware Vulnerability with Samba Exploitation\nAttacking SSH with Bruteforce Attack\nExploitation Challenge with 5 Different Exploits\nExplaining Windows 7 Setup\nEternal Blue Attack Windows 7 Exploitation\nDoublePulsar Attack Windows Exploit\nBlueKeep Vulnerability  Windows Exploit\nRoutersploit\nRouter Default Credentials\nSetting Up Vulnerable Windows 10\nCrashing Windows 10 Machine Remotely\nExploiting Windows 10 Machine Remotely\nGenerating Basic Payload With Msfvenom\nAdvance Msfvenom Usage\nGenerating Powershell Payload Using Veil\nTheFatRat Payload Creation\nHexeditor and Antiviruses\nMaking Our Payload Open An Image\n\n\n\n\n7. POST EXPLOITATION - This is what comes after Exploitation. Post exploitation is what we do on the target machine after we have exploited it. Since we are on that machine we can do many things depending on what we want to get out from it. At the end, after we do all of the things we wanted, we want to make sure we cover our tracks by deleting any event logs or deleting any evidence that we were ever on that machine.\nPost Exploitation Theory\nMeterpreter Basic Commands\nElevating Privileges With Different Modules\nCreating Persistence On The Target System\nPost Exploitation Modules\nPython Coding Project Backdoor\n\n\n8. WEBSITE PENETRATION TESTING - This is another big topic for an ethical hacker. In this section, we are mainly targeting websites and their bugs or vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be anything from misconfigurations, SQL Injections (us interacting with the database), Information Disclosures (having access to some information by mistake which shouldn't be out there), Command Injection  (directly interacting with the system through the webpage),  XSS (Cross Site Scripting Attack and Injecting Javascript code on the page).\nWebsite Penetration Testing Theory\nHTTP Request and Response\nInformation Gathering and Dirb Tool\nBurpsuite Configuration\nShellShock Exploitation\nCommand Injection Exploitation\nGetting Meterpreter Shell With Command Execution\nReflected XSS and Cookie Stealing\nStored XSS\nHTML Injection\nSQL Injection\nCSRF Vulnerability\nHydra Bruteforce Attack\nBurpsuite Intruder\nPython Coding Project with Login Brute-force and Directory Discovery\n\n\n9. MAN IN THE MIDDLE - This is an attack that is used inside a network. This allows us to sniff any unencrypted data and see it in plain text. This could also include seeing passwords in plain text for some websites. There are many tools out there that can perform this attack for us and we cover some of the main ones in the section.\nTheory of Man In The Middle Attack\nBettercap ARP Spoofing\nEttercap Password Sniffing\nManually Poisoning Targets ARP Cache With Scapy\n\n\n10. WIFI CRACKING - This is the section where we want to gain access to a network by cracking its wireless password.\nWireless Cracking Theory\nPutting Wireless Card In Monitor Mode\nDeauthenticating Devices & Grabbing Password\nAircrack Password Cracking\nHashcat Password Cracking\n\n\n11. SOCIAL ENGINEERING - This is something we cover in almost every section. Social Engineering is an attack on humans since as we know people are always the weakest security!\n& much much more!\n\nWe guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online course on hacking and security skills! Have a look at the course outline video to see all the topics we are going to cover, all the projects we’re going to build, and all the techniques you’re going to learn to become a top ethical hacker and penetration tester!\n\n\n\nTaught By:\n\nAndrei is the instructor of the highest rated technical courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.\n\n\nHaving been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time. Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.\n\n\nAndrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.\n\n\nTaking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.\n\n\n\n\nAleksa is a Penetration Tester with over 5 years of experience in Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security. As a self made hacker that started from a young age he has learned it all from Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security to Online Privacy and How To Become Anonymous Online.\n\n\nHe has worked and discovered vulnerabilities for multiple companies and governments. He also worked as a freelancer that tested private web applications. He believes that Online Security and Privacy is something valuable but also that it doesn't get enough attention as many cyber attacks are being executed every single day! No System is Safe and that is why we are here to discover vulnerabilities and secure them before the bad guys attempt anything malicious\n\n\nHis main goal as an instructor is to teach the foundations of Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security to anyone who wants to pursue this as a career or wants to learn it to protect themselves online. Cyber attacks and online security is something that changes really fast so we as hackers must always be ready to learn new things in order to better protect Networks, Websites, Machines .. and also people\n\n\nSee you inside the courses!",

      "description": "Last Update: May 2024\n\n\nWelcome to my WiFi cracking course where you'll learn how to crack the key and get the password to WiFi networks weather they use WEP, WPA or even WPA2, not only that but you'll also learn how to secure networks from hackers.\nThis course is highly practical but won't neglect the theory, you will start as a beginner with no prior knowledge about hacking, and it will take you through the basics of networking and how clients communicate with each other, how the different types of WiFi encryptions work, then you'll learn how to use this information to exploit these networks and crack their encryption.\n\nThe course is divided into four main sections:\nNetworks Basics: in this section you will learn about how networks work, how devices communicate with each other and how the information is transferred in a wireless networks. You will also learn about basic terminology, what is a channel ? MAC address ? what is managed mode ? What is monitor mode  and how to enable it ? what is sniffing and what is it limited to ? so in this section we still don't know much about penetration testing , all we have is a computer and a wireless card connected to it, you will learn how to start gathering information using your wi-fi card (packet sniffing) and you will learn a number of attacks that you can launch without the need to know the password such as controlling all the connections around you (ie: deny/allow any device from connecting to any network),  you will also learn how to overcome some security features that would prevent you from even trying any attacks, you will learn how to discover and target hidden networks and bypass mac filtering weather it is implemented using a black-list or a white-list. .\n\nWEP Cracking: Now that you have gathered information about all the networks around you, and found your target, you will learn how to crack the key that the target uses. In this section you will learn four methods to crack WEP encryption. First you will learn the weaknesses in WEP that allow us to crack it, then you will learn the theory behind each method and finally you will learn how to launch that attack against WEP networks and obtain the key, in this section you will learn 4 different methods to crack WEP to make sure that you can crack any WEP network you face regardless of how its configured.\nWPA Cracking: in this section you will learn  a number of methods to crack WPA/WPA2 networks, again you will learn the weakness in WPA and theory behind each method first, and then you will learn how to launch the attack against a real network, this section is divided into a number of smaller sections:\nExploiting WPS - In this subsection you will learn how to exploit the WPS feature to gain access to WPA/WPA2 networks without using a wordlist, not only that but you'll also learn how to debug reaver's output and exploit the WPS feature on more routers using reaver's advanced options, you will also learn how to unlock some routers if they lock after a number of failed attempts.\nWordlist Attacks - in this subsection you will learn how to run wordlist attacks to crack the WPA/WPA2 key, you will learn how to use huge wordlists without wasting storage, save the cracking progress so that you can pause and resume the cracking process whenever you want, and you will also learn how to crack the key much faster using the GPU instead of the CPU.\nWPA/WPA2 Enterprise - These networks are usually used in companies and colleges, these are secure networks that use WPA/WPA2 but also require users to login with a username and password after connecting, in this subsection you will understand how they work and how to gain access to them.\nProtection: At this stage you will know the weaknesses and methods that real life hackers use, therefore it will be very easy for you to secure your network against these attacks. In this section you will learn how to configure your wireless networks so that the above attacks will not work, you will learn what settings need to be changed, how to access the router settings and how to change these settings.\n\n\nAll the attacks in this course are practical attacks that work against real wireless networks in my lab\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\nNOTE: This course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih and No other organization is associated for certification exam for the same. Although, you will receive Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that No OTHER ORGANIZATION IS INVOLVED.",

      "description": "Hi! I am a Former Okta Certified Consultant and I have carefully designed this course for you to get to know the aspects of Okta in a simple and pleasant manner.\nCourse is intended for anyone out there working with Okta or simply interested in this field. You frankly don't need much previous information to get started and learn what I am presenting here.\n\n\n*ATTENTION* - Course DOES apply for those of you out there using the new feature, \"Admin Experience Redesign\" (where Okta changed the GUI of Admin Panel; if you want the change to reflect on End-User side as well, you have the feature 'New End User Experience' for End-User panels), as it mostly changed font and colors along with the location of main menu (top -> left side), but NOT menu paths. You can follow this course very well on the new GUI design as paths towards the options are still there and still the same.\n\n\nFor you to understand who am I and how I teach - I put two lessons free to preview. Lecture titled \"Who am I\" - section 1 and lecture \"Org2Org\" - section 8.\nAlso, I have a truly 'human' approach and you'll see that I'll face errors as well in this course, but I am finding a solution to overcome them successfully, on the spot. I hope that this course will inspire you more into staying calm and collected when facing technical issues. With some basic best-practices you will get them resolved. This Okta Guide is intended to mimic reality and my aim is to show you that anyone can make mistakes, but also that anyone can overcome them; this is not a course where everything works for me, but not for you. No, I give you this pleasant pragmatic approach on the situation. Hop on this ride with me and let me present this to you.\n\n\nFor the Okta account based on a free email from @mailinator topic - that might not work anymore. Try Zoho or other free services that offer alias work emails (5 free) for your personal email addresses or a work email with a very small fee online, in order to then create your own Okta account.\n\n\nInterested in certifications?\nOkta Certified Professional - You may get this one if you follow each aspect of this course and attribute all the info to yourself.\nOkta Certified Administrator - You may take this one by doing the aforementioned, also not skipping, but studying each document / KB article I attached this course\nOkta Certified Consultant - This is achievable, but it's up to you paying close attention to logic and details - also, I recommend you to study the Okta OIDC articles on their Support page, Inbound SAML (Org2Org would be fine as well here) and know OktaEL (Okta Expression Language) by heart to get this one. If you already have the Admin Certificate, I can guarantee you will still find a lot of new info throughout this course!\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get to see:\nMore than 10 hours of hands-on training;\n~90 different links to Okta docs and not only and files I attached that will furthermore detail my presentations;\nStep-by-step practice exercises;\nSome lengthy lectures (to treat almost every aspect of a specific situation), yes, but full of explanations to set you on the right track.\n\n\nYou will:\nLearn the features in the Okta Admin Panel and in End-User's one;\nCreate your own Users;\nAdd your own Applications and learn how to assign them in various ways;\nStudy Okta Groups, App-Groups and Okta Group Rules;\nCreate and understand the Policies (Sign On, MFA, Password Policies);\nDevelop a strong knowledge about Attribute Mappings, Single Sign-On and Provisioning configurations\nRun Okta APIs - learn about Software like Postman;\nWork with System Log and understand its concepts;\nIntegrate Org2Org implementations;\nUnderstand IWA;\nEven get to work with Python and Okta APIs through it;\nUnderstand how to troubleshoot Okta and get my recommendations and best practices;\nHave a recap about Networking.",

I made this course for all levels, so anyone can get accustomed to it and practice along with me. No matter if you are a beginner in this field, intermediate level or even have some Okta certificates under your belt - I am sure you'll find never-seen-before lectures / pieces of information in here."

I have curated this course by carefully analyzing and researching each topic and the current industry-trends to give you all the necessary resources/tools/pointers to successfully build and operate 5G networks.\n5G is quite different from 4G and it is necessary to understand the underlying 5G cloud-native technologies to fully embrace and understand 5G. This course is for all levels of expertise. It starts from the basics by introducing the motivation for 5G, enabling technologies including cloud-native principles and then builds on top of these concepts as we explore the 5G Core concepts in depth.\n4G is going to around for quite a while and both 4G and 5G networks will need to co-exist for many years. This course covers practical deployment considerations for such 4G/5G co-existence scenarios as well.\nThis is by-far the most comprehensive course on 5G Core networks on Udemy since all concepts are covered in-depth.\nI have included easy to follow diagrams in the slides, along with references to 3GPP documents where appropriate.\nBelow are the topics covered in this course -\nIntroduction - Why and How ?\n5G Timeline\n5GC Deployment Architectures - SA and NSA\n5G Core Architecture - Enabling Technologies\n5G Core Architecture - SBA and Point-to-Point\n5G Core elements\nAMF - Access and Mobility Function\nSMF - Session Management Function\nUPF - User Plane Function\nQoS in 5G\nNRF - Network Repository Function\nUDM - Unified Data Management Function\nAUSF, EIR\nPCF - Policy Control Function\nNSSF - Network Slicing Selection Function\nNetwork Slicing\nIdentifiers in 5G Core\nSecurity in 5GC\nInterworking with 4G EPC\nNetwork Functions and Services\nCall Flows\n\n\nHappy learning!",

In this course you will see exactly how to create an advanced keylogger starting from nothing by literally following the steps I take as I make it!\nThis keylogger is capable of recording all the keyboard and mouse input! It can even record independent of the language settings because it logs the physical keys on the keyboard first. Next, by using an arbitrary keymap with human friendly names, it translates the machine keys to something that we can understand. It also possesses mail sending capabilities so you can just schedule the logfile to be sent via mail, lets say every 12 hours. In addition to this, it will also keep the logfile encrypted. Therefore, we will create another program which will be able to decrypt the logfile on your end.\nFor learning C++, this is an ideal course because it is completely hands on learning that provides a functional end product! Some future features that will be added to the keylogger course as I develop them will include but are not limited to taking screenshots, capturing clipboard content (copy-paste), recording website URLs, and so on! Take this course now to get immediate access to the videos and to get answers to every single question you ask in the course!\nAs an information technology professional myself, I realize what the final product of this course is capable of. I trust in creating this that you will use it for good and for learning. If you choose to use this keylogger for any illegal or immoral purposes, you risk losing a lot. This is only for educational purposes. The keylogger that you are going to see will be able to cause some serious damage, so please use it in a legal and responsible way.\nThank you very much for reading this and I hope to see you in the course soon! If you have any suggestions in regard to the functionalities of the keylogger, feel free to send me a message or post your requests here.",

Although the vulnerability itself is simple to learn and exploit, it can potentially lead to disastrous consequences that leave an organization open to severe risks such as sensitive information disclosure, authentication bypass and even remote code execution.\nIn this course, we dive into the technical details behind SQL Injection vulnerabilities, the different types of SQL injection vulnerabilities, how to find them from both a black-box and a white-box perspective and cover the different ways to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities. We also go through prevention and mitigation techniques on how to prevent and mitigate these types of vulnerabilities.\nThis is not your average course that just teaches you the basics of SQL Injection. This course contains over 9 hours worth of content that not only describes the technical details behind SQL Injection vulnerabilities, but also contains 18 labs that give you hands-on experience exploiting real-world examples. The labs are of varying difficulty levels starting with really simple examples and slowly moving up in difficulty.\nIf you're a penetration tester, application security speciality, bug bounty hunter, software developer, ethical hacker, or just anyone interested in web application security, this course is for you!",

      "description": "Welcome to the ultimate dark net, privacy, anonymity and security course. With no prior knowledge required this course will take you from a beginner to advanced in all of these topics; teaching you how to properly and securely discover data and websites on both the dark web and clear web, access hidden (onion) services, communicate privately and anonymously using instant messages and email, manually use end-to-end encryption to protect your privacy and make it impossible to read even if it gets intercepted, sign and verify files, share files anonymously, transfer funds anonymously using crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Monero and much more! You'll also learn how to do all of this in a secure manner making it very difficult for hackers or other entities to hack you or de-anonymise you.\n\n\nThis course is highly practical but won't neglect the theory, first you'll understand the inner-workings of each topic and each technique covered, then you'll learn how to apply it in real-life scenarios ultimately teaching you how to use the dark net and the clear net in a more private, more anonymouse and more secure manner. By the end of the course you'll be able to combine the skills you learned and use them in any situation that requires more privacy, more anonymity or more security.\n\n\nThis course covers four main topics, I chose to cover all of these topics in one course because I think it is very difficult to learn one without the others as they are very related, these main topics are:\n\n\n1. Anonymity - anonymity is a state where your identity is unknown. Achieving this on the internet is not easy because of the way the internet is designed. In this course you'll learn a number of techniques to protect your anonymity; you'll first learn what the TOR network is, understand how it works and how it can significantly improve our anonymity, then you'll learn how to connect to it using the TOR Browser, using TAILS and using Qubes OS. You'll also learn how configure TOR properly to bypass censorship and connect even if its blocked!\n\n\n2. Privacy - Using an anonymising network such as TOR is not enough to stay private and anonymous because the operating systems we use (Windows, Apple Mac OS and Linux) constantly collect data about us. Therefore in this course you'll learn how to use operating systems designed to be more private, more anonymous and more secure; TAILS and Qubes OS. You'll learn how to install these operating systems on a USB stick so you can use them on any computer without affecting the original operating system and without leaving any traces!\nThere's also a fully section on encryption in which you'll learn how the two main types of encryptions work (symmetric and asymmetric), end-to-end encryption and how to use it to encrypt / decrypt and sign / verify data, This allows you to privately communicate and share any sort of data; whether it is simple text, or files such as images, videos, etc. without worrying about it being intercepted.\nThe the payment methods we are used to use are not private and not anonymous. Therefore the course has a full section on crypto-currencies, to teach you about blockchain, crypto-currencies, and how to anonymously obtain two crypto currencies; Bitcoin and Monero and use them to send / receive funds.\n\n\n3. Dark Net - This is the portion on the internet that is not indexed by search engines and require special configuration to access. Using anonymising networks and privacy-focused operating systems are 2 steps in the right direction of becoming more private and more anonymouse. However, unfortunately it is not enough, the services we use everyday are not private and constantly collect data about us, so the the search engines (Google or Bing), the email provers (ex: Gmail, or Yahoo), the instant messaging platforms (Whatsapp or Skype), the file sharing services (Dropbox or Google Drive) and the list goes on. All of these services are not private, not anonymouse and can be used to track us and de-anonymise us. Therefore in this course I will teach you how to carry out your normal day-to-day tasks in a more private and anonymous manner, so first I'll teach you how to search for websites and content on both the clear net and on the dark net, then I'll tech you how to discover hidden services (onion services) to carry out your normal day-to-day tasks privately and anonymously (such as communicating using emails, or instant messages, file sharing, etc.).\n\n\n4. Security - All of the above will drastically enhance your anonymity and privacy and allow you to access both the dark web and the clear web privately and anonymously. However if you get hacked, the hacker will gain control over your system and therefore will be able to easily bypass whatever anonymity techniques you're using and de-anonymise you, so all of the above is useless without security. Therefore in this course I will teach you how to do all of the above securely, then at the last section of the course I'll show you how to take your security to the next level by dividing your operating system into a number of isolated security domains. Therefore even if you get hacked, only a small portion of your system will be compromised, making it extremely difficult for the hacker to compromise the entire system or de-anonymise you.\n\n\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\nCheckout the curriculum and the course teaser for more info!\n\n\nNotes:\nThis course is created for educational purposes only .\nThis course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih & zSecurity and no other organisation is associated with it or a certification exam. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that NO OTHER ORGANISATION IS INVOLVED.",

Questions started flooding into my mind:\n\n\nWhat should I look for? Where do I start? How can I find the packets that matter? What filters should I use? What is \"normal\"?\n\n\nI froze under the weight of all the detail in the packets.\nIf you have ever felt that way when looking at a pcap, this is the course for you!\n\n\nThroughout this course, we are going to look at real-world examples of how to practically use Wireshark to solve network problems. This skill will help all IT engineers to improve in their analysis and troubleshooting skills. Labs have been designed with participation in mind. Download the trace file, try your hand at the questions that go along with it, and see if you can solve the network puzzle in the packets.\nWhile learning the art of packet analysis, we will also explore the Wireshark interface, configure custom columns, filters, and coloring rules, learning how to customize the layout so we can spot problems fast. This course will give you comfort with the Wireshark interface and the experience you need to understand core protocols.\n\n\nMy name is Chris Greer and I am directly affiliated with the Wireshark Foundation. I teach packet analysis for companies all over the globe. In this course, I bring real-world examples to every lecture, exercise, and course assignment. My goal is for you to get comfortable with the Wireshark interface, learn to interpret the packets, and find actionable data that will help you to resolve problems or spot security incidents faster.\nReady Packet People? Let's dig!",

      "description": "LTE (4G) is the first network technology that is capable of delivering high-speed data to subscribers. It is the most widely deployed 3GPP technology and its adoption has been the fastest compared to its predecessors (2G, 3G). 4G LTE lays the foundation for the future 5G networks.\n\n\nThis course is designed to provide students with in-depth information regarding LTE EPC architecture. The course has been designed for all levels and starts off by providing the introduction to LTE and its advantages over legacy technologies. We then quickly start by building the foundation needed to understand the LTE technology and its architecture. During the lectures, all concepts are introduced by means of intuitive diagrams and real-network examples whenever possible.  Here are some of the reasons why this course is different compared to others -\n\n\n1. Robust structure\n\n\nLTE EPC is a complex and very exhaustive topic. That is why we have organized the lectures in a way that students can quickly understand concepts.\n\n\n2. Intuitive Examples and Use Cases\n\n\nSo many courses and books just bombard you with the theory. But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: why you are doing what you are doing. And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive *feel* for the concepts behind LTE.\n\n\n3. Real network Examples\n\n\nIn this course, we use real Wireshark traces from a test network to describe call flows rather than just relying on theory. This way we are able to deliver practical information to the students that will help them in real-world scenarios.\n\n\n4. 3GPP based material\n\n\nThroughout the course, we refer to the relevant 3GPP specifications so that students can become familiar with 3GPP specifications.\n\n\n5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT\n\n\nHave you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?\n\n\nWell, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful LTE EPC course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help. No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed. Therefore, feel free to send us a message and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n\nGood Luck and Happy learning!",

      "description": "Whether you are an experienced AWS user or are just getting started with cloud computing. You know it is quite easy to get your infrastructure components deployed in the AWS cloud.\nBut do you ever wonder how you can orchestrate and manage your AWS resources in an easy and efficient manner? How do you automate the deployment and configuration of your EC2 instances, your IAM users, your elastic load balancers and numerous other AWS components services that your applications rely on?\nIf so, then we know exactly where you're coming from.\nAWS does provide a very useful web based management console to deploy and manage all these cloud resources. The AWS management console works nicely if you have to occasionally make some changes to your cloud infrastructure which comprises of a few components.\nBut for a cloud architect or a cloud administrator who tend to manage tens or hundreds or even thousands of cloud resources – using the AWS management console may be too time-consuming and inefficient.\nAWS also provides a powerful command line interface which can be used to manage AWS services known as AWS CLI.\nAWS CLI stands for Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface.\nIt is a comprehensive and essential toolset provided by AWS which helps software engineers, IT and operations teams and DevOps engineers manage their cloud services and resources. It is a command line interface tool which facilitates automation by using scripting to operationalize your AWS resources from the command window or terminal.\nIf you are serious about automating your AWS based cloud infrastructure – then using the AWS CLI toolset in conjunction with bash scripting is the only way to go. And when any startup or technology company is looking to implement DevOps practices to automate their cloud infrastructure – they are willing to pay big money for cloud engineers and consultants to help them manage their cloud infrastructure. In fact, the hourly rates cloud engineers are easily few hundred dollars an hour. And the demand for these skills is just exploding.\nWouldn’t you want to acquire these skills and be a part of this cloud computing revolution? Be highly sought after and take your career to the next level\nThat's why today, we are thrilled to be able to share with you - our new training program \"AWS MasterClass: Learn all about AWS Client Line Interface (CLI).\"\nIn this course, you will get an in-depth look at this comprehensive and essential toolset called AWS CLI.\nAWS CLI can be used to manage various AWS services like EC2, IAM, ELB, ECS and many others. In this course, we will dive deep into many of these services and learn how we can deploy, configure and manage some of the key cloud components available for these services.\nYou will find real actionable information and education in exchange for your time, willingness to learn and a fraction of the cost you will be able to demand as a cloud engineer or consultants. We can guarantee that you will get your investment back manyfold in no time.",

Companies around the world add OAuth to their APIs to enable secure access from their own mobile apps and third-party IoT devices and even access to banking APIs.\nSecurity expert Aaron Parecki breaks down each of the OAuth flows (grant types) and applies them to use cases such as implementing OAuth for web apps, native apps, and SPAs. In addition to learning how applications can use OAuth to access APIs, you’ll learn how to use OpenID Connect to get the user’s identity.\nIf you're building an API, you'll learn the differences and tradeoffs between different access token formats, how to choose an appropriate access token lifetime, and how to design scopes to protect various parts of your APIs.\nThis course includes the latest recommendations from the OAuth working group including covering everything from using PKCE for all types of applications to explaining the motivations behind dropping the Implicit and Password grants from the spec. These security recommendations and more will be rolled up into the new OAuth 2.1 update, so this course will give you an excellent head start on learning the best way to use OAuth going forward!\nBy the end of this course, you’ll understand:\nThe problems OAuth was created to solve\nThe basics of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect\nBest practices for developing web-based and native OAuth apps\nThe difference between local and remote access token validation\nHow to validate JWT access tokens\nAnd you’ll be able to:\nImplement an OAuth client from scratch\nProtect the OAuth flows in native and JavaScript apps\nUse OpenID Connect to get the user’s name email address\nProtect an API with OAuth access tokens\nDesign scopes to protect various parts of your API\nThis course is for you because...\nYou’re a software architect, application developer, or technical decision maker\nYou work with APIs, web apps, mobile apps, or microservices\nYou want to deepen your understanding of application security and become a technical leader\nPrerequisites\nA basic understanding of HTTP requests, responses, and JSON\nNo programming language knowledge is necessary since the exercises can be completed without writing any code!\nTo follow along with the exercises, you'll also need:\nExperience with Postman, curl, or any other HTTP client\nA free Auth0 Developer account\nThis course also gives you exclusive access to an interactive web-based tool that will guide you through the exercises and give feedback along the way! It's like having the instructor provide real-time feedback as you are working through the exercises!",

      "description": "The Cyber Security Threat Intelligence Researcher Certification will help you acquire the skills needed to find out who is behind an attack, what the specific threat group is, the nation from which the attack is being launched, as well as techniques being used to launch this attack.\n\nYou will know how to take a small piece of malware, find out who is responsible for launching it, the threat actor location and also how to take down that threat actor, with the support of your local law enforcement.\nIn today’s cyber security landscape, it isn't possible to prevent every attacks. Today’s attackers have significant funding, are patient, sophisticated, and target vulnerabilities in people and processes as well as technologies. With organizations increasingly relying on digitized information and sharing vast amounts of data across the globe, they have become easier targets for many different forms of attack. As a result, every company’s day-to-day operations, data and intellectual property are seriously at risk. In a corporate context, a cyber attack can not only damage your brand and reputation, it can also result in loss of competitive advantage, create legal/regulatory noncompliance and cause steep financial damage.\nToday’s secure environment will have vulnerabilities in it tomorrow, so an organization cannot allow itself to become complacent. There is only so much an organization can do by defending itself against threats that have already occurred. If an organization only reacts to new threats as they come up, are likely acting too late. It is important to understand and prioritize cyber threat intelligence processes, and how they can be integrated into an organization’s security operations in a way that adds value.\nCyber threat intelligence (CTI) is an advanced process enabling organizations to gather valuable insights based on analysis of contextual and situational risks. These processes can be tailored to the organization’s specific threat landscape, industry and market. This intelligence can make a significant difference to organizations' abilities to anticipate breaches before they occur. Giving organizations the ability to respond quickly, decisively and effectively to confirmed breaches allows them to proactively maneuver defense mechanisms into place, prior to and during the attack.\nIn this course, we’ll introduce you to the 8 phases of threat intelligence:\nHunting - The goal of hunting is to establish techniques to collect samples from different sources that help to start profiling malicious threat actors.\nFeatures Extraction - The goal of Features Extraction is to identify unique Static features in the binaries that help to classify them into a specific malicious group.\nBehavior Extraction - The goal of Behavior Extraction is to identify unique Dynamic features in the binaries that help to classify them into a specific malicious group.\nClustering and Correlation -  The goal of Clustering and Correlation is to classify malware based on Features and Behavior extracted and correlate the information to understand the attack flow.\nThreat Actor Attribution - The goal of Threat Actors is to locate the threat actors behind the malicious clusters identified.\nTracking - The goal of tracking is to anticipate new attacks and identify new variants proactively.\nTaking Down - The goal of Taking down is to Dismantled Organized Crime Operations.",

You cannot go far as a hacker without it.\n\n\nIt belongs in the toolbox of every Cybersecurity professional, network engineer, penetration tester, ethical hacker, or SOC analyst.\n\n\nThe problem is that there are so many OPTIONS and SWITCHES to remember! What do they do? When do I use them? How can I remember them?\n\n\nIf you have ever felt that way when getting started with Nmap, this is the course for you. In this class there are a grand total of two powerpoint slides. Why? Because slides are boring. Instead, we will walk through several hands-on labs that will help you build your Nmap skills as you run each scan along with me.\nBut there is more.\n\n\nWith each scan, we are going to capture it with Wireshark and learn how it really works. Instead of just waiting for an output and hoping to understand what to do with it, we will be looking at the scan and responses from a target at the packet level. This will help us know and remember what we are putting out on the wire and what to do with the results we receive from the test.\n\n\nMy name is Chris Greer and I am a Wireshark University instructor, as well as a packet analysis consultant for companies all over the globe. Like you, I started out with a deep interest in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Looking at Nmap scans in Wireshark helped me to understand them, remember them, and utilize them to find vulnerabilities in networks and servers.\nReady to SCAN? Let's get to it!",

      "description": "Welcome to - Learn Ethical Hacking From A-Z: Beginner To Expert Course!\nThis practical, hands-on course was created for newbies – that's to say, people with no prior training or knowledge in hacking and cybersecurity. The aim of this course is to give you the education not just to understand what black-hat hatters do and how, but also to learn exactly how to hack systems like a pro and win the cat and mouse game by securing systems like a professional security expert.\nBlending practical work with solid theoretical training, we take you from the basics of ethical hacking through to mastery, giving you the training you need not just to hack, but also to secure against a hack.\nWhile the theory is important, we understand that it can also be dry and uninspiring. For this reason, this course is packed with examples that you can follow. This practical focus starts from the beginning, where we will teach you about penetration testing and show you how to install the software required (Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX) and jump right into hacking.\nThroughout, you will analyze and exploit various systems from regular websites through to sprawling networks, along with hacking servers and clients. More than just hacking, you'll also learn how to conduct efficient penetration testing techniques.\nThis approach gives you the foundational education that you need not just to hack any given system, but also to secure it, with each module covering both sides of the coin. The course covers six main areas:\n\n\n1: LEARN THE FUNDAMENTALS NECESSARY TO BECOME A HACKER\nThis foundational section gives you a full introduction to the basics of networking systems – how they communicate and work – and is designed to give you the knowledge you need to succeed in this course.\nBASICS OF NETWORKING: Networking can be an intimidating topic, but don’t worry! We break down only the necessary things that you need to know in regards to networking and teach you important networking fundamentals\nSETTING UP A HACKING LAB: You can’t hack without a lab! We walk you step-by-step through the process of setting up your own hacking lab on your laptop or desktop computer!\nLINUX + SCRIPTING BASICS: Hackers use Linux, which is an OS that the average person may have no experience with. We will go over Linux fundamentals so that you can easily navigate your way through Linux during this course. We also touch on a couple of scripting languages that are a MUST for any ethical hacker and teach you the basics of each one with practical examples.\nHIDING YOUR IDENTITY ON THE WEB: If you are hacking on the internet, you need to learn how to remain anonymous. We will show you the tools and techniques that you can use to always remain anonymous and unknown on the internet.\n\n\n2: LEARN HOW TO HACK NETWORKS\nThis section shows you how to test both wired and wireless systems. You will learn how to go from not having any access to a network to gaining access and being able to begin attacking systems on the network.\nPRE-CONNECTION ATTACK: Not all attacks require you to be connected to the target or even know the password. Learn how to discover and manipulate devices connected to a network and gather information about your target\nGAIN ACCESS TO NETWORKS: Learn how to use the information you have about your target to crack the key and get the access password. This section covers multiple protocols including WEP, WPA, and WPA2\nPOST-CONNECTION ATTACKS: With a key, you can now leverage powerful hacking techniques to get even more information. Learn how to see what users are doing on a network, inject code in pages, and more on wired and wireless networks\n\n\n3: HOW TO GAIN ACCESS AND CONNECT TO NETWORKS\nThis section builds on the lessons learned in section one, showing you how you can get full control and hack into any computer system that you target.\nSERVER-SIDE ATTACK: Discover how to harvest information about your targeted system – its OS, open ports, and installed services – without user interaction. Then use this information to exploit vulnerabilities and generate reports\nCLIENT-SIDE ATTACK: Learn how to hack systems with no vulnerabilities by sneaking in with software updates or using backdoor trojan downloads. You’ll also learn the art of social engineering – or tricking people into giving you information\n\n\n4: HOW TO LEVERAGE POST EXPLOITATION\nThis section shifts the focus on interacting with compromised systems. Now that you have gained access, you'll learn how you can exploit these systems.\nACCESS FILE SYSTEMS: All systems have a wealth of files that you can now manipulate with your access. Learn how to access these systems and how to read, write, upload, and even execute files\nMAINTAIN ACCESS: Gaining access to a system and its files is only half of the battle. Learn how to maintain your access and frustrate efforts to secure it again so you can continue to exploit a system\nSPY ON YOUR TARGET: Learn how to capture any keystrokes on a keyboard, turn on a computer webcam, take screenshots, and even take control of the system to attack, hack, and access third-party networks and systems\n\n\n5: HOW TO HACK WEBSITES AND WEB APPS\nIn this section, you will learn more about how you can hack into websites and web applications using Kali Linux. You’ll also learn how web applications work – and how to find vulnerabilities within these applications for you to exploit.\nHow to scan websites/web applications for vulnerabilities to exploit\nHow to Brute Force into web applications\nHow to conduct SQL injection in web applications\nHow to conduct Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nHow to exploit File Inclusion Vulnerabilities\nHow to exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities\nHow to automate attacking web applications using various tools\nHow to prevent and secure websites & apps yourself\n\n\n6: HOW TO MAKE MONEY, LAND A JOB & BUILD A BRAND AS A HACKER\nIn this section, you will learn how you can make money as an ethical hacker using a variety of methods. You’ll also learn how to build your personal brand and get your name out there as an Ethical Hacker so you can have employers and clients knocking at your door ready to hire you for your services. Then finally, you’ll learn how you can start a career in cybersecurity with some insider tips on what certifications to get and the best way to land a job.\nThis includes:\nHow to build an ethical hacker personal brand from scratch\nHow to get instant credibility and authority as a hacker\nHow to properly network and get others talking about you\nHow to make money using a variety of websites\nHow to get started freelancing as a hacker\nHow to get started consulting as a hacker\nHow to land a job as a cybersecurity professional\nThis course is comprehensive, showing you both sides of hacking. You will learn to think and operate like a hacker – and how to apply that knowledge as a cybersecurity expert to protect you and your clients' networks and systems. In taking this 'cat and mouse' approach, your rounded understanding will give your approach new depths and angles, revealing the paths you can take to effectively neutralize any threat.\nTogether with the emphasis on practical examples that you can follow in real life with live systems, you will also benefit from the excitement of hands-on learning. By experiencing precisely what it takes to hack into any given target system, you'll also learn that no one system is the same and that all approaches can be modified.\nThis real-life learning is an invaluable part of your education, enabling you to better see what hackers are doing and how to block even the most potent attacks. No matter what the scenario or how complicated a hacking situation, this course gives you the foundational training you need to secure a network – and start pursuing a career in a field that is increasingly in demand as the global reliance on technology grows.",

Although the course was designed around the (9) Consul Associate 002 exam objectives, the course covers a wealth of Consul topics to get even the most novice person up to speed with Consul. And hey, if you're already working with Consul, you might also learn some stuff.\n\n\nLooking for information on Consul architecture, security, and protocols used? It's in here.\nStruggling to understand how to write prepared queries? I've got that, too.\nWere you writing a Consul agent configuration file and had problems? Yeah, I talk about that as well.\nThis course includes almost 70 lectures, 20+ lab sessions, and test questions for each lecture. I also include access to the slides, Mindmaps of each objective, lab guides to follow along, and tons of external links. There is even a final practice exam that includes exam-like questions to test your knowledge.\nIf you're looking for a course to teach you how to deploy and manage a Consul environment, or if you're looking to pass the HashiCorp Certified: Consul Associate, you're in the right place.\n\n\nStudent Feedback\n\"I went through almost 2 hours of your Consul course and as someone who has worked with Consul in production environments for enterprises with 15 years of IT experience, I can confidently say that this is one of the best unofficial courses on Consul.\n-\nThe production quality and the way you laid out the entire course are top-notch. So far I noticed, you didn't short change on the technical depth. I love courses that cover the technical internals in-depth as it's a productive use of my time.\" - Narendra V\n-\n\"Excellent course Bryan. Teaching format was great - love the labs and study guide.

      "description": "Ready to master Solana blockchain development? You've come to the right place!\nBlockchain technology is the most disruptive force in years, and amongst the various blockchains is the shining star that is Solana. It's faster, cheaper, and better for the environment than both Bitcoin and Ethereum. These factors mean Solana is growing exponentially despite being so new, and make it likely to reach mass adoption.\nLarge tech companies and start-ups alike cannot hire developers who understand blockchain technologies fast enough, but there are so few resources published to help you truly understand what blockchains are used for, let alone build apps with them.\nThat's the purpose of this course: to be the best resource online for learning about Solana, the blockchain, and how to build apps with these cutting-edge technologies.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll:\nBe an expert Solana and Web3 developer\nBe proficient at creating your own decentralised applications from scratch\nMake millions from NFTs? Build a decentralised version of Uber? Create your own bank? Up to you!\nIn this course you'll cover:\nWhat the Solana blockchain is, how it works, and why it's so incredible\nDeep dive into Solana development using Rust, JavaScript, and the command line\nFull projects that will solidify your skills in DeFi (decentralised finance), NFTs (non-fungible tokens), dapps (decentralised apps), Web3, and more\nIf you want to take advantage of the cutting-edge Solana blockchain while it’s still new and rapidly growing, this course is for you. All you need is beginner level programming experience.\nWhat is Solana?\nSolana is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum. What differentiates it from the rest it is its speed, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendliness, and these make Solana poised to overtake both Bitcoin and Ethereum in popularity and adoption. What's more, is that Solana makes it easy for developers like you to create decentralised applications focused on transferring value from one party to another. It even supports *programs* which are pieces of code that run on the blockchain, and which can replace your bank/real estate agency/ticket selling company/accountant/witch doctor.",

The necessary resources and tools are posted for each sections of the course.\n\n\nBefore jumping into penetration testing, you will first learn how to set up your own lab and install the needed software to practice Penetration Testing along with me. All the attacks explained in this course are launched against real devices, and nothing is theoretical. The course will demonstrate how to fully control victims' devices such as servers, workstations, and mobile phones. The course can also be interesting to those looking for quick hacks such as controlling victim's camera, screen, mobile contacts, emails and SMS messages.\nAt the end of the course you will be equipped with the necessary tools and skills to:\n1) Assess security risks by adopting a standard Threat Modeling technique\n2) Adopt a structured approach to perform Penetration Tests\n3) Protect yourself and the organization you work at\n4) Compile security findings and present them professionally to your clients\n5) Make the world a safer place\n\n\nYou can as well enjoy the JUICY BONUS section at the end of the course, which shows you how to setup useful portable Pentest Hardware Tools that you can employ in your attacks.\n\n\nI have put my 14 years of experience into this course by trying to answer many of the questions I had during my journey of learning. I have as well took the feedback and input of many of my students, peers, and professional figures.\n\n\nI will be happy to answer all your inquiries and connect with you.\n\n\nJoin TODAY and enjoy a life-time access.\n\n\nPS: The course is available in Arabic as well as Russian versions.\n\n\nHack Ethically  !",

There are a variety of reference documents throughout the course. Do watch for them. They include my cloud guardians book, my slides, as well as other useful documents such as the CSA guidance 4.0.\nWe will explore information security in the cloud. A lot of information security remains the same when you transition to the cloud, but a lot changes. Everything is in here from Governance, Risk management, and Compliance (GRC) to encryption and building data centers.\nMost of this exam you should think from a customer perspective looking toward the cloud provider. However, there are points, especially in domains three and five, that the perspective of the exam question can and will change to that of a cloud provider.\nA solid understanding of networking involved in data centers is explored including firewalls, network security groups, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems and more. Fundamentally this is a datacenter course. If networking is a new topic to watch and learn about networking.\nThere is plenty of information in here about the cloud and how it works. What I do say though, is the more you know the easier this test gets.  20 years of teaching CISSP and a deep dive into OpenStack made this exam easy for this instructor. Be careful, this is not an easy test, but the more you know the easier it gets.",

      "description": "Welcome to the advanced course on how to setup a deployment automation that's capable of scaling to handle millions of users!\nIn this course you will learn some of the most in-demand skills in the marketplace today by creating automated workflows to deploy and manage a scalable and secure infrastructure.\nThe demand for DevOps engineers is skyrocketing because few people have these skills and the value they add to a business’s bottom line is so high. Software development is expensive, and DevOps saves money by automating and streamlining the process. It also makes it easier to deploy more frequently, so you can catch issues early and improve the reliability of your product or service. Not to mention it saves hundreds of hours of manually administering servers and running deployments (like the good old days).\nPeople in DevOps roles are some of the highest earners in the industry, are looking for work the least, and are the most sought after by companies. (Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 and Indeed).\nNeedless to say, mastering the technologies and skills used for DevOps is a great return on investment.\nWhether you’re a developer, system administrator, or tech entrepreneur - this course will give you the tools to advance your skills in some of the most in-demand DevOps technologies in the marketplace today.\nIn this course, you’ll be deploying a sample Django REST API to AWS using Terraform, GitLab, Docker and a suite of AWS technologies, including:\nElastic Container Registry (ECR)\nRelational Database Service (RDS)\nElastic Container Service (ECS)\nApplication Load Balancer (ALB)\nElastic File System (EFS)\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nSubnets\nGateways\nEndpoints\nSimple Storage Service (S3)\nRoute53\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM)\nAWS Certificate Manager (ACM)\nThis course was designed to deploy a Django application, but it will work for any web application that runs in Docker.\nIn this course, you will learn how to:\nDefine your infrastructure as code so you can easily create and destroy environments as you need them, keeping AWS costs low\nDesign an architecture that is scalable, secure, resilient and facilitates zero downtime deployments\nSetup professional development workflows based on GitLab Flow to automate processes and speed up deployments\nProperly manage and administer an AWS account in accordance with best practices to mitigate the risk of it getting compromised (and preventing AWS bill shock)\nBy the end of the course you will have implemented a fully functioning deployment process, comparable to what you might find at any major tech company.\nThis is an advanced course that requires previous experience with Django and Docker, and familiarity with AWS. It requires you to have a budget for AWS fees and an acceptable payment method. You must also have a computer that can run Docker desktop (sorry Windows Home users).\nThis is a high-stakes course, so we encourage you to check out our full Requirements video before enrolling. This video and many others are free to preview, so make sure you check them out to make sure this course is right for you.\nThis is a hands-on course, with a bit of theory and lots of opportunities to test your knowledge. The content is challenging but rewarding. Ready for it? Let’s dive in!",

Along with SAML 2.0 theory, this course will use Okta as a Cloud based SAML 2.0 Identity Provider to learn how to construct SAML requests by hand and how to analyze the SAML responses.  A section has been dedicated to SAML Identity Brokers which has become important in today's enterprises. You will also get a good overall understanding of URL Encoding, Base64 Encoding, Hashing, Symmetric Encryption, Asymmetric Encryption and Digital Signatures. Never again would you be confused about RSA, AES, SHA-256 and what role they play in Cryptography. We will demonstrate all of these using openssl command line tool.\nFor Java Spring Boot Developers, there is an entire section with explanation on how to integrate with Okta ( or any other SAML Identity Provider). We will use the latest Spring Boot (2.7 and 3.3) and latest Java ( Java 17 or Higher)  to create a project with Single Sign On (SSO) and Single Log Out (SLO). Spring Boot applications fully tested with Spring Boot 2.7.x, 3.3.x and Java 19. Code includes full support for Spring Boot 3.3\nBy the end of the course, you will get an excellent grasp of SAML 2.0 and its relationship with HTTP Sessions and Cryptography. With this deep understanding of SAML 2.0 protocol, you will be able to write applications or deploy tools to integrate with the SAML Identity Providers with no problems.\n\n\nREMEMBER… I'm so confident that you'll love this course that we're offering a FULL money-back guarantee for 30 days! So it's a complete no-brainer, sign up today with ZERO risk and EVERYTHING to gain.",

      "description": "From Morris worm to Mitnick attack; from Mafia boy to Kaminsky attack; from Pakistan's hijacking of YouTube to Syria's shutting down of its own Internet. These are so many attacks on the Internet. If you want to learn how the Internet works, how it can be attached, and more importantly, how you can defend against these attacks, then this course is for you.\nIn this course, we systematically study each layer of the TCP/IP protocols, discuss the vulnerabilities in its design and implementation, and demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerabilities in attacks. Many classic attacks are covered in this course, with great technical details. The course won't just teach you the high-level concepts and theories; it would dive into the low-level technical details and fundamentals, so you can fully understand how exactly things work.\nThe course emphasizes hands-on learning. For each attack covered, students not only learn how the attack works in theory, they also learn how to actually conduct the attack, in a contained virtual machine environment. The hands-on exercises developed by the instructor are called SEED labs, and they are being used by over 1000 institutes worldwide. The course is based on the textbook written by the instructor. The book, titled \"Computer & Internet Security: A Hands-on Approach, 2nd Edition\", has been adopted by over 210 universities and colleges worldwide.",

The trainer in me highly approves!\" - Rommel A.\n\n\n\"A very high quality course that truly enables someone looking to implement ISO 27001 and an effective ISMS in their organisation. Well recommended course.\" - Gregory D.\n\n\nWith over 10 hours of detailed and engaging content across 200 lectures, this course will not only prepare you for the exam, but also provide you with a step-by-step approach on how to implement ISO/IEC 27001.\n\n\nIf you’re here right now, I know it’s because of one of the following reasons:\nThe Challenges You Face\nImplementing ISO 27001 is a tough challenge that many people struggle with. Understanding the standard is just the tip of the iceberg.\nComplexity: ISO 27001 is full of details that can be hard to follow. Risk assessments, statements of applicability – the list of requirements seems endless.\nTrial & Error: Without a clear roadmap, organizations are often forced to rely on trial and error. This approach is not only costly but also frustrating and time-consuming.\nTime-Consuming: Many organizations find themselves dedicating months to the implementation process. The numerous assessments, documentation, and internal audits required can put a strain on your resources and hinder your day-to-day operations.\nCostly: Whether you're considering hiring consultants or assigning a dedicated internal team, the costs associated with ISO 27001 can quickly pile up. From training to necessary tools, the expenses can be hefty.\nGeneric Nature: ISO 27001 is prescriptive and generic, which makes it even more difficult to implement. The one-size-fits-all approach means that you have to interpret the standard and adapt it to your organization's unique context, adding another layer of complexity.\n\n\nListen, You are Not alone!\nI know how complicated and time consuming a certification journey can be...\n\n\nThe Solution for You\nImagine having a step-by-step blueprint, tailored to fit any organization regardless of size, type, or nature. Imagine having access to a comprehensive collection of resources designed to simplify and accelerate your implementation process.\nClarity: With a structured 12-step approach, the complexities of ISO 27001 are broken down into manageable steps, giving you a clear path forward.\nProven Method: You can avoid the costly and frustrating trial-and-error phase. This course is based on a proven 12-step approach that has been successfully implemented by organizations of all sizes and types.\nEfficiency: No more lengthy implementation processes. You'll have access to templates and tools designed to save you hundreds of hours.\nAffordability: You can now get closer to compliance without the exorbitant costs. This course offers a growing collection of resources at a fraction of the price.\nPersonalized Approach: With a course that translates the generic contents of ISO 27001 into actionable advice, you'll have a personalized roadmap, tailored to fit your organization's unique context.\nHere's what you'll get...\nIn this course you will learn about the importance of information security and the ISO 27000 family of standards, including ISO 27000, ISO 27001, and ISO 27005. This course provides you with everything you need to know to establish and implement your own information security management system, including information security governance, risk management and compliance. The course will also help you to understand how organizations use management systems to achieve their objectives.\nImplementation Resources*\nOne of the unique features of this course is the downloadable resources that are provided to support your implementation project. You'll have access to a variety of templates, and resources that you can customize to fit your organization's specific needs and requirements.\n\n\nProject Plan\nThe course features a fully customizable project plan for the implementation of an ISMS in accordance to ISO 27001.\n\n\nDocumentation Starter Set*\nKickstart your ISO 27001 journey with an evolving documentation toolkit. Get key templates and guidelines that save time and help with compliance and certification.\n\n\nScope of the ISMS\nInformation Security Policy\nInformation Classification Policy\nStatement of Applicability (SoA)\nRisk Assessment Process\nRisk Treatment Process\n*THE COURSE DOES NOT CONTAIN A COMPLETE ISO 27001 DOCUMENTATION TOOLKIT!\nProcesses\nTailor the provided reference processes to your own organisation and save dozens of hours in translating ISO 27001 into actionable processes. The processes were designed based on the guidance in ISO/IEC TS 27022:2021, ISO 19011 and ISO/IEC 27005.\n\n\nInformation Security Governance Process\nManagement Review Process\nContext Analysis Process\nResource Management Process\nCommunication Process\nSupplier Management Process\nInformation Security Incident Management Process\nInformation Security Policy Management Process\nSecurity Awareness and Training Process\nRisk Assessment Process\nRisk Treatment Process\nControl Implementation Process\nPerformance Evaluation Process\nInternal Audit Process\nISMS Improvement Process\nISMS Change Management Process\nRecords Control Process\nMind Maps\nStandards can be confusing and tiring. In this course, interactive visuals make understanding the requirements fast and enjoyable.\n\n\nISO/IEC 27000 Mind Map\nISO/IEC 27001 Mind Map\nISO/IEC 27002 Mind Map\nISO/IEC 27005 Mind Map\nISO 27000 Family Mind Map\nMiscellaneous\nISO 27001 Control Mapping (ISO 27002:2022, NIST SP 800-53, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, CIS Critical Security Controls)\nControl Mapping Table - Annex A of ISO 27001:2022 vs. ISO 27001:2013\nISO 19011 Audit Workflow\nList of ISO 27000 family of standards\n*More resources are added on a continual basis.\nWhat are you waiting for?

      "description": "DON'T GET ENGINEERED\nSocial engineering, such as phishing, is one of the biggest problems for corporations - and users - in terms of security.\nAnd the advent of generative AI... has just made it worse.\nIn the world of today, companies and individuals must be able to not only resist social engineering and phishing, but resist it when it leverages generative AI - which means faster, larger-scale, more sophisticated attacks.\nThis course will teach you how to protect against social engineering, when social engineering is accelerated by generative AI.\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING.\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn the basics of generative AI and what it can do, including common models and families of models, the characteristics of generative content, and how it can be misused due to negligence or active malevolence (including biases, misinformation, impersonation and more);\nYou'll learn the basics of social engineering and what it consists of (manipulating someone to access information you otherwise would not), including common approaches and the facts that enable it (social norms, weak OPSEC, etc);\nYou'll learn the basics of social engineering with generative AI, including how it accelerates approaches (more sophisticated attacks, faster attacks, on larger scales, with micro-targeting), the major approaches that are affected (such as impersonation or more convincing pretexts), and the major defenses that are also affected (sophisticated detection mechanisms, MFA, behavioral analytics, faster IR, etc);\nYou'll learn about an overview of the major generative content types used in social engineering attacks (text, image, audio and video), including the specific approaches that each leverage, the model training requirements and data required for attackers to train such models, and how each type can be detected;\nYou'll learn about generative text, including the models that enable it (e.g., LLMs), the usual distribution channels (messages, emails, social media profiles), the required data to train such models (text samples, including specific ones), and how it can be detected (inconsistencies in facts, spotting specific text styles and patterns, detecting emotional manipulation patterns);\nYou'll learn about generative image, including the models that enable it (e.g. GANs, diffuser models, VAEs), the usual distribution channels (social media or specific platforms, such as for false documents), the required data to train such models (a variety of images, possibly of specific people or documents), and how it can be detected (artifacts, elements that meld into each other, doing reverse image searches, etc);\nYou'll learn about generative audio, including the models that enable it (e.g., TTS models, GANs), the usual distribution channels (VoIP or cellular calls, messaging apps, social media posts), the data required to train such models (audio samples, possibly of a specific individual), and how it can be detected (mismatches in speech patterns, accent, tone, or with automated detectors);\nYou'll learn about generative video, including the models that enable it (e.g. GANs, deep learning video models, motion transfer models), the usual distribution channels (video platforms such as YouTube/Vimeo, social media such as FB/IG/TikTok, or publications/news outlets), the required data to train such a model (a variety of footage, including possibly of a specific person or situation), and how it can be detected (mismatches in gestures, facial expressions, lack of synchronization in lip movement, etc);\nYou'll learn about the advanced impersonation approach, where fraudsters impersonate someone, such as via text, or with an audio/video deepfake, as well as how it's executed, the specific types of consequences it has and how to defend against it;\nYou'll learn about the hyper-personalization approach, where fraudsters create messages or bait that is targeted at a person's specific tastes or preferences, as well as how it's executed, the specific types of consequences it has and how to defend against it;\nYou'll learn about the emotional manipulation approach, where fraudsters create content made to polarize someone in terms of emotions (positive or negative), to get them to make a rash decision without using logic, as well as how it's executed, the specific types of consequences it has and how to defend against it;\nYou'll learn about advanced pretexting, where the fraudster uses an excuse/pretext to obtain information - but a very realistic one created with generative AI - as well as how it's executed, the specific types of consequences it has and how to defend against it;\nYou'll learn about automated/scalable attacks, where fraudsters simply overwhelm defenses by launching attacks en masse, causing disruption and straining resources, as well as how it's executed, the specific types of consequences it has and how to defend against it;\nYou'll learn about defending your organization with awareness and training, but specifically educating employees on the specific social engineering approaches that leverage generative AI, as well as including these in training programs, and motivating employees to be skeptical and report suspicious situations without pushback;\nYou'll learn about defending your organization with text corroboration, verifying facts and context in communications sent, either with manual search or automated retrieval of facts, as well as pointers that can be used to identify suspicious inconsistencies in generative text (in the conclusions, in the facts, in the possible lack of congruence with similar communications, etc);\nYou'll learn about defending your organization with mannerism analysis, analyzing nuances and incongruencies in someone's speech patterns, facial expressions, and/or body language gestures and posture, identifying telltale signs of AI-generated audio and video;\nYou'll learn about defending your organization with identify verification measures - a practice that is standard, but that is not enough anymore, as-is, in a world where fraudsters can imitate someone's likeness in a realistic manner;\nYou'll learn about defending your organization with technological defenses that can automate some of the flagging and removal of generative content, including content analysis tools, automated deepfake detectors, and/or behavioral analysis tools that can detect anomalies in behavior;\nYou'll learn about defending your organization with policies and culture, defining specific types of generative threats and controls for each, defining strict processes with no exceptions, and promoting a culture of reporting suspicious actions (even with high-status clients and executives!);\nYou'll learn about what changes, in an organization's defense strategy, due to generative AI threats - what are the defense mechanisms that stay the same in this \"new world\", and what are the defense mechanisms that are, additionally, necessary due to new generative threats;\nYou'll learn about an overview of the detection and triage of attacks for generative threats, including calculating risk levels for generative threats, prioritizing these threats and dealing with them, as well as the general process of detecting and integrating these threats in the organization;\nYou'll learn about an overview of responding to, and recovering from, social engineering attacks with generative AI, including steps such as containing or mitigating these threats, doing in-depth investigations, recovering from these, and making changes to defense mechanisms based on feedback;",

      "description": "Last Update: May 2024\n\n\nNotes:\nAlthough website hacking is covered in one of my other courses, that course only covers the basics where this course dives much deeper in this topic covering more techniques, more vulnerabilities, advanced exploitation, advanced post exploitation, bypassing security and more!\nThis course focuses on website hacking, I have a different course that teaches bug hunting from scratch.\n\n\nWelcome to my comprehensive course on Website hacking / penetration testing. This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in hacking, it starts with you from scratch and takes you step-by-step to an advanced level, being able to hack websites like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts!\n\n\nThis course is highly practical but doesn't neglect the theory, we'll start with basics to teach you how websites work  and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Apple Mac OS). Then we'll start hacking straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by discovering vulnerabilities and exploiting them to hack websites. No boring dry lectures\n\n\nBefore jumping into hacking, you'll first learn how to gather comprehensive information about the target website. Then the course is divided into a number of sections, each aims to teach you a common vulnerability from the OWASP top 10 most common security threats. Each section takes you through a number of hands-on examples to teach you the cause of the security bug or vulnerability and how to discover it and exploit it in a number of scenarios, from simple to advanced, ultimately allowing you to hack the target website. You'll also learn advanced techniques to bypass filters and security, escalate your privileges, access the database and much more post-exploitation techniques.  As we do this I will also introduce you to different hacking and security concepts, tools and techniques. Everything will be taught through examples and hands-on practicals, there will be no useless or boring lectures!\n\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of the course content:\n1. Information Gathering - In this section you'll learn how to gather comprehensive information about a target website, you'll learn how to discover its DNS information, the services used, subdomains, un-published directories, sensitive files, user emails, websites on the same server and even the hosting provider. This information is crucial as it expands the attack surface, increasing our changes of successfully hacking the target website.\n\n\n2. Discovery, Exploitation & Mitigation - In this section you will learn how to discover, exploit and mitigate a common vulnerabilities from the OWASP top 10 most common security threats. This section is divided into a number of subsections. Each subsection takes you through a number of hands-on examples to teach you the cause of the vulnerability, how to discover it and how to exploit it in a number of scenarios, from simple to advanced, ultimately allowing you to hack the target website. You'll also learn advanced techniques to bypass filters and security. Finally we will analyse the code causing these vulnerabilities and d,\nHere's a list of the main vulnerabilities that will be covered in this section.\nInformation Disclosure.\nFile upload.\nCode Execution.\nLocal File Inclusion.\nRemote File Inclusion.\nSQL Injection.\nCross Site Scripting (XSS).\nInsecure Session Management.\nBrute Force & Dictionary Attacks.\nCSRF (Client-Side Request Forgery).\n\n\n3. Post Exploitation - In this section you will learn what can you do with the access you gained by exploiting the above vulnerabilities. You will learn how to convert reverse shell access to a Weevely access and vice versa,  how to execute system commands on the target server, navigate between directories, access other websites on the same server, upload/download files, access the database and even download the whole database to your local machine. You will also learn how to bypass security, privilege escalation and do all of the above with limited permissions on the server !\n\n\nYou'll use the following tools to achieve the above:\nKali Linux.\nWeevely.\nTHC-Hydra .\nNetcat .\nDev tools.\nBurp Suite.\nOWASP Zap.\nMetasploit.\nBeEF.\nDirb.\nMaltego.\nKnockpy.\n\n\nWith this course you get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\nCheckout the curriculum and the course teaser for more info!\n\n\nNotes:\nThis course is created for educational purposes only and all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against systems that I have permission to test.\nThis course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih & zSecurity, no other organization is associated with it or a certification exam. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that NO OTHER ORGANIZATION IS INVOLVED.",

      "description": "Just updated with all modern Bug Bounty and Penetration Testing tools and best practices! Join a live online community of over 900,000+ students and a course taught by industry experts. This course will take you from absolute beginner, all the way to becoming a security expert and bug bounty hunter to improve security for your clients and any future web applications you may create!\n\nThis course is focused on learning by doing. We are going to teach you how penetration testing works, by actually practicing the techniques and methods used by bug bounty hunters today. We will start off by creating our virtual hacking lab to make sure we keep your computers safe throughout the course, as well as doing things legally, and having our computers set up for penetrations testing.\n\nWe dive into topics like:\n\n\n1) Introduction To Bug Bounty:\nHere we just touch on theory of what exactly is Bug Bounty and Penetration Testing\nQuick example of one vulnerability that we will cover.\nPen Tester career path.\n\n\n2) Our Virtual Lab Setup:\nCreate our virtual lab that we will use throughout the course (Kali Linux machine).\nInstall a vulnerable VM called OWASPBWA that we will attack.\nCreate an online account on TryHackMe platform.\nWith almost  every vulnerability, we will cover an example on TryHackMe and also on our vulnerable Virtual Machine.\nFrom here choose 2 different paths depending on the knowledge that you already have.\n\n\n3) Website Enumeration & Information Gathering\nThis is where we start with the practical Bug Bounty/ Website Penetration Testing. We cover numerous tactics and tools that allow us to gather as much information about a certain website. For this, we use different tools like Dirb, Nikto, Nmap. We also use google hacking which is useful skill to have once tools are not available.\n\n\n4) Introduction To Burpsuite\nThis is a very important tool for a Bug Hunter. Pretty much every Bug Hunter out there knows about this tool (and probably uses it). It has many different features that make hunting for bugs easier. Some of those features are crawling the webpage, intercepting and changing HTTP requests, brute-force attacks and more.\n\n\n\n5) HTML Injection\nThis is our first bug. It's also one of the easiest so we start with it. HTML injection is essentially just finding a vulnerable input on the webpage that allows HTML code to be injected. That code is later rendered out on the page as real HTML.\n\n\n6) Command Injection/Execution\nOur first dangerous bug. Injecting commands is possible when server runs our input through its system unfiltered. This could be something like a webpage that allows us to ping other websites but doesn't check whether we inputed a different command other than the IP address that it needs. This allows us to run commands on the system, compromise system through a reverse shell and compromise accounts on that system (and all the data).\n\n\n7) Broken Authentication\nThis is another vulnerability that occurs on websites. It essentially refers to weakness in 2 areas session management and credential management. It allows the attacker to impersonate legitimate users online. We show different examples through cookie values, HTTP requests, Forgot password page etc.\n\n\n8) Brutefroce Attacks\nThis can be a problem even if the website is secure. If client has an easy and simple password set, then it will be also easy to guess it. We cover different tools used to send lots of password on the webpage in order to break into an account.\n\n\n\n9) Sensitive Data Exposure\nThis isn't a vulnerability in the system. Instead it's when developers forget to remove important information during production that can be used to perform an attack. We cover an example where developer forgot to remove the entire database from being accessible to regular users.\n\n\n10) Broken Access Control\nAccess control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing a business function outside of the limits of the user. Here we cover a vulnerability called Insecure direct object reference. A simple example would be an application that has user IDs in the URL. If it doesn't properly store and manage those IDs an attacker could potentially change the ID and access the information of another user.\n\n\n11) Security Misconfiguration\nWe put this as a separate section, however all the previous vulnerabilities also belong to it. Here we show an example of a vulnerability where the admins of websites haven't changed the default credentials for a certain application that runs on their server.\n\n\n\n12) Cross Site Scripting - XSS\nThis is a big vulnerability and is very common in many websites out there. This vulnerability allows us to execute Javascript code on the webpage. This is due to user input not  being well filtered and processing the input as javascript code. There are 3 main types of XSS which are Stored, Reflected and DOM based XSS. We cover these 3 plus some unusual ones.\n\n\n\n13) SQL Injection\nAnother big vulnerability out there and a really dangerous one. Many websites communicate with the Database, whether it being a database that stores product information or user information. If the communication between the user and the database is not filtered and checked, it could allow the attacker to send an SQL query and communicate with the database itself, allowing them to extract the entire database or even delete it. There are couple of types of SQL injection such as Error based or Blind SQL injection.\n\n\n14) XML, XPath Injection, XXE\nXXE or XML External Entity is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with a website that processes XML data. It could allow the attacker to run a reverse shell or read files on the target system making it another severe vulnerability.\n\n\n\n\n15) Components With Known Vulnerabilities\nEven if the website might not be vulnerable, the server might be running some other components/applications that have a known vulnerability that hasn't been patched yet. This could allow us to perform various types of attacks depending on what that vulnerability is.\n\n\n16) Insufficient Logging And Monitoring\nLogging and monitoring should always be done from security standpoint. Logging allows us to keep track of all the requests and information that goes through our application. This can help us determine whether a certain attack is taking place or if the attack already happened, it allows us to examine it a little deeper, see which attack it was, and then apply that knowledge to change the application so that the same attack doesn't happen again.\n\n\n\n17) Monetizing Bug Bounty Hunting\nAfter practicing and covering all the vulnerabilities, it's important to mention how we can monetize our knowledge. We mention different platforms that can be used to start your career as a bug hunter, and we also take one platform as an example to show how a bug bounty program looks like and what to pay attention to when applying.\n\n\n\n18) Bonus - Web Developer Fundamentals\nFor anyone lacking some knowledge in Web Development or knowledge in how exactly websites work and are structured\n\n\n19) Bonus - Linux Terminal\nFor anyone lacking some knowledge in simple usage of linux terminal as we will be using it throughout the course\n\n\n20) Bonus - Networking\nFundamentals of networking and some basic terms used as Penetration Testers or Bug Bounty hunters.\n\n\n\n\nWe guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online course on bug bounty hunting, penetration testing, and web security skills! Have a look at the course outline video to see all the topics we are going to cover, all the projects we’re going to build, and all the techniques you’re going to learn to become a top penetration tester!\n\n\nTaught By:\n\nAndrei is the instructor of the highest rated technical courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.\n\n\nHaving been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time. Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.\n\n\nAndrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.\n\n\nTaking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.\n\n\n\n\nAleksa is a Penetration Tester with over 5 years of experience in Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security. As a self made hacker that started from a young age he has learned it all from Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security to Online Privacy and How To Become Anonymous Online.\n\n\nHe has worked and discovered vulnerabilities for multiple companies and governments. He also worked as a freelancer that tested private web applications. He believes that Online Security and Privacy is something valuable but also that it doesn't get enough attention as many cyber attacks are being executed every single day! No System is Safe and that is why we are here to discover vulnerabilities and secure them before the bad guys attempt anything malicious!\n\n\nHis main goal as an instructor is to teach the foundations of Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security to anyone who wants to pursue this as a career or wants to learn it to protect themselves online. Cyber attacks and online security is something that changes really fast so we as hackers must always be ready to learn new things in order to better protect Networks, Websites, Machines .. and also people!\n\n\nSee you inside the courses!",

We also look forward to other courses offered- Mashaal Al Otaibi\n************************************\n★★★★★\nI love this course. I am continuously repeating my course in a regular interval to enrich my depth of knowledge.\nThanks!- SHEIKH MD. MAHTABUR RAHMAN\n************************************\n★★★★★\nI don't know how to explain my words how i felt while learning this course.... If you want to learn something i will recomended to all of you chose it... If you have a little exprince in this field then you will understand the value of this course. I'm not promoting this course. I'm sharing my words with all of you. I'm impressed with the instructor of this course very responsive and friendly. I really like your course and I would like to thank you for making this kind of courses and being friendly with us. Thank you so much. - Tabish Raza\n************************************\n★★★★★\ni got very experience instructor and i got to learn some new stuff\nand my instructor hope that ill put my name in world class list\nso i would like to thank my instructor and udemy\ni really enjoyed it\nthank you very much- Halal Rajan\n************************************\n★★★★★\nThis is a great and powerful course. A lot of helpful tips on securing our computer and on how hackers hack.Thank you.- Bobbie Smith\n************************************\n★★★★★\nit's a very good course really it's your gate to be a pro in hacking whatever your knowledge- Serag El-Din\n************************************\n★★★★★\nWell done! Labs are well explained, and very clear.\n************************************\n\n\nHi everybody, Welcome to your course, if you are reading this course it's sure that you want to get more information and to be sure about what you will buy, and that's exactly what a reasonable student will do, so let me tell you what the course offers, and then you can make your reasonable choice!\n\n\nWhy you should take this course:\nI won't lie to you, this course is not a complete course of Ethical Hacking, and I don't believe that there is one! but it explains a big part of Ethical hacking theoretically, and practically it will explain an excellent methods on hacking anonymously (How hackers hack without getting doubts on them). Sometimes it will be in a separated videos and sometimes in a process.\nThe advantage of the methods showing on the course is that they are flexible, which means that they can work on other Ethical Hacking operations (For example I practiced an anonymous hacking operation on a windows machine, which can be done in the same way just by changing the windows malware by an android malware).\nI had the choice to create a basic classic long Ethical Hacking course, or explaining the best useful hacking tricks (Because there are a lot of things that are explained but mostly they are old,useless and not effective now), for me I choose to not waste my time and keep with the best methods, and understand the concept of the old ones just theoretically.\nThis course will explain everything from the pre-hacking to preform your hack successfully, everything is explained from scratch.\nAlso, the course will explain every Linux commands that i have used (so we can chase two birds with one stone), and uses diagrams (in paint xD, yeah I like to draw! it gives me the total freedom).\nThis course won't teach only how to use the Ethical Hacking strategies in your computer, but offers you the ability to learn how to use those hacking strategies also in your android device through Termux environment (so you can consider it as three birds with one stone ;) ).\nWhile this course is not a \"Classic Learning Course\"; like I have mentioned before it explains the best anonymous hacking methods (undoubtedly), so it can help both; beginners and advanced students that maybe don't know this methods.\nI'm kind of a careful teacher; which means I like to make sure that all my students understand what I'm explaining, so if you are the kind of persons who needs more talk and deep explanation to understand then I guarantee you that you have found the right instructor!\nI want to mention negative points too (I like to be honest), this is my first online course ever; so maybe someones of you will find me kind awkward xD in the first lectures, also I have explained the hacking methods from scratch, so if you are kind of advanced you will waste some time on somethings that you already know before the hacking process starts, another thing is that sometimes I repeat somethings that are very important in more than one lecture (somethings that takes 5-8 seconds). That's it! personally I think that those are the negative points on the course.\n\n\nI didn't wont to write the lectures descriptions, because they are already written down on the curriculum (I don't want to waste your time twice), so for more information don't forget to visit the it, read the titles and make your choice, and don't forget the 30 days money back guarantee :) ... Make your reasonable choice, and I hope I will meet you down in the Lectures ;)\n#PEACE",

      "description": "Learn to Setup pfSense Open Source Firewall, Configurations, Captive Portal etc in an Actual as well as Virtual Scenario.\n\n\nHello..  This is Abhilash Nelson and welcome to my new course 'pfsense Beginner to Master'.\nLets see what are the topics that are included in this course..\n\n\nIn session 1 & 2 , we will see what exactly is a firewall. The concept behind a firewall. Why should we use a firewall in our network and why are we choosing pfsense as our firewall. The specialities, the features of pfsense.\n\n\nIn the third session we will see how we can download pfsense Community Edition from the website and then create a bootable USB drive using the downloaded file so that we can use this bootable USB drive to install pfsense in our computer.\n\n\nIn the next session, we will see how we can install an additional ethernet card in your PC, so that we can have the incoming connection coming in through the first ethernet card and the outgoing connection going out through the second ethernet port of our computer\n\n\nIn the next session we will have a discussion about the network plan that we are going to include in our actual network scenario and the devices that we are going to use in the network and how we can make the connections between the devices that we are going to include in our actual network scenario.\n\n\nFrom the session 6 to session 11, we will see how we can boot using our bootable USB drive, then go ahead with installing pfsense in our computer. We will also setup the WAN network as well as the LAN network so that we can have the internet connection, coming from the WAN network, going through our pfsense and into our Local Area Network, that is our LAN network.\n\n\nAnd the problem with this kind of configuration is that if you want to do a quick learning of pfsense, it will not be a practical option to set all these gadgets and set all these network. The exact lab set up that we had here for the actual configuration, we are going to do it in the virtual environment.\n\n\nFrom session 12 to 17 we will try to setup the exact scenario that we had in our actual Lab into our virtual environment using VirtualBox. We will be downloading VirtualBox from the Oracle website. We will also be downloading pfsense Community Edition. Then we will be downloading Ubuntu which is our client computer and we will be installing both pfsense as well as Ubuntu into our virtual machines so that we can have the pfsense as well as a client computer.\n\n\nFrom sessions 18 to 20, we will discuss and explore the most commonly used pfsense console options and configurations. We will also see the Web Wizard that will appear for the first time you install and also how you can configure the Web Dashboard to your liking.\n\n\nFrom sessions 21 till 27, we will see the advanced system configuration options and administrative options. We will also see package manager by using it you can install new packages and get the new features and also we will see the gateways, where you can configure the gateway options and User Manager where you can edit, delete, activate and de-activate new users. We will also see the interface options and interface assignments. And port forward which allows you to forward port using your firewall.\n\n\nIn session 28 and 29, we will setup and configure captive portal, which is one of the coolest functionalities available with pfsense. We can setup it for institutions like hotels or schools, where you can make the user login to the system using a username and password. Or you can also create voucher codes. The user can use the voucher code, or else he can use the username and password to login to the system so that he can access metered internet connection.\n\n\nIn session 30, we will see miscellaneous pfsense options like  load balancing. We will also see an important to take backup of your configuration and restore it using the web interface as well as using the command line interface.\n\n\nIn sessions 31 and 32, we will implement website blocking functionality for the whole network using pfsense plugin called pfblocker, where you can block from a list of websites and also you can include individual domain names and block that particular domain name in the network.\n\n\nSo overall, this course will be a great place to start your journey with pfsense firewall. We will be also be providing you with a course completion certificate which you can include in your Network Administration portfolio and will add more weightage to your portfolio.\n\n\nSo see you soon in the class room. Have a great time.
