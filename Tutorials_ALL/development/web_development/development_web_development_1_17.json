It is used for:\n\n\nweb development (server-side),\nsoftware development,\nmathematics,\nsystem scripting.\n\n\nWhat can Python do?\n\n\nPython can be used on a server to create web applications.\nPython can be used alongside software to create workflows.\nPython can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\nPython can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\nPython can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\nPython works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\nPython has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\nPython has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\nPython runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\nPython can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n\n\nDjango is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.",

      "description": "In this course, using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 for Web, you learn the fundamentals of programming using Microsoft Razor. This course uses the very powerful \"Step Into\" feature of Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. This debugger approach ensures you can observe the code execute line by line, so it's behavior is very clear and predictable. Why should you learn this language? Because Razor is a simplified syntax version of Microsoft C#, and Razor is widely used in many modern web architectures like MVC. However, Razor is also less intimidating than C#, so you'll get cracking in no time. Along the way, you'll get exposure to technologies like HTML, CSS, JQuery and SQL. These are all essential technologies in the world of web development. And, of course,you learn to use Microsoft Visual Studio, which is one of the most powerful, and widely used programming environments in use today, and well into the future. Let's get coding!",

This test has been designed for HTML Certification, HTML Exam, Exam 98-383, MTA, Interviews, Web Development, Entrance Exams, Private Exams, Competitive and Academic Exams.\nHypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.\nHTML Elements: An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag: <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>\nHTML Attributes: HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name=\"value\"\nHTML Headings: HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage. HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.\nHTML Paragraphs: A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text. The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.\nHTML Styles: The HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.\nHTML Text Formatting: HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.\nHTML Quotation and Citation Elements: In this course we will go through the <blockquote>,<q>, <abbr>, <address>, <cite>, and <bdo> HTML elements.\nHTML Comments: HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.\nHTML Colors: HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.\nHTML Styles - CSS: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.\nHTML Links: Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.\nHTML Images: Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.\nHTML Tables: HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns. The <table> tag defines an HTML table.\nHTML Lists: An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag. The list items will be marked with bullets.\nHTML Block and Inline Elements: Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.\nThere are two display values: block and inline.\nHTML Iframes: An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.

Resource Efficiency: Docker is lightweight and fast. Process level isolation and usage of the container host’s kernel is more efficient when compared to virtualizing an entire hardware server using VM.\nDocker Architecture and its Taxonomy\nDocker Engine is a client-server application with these major components:\n• A server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process.\n• A REST API that specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it on what to do.\nCreate an Image Manually\nStep 1: Update the Code\n1. Create a New Project - HelloWebApp dotnet new MVC -n HelloWebApp\n2. Add docker file as below Dockerfile\nAzure Pipeline for Build and Publish Docker Image to Docker Hub\nAzure Pipelines can be used to build images for any repository containing a Dockerfile. The building of both Linux and Windows containers is possible based on the agent platform used for the build.\n\n\nDeploying to Web App\nYou can automatically deploy your application to an Azure Web App for Linux Containers after every successful build.",

While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.\nGraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, not endpoints. Access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint. GraphQL uses types to ensure Apps only ask for what’s possible and provide clear and helpful errors. Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code.\nSend a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less. GraphQL queries always return predictable results. Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the server.\nIn this tutorial we will learn how to develop graphql applications using python & fastapi.",

Sign up now to learn valuable skills no one can take away from you.\nIn Part 1, you learn Kotlin, the brand-new programming language for Android app development that is taking Java by storm.\n\nPart 1 is devoted to Kotlin's language basics and comparing the syntax to Java. We target beginners and cover core topics in depth.\nIf you're an intermediate or advanced coder, you can watch the videos at a faster speed using the Speed tool. We encourage you to follow along with the coding as we show you Kotlin's unique syntax.\n\nWhat Will I Learn?\n1. The major concepts involved with variables, basic types of variables, more advanced types, Kotlin's new syntax for variables, and how we can use variables differently in Kotlin than you may have already seen in other programming languages.\n2. Collection types, which Kotlin allows us to customize. We'll begin by looking at the simple collection types and then look at more advanced ones.\n3. Control flow. Kotlin has some new statements not found in Java. Kotlin also provides the brand-new ability to turn control flow statements into expressions, which is a powerful capability that has a lot of potential. We will look at the basics and syntax, always relating back to real-life examples.\n4. Functions, which have significant syntax differences in Kotlin. Beginners will learn how to use functions, and more advanced developers will benefit from the introduction to Kotlin's new syntax.\n5. Classes, objects, and other structures available in Kotlin.\nIncluded in this course is material for beginners to get comfortable with the interfaces.

to get the most benefit, consider making your submissions public so everyone can participate in the discussion.\nI've tried to speak somewhat slowly to make the videos easier to follow if English is not your primary language, and there are captions in all videos to help as well.  If your primary language is English, you may want to use the video controls to quicken the playback speed to something more comfortable.\n\n\nThe Tech Stack\nThis course is not about any specific tech stack!  You can use these techniques with any language or framework you are using to create modern web services or applications.\nFor the examples, I will be using the C# language , Web API for .NET Framework for the web service framework, some Microsoft Azure features, and Microsoft SQL Server database--  but you don't need to know anything about C#, Web API framework, Azure or SQL Server to be able to follow what is happening in the examples since the discussion will be at a higher level.  Remember, this course is for thinking about architecture and design, not writing or reviewing code.\n\n\nReal World Focus\nMy \"Real World\" courses specifically target working developers solving actual problems in typical business programming scenarios.  They are uniquely designed to cover areas you don't find in other courses on similar topics, from the specific viewpoint of developers who need to translate theory into practical application to solve the kinds of problems the \"overview\" courses don't help with.  I assume you already know how to program and have built working commercial systems-- you won't find any \"Hello, world\" here!",

They enable seamless communication between different software components, allowing for the integration of services, data sharing, and the creation of dynamic and interactive user experiences. Whether you're a frontend developer looking to expand your skill set, a backend developer aiming to master API creation, or an aspiring full-stack developer, understanding how to build and manage APIs is essential. This course, \"API Development Essentials: Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL,\" is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills you need to design, build, and optimize RESTful APIs using some of the most powerful and widely-used technologies in the industry.\nWhat You Will Learn:\nThe course begins with an introduction to the core concepts of APIs and REST (Representational State Transfer). You'll explore what an API is, how it functions, and why RESTful APIs have become a standard for building scalable and maintainable applications. The principles of REST, such as statelessness, resource-based architecture, and proper use of HTTP methods, will be covered in detail, providing a solid foundation for your API development journey.\nNext, you'll set up your development environment, starting with Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime that allows you to build server-side applications with ease. You'll learn how to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), explore the basics of asynchronous programming in Node.js, and understand how to work with Node.js modules to structure your applications effectively. The course will also guide you through the installation of essential tools like Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor, Postman, a tool for testing APIs, and nodemon, a utility that helps manage your development workflow by automatically restarting the server when code changes.\nWith your development environment ready, you'll dive into database management with PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source relational database system. You'll learn how to install PostgreSQL, connect to it using the Psql Shell, create roles (user accounts), and manage databases and tables. This section will also cover basic SQL operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting data, setting the stage for integrating your database with a Node.js application.\nThe heart of the course lies in building an Express.js server and connecting it to your PostgreSQL database. Express.js is a flexible and minimal web application framework for Node.js, making it easier to create robust APIs. You'll install Express.js and the node-postgres (pg) library, which allows Node.js to interact with PostgreSQL. You'll then create an application file, start the Express server, and connect it to your database.\nOnce your server is up and running, you'll move on to implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. You’ll create API endpoints to perform these operations on your PostgreSQL database, learning how to structure your routes and organize your code for scalability and maintainability. Testing the functionality of your API using Postman will ensure that your endpoints are working correctly and efficiently.\nBeyond the basics, this course will also cover performance optimization and security best practices. You'll learn caching strategies to improve the responsiveness of your APIs, and you’ll implement security measures to protect your endpoints from common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally, you'll explore rate limiting and throttling techniques to prevent abuse and ensure your API can handle high traffic loads.\nWho This Course Is For:\nThis course is ideal for anyone who wants to gain practical experience in building RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. Whether you're a beginner eager to dive into backend development or an experienced developer looking to enhance your skills, this course provides a comprehensive and hands-on learning experience. By the end of this course, you'll have the confidence to build and deploy your own APIs, integrate them with front-end applications, and optimize them for performance and security.\nJoin us in \"API Development Essentials: Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL,\" and take your development skills to the next level.",

It can also read and modify files.\nPython can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\nPython can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\nWhy Python?\nPython works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\nPython has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\nPython has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\nPython runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\nPython can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n\n\nDjango is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.\nRidiculously fast: Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.\nReassuringly secure: Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes.\nExceedingly scalable: Some of the busiest sites on the web leverage Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale.\n\n\nFlask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.\nHeroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.\nGit is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\nGitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features",

Whether you're taking your very first steps into coding or looking to solidify and expand your existing knowledge, we'll guide you through every essential concept and advanced technique.\n\n\nIn today's digital landscape, PHP powers a vast majority of the internet, making it an indispensable skill for anyone aspiring to build impactful web applications or pursue a thriving career in web development. This course isn't just about learning syntax; it's about understanding the \"why\" and \"how\" behind creating efficient, secure, and scalable solutions.\n\n\nWe start right at the beginning, assuming no prior programming experience. You'll lay a rock-solid foundation by mastering core PHP concepts: understanding variables, data types, operators, control structures (like if/else statements and loops), and functions. We'll demystify how PHP interacts with web servers, processes user input, and generates dynamic HTML. You'll gain a firm grasp of debugging techniques and best practices for writing clean, readable code that any developer can understand.\n\n\nAs your skills grow, we'll seamlessly transition into the more advanced realms of PHP. You'll delve deep into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), learning to design and implement classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism – principles that are crucial for building maintainable and modular applications.\n\n\nA significant portion of the course is dedicated to database integration with MySQL, teaching you how to connect PHP applications to databases, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and secure your data effectively. You'll also explore error handling and exception management, ensuring your applications are robust and user-friendly, even when things go wrong.\n\n\nBeyond the core language, we'll equip you with practical, real-world skills. You'll learn about working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to connect your PHP applications with external services, understand session management for user authentication, and implement crucial security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities.\n\n\nWe'll touch upon modern PHP development practices, including the use of Composer for dependency management, and introduce you to the concepts of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, setting you up for success with popular PHP frameworks.\n\n\nBy the end of this immersive experience, you won't just have theoretical knowledge; you'll have a portfolio of practical projects and the confidence to tackle real-world development challenges.\n\n\nYou'll be ready to build anything from dynamic blogs and e-commerce platforms to custom content management systems and sophisticated web services.\n\n\nThis course is ideal for:\n\n\nAbsolute beginners with no prior coding experience who are eager to start their journey in web development.\nFront-end developers looking to expand their skillset and become full-stack developers.\nAspiring backend developers who want to build a strong foundation in PHP.\nAnyone who dreams of creating their own dynamic websites and web applications.\n\n\nDon't just learn PHP – master it. Join us and transform your passion for technology into powerful web solutions. Enroll today and start building the future of the web!",

With a focus on declarative programming, ES6 empowers developers to create robust applications with enhanced speed and ease. This course dives deep into the key changes ES6 introduced, laying the foundation for modern JavaScript development.\nKey highlights of the course include:\nVariable Hoisting and Scoping: Learn how ES6 introduced new keywords to improve variable handling, enabling more efficient hoisting and scoping for local, block-level, and global variables.\nSimplified Functions: Understand the new syntax for function creation, with an emphasis on arrow functions and their streamlined syntax, improving code readability and simplifying the usage of this in JavaScript.\nHandling Asynchronous Operations: Explore how ES6 tackled common pitfalls like callback hell by introducing Promises, offering a cleaner and more maintainable way to handle asynchronous code.\nObject-Oriented Programming: Dive into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) within JavaScript, understanding how ES6 makes it easier to work with objects, classes, and inheritance.\nEnhanced Efficiency with Built-in Methods: Discover the power of new ES6 methods that simplify common tasks, reduce redundant code, and enhance overall performance.\nReal-World Applications with ES6: See how modern libraries like React have embraced ES6 syntax and features to make development more intuitive and efficient.\nWhile newer JavaScript features continue to emerge, ES6 remains the cornerstone of modern JavaScript programming, offering a solid foundation for developers looking to build scalable, maintainable applications. Join us in mastering ES6 and stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving world of web development.",

I have B.s.c + M.s.c in mechanical engineering. I have been making software applications for over 20 years in the Hi-Tec industry and have much teaching experience. You can trust me and my teaching methods. I have learned many technologies in the past (check my LinkedIn profile), and I know exactly what is needed to learn and how.\n\n\nIn this course, I show you three practical examples, actually three web pages, and walk you step by step through how to improve their load time and responsiveness so that they will reach a performance score of 99-100\n\n\nEvery website has a front-end side. The front end comprises files: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Fonts, and Images. These files have a huge effect on how fast your web pages load and respond and this will be the focus of this course.\n\n\nThere is a lot of theory behind web performance and most courses concentrate on theory, but not this course. This course concentrates on real life - you have a web page with bad performance and you want to improve its load time and responsiveness.\n\n\nWhen you come to handling web performance issues you need to answer all the following questions which most developers do not have answers to:\n- How to measure performance straightforwardly?\n- How to analyze performance?\n- How to fix the performance issues and reach a performance score of 100 using a clear procedure.\nAll of these questions will be demonstrated and answered in this course using three web pages.\n\n\nTo make you an expert on this issue we will learn the following concepts\n- Core Web Vitals, in particular: LCP, CLS, TBT\n- Measure performance correctly using Page Speed Insight and Lighthouse\n- Analyze web performance using WebPageTest\n- Learn a clear procedure that will lead you to improve the webpage performance score to 100\n- Convert image format to WEBP format and how to crop image file using the image processing package - sharp\n- Lazy load images using HTML properties\n- Use responsive images and srcset for smart image loading per viewport\n- Reduce CSS file size using purgeCSS\n- Minimize JavaScript and CSS files using the bundler\n- Improve SEO, accessibility, and best practices\n- Track unused CSS and javascript using Chrome dev tools\n- Remove unused JavaScript function using Tree Shaking\n- Use Chrome Dev Tools to pinpoint functions that consume a lot of CPU\n- Optimizes load of web font using self-host and woff2 format",

The course is taught by Darragh O'Neill a Udemy Instructor who has has received excellent reviews on the platform and has at present a 4.7 star rating.\nAs someone who was once new to JavaScript too Darragh knows how hard it can be to learn the language which is why every single line of code we write will be explained clearly and concisely in this course! JavaScript can be a difficult coding language to learn but I promise by the end of this course students will be much more confident working with JavaScript! We start off by learning about variables and the primitive data types of strings, numbers, boolean etc. before working with control flow and decision making concepts such as if statements and loops. The course then teaches students how to declare and invoke functions. We will also cover other topics such as working with Arrays and Objects and of course working with the Document Object Model (the 'DOM').\nThe course also contains several mini-projects and challenges so we can apply the JavaScript syntax that we have learnt. The course has overs 13+ hours of content and by the end of this course students will be familiar with all the fundamental aspects of the JavaScript language including data types, variables, let, const var, arrays, objects, functions, manipulating the DOM and more.",

This allows when user clicks on a link, instead of loading a whole new page to see the expected content smoothly sliding in. This is especially useful for people who don't want to wait for too long, and are satisfied with having consistent visual design.\nThis video course will teach you how you can implement smooth scrolling into your website. You will learn how to use HTML5 in order to set up a website. Then with the help of JavaScript, you will learn how to code a fade-in and out page pre-loader and smooth scrolling functionality.\nNext, you will learn how to create and style inner pages: sample profile content and contact form before developing a mobile-friendly navigation menu again with the help of JavaScript.\nThe course is suitable for you if you would like to implement such website functionality in your portfolio, to improve an existing web page or create a modern product/service landing page. So, be welcome and let's start creating your custom smooth scrolling website!\nupdate: updated the JavaScript code to ES6.",

      "description": "Hi there,\n\nWelcome to my \"JPA, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot & Hibernate Basics From Scracth\" course.\nSpring Data JPA & PostgreSQL from scratch. Learn JPA & Spring Boot using Rest API project with all PostgreSQL details\n\n\nSpring Data JPA is a part of the larger Spring Data project, which aims to simplify data access and manipulation in Spring-based applications. Specifically, Spring Data JPA provides a high-level, abstracted approach to working with relational databases using the Java Persistence API\nIn the world of software development, simplification is often the key to productivity and efficiency. Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA are two powerful tools in the Spring Framework ecosystem that make it easier to develop robust and maintainable Java applications, especially when it comes to working with databases.\n\n\nSpring Boot: The Foundation of Modern Java Applications\nSpring Boot is a part of the Spring Framework that is designed to simplify the process of building production-ready applications. It achieves this by providing a set of conventions and tools to eliminate the need for extensive configuration, boilerplate code, and a steep learning curve .\nSpring Boot embraces the concept of \"opinionated defaults\" . It comes with predefined configurations for common scenarios, such as database connections, web servers, and templating engines . This allows developers to get started quickly without having to make countless decisions .\nOne of the standout features of Spring Boot is its auto-configuration. It automatically configures components based on the dependencies you include in your project. If you're using Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot will configure your data source, entity manager, and transaction management with sensible defaults.\nSpring Boot includes support for embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow . You don't need to deploy your application to an external server; Spring Boot packages the server with your application, making it easy to run and deploy.\n\n\nSpring Data JPA, a part of the Spring Data project, simplifies database access in Java applications, specifically when working with relational databases using the Java Persistence API (JPA) .\n\n\nPostgresql is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of Postgresql date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.\nPostgreSQL, like other relational and object-oriented databases, let non-IT specialists query databases. PostgreSQL is open-source, fault-tolerant, and supports location-based services.\nKnown for reliability, scalability, and robustness, PostgreSQL is widely used by organizations of all sizes for managing large and complex databases. This makes it well-suited for high-performance and mission-critical applications such as data warehousing, analytics, geospatial applications, and web services.\n\n\nPostrgeSQL comes with many features aimed to help developers build applications, administrators to protect data integrity and build fault-tolerant environments, and help you manage your data no matter how big or small the dataset. In addition to being free and open source, PostgreSQL is highly extensible. For example, you can define your own data types, build out custom functions, even write code from different programming languages without recompiling your database.\n\n\n\nIn JPA, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot & Hibernate Basics From Scracth course you will Learn;\nInstalling java jdk and most useful IDEs like eclipse and intellij.\nSpring Basics\nLombok\nPostman,\nDocker\nDBeaver\nSpring Rest API\nORM,\nJPA,\nHibernate\nSpring JPA Annotations\nSpring JPA Methods\nQuery methods and Finder methods\nSorting and pagination\nRelationships of Entities\nUsing JPA with different Databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, MSSQL\nBasic Relational Database Concepts\nNormalization\nPostgreSQL Basics\nDatabase Tools to Build Your Own Data Architecture\nPrivileges\nPartitioning\nInheritance\nRow Security Policies\nSimple Structure Of PostgreSQL\nHow To Construct Your Own Relational Data Set\nSQL Basics\nUsing SQL Objects Effectively\nDetails Of SQL Language.\nJoin Types\nSubqueries\nCombining Queries\nThe Groupby and having clauses\nGrouping Sets Cube And Rollup.\nSome Trip And Trick That Make the life easier for you when using postgresql\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine the benefits of Spring Data JPA\nRepository Abstraction\nSpring Data JPA introduces the concept of repositories. These are interfaces that define common database operations, such as saving, retrieving, and deleting entities. You can create custom repository interfaces to define your own data access methods, and Spring Data JPA generates the corresponding implementations.\n\n\nQuery Methods\nOne of the standout features of Spring Data JPA is the ability to define query methods by method naming conventions. It can derive queries from method names, which makes it easy to create custom queries without writing SQL or JPQL queries manually. For example, a method named findByLastName(String lastName) in a repository interface will automatically generate a query to retrieve entities by their last name .\n\n\nAutomatic CRUD Operations\nSpring Data JPA provides automatic implementations for common CRUD operations. You can save, retrieve, update, and delete entities with minimal code, allowing you to focus on your application's business logic.\n\n\nPagination and Sorting\nImplementing pagination and sorting for your queries is straightforward with Spring Data JPA. It abstracts the complexities of database-specific query syntax, making it easy to retrieve subsets of data.\n\n\nIntegration with Spring Framework\nSpring Data JPA seamlessly integrates with the broader Spring ecosystem. It works well with Spring's dependency injection, transaction management, and security features, creating a cohesive development experience .\n\n\nWhen you combine Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA, you get a powerful toolkit for building Java applications that interact with databases. Spring Boot provides a strong foundation for your application, with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and cloud-native support, while Spring Data JPA streamlines your data access, reducing the need for boilerplate code and manual SQL queries\nSo, this course will be a great chance for you to progress faster in the software world\n\n\nWe will start to our course with installing java jdk and most useful IDEs like eclipse and intellij. After that we will learn basic information about spring and Lombok to use in our training. Then we will examine some other tools or apps to use in our training like sts tool, Postman, Docker and postgre Database.\nAfter that we will learn basics of spring API . Because this training is about JPA and I want to teach Data jpa on API pages.\nThen we will start spring data JPA.\nWe will learn some programming concepts like ORM, JPA, Hibernate, Spring data jpa and we will examine differences between them.\nAfter that we will start to JPA with rest API on postgre SQL. We will learn spring annotations that used in JPA like\nEntity\nId\nTable\nColumn\nGenerated vale\nUnique constraint\nAuto Identity, Sequence.\nAlso we will examine JPA repository and most useful methods od JPA repository like\nSave\nFind by\nSave all\nFind all\nDelete\nDelete by Id\nCount and exist by Id.\nWe will continue with Query methods and Finder methods. After that we will continue with JPQL.\nThen we will learn sorting and pagination, relationships between tables like\nOne to one\nOne to many\nMany to one and many to many.\nAlso we will examine the search functionality, transaction management and unit testing.\nWe will make all operations with postgre SQL database. but also we will change our database with difference databases like mysql, mssql, mongo etc.\n\n\nTo summarize briefly, with this course you will learn how to perform spring data JPA operations with the Postgre database and using the PostgreSQL database with all its features. At the end of this course, you will have as much knowledge as a software developer who is an expert in JPA operations and a database administrator who is an expert in PostgreSQL operations.\n\n\nI think these are enough reasons to start the course. If you're ready, let's get started.\n\n\nWhat is Spring Boot and why it is used?\nJava Spring Boot (Spring Boot) is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier through three core capabilities: Autoconfiguration. An opinionated approach to configuration. The ability to create standalone applications.\n\n\nWhat is Spring Data JPA?\nSpring Data JPA, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA-based (Java Persistence API) repositories. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies. Implementing a data access layer for an application can be quite cumbersome.\n\n\nWhat is the use of JPA?\nThe Java Persistence API (JPA) is one possible approach to ORM. Via JPA the developer can map, store, update and retrieve data from relational databases to Java objects and vice versa. JPA can be used in Java-EE and Java-SE applications. JPA is a specification and several implementations are available.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between spring data JPA and Hibernate?\nWhat Is the Difference Between Hibernate and Spring Data JPA? Hibernate is a JPA implementation, while Spring Data JPA is a JPA Data Access Abstraction. Spring Data offers a solution to GenericDao custom implementations. It can also generate JPA queries on your behalf through method name conventions.\n\n\nWhy do we use spring JPA?\nSpring Data JPA aims to significantly improve the implementation of data access layers by reducing the effort to the amount that's actually needed. As a developer you write your repository interfaces, including custom finder methods, and Spring will provide the implementation automatically.\n\n\nWhat is difference between Spring and Hibernate?\nSpring is useful for transaction management, aspect-oriented programming, and dependency injection. Hibernate provides Object-Relational Persistence and Query service for applications. Spring has a number of modules such as Spring core, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring JDBC & more.\n\n\nWhat is PostgreSQL and why it is used?\nIt is a highly stable database management system, backed by more than 20 years of community development which has contributed to its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness. PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.\n\n\nWhy PostgreSQL is more popular?\nPostgreSQL is chosen by companies because it offers data types that MySQL does not, as well as many other features that are not offered in MySQL. Generally, however, MySQL is typically recommended for web-based/online or mapping functions, whereas PostgreSQL is recommended for large analytical processes.\n\n\nWhat is difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?\nPostgreSQL supports Python, PHP, Perl, Tcl, Net, C, C++, Delphi, Java, JavaScript (Node. js), and more. SQL Server is more limited, offering support for Java, JavaScript (Node. js), C#, C++, PHP, Python, and Ruby.\n\n\nWhat is PostgreSQL best for?\nKnown for reliability, scalability, and robustness, PostgreSQL is widely used by organizations of all sizes for managing large and complex databases. This makes it well-suited for high-performance and mission-critical applications such as data warehousing, analytics, geospatial applications, and web services.\n\n\nIs PostgreSQL enough to get a job?\nThe high estimated earnings are one of its many perks. The biggest advantage is you can build a really good career by learning even just PostgreSQL. A little hard work and ambition can lead you to the top and enable you to develop steadily. And as a result, you build a better life!\n\n\nIs PostgreSQL a programming language?\nPostgreSQL (pronounced post-gress-Q-L) offers the full functionality of Structured Query Language (SQL) — a standard programming language for database management — and many other feature enhancements and extensions.\n\n\nWhy learn PostgreSQL?\nIt is great for large datasets. It's less prone to data corruption. It's still the most advanced open-source RDBMS in the world. And it's an excellent choice for those who are new to SQL.\n\n\nIs PostgreSQL free?\nA: PostgreSQL is released under the OSI-approved PostgreSQL Licence. There is no fee, even for use in commercial software products. Please see the PostgreSQL Licence.\n\n\nDo companies use PostgreSQL?\nAround the world in 2023, over 58509 companies have started using PostgreSQL as relational-databases tool. Companies using PostgreSQL for relational-databases are majorly from United States with 22627 customers. 33.26% of PostgreSQL customers are from the United States.\n\n\nWhy do people prefer PostgreSQL?\nPostgreSQL has advanced features.\nPostgreSQL supports a huge number of features, many of which aren't available on other database systems. Just some examples of these include: Indexes that support different collations, types, access methods, and operators.\n\n\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy's seasoned instructors' expertise.\n\n\nFresh Content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge.

      "description": "I would like to introduce you to a brand new online course where you can learn to build a full-stack web application from scratch. You will develop a web-based scraping tool, where the users can copy and paste the URL and the software will generate the audio file. They can listen to it online or can download the same as per their requirement. Let me show you the demo of the project.\nI have always been a firm believer in learning by doing, and in this course, you will learn what you need to know by hands-on experience. You don’t need any special knowledge except basic computer skills to get started with this course. Every one of you comes from a different background and hence the course is crafted from basic to advanced level with minute detail in every lecture.\nHere are two main reasons, why you should take this course. The course will help you to level up your career as a full-stack developer. Python is the most popular programming language in the current market trends. Hence, the whole backend is written using Python, which will boost your programming skills.\nThis is a practical hands-on course, although you will spend some time dealing with theoretical concepts, the majority of the course will focus on writing code. You will first design the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and after completing this, you will code the back-end part using Python and the web-based framework flask. In the entire development phase, you will explore the process of web scraping, text-to-speech conversion, and will also address the security concerns of the web application.\nTo make the learning curve easier, The course has been divided into 5 sections. Then, let us see what we are going to learn in each section.\nIn the first section, we will get to know the problem statement and what solution we can provide by building the web application, thereafter we will understand the complete project structure. Upon completing this, we will explore the tools to be used for the project development. Here we will also get to know about the important features of the IDE which will help us in writing structured code.\nIn the second section, We will begin with the installation of the IDE and after that, we will proceed with the installation of the required libraries for the successful execution of the project. Thereafter, we will follow a practical approach to access the complete project structure in the Visual Studio code.\nFrom the third section, we will get our hands dirty, we will learn to code an interactive UI using HTML, and CSS. Also, we will test the front-end part without the back-end. By doing this, you will get, in-depth insight of front-end development.\nIn the fourth section, we will learn about back-end development and how to combine the backend with the front-end codes. By doing this you will leverage the power of full-stack development. You can add this skill to your resume to level up your career.\nIn the fifth section, We will dive into the deployment phase. We will first test the project on the local server and learn the kind of errors we can encounter during the execution of our application. Upon completing this, We will host the complete project on an online server, to access it globally. You will also get to know, how we can configure the project live on the server and view the desired output.\nEach video in the course will teach you new concepts and techniques which you may apply to any of your projects immediately. This course assumes just a basic knowledge of programming, and you can leave the rest to us. So if you are somebody who has never built a web application before, you need not to worry, I will be with you every step of the way.\nDon’t let technical errors hold you back from achieving your goals. If you ever need help, simply post your question in the question and answer section and our dedicated support team will get back to you within 24 hours. They are available to assist you 6 days a week, from Monday to Saturday.\nWe will also share the complete source code with you, so that you can easily replicate the project and practice on your own.\nAll lectures are accompanied by English subtitles, ensuring clear and comprehensive understanding.\nAlso if you don’t like the course, don’t worry at all, you are always protected by 30 days, no questions asked, money back guarantee.\nAlright, so at the end of the day, you have got nothing to lose, so join me in this incredible journey, into the world of full stack web development.\nTake control of your career and invest in your future. Don’t miss the opportunity to improve your skills. Enroll now and take the first step towards a better future.",

      "description": "WordPress started its journey as an open source blogging tool but now it has become more popular as a content management system (CMS). WordPress is built on PHP and MySQL. WordPress has really changed the way we do web development. WordPress’s content management system makes it easy for developers to create rich and interactive websites. WordPress basically provides us themes and framework which help us to reduce coding effort. WordPress also comes with library of plugins. These themes and plugins take care of most of the coding for us. As a result, web developers can save a lot of coding time and focus more into the design concepts. WordPress do not require any knowledge of programming languages and non-technical people are able to create web pages with the help of WordPress. WordPress is a free tool but WordPress training courses are pretty expensive. Erudeversity likes to keep the training part free as well.

This course is designed for learners who have a basic familiarity with Flexbox concepts and are ready to apply them through hands-on projects — no advanced experience required.\nRather than teaching every Flexbox property in isolation, this course focuses on applied layout thinking. Each project is inspired by real-world designs, showing how Flexbox can be used to recreate them in a clean, efficient way.\nWhat You'll Build:\nDay 1: Form layout with equal-width label and input columns\nDay 2: Multi-colored centered box layout\nDay 3: Triangle of colored circles layout\nDay 4: Symmetrical bricks layout\nDay 5: Old style mobile layout\nDay 6: Keyboard-style layout\nDay 7: Multi-colored steps layout\nDay 8: Responsive masonry grid layout\nDay 9: Responsive webpage design\nDay 10: Responsive dropdown navigation menu\nSome layouts are simple and straightforward, while others are more involved but all are designed to deepen your understanding of how Flexbox works in practical, everyday design scenarios. The course uses only HTML and CSS, with no frameworks or JavaScript required, making it perfect for focusing purely on core, practical layout skills.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have a solid understanding of Flexbox and the ability to confidently design your own flexible layouts — from structured forms to creative grids and navigation menus — without relying on frameworks.\nEnroll now and start building with CSS Flexbox.",

It is designed for software engineers, IT admins and enterprise application developers.\nIn the first section, we have learned what the course is about, what’s an enterprise app, how to take advantage of Azure free service offering so we can sign up for an account.\nIn the second section, we introduced Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Identity platform; We showed how to register an app with Azure Active Directory single sign-on; How to use Enterprise App to set up groups, roles and permissions. How to authorize a user and how to validate a token. There is so much information and features with Azure Active Directory, and it could be very confusing. Even though we only scratch the surface, what you have learned is important enough to get your project going.\n\n\nIn the third section, we explored the datastore options. We can choose Cosmos DB as our NoSQL database option, or use Azure SQL as your relational database. Of course, We can bring our own choice of databases, such as MongoDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL. For MongoDB, Azure has Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB. For MySQL or PostgreSQL, Azure provides fully managed, enterprise-ready community MySQL or PostgreSQL database as a service. Do check the pricing before you make a decision.\n\n\nIn the fourth section, we got to know Azure storages options. We introduced how to work with Azure blob storages for uploading, reading, deleting files. How to secure our file by setting right access controls. How to use event and queue feature in blob storage to monitor new files added or deleted from a blob container, and how we can poll messages from queue so we can do something with the files. And how to use Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer tool to explore our files.\n\n\nIn the fifth section, we introduced the message and event services in Azure: service bus, event hubs and event grid, the similarity, the difference and the best use cases. We also use live codes to demonstrate how to get it started.\n\n\nIn the sixth section, we discussed Azure DevOps for devOps. Azure DevOps has five main services. Azure board is for project management; Azure repos is for our code repositories; Azure Artifacts is for our private package; Azure Pipeline for continuous integration and delivery. Azure Testplans is for testing. All services are under one project, quite convenient in my opinion.\n\n\nIn the seventh section, we went over how to publish our app with Azure App Services. We talked about dockerifying our app, hosting docker images with Azure Container Registries, deploying and scale our app with App Services.\n\n\nWe didn’t forget logging and monitoring. In the eighth section, we integrated Application Insights in our frontend and backend app, which will telemetry logs, exceptions, request & response, crashes to Azure Logs. We can query logs and continuously export them to Azure Blob Container.",

In this course, we are going to learn FROM SCRATCH how you can implement a Redux store pattern in your Blazor app !\nIn the first module, we'll start from a classic Blazor app that communicates with an API. We'll quickly see what are the main issues with this way of creating Blazor. In this module, we will:\nCreate our first state from a blank C# class file\nCreate our first action from a blank C# class file\nCreate our first reducer from a blank C# class file\nCreate the service that will be used in our Blazor components\nModify the list component to use our Redux implementation\nExercise : try to update the list component for the delete action by using our Redux implementation\nAt the end of this first module, you'll understand the basics of a Redux implementation and how it can enhance your application performance.\nThe second module will be focused on using an open-source rock-solid library to enhance our implementation. You'll learn:\nHow to install and configure this library\nHow to mutate our state and reducer to be compatible with this library\nExercise : try to update the list component to use the open-source library\nAdding effects, a special kind of reducer, to handle asynchronous needs\nExercise : try to update the list component to use effect and respect the first SOLID principle (Single Responsibility)\nEnable ReduxDevTools to be able to time travel with your application\nCreating a middleware for the library to add custom behavior easily\nAt the end of this second module, you'll understand how to use this library effectivly and you'll be autonomous to implement a Redux store in your Blazor app.\nTo verify that you've mastered everything in the course, a complete independent exercise will the third and last module of the course, to let you practice.",

      "description": "Do you want to learn to implement GraphQL, React, Express, NodeJS and MongoDB in one project?\nWhy we need GraphQL?\nThe fact that clients can receive exactly the data they need from the API is frequently mentioned as a major benefit of GraphQL by developers. They are no longer reliant on REST endpoints that return predetermined and inflexible data structures. Instead, the client has control over the shape of the API response objects.\nWhy choose ReactJS?\nFacebook, Dropbox, Khan Academy, CodeAcademy, Netflix, Airbnb, PayPal, Walmart, Tesla Motors, IMDb, and more well-known companies and startups use React. React is used in a slew of well-known apps.\nWhy is this technology being used by so many excellent companies and startups? The answer is that it is unquestionably a high-quality frontend development tool.\nGiven that React is used by such well-known organizations as Facebook and PayPal, it must be a very helpful library.\nWhy learn NodeJS?\nNode. js may easily be used as a server-side proxy, handling a huge number of concurrent connections in a non-blocking manner. It's particularly handy for proxying various services with varying response times or collecting data from multiple sources.\n\n\nWhat we will learn inside in this course?\nWe will create a Todo app which level up your skill on creating a CRUD app which is useful for building almost different types of app like social media app, which also need to know how to implement CRUD operations.\nWe will walk through\nAt the server side\nCreate NodeJS server and install necessary framework like Express and other dependencies\nCreate typedefs and resolvers files\nMongoose and Model Setup\nConnecting to MongoDB\nFetch data with graphql\nCreate data(todo) using Mutations\nFetch a single data with Query\nDelete a todo with Mutations\nUpdate the data with Mutations\n\n\nAt client side\nCreate react app and add bootstrap\nInstall graphql and add custom CSS\nAdd Bootstrap list group\nInstall Apollo client\nCreate graphql query and mutation\nRender todos\nExtract  React components\nCreate a new todo\nDelete specific todo\nusing useRef to define area\nuse Context to store the selected Id\nChange UI according to selected id\nUpdate todo\nGet single todo and fix bugs\nIt's the most up-to-date and entertaining GraphQL course on the market, and it's backed by a 30-day Udemy money-back guarantee.",

      "description": "Hi there,\n\nWelcome to my \"Microservices | Spring Cloud Microservice with Rest API\" course.\nMicroservices & Spring boot | Learn Spring Cloud Microservice & Spring Framework with Rest API, ElasticSearch & RabbitMQ\n\n\nMicroservices is a growing standard in cloud based software design, used by several companies today. Microservices, or microservices architecture, is an approach to software and website development that breaks down a large project into multiple, independent chunks of code. Each code, called a microservice, gets developed to perform a specific function within the overall software package. Microservices, designed by separate teams, run independently and combine with other microservices to fulfill a larger goal. For example, an e-commerce site includes different functions to manage inventory, product catalogs, customer data, and billing information.\n\n\nMicroservices architecture is a software design approach where an application is divided into a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each of these services, known as microservices, focuses on a specific business capability or function. These microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, allowing them to work in harmony to deliver a complete application experience.\n\n\nWith a microservices approach to site development, they would get separately developed and tested before being combined to create the final website. Microservices get compared to “monolithic” software architecture, in which the entire software package gets developed as a single unit.\nMicroservices enables developers to break apart applications into a series of decoupled cloud services, containerizing each individual piece. Through this software design method, engineers can implement necessary software changes more swiftly than with standard system architecture.\n\nThe Spring Framework is a comprehensive framework for Java development that provides infrastructure support, enterprise-level features, and promotes the use of best practices in software design and architecture. It was created by Rod Johnson and was first released in 2003. The primary goal of the Spring Framework is to simplify the development of complex enterprise applications by providing a cohesive, modular, and extensible framework.\nWelcome to a transformative journey into Microservices Architecture, a paradigm shift that redefines how we build and deploy applications. Microservices Architecture, often hailed as the cornerstone of modern software development, offers a set of principles and practices that break down monolithic applications into smaller, independently deployable services.\n\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving technology landscape, where agility, scalability, and rapid development are paramount, traditional monolithic software architectures have started to show their limitations. Enter microservices architecture, a modern approach to building software applications that has gained immense popularity for its ability to address the challenges posed by monolithic systems and empower organizations to thrive in the digital age.\n\n\nLet's explore the advantages and considerations of Microservices First Advantages:\nScalability and Flexibility\nMicroservices enable horizontal scalability, allowing you to scale individual services based on demand. This flexibility ensures efficient resource utilization and responsiveness.\nModularity and Independence\nServices operate independently, promoting modularity. Developers can work on and deploy services independently, fostering parallel development and reducing dependencies.\nTechnological Diversity\nEmbrace a polyglot approach, choosing the right technology stack for each service. This flexibility enables optimal solutions for diverse business requirements.\nImproved Fault Isolation\nIsolate failures to specific services, preventing a single service failure from affecting the entire application. This enhances system resilience and fault tolerance.\n\n\nIn this Microservices course you will Learn;\nInstallations of the necessay applications\nDBeaver\nPostman\nLombok\nMicroservice Architecture\nMonolithic Architecture\nSpring Cloud Config\nEureka Server\nSwagger\nElastic Search\nContains Method\nMicroservice Communication\nOpenFeign\nRabbitMQ and Kafka\nZipkin\nSpring Cloud Gateway(Api Gateway)\nResilience4j(Circuit Breaker)\nQuick Microservice\n\n\nLet's continue with disadvantages and challenges\nIncreased Complexity in Deployment and Monitoring\nMicroservices introduce complexities in deployment, monitoring, and orchestration.

Each code, called a microservice, gets developed to perform a specific function within the overall software package. Microservices, designed by separate teams, run independently and combine with other microservices to fulfill a larger goal. For example, an e-commerce site includes different functions to manage inventory, product catalogs, customer data, and billing information. With a microservices approach to site development, they would get separately developed and tested before being combined to create the final website. Microservices get compared to “monolithic” software architecture, in which the entire software package gets developed as a single unit.\nWhat are the benefits of a microservices architecture?\nWhile a microservices architecture takes more initial planning than a monolithic architecture, it offers distinct advantages in large-scale systems. A microservices architecture breaks down complex software projects into smaller components. Because each microservice gets developed separately, the architecture facilitates faster development times as they get designed in parallel rather than in sequence. Since each microservice operates independently, the engineer can update one microservice without the changes causing problems with other microservices. That saves a lot of testing and debugging time in the overall software project. Finally, a microservices architecture helps development teams understand the general code easily, making the software easier to maintain and deploy.\nWhat careers use microservices?\nMicroservices are used primarily by software developers, especially front-end developers, back-end developers, and full-stack developers. DevOps engineers also get familiar with microservices—as tech companies implementing Agile and DevOps teams will more likely take advantage of microservices benefits. While a microservices architecture could theoretically get used for any software, web developers commonly create complex websites and web-based applications with it.\nWhat are some common tools to implement microservices?\nMicroservices architecture developers use various Java-based languages, libraries, and frameworks like React, Node.js, Spring Cloud, and Spring Boot since microservices help with software and application development. In addition, team communication remains critical when implementing microservices—the reason why development teams use tools such as Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ. Finally, containerization tools such as Kubernetes and Docker help developers manage the function, packaging, and collaboration of individual microservices.\nWhat is Spring Boot and why it is used?\nJava Spring Boot (Spring Boot) is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier through three core capabilities: Autoconfiguration. An opinionated approach to configuration. The ability to create standalone applications.\nWhat is PostgreSQL and why it is used?\nIt is a highly stable database management system, backed by more than 20 years of community development which has contributed to its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness. PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.\n\n\nWhy PostgreSQL is more popular?\nPostgreSQL is chosen by companies because it offers data types that MySQL does not, as well as many other features that are not offered in MySQL. Generally, however, MySQL is typically recommended for web-based/online or mapping functions, whereas PostgreSQL is recommended for large analytical processes.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy's seasoned instructors' expertise.\n\n\nFresh Content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge.

      "description": "Hi there,\nWelcome to the \"Complete Tailwind CSS Course From Scratch with Real Project\" course\nTailwind Css | Learn Modern CSS Framework Tailwind CSS using Flexbox, CSS Grid and build responsive modern styling sites\n\n\nTailwind CSS is an open-source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of \"utility\" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.\n\n\nFor example, in other traditional systems, there would be a class message-warning that would apply a yellow background color and bold text. To achieve this result in Tailwind, one would have to apply a set of classes created by the library: bg-yellow-300 and font-bold.\n\n\nWorking with Tailwind CSS encourages a more direct approach to styling. Instead of moving between HTML files and separate CSS stylesheets, developers can apply styles right within the HTML. This makes designing quicker and simpler. Tailwind CSS isn't tied to a specific JavaScript framework.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn to develop a web site with Tailwind CSS from scratch.\nIf you are thinking to start to learn Tailwind CSS, this course is the best match for you.\nWe have explained Tailwind CSS from beginner to all levels. We have explained all the topics as simple as possible with examples, slides, and diagrams.\nWe have created a lot of projects while explaining the subjects. Because we believe that applied educations are much more useful than other teaching methods.\n\n\nLet's talk about the course curriculum now.\nIn the first part of the course, we answer the question of what is a Framework. We explain the advantages of Tailwind CSS.\nIn the next section, we start learning the operations we will do with Tailwind CSS. To take this course, you need to have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. We will learn how the operations done with normal CSS are done with Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS has its own classes. We will explain these topics with the help of the document page. Because it is very important to be able to use document pages when you learn something new. It is not possible to explain any subject with all its subtleties. What we are trying to do is to teach you how to learn the subject. In doing so, it is necessary to talk about the most basic features.\nIn this tutorial, we will show you how to use the most common CSS features with Tailwind CSS. We will start working with text and color classes.\nThen we will start to see features that affect our overall page structure, such as flex and grid. To reinforce what we learned in the second part, in the third part we will create a beautiful website. This entire site will have a responsive design. While creating this application, we will also see a few topics that we did not see during the lecture.\nThus, when you complete our course, you will have learned how to integrate Tailwind CSS into applications and you will be able to create application interfaces with Tailwind CSS.\n\n\nNo Previous Knowledge is needed!\nYou don’t need to have previous knowledge about Tailwind CSS. This course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level with hands-on examples.\nYou will be confident in using Tailwind CSS , and if you ever get stuck, we will be there to help.\n\n\nLearn by doing!\nSo we have made this course as simple as possible in order to take you through step by step so you can feel confident and get a truly good understanding of how to utilize Tailwind CSS. In this course, we will be teaching Tailwind CSS by creating various projects.\n\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial you will learn;\n\n\n· Tailwind CSS Basics and adding it to the application\n· Most important Tailwind CSS topics.\n· How to create responsive designs for websites\n· How to easily build the largest and most advanced web site using Tailwind CSS\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Tailwind CSS?\nTailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for building modern web UIs. Instead of predefined components, Tailwind CSS provides a set of low-level utility classes that you can combine to build any design, directly in your HTML. This gives you the flexibility to create custom designs without having to write a lot of CSS.\n\n\nHere are some of the key features of Tailwind CSS:\nUtility-first approach: Tailwind CSS provides a set of low-level utility classes that you can combine to build any design. This gives you a lot of flexibility and control over the look and feel of your website.\nResponsive design: Tailwind CSS makes it easy to create responsive designs that look great on any screen size.\nCustomizable: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, so you can create your own custom designs and components.\nEasy to learn: Tailwind CSS is relatively easy to learn, especially if you are already familiar with HTML and CSS.\n\n\nWhat are the advantages of Tailwind CSS?\n· Can reduce code duplication: Tailwind CSS can help you to reduce code duplication by providing a set of reusable utility classes.\n· Can speed up development: Tailwind CSS can help you to speed up development by making it easier to create custom designs.\n· Can improve maintainability: Tailwind CSS can help to improve the maintainability of your code by making it easier to understand and modify.\n\n\nIs it hard to learn HTML and CSS?\nWhether or not Tailwind CSS is hard to learn depends on your previous CSS experience and learning style.\nIf you have never used CSS before:\nIt may be a bit difficult to grasp the basic principles of Tailwind CSS at first. Tailwind CSS uses a utility-first approach that is not found in other CSS frameworks. Therefore, it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of how CSS works.\nHowever, while the learning curve for Tailwind CSS is steeper, you can progress quite quickly. The framework's official documentation and online resources are quite comprehensive, and there are many free courses and tutorials available.\nAdditionally, Tailwind CSS has an active community, and there are many people who can help you if you have any questions.\nIf you have previous CSS experience:\nLearning Tailwind CSS will be easier. If you already know the basic principles of CSS, learning how to use Tailwind CSS's utility classes will be a relatively quick process.\nHowever, it is important to remember that Tailwind CSS works differently from other CSS frameworks. Therefore, you may need to learn some new concepts when using Tailwind CSS.\nStill, if you have previous CSS experience, you can significantly shorten the time it takes to learn Tailwind CSS.\nOverall, Tailwind CSS is not difficult to learn, but it does require some time and effort.\n\n\nIs Tailwind CSS worth learning?\nTailwind CSS is a great tool for front-end developers who want to build fast, flexible, and scalable web interfaces. It can be especially beneficial for responsive design and reducing code duplication.\nThe best way to determine if Tailwind CSS is right for you is to try it out and see how you like it.\n\n\nAt the end of the course\nBy the end of the course, You will be able to start building your own website using Tailwind CSS.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching\nOAK Academy, based in London, is an online education company that offers courses in IT, Software, Design, and Development in Turkish, English, and Portuguese.

      "description": "NextJS is a great choice for growing as a React developer and for taking your React apps to the next level!\n\n\nBecause NextJS is growing fast and therefore in high demand. And there are good reasons for that: NextJS allows you to build React apps with built-in server-side rendering and page pre-rendering. Building great user experiences and search engine friendly (SEO!) React apps has never been easier!\n\n\nIn addition, NextJS makes building fullstack React apps (frontend + backend code combined in one project) extremely easy as well! Blend client-side and server-side code and build a NodeJS-based API side-by-side with your frontend React apps. It's a breeze with NextJS!\n\n\nWant to add authentication? NextJS simplifies that as well and makes user signup, sign in and session management very convenient.\n\n\nThis course will take you from NextJS beginner to advanced level in no time!\n\n\nIn detail, this course will cover:\nWhat is NextJS? And why would you use it?\nWorking with file-based routing\nAdding dynamic routes and catch-all routes\nImplementing different forms of page pre-rendering and server-side rendering\nWorking with data and adding data fetching + pre-fetching to your apps\nPre-generating dynamic and static pages\nOptimizing images with the NextJS Image component\nAPI routes\nAnd much more!\n\n\nFor this course, you'll need basic React knowledge, though the course does come with a \"React refresher\" module in case it's been some time since you last worked with React.\nAfter finishing this course, you'll be well prepared to build your own NextJS projects from the ground up and apply for NextJS positions!",

The shortcode section is recorded on Mac OS, the followup sections are on a mix of Windows 7 and Mac - development is entirely cross platform as you will see.\nThere is not a whole heap of complexity in the actual code base, it's all clear and straightforward, so you don't need PhD level PHP. The WordPress admin side isn't rocket surgery either. Most of the course outlines the structures & how things fit together, so you won't be bamboozled by complex arcane code that will leave you baffled.\nThe best bit is you get access to source code that is tried & tested and can act as the starting point for your own plugin - all free of charge and free to use for open source or commercial projects as you wish.\nIn theory you could blast through the shortcode module in just a morning and then refer to the videos as you create your own plugin in the afternoon - imagine, just one day to go from Joe Dev to WordPress Plugin Pro.\nThe course leader, Nick McCloud, from TheWebsiteSupportDesk.com and a few other places, is an entrepreneurial programmer with over 35 years coding experience (pre-internet, pre-Windows, pre-iPod, pre-running water) and 20 years running his own businesses.\nCome on board, cover the materials and ask questions.

Along the way, you'll discover tips and tricks that make your future designs and development workflow leaner and more maintainable than ever before. By the time you reach the end, you'll be equipped with the latest cutting edge front- end development skills, ready to develop your very own modern, responsive websites that are pixel-perfect across a wide range of devices.\nAbout the Authors\nBen Frain has been a web designer/developer since 1996. He is currently employed as a senior frontend developer at Bet365.\nBefore the web, he worked as an underrated (and modest) TV actor and technology journalist, having graduated from Salford University with a degree in media and performance.\nHe has written four equally underrated (his opinion) screenplays and still harbors the (fading) belief he might sell one. Outside of work, he enjoys simple pleasures: playing indoor football while his body and wife still allow it, and wrestling with his two sons. His other book, Sass and Compass for Designers, is available now.\nCord Slatton-Valle started working with web development when he was 15 years old having read an article in a magazine. Over 20 years later, he is still enjoying development and the constant learning needed to maintain his skills in the feld. He has expanded into Raspberry Pi and other platforms, in addition to the web. He mentors students in web development and spends his free time doing maker-style projects and working with his wife on his newly purchased home.\nJoshua Miller is a freelance web designer, college professor, and interactive artist living in eastern Pennsylvania. He has taught courses in animation, web/graphic design, video game design, and programming at a variety of schools, including Lehigh University, Northampton Community College, Drexel University, Lafayette College, Montgomery County Community College, and Lehigh Valley College. He currently holds a tenure-track position at Kutztown University, where he teaches web design, graphic design, and interactivity. He also teaches part time at Lehigh University, and runs a successful freelance design business in his downtime. His true interests lie in the intersection between design and programming, specifically with the creation of digital interactive work.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the React for Full Stack Development: Build Modern Web Solutions course by Uplatz.\n\n\nWhat is React?\nReact is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications. It was created by Facebook and is now maintained by Meta and a large community of developers. React simplifies the process of building and maintaining dynamic user interfaces by promoting component reusability, a declarative approach, and efficient updates to the DOM. It has become a popular choice for front-end development due to its flexibility, performance, and strong community support.\n\n\nKey features of React include:\nComponent-Based: React allows you to break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable pieces called components. This modular approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and testability.\nDeclarative: In React, you describe what your UI should look like based on its current state and data, rather than specifying how to achieve it. React handles the actual rendering and updating of the UI efficiently.\nVirtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the actual Document Object Model (DOM), which allows it to perform updates efficiently by minimizing changes to the real DOM.\nJavaScript Syntax Extension (JSX): JSX is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code within your JavaScript, making it easier to define the structure and appearance of your components.\nOpen-Source and Large Community: React is open-source and has a vast and active community, providing extensive support, resources, and third-party libraries.\nHow React Works\nComponents: You create components, which are like building blocks for your UI. Each component represents a part of the UI and can have its own state and logic.\nJSX: You use JSX to define the structure and appearance of your components in a way that resembles HTML. React converts this JSX into regular JavaScript code that manipulates the DOM.\nVirtual DOM: React maintains a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. When the state or data in your components change, React efficiently updates the virtual DOM and compares it to the previous version.\nReconciliation (Diffing): React performs a process called reconciliation (or diffing) to identify the specific changes that need to be made to the actual DOM. This minimizes the number of updates to the browser's DOM, improving performance.\nRendering: React applies the necessary changes to the actual DOM, updating only the parts of the UI that need to be changed based on the reconciliation process.\nState Management: You manage the state (data) within your components using React's state management features (e.g., useState hook) or external state management libraries like Redux.\nEvent Handling: You add event listeners to your components to respond to user interactions (clicks, input changes, etc.). These events can trigger updates to the component's state or other actions.\n\n\nReact - Course Curriculum\n\n\nLecture 1\nIntroduction to ReactJS\nIntroduction of ReactJS.

      "description": "In a microservice, each software application feature is separated from the other, in most cases with their respective servers and databases. Applications built with this kind of architecture are loosely coupled, also referred to as distributed applications.\nEarly on in the practice of software development, best practice involved tightly coupling all of the software’s components in what is known as a monolithic application. However, monolithic applications require extra effort to respond to changes in the system. If any particular component develops a fault, the entire system is affected.\nNowadays, we can solve the problem using microservices, which allow us to build our software product components separately. If there is a fault in one component, it won’t affect the functioning of the entire software product.\nIn this article, we’ll review the concept of microservices, learn how to implement a microservice with Node.js, and explore how microservices are changing the practice of software development\nImagine we’re building an ecommerce store. We’ll need models for a payment feature, cart, customers, admin, and order. Each of these features will have its own separate servers and databases.\nOur ecommerce microservices will communicate with each other using the REST API framework. With our store features developed independently from each other, we can easily identify which feature to debug if our system develops a fault and avoid having to bring down the entire application.\nmicroservices offer a better developer experience. A new developer joining the team won’t have to understand the entire code base, but rather only the features they are working on, increasing productivity.",

You might be stuck with a data fetch that takes a couple seconds to execute. You can't make the rest of your code wait for it to finish executing though. Asynchronous code helps you manage everything seamlessly while making sure that the data you're waiting for (in our example) is used in your code ONLY after it has been completely fetched. Sounds like magic, doesn't it?\nBut it also sounds too complicated.\nDon't worry.\nYou'll learn every single concept of Asynchronous Javascript with easy to understand over-the-shoulder examples and detailed, but interesting explanations.\nYou'll learn all about event loops and how Javascript works behind the screen and how it executes Asynchronous code, about callbacks and their drawbacks, how promises replaced them and how Async Await made promises prettier. You'll apply all of these in 3 real world mini-projects as well.\nSo, if you'd like to delve deep into the exciting world of Asynchronous programming, especially with Javascript as your language of choice, this course is perfect for you.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\n1. By the end of this course, you’ll have a thorough understanding of how Asynchronous programming works in Javascript.\n2. You'll learn the ins and outs of one of the major topics that can land you a job or a promotion\n3. You’ll know how to apply those concepts in your projects and create clean code that runs faster than your peers.\n4. You'll learn all about event loops and how Javascript works behind the screen and how it executes Asynchronous code\n5. You'll learn about callbacks and how you've probably been using them in your daily programming already\n6. You'll learn about the pros and cons of callbacks, callback hell and why we need a replacement\n7. You'll learn about promises, an ES6 update, and how they replaced callbacks\n8. You'll learn about handling errors in promises\n9. You'll learn about making promises prettier with Async Await, an ES7 update\n10. You'll learn about handling errors in async await\n11. You'll learn how to apply what you learn in 3 real world mini projects\n12. You'll learn one of the most complex topics of programming with easy to understand examples and hands-on explanations\n\n\nWho is this course for?\n1. Javascript developers who want to take their knowledge to the next level\n2. Web developers who'd like to pad their resume and get that promotion they've always wanted.\n3. Web developers who'd like to add \"Asynchronous programming\" to their resume and stand out in your job interviews.\n4. Programmers who already know Asynchronous programming but would like to learn how to implement it in Javascript.\n5. Fledgling developers who'd like to learn how real world programming works\n6. Front end developers who are working with frameworks like Angular, React, Vue or Svelte and would like to apply Asynchronous programming concepts in their projects.\n\n\nHow is this course designed:\nModule 1 : Introduction - In this module, we'll look at the difference between synchronous and Asynchronous programming, how Asynchronous programming works, how Javascript works in the background, what event loops are, how call stacks execute your Javascript code, what Web APIs are and so much more!\nModule 2 : Callback functions - In this module, let's delve deeper into Asynchronous Javascript by looking at using callback functions to make your Async codes work seamlessly, but let's also delve deeper into the pros and cons of callbacks and why we need a replacement for it. We'll end the module with a mini-project that demonstrates a real world usage of callbacks and asynchronous code.\nModule 3 : Promises - In this module, let's take a detailed look at the ES6 update Promises, why they were needed and how they pretty much replaced calbacks. Let's also look at how we can get their resolutions and errors and display them, creating promise chains, promisification and error handling in promises. We'll end this module by creating the same mini project, but this time with promises and comparing them to callbacks.\nModule 4: Async Await - In this module, we'll look at Async Await, an ES7 update, and how they've made promises look pretty. We'll also look at resolving multiple promises at the same time using Async Await and error handling. We'll end this module with a mini project as well.\n\n\nEach of these modules will create full-fledged lessons that teach a particular Asynchronous JavaScript concept in detail with a lot of real-world over-the-shoulder examples, so you'll have a lot of fun while learning!\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Get in and get started on your journey to becoming an Asynchronous web developer today!",

      "description": "Learn javascript, Learn and Understand it once and for all and level up your programming, 8 Confusing JavaScript Concepts Over Simplified\nTop 10 Reasons to Learn JavaScript\n1) It’s the most popular programming language\nWe start our list with possibly the most significant reason! According to Stackoverflow JavaScript is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today. Even back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not.\n2) It’s in your browser\nJavaScript is, without question, the default language of the internet. You need to look no further than your browser for proof since JavaScript was most likely used to develop it. Since browsers are a necessary part of any user’s online experience, it’s easy to see why JavaScript is so significant.\n3) JavaScript also exists outside of the internet\nJavaScript has many uses that go beyond its traditional internet roles. It powers smart televisions, works with the internet of things (IoT), creates native apps for iOS and Android, and builds cross-platform desktop apps, to name a few.\n4) JavaScript is Ideal for Newbies\nSince it’s already installed on every web browser today, JavaScript spares the rookies from the chore of setting up a development environment. Newcomers can just jump in and start coding. It’s one of the most accessible entries into coding available, a value-add for beginners. There is also a large online community that offers support and advice.\nAlso, JavaScript is an excellent tool for beginning programmers who want to expand their skill set into other languages. JavaScript supports valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can apply these skills to any new language they want to learn, like Python, Java, or C++.\n5) JavaScript is Easy to Learn\nNot only is it a natural language to use, but JavaScript is also easy to pick up. JavaScript turns intricate details into abstracts, making things easier for the newcomer. Unlike the higher-level languages, JavaScript has more of a natural language feel to it.\n6) You Can Create Visual Effects and Other Eye-catching Aesthetic Features\nThere’s building a web page, and then there’s building a visually appealing web page that attracts the user’s attention and encourages interaction. JavaScript is so versatile that you can use it to easily add cool design elements such as animation, interactive maps, and scrolling video. Organizations and clients want web designers who can not only put together a technically sound page but one that also will lure visitors. If you know JavaScript, you can deliver.\n7) JavaScript is Versatile\nFar from being a one-trick pony, JavaScript empowers a programmer to handle any aspect of app design. Do you want to do user-side (front-end) coding? You can do it in conjunction with Angular. Are you more interested in the server-side (back-end)? Bring Node.js into the mix and you can do that, too!\nYou can also create desktop, mobile, and web apps with Electron, React Native, and React. If you’re intrigued by machine learning, then JavaScript will help you there as well.\n8) JavaScript also Affects Big Data and the Cloud\nJavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is the go-to standard for data exchanges on today’s internet. NoSQL databases use JSON documents for record storage; and although JSON plays well with any programming language, it does best with JavaScript.\nAlso, more developers are turning to Node.js to build cloud-based apps, a very much in-demand market.\n9) It’s a Valuable Tool for Game Designers\nGames are a big business today, and developers who know JavaScript have that extra advantage. The language’s versatility, power, and ability to easily create visual effects make it a perfect fit for game developers.\n10) Finally, the Career Potential is Skyrocketing\nWith an increasing number of businesses and organizations going digital, there is a corresponding increase in demand for developers who are familiar with the better-known programming languages. As we’ve already noted, that’s JavaScript!",

It brings together development and operations teams so there are fewer redundancies in the software development process.\nDevSecOps is a culture shift in the software industry that aims to bake security into the rapid-release cycles that are typical of modern application development and deployment.\n\n\nDevOps has revolutionized workplaces in many ways. The number of DevOps-related jobs are increasing, while its rank as an in-demand job.\n\n\nDevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.\n\n\nWhat is CI/CD ?\nCI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (AKA \"integration hell\").\nSpecifically, CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment. Taken together, these connected practices are often referred to as a \"CI/CD pipeline\" and are supported by development and operations teams working together in an agile way with either a DevOps or site reliability engineering (SRE) approach.\n\n\nWhat is Jenkins ?\nJenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

It will introduce you to the basic concepts of web development that we generally overlook while starting to learn web development. After enjoying the whiteboard narrations here, you will feel at home while taking your favourite hands-on course on web development.\nIf you already are a web developer, but yet to feel confident about it, you might find this course quite useful in strengthening your concepts. When learning web development, most of us overlook the concepts and move quickly to hands-on and to projects. And then we keep coding with a lower confidence until we learn the concepts by experience. So, give less than an hour here, and then see how coding web applications become more interesting.\nIf you are a non-technical or semi-technical project manager, dealing with web based projects, this course could be very useful in introducing you to the subject you deal with, and you would feel more at home with your programmers.\nLet me tell you that this course is not only for Java guys, but actually the first half of it, in which we discuss the web application basics and the HTTP protocol is equally beneficial to guys from other technologies, for example PHP as well.",

Since then I have been designing and developing sites for friends, family and business clients. At times it has been my full-time job, and other times I have been more of a part-time consultant. My work has ranged from simple, static websites for individuals and small businesses up to complicated web applications for Universities. Because my work has been so diverse there is a good chance I will be able to relate to your situation and quickly be able to answer any questions that you have.\n\n\nWhy I made this course\n1. To Show You How to Edit and Manage Your Existing Site\nOne reason I created this course is because I know quite a few folks who decided it was time to give their small business an online storefront and because they had no idea about the basic steps required to set up a website they spent a LOT OF MONEY at web design firms only to be stuck with a site they didn't know how to edit or manage. And my clients have complained to me that their hosting companies are constantly UPPING THEIR FEES but they don't know how to set up a different account.\n2. To Explain When You Should Use an Existing Platform\nOther people aren't sure if they need to use and eCommerce platform like Shopify or a blogging platform like Wordpress. So I wanted to explain when you should use them.\n3. To Walk You Through the Nuts and Bolts of Setting Up Your First Website\nAnd lastly, some of my clients and friends just want to set up a simple website but they just don't know where to start. There are many tutorials about how to code, but you really have to dig through boring help files to understand the nuts and bolts of setting everything up.\n\n\nThis course is created for you and intended to be a valuable resource\nI will be available to answer any questions and even add additional content and lectures as needed.\n\n\nSupplemental material\nThe course also has a comprehensive links to help you navigate through the ins and outs of setting up your website. Additionally the course will demonstrate the tools and services I use so you know how they work.\n\n\nBonus material\nI recently published a book that goes beyond this course and discusses how to get your business started online and what it will take to be profitable.\nTHE COURSE INCLUDES A WAY FOR YOU TO GET THIS BOOK FOR FREE!\n\n\nCurriculum Overview\n1. How to find and register a unique domain name:\nThere are a lot of options out there for where to register your domain. Which one should you use? How does it work? What is the science behind domain names? I answer all these questions in this lecture, and when we are done you will be able to register your own domain name quickly and cheaply.\n2. Simple instructions for setting up a hosting account for less than $49/year:\nIt is really hard to narrow down which hosting company to use, and even if you look at review lists of Best Hosting Companies it is hard to pick a winner. Then you try to set up an account and get a lot of nasty up-selling and confusing price structures. Later you find out the discounted prices at some companies go way up after the first year and you end up spending more year over year than you would have elsewhere! I will help you sort through the confusion and give you some tips on how to avoid all the up-selling and price changes, and I show you some companies that provide great service at good prices with less pressure.\n3. Tutorial on pointing a domain name to a separate hosting account:\nIf you purchase a domain and hosting service from separate companies (I'll show you how and why you might want to) you have to connect them. I'll show you how to do it in no time!\n4. Options for purchasing a combined domain + hosting solution:\nIf you want to save money during your first year, you can get a free domain with your hosting service. I'll quickly walk you through the process.\n5. Step-by-step guide to create your first basic web page using different methods:\nWe won't go in to depth on how to write code, many people on Udemy have done that quite well. But I will show you how to create a basic web page, and more importantly I will show you where to find FREE help resources and examples, even a free sandbox, that will help you learn more and more on your own.\n6. How to edit web pages right on your hosting account or from your computer:\nThis is designed specifically for folks who had someone else build them a website, but now every time they want to make an edit they have to call up the web design company. Even if it's just to change one word! That's outrageous. I will show you how you can do it yourself.\n7. Instructions for uploading files to your hosting account: Want to build webpages on your computer? I'll show you how to get them online and show you how to use a free tool that makes it a breeze.\n8. Options for when you may not want to create your own website:\nSometimes it makes more sense to use a full-service platform that has professional templates and packages so you don't have to create your own web pages. I'll discuss my favorite ones and tell you when and when not to use them. (Even if you are already planning to go this route you may want to take this course because it will still be helpful to know how to register your own unique domain name)\n9. A look into more advanced topics:\nCurious about whether you can actually make a sophisticated, professional website from scratch? You can and I'll show you some examples to whet your appetite.\n10. Case Study that ties all the sections together:\nIn the Case Study we will actually purchase a domain name, set up hosting for the domain, link it to our hosting account. Then we will create a basic web page (NO CODE) for the website and view it live online. Later we will go back and edit that same web page, add pictures to it, put an Amazon Affiliate Link on it, embed a YouTube video on it and perform basic text and font edits. Lastly we will install WordPress and put a PayPal button on the site.\n\n\nREGISTER YOUR DOMAIN BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE DOES:\nYou can scroll right up to the top and click Take This Course to get started setting up your website today!\nIf you read this far, you've accomplished a lot already - I hope to see you in the course.\n-Andrew Tye",

Welcome to this ProMatrix course titled, “Angular: Overcoming Common Obstacles”.\nThis course is a reduced set of videos, and it covers specifically the topic of overcoming common obstacles when integrating with ASP.Net Core, using Visual Studio. In order to develop applications effectively, you will need to overcome many obstacles. This course should put it altogether for you to be able to use Visual Studio to integrate Angular and ASP.Net Core.\nIf you only want to learn how to overcome common obstacles when creating web applications with Angular and ASP.Net Core, then you’ve come to the right place.\nHowever, if you would like to learn the whole subject, about how to integrate Angular with ASP.Net Core, then I suggest you scoot on over to the full blown course titled “Angular and ASP.Net Core Integration”.\nI’d like to take this opportunity to share some of the obstacles that you will be faced with when integrating Angular with ASP.Net Core. Many are the same that you will face integrating any modern client-side framework, but most are specific to Angular. Please keep in mind that the key is automation. As a Microsoft developer, we expect to stay within the Integrated Development Environment, and consider it less productive if we have a need to drop down to the command line, or merge files manually, or make changes depending on the configuration we are in, Debug or Release. Let’s overcome any obstacles that will compete for our attention. Shall we?",

React JS is a powerful library for building dynamic web apps, and it’s easy to make your design responsive with it. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n\n1. Understand Responsiveness\nResponsive design means your website adjusts its layout to fit different screen sizes. It ensures content looks good and is easy to use on all devices.\n\n\n2. Use a CSS Framework\nFrameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI simplify the responsive design. They offer pre-built components and grid systems to structure your layout.\n\n\n3. Utilize Media Queries\nMedia queries in CSS allow you to apply different styles based on the device’s screen size. For example, you can adjust font sizes, margins, or layouts for smaller screens.\n\n\n4. Choose a Grid System\nA grid system divides the page into rows and columns. This makes it easier to organize content and align elements consistently. Most frameworks have grid systems built in.\n\n\n5. Test Flexbox and CSS Grid\nCSS features like Flexbox and Grid help design flexible layouts. These tools make it easy to control alignment, spacing, and how elements behave when the screen size changes.\n\n\n6. Use Responsive Images\nEnsure your images resize properly. Use relative units like percentages or tools like picture tags to load images optimized for different devices.\n\n\n7. Keep Components Modular\nIn React, break your UI into smaller components. Each component should handle its own styling and adapt to screen changes independently.\n\n\n8. Test Across Devices\nCheck your site on various devices, such as phones, tablets, and desktops. Use browser developer tools to simulate different screen sizes and fix any layout issues.\n\n\n9. Optimize for Performance\nA responsive website should also load quickly. Optimize images, minimize unnecessary scripts, and ensure smooth transitions between screen sizes.\n\n\n10. Use React Libraries\nReact libraries like React-Bootstrap or Material-UI offer responsive components out of the box. They save time and reduce the effort needed to build responsive designs.\n\n\nFinal Tip\nAlways put the user first. Design with simplicity and usability in mind. A responsive website ensures a great experience for everyone, no matter what device they use.\nBy following these steps, you can build a responsive website in React JS that looks great and performs well on any screen.",

You create incredible businesses and come up with ideas that change the world.\nTechnology has made the 21st century, the century of the entrepreneur. Thanks to the power of the internet, you can reach a global audience in minutes.\nThe question is...do you have the skills to be able to take advantage of this incredible opportunity?\nIf you're starting (or have started) a business in today's tech driven economy, then you've got to understand the code that's driving your business.\nImagine asking others to create your software but you've no idea how it works?\nImagine not knowing the time and effort involved in realizing your idea?\nImagine having an incredible idea but you don't have the skills to get it started?\nI'm Not Going To Teach You Tons of Coding Languages...\nInstead of spending infinity boring you with the intricacies of a multitude of languages, Coding For Entrepreneurs will teach you the exact languages you need to know to launch any type of eCommerce site & build landing pages that convert browsers into buyers.\nThe best way to learn is by doing - you'll never learn anything if you sit and watch videos or read a PDF all day. We get you into action and enable you to achieve results immediately.\nYou'll get in introduction in:\nPython\nDjango\nHTML\nCSS\nDon't worry if these look scary...if you can multiply and add numbers then you can code!\nCoding is extremely logical. Take Python for example - it reads just like the English language less a couple of odd characters.\nWe Put Special Emphasis On Django...Why?\n\n- Django is based in Python\n- It's fast, simple, effective, secure, and ideal for \"perfectionists with deadlines\"\n- Built-In User Login (authentication) System\n- Web-based Admin system (built - in)\n- Template system that allows basic knowledge of HTML/CSS to design the front-end.\n- Growing Community for Help/Advice/Best Practices .... and freelance clients (or jobs).\n- Easy to implement & Launch\nBut I've Been Told That I Need To Learn C, C#, Objective C and Java?\nThe truth is that you could learn all of these languages and use them to further enhance your coding.\nBut why bother?\nYou're an entrepreneur, NOT a professional coder.

Makes your web content come to life - JavaScript allows for interaction with content and makes things happen. JavaScript is the dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. Used in all browsers it's the most popular coding language ever. Websites and web apps everywhere are using JavaScript. It runs directly in your browser and you can create html files with a text editor directly on your computer to run in your browser. Select the html file and open it with any browser.\nCode is a set of instructions for what you want to happen. Example : When a new person comes to your website, ask their name. Showing a welcome message with their name would be an example of something you might ask JavaScript to do. The instructions for the code would be to provide the user an input area, get the input value of their name, then use that value to return a response. Select a page element and update the contents of the element with the welcome message including the value of the input for the user's name.\nThe developer console shows you information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a console that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions within the current webpage. Open your browser, select the devtools and try it out, we will be using it in the lessons of this course. With most modern browsers you can write and execute javascript directly from your browser. Within the Chrome browser you can open DevTools when you want to work with the DOM or CSS, right-click an element on the page and select Inspect to jump into the Elements panel. Or press Command+Option+C (Mac) or Control+Shift+C (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS). When you want to see logged messages or run JavaScript, press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to jump straight into the Console panel.\nYou will need an editor to write your code. You can use Visual Studio code if you don’t already have an editor. First lesson will help you set up and start coding on your computer.\nGetting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. Create an index html file and open it in a browser Add JavaScript to the html either linking to a script file or JavaScript directly between the script tags in the HTML.\nGetting Started with JavaScript\nDouble quotes and single quotes or backticks can be used to contain string content. A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. Whitespace is ignored in JavaScript code, you can use it for writing code that is more readable and understandable.\nCreating variables -\nvar - Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.\nlet - Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value. Blocks of code are indicated by {}\nconst - Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant. Cannot be changed.\nVariables must be declared before you use them. Comma separate to declare multiple variables. Camelcase is more readable as in the example below.\nlet a,b,c,d;\nlet userfirstname = “Laurence”;\nlet userFirstName = “Laurence”;\nRules for naming variables must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent can be letters of digits. Upper or lower case. No spaces. No limit to the length of the variable name. Variable names are case sensitive. Cannot use reserved words.\nJavaScript Data Types and JavaScript Objects\nJavaScript uses different data types, JavaScript dynamically assigns the data type that it presumes is desired, you can also change data types of the variable if needed. Arrays are objects that have a preset order of items, using the index of the item to select and identify the item within the array list. Arrays also have built in methods which make them a powerful way to use the data and manipulate and select items contained in the array. Objects also can contain multiple items in the same variable, they are identified by a property name which is used in order to select the item from the object. Each property name can only be used once and is unique within the object. Property names can be set with quotes or as single words within the objects. They get assigned values as a pair with the property name, using the colon to assign the value and comma separate multiple named pair values.\nJavaScript Functions\nFunctions provide a powerful way within code to run blocks of code, also they contain their own scope so variables set within the function can live only within that function. Create functions in code to do repeat code tasks, and handle specific coding objectives. You can pass values into a function then use those values within the function code, and return a result back from the function code. Functions can use arguments within the parameters, although they are not mandatory. Function also can use return although not mandatory to return a response from the function. You can pass values into function to be used within the code.\nThere are two types of functions, function declaration which uses the keyword function to assign the function code, or a function expression which is similar to assigning a variable a value, but in this case it's the function code.\n// Function declaration\nfunction test(num) {\nreturn num;\n}\n// Function expression\nvar test = function (num) {\nreturn num;\n};\nInteractive Web Pages JavaScript\nJavaScript can connect to web page elements using the document object. The document object is built by the browser as a tree type structure to represent the entire web page contents of elements and their properties. Using JavaScript to access the DOM or Document Object Model from the browser allows us to within the code select page elements, and even update the page elements. The document object is a massive object that has its own set of methods and properties values that can all be selected and manipulated with JavaScript Code.\nUsing querySelector or querySelectorAll make a selection of your page elements, assign a variable to the element object in order to be able to easily use that object within your code.\nYou can update the textContent of the page element using the property value of textContent.\nYou can add event listeners on your elements with the onclick event object, assigning a function that gets invoked once the event is triggered. Try it out select a page element, add an event listener and then make some updates to the element using the various element property values.\nLogic Conditions with JavaScript\nConditions can be used within code to apply logic, and run different actions based on the result of the condition. Depending on the value either True or False the code can run different blocks of code.\nThe if statement will check a condition, if true it runs the specified code. If false it does not run the code. Else provides an alternative if the condition is not true then else statement allows us to run a block of code on false if none of the previous conditions are true. You can also use the else if statement to check another condition with a separate block of code to be run if the previous condition came back as false.\nUsing the switch statement allows us to specify several alternatives checking to see if any of the conditions match and allow the corresponding code to be executed.\nJavaScript code can use Comparison Operators to check if a statement is true or false. To check multiple conditions you can apply Logical Operators to check logic between conditions. The example below will show how to use the Logical operators and the results that can be expected with the various combinations of true or false.\nJavaScript Loops For and While\nLoops allow us to execute blocks of code a number of times, they also allow us to iterate through a list of items such as items in an array or other iterable list.\nLoops will always require several parameters, such as a starting value, a condition to stop the loop and a way to move through the items to the next item in the loop. We can setup a simple for loop by setting a variable to use with a starting value, then applying a condition to continue the loop if the condition is true, and incrementing the value of the variable so that eventually the condition is no longer true.\nBuilt In methods JavaScript\nJavaScript has many built in methods, which are prebuilt functions that allow us to perform a certain predefined action. Math is an object in JavaScript that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers, we can also generate random values with Math.\nString methods help you to work with strings and do manipulations of the string values. Strings all have a length property with a returned value of the length of the string. Every character in the string has its own index value which allows us to use JavaScript code to select those characters.\nJavaScript List Maker Course Project\nCourse project is designed to challenge you in applying what you have learned in the previous lessons. Use JavaScript to transform the index.html code, with three divs. Change the page elements to have one as an updatable field, the second into a submit button, and the third into a dynamic list that adds new items when the submit button is pressed. Take the value of the intake field, when the button is clicked and add that value as a new list item to the list in the last element. Clear the first element content and allow users to once again update the element with new content to be again added to the bottom of the list. Create event listeners so that when list items are clicked they update the font color either to red or toggle to black.",

As a Senior Front-End Developer and Tech teacher since 10 years now, I can assure you that JavaScript is the most popular language right now in web development.\n\nThis is why I propose you to spend this next 2 hours together to learn basics JavaScript. The main idea of this course is not to enter deep in JavaScript but just to learn the basics that JS Developers are using 85% of their time. So if you want to bootstrap your JavaScript level in 2 hours, this course is absolutely for you.\nWhat is JavaScript?\nA high-level definition\nJavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.\nHTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.\nJavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)\nWhat are we going to learn in this course?\nIn my opinion, JavaScript is a major programming language in tech ecosystem. If you want to code in JavaScript, you have to answer these questions:\nWhat is JavaScript?\nHow does it interact with HTML?\nWhat are variables?\nWhat is assignment?\nHow to create my first operations?\nWhat are Array & Objects?\nWhat are Booleans?\nHow to create functions?\nWhat is return and how to use it?\nExplanation of scope, what are the most commons errors?\nUse of JavaScript native features: loops, filter, map...\nWhat are promises?\nWhat ES6/ES7 provides as new features of JavaScript?\nWe will answer these question by practicing JavaScript in our code editor and browser. I decided to list the 20 most important points to know if you are/aim to develop in JavaScript. These points are my program.\nAt the end, you'll have a strong understanding of basics. This will help you to go deeper into JavaScript by learning another framework (React, Vue, Angular...). So if you are ready, let's go !",

The biggest technical advantage of Svelte is high performance, browser-friendly JavaScript with small bundle sizes.\nWhy to use Svelte.js?\nIf you are looking for an efficient Javascript framework with a nice learning curve to build front-end applications, you'll love to play with Svelte. This framework provides a fluid & light approach of coding that open new horizons for beginners and seniors developers.\nSvelte/Firebase, a good mix?\nAs you may already know, Firebase offers you the opportunity to create an app serverless. It means that you don't need to code any back-end at all. Moreover, this is for free! How amazing is that? Combined with Svelte makes this course even more interesting for those who want to create a front-end app.\nWhat is our program?\nIn this course, I'll teach you how to handle Svelte and Firebase by coding a Pokedex! Why? Because it provides to us an already-made database (I'll provide you a JSON to use during the course) that we'll inject inside our Front-End application directly from Firebase.\nConcerning Svelte, you'll learn:\nSvelte mechanic, logic & lifecycles,\nAdding data,\nDynamic attributes,\nConditions, key, DOM events...\nStyling,\nNested components,\nComponents & views relationships,\nAssignments, declarations, statements,\nUpdating values,\nDeclaring props,\nManage stores...\nBut not only. I'll use my senior skills to show you how to architecture a Front-End application properly. In details, this is our roadmap:\nSvelte install & configuration,\nRouting with Routify,\nFirebase project configuration,\nFireAuth, FireStore & FireDatabase initialization,\nAuthentication, routes guards & sessions,\nJavaScript modules & Front-End architecture,\nAPI interface design,\nViews & components logic in Svelte,\nCSS Design with Tailwindcss,\nAutocomplete for pokemons,\nListing pokemons,\nStore favorites pokemons...\nThis is a complete program and all of this in less than 2 hours.\nSvelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces [...] As we all know the popularity of Svelte is at the moment way lower than other JS frameworks/libraries like React.js or Vue.js, but that is no reason for Svelte to lose the game.\nSvelte.

We’ll also take a look at Coffeescript, which is a preprocessor for Javascript. It follows a lot of similar structures to Python and is very, very popular.\nFinally, we’ll discuss Sockets. Sockets are a way for us to open a constant connection between the server and the client. Normally when you make a request, the request goes up and then comes down with the data. With a socket, that request goes up and stays open, allowing the server to send data whenever it wants and the client to send data whenever it wants.\nSo, we can make real time applications using sockets and we’ll take a look at how to implement a very simple system using socket IO.\nCourse Includes:\n16 videos with over 50 minutes of lectures and explanations.\n6 external resource files.\n1 exercise to help you master advanced backend web development concepts.\nWhat You'll Learn:\nIntroduction to Grunt\nSetting up Grunt with css-min\nUglify JS files\nSetting up custom tasks\nWatching files\nBasics of CoffeeScript\nIf Statements\nTernary\nLoops\nComments, Strings, and Interpolation\nIntroduction to Sockets\nScaffolding the project\nSetting up Sockets\nCommunicating between connections\nAdditional Resources\nExercises\nAnd More!",

We will build a few features in a pretend home rental application. I will show you how to write a failing test first (step 1), then make it pass by writing code (step 2), then refactor the code (step 3). These features include:\nbuilding the app header (easy)\nfetching the list of rental homes from the API and displaying it on the page (intermediate)\nbuilding a rental booking dialog (complex)\nAfter completing this course, you will gain the full power of TDD which provides you with:\nbetter focus: you end up writing a lot less code because you need just enough to make the test pass, and anything else is a distraction and can be ignored\nbetter architecture: you get less tightly coupled code and more cohesive components\nfewer bugs and simpler maintenance\nhigh test coverage: you have more confidence that everything is working\ndocumented behavior: the tests describe the intended behavior of the component and document the edge cases\nit's easy to pick up after the last context switch: when I return to my code the following day, the next step is always to get the test to pass or write the next one or refactor\nHope you'll find this course helpful.

We will start from the simple concepts of variables, input and output to the more complex ones such as loops, low-level text manipulation and functions.\n\nStart programming with this simple and straightforward guide through the most basic programming language.\n\nVariables, working with data\nWriting to the screen and reading user input\nConditions and loops\nManipulating text\nCreating re-usable code using functions\nUnderstand quickly one of the most important skills in programming\n\nIn the programming industry you might come across the idea that you have to learn the most advanced, cutting-edge and fully featured language right off the bat. This might be a good idea for some people, but, for most, it's a wise choice to start from the beginning, the root of all programming language, the C language.\nWho uses this language? Essentialy, everybody, whether they know it or not. It's used in your operating system (mobile and desktop), for most embedded systems and even in building other programming languages (like Java, Python and C#)\n\nContent of this course\n\nThis course has been created with you, the beginner, in mind. We start from the basics of the basics, how to create the code in the C programming language and run it. We will be using Dev-C++ as our IDE but this is just a recommendation, if you have already other IDE installed you can certainly use that.\nWe will continue with creating an overview of what a program actually is and how we can interact with this program using user input (from the keyboard) and program output (using the command prompt's console). We will also learn ways to format our output however we want.\nInteracting with the program is all nice and good, but what if we want it to do something else based on a certain condition. This is what will learn next, and we won't stop there. We will also go through ways in which we can do something (inside our code) however many times we want.\nNext up we'll cover ways to manipulate text in a low-level manner. This is very interesting and much more in-depth than in some other languages. This is something that is hidden from you when using other languages (such as Java) for text manipulation and will be great food for thought for the curious.\nAnd lastly, we will shortly cover how to create code that can be used later on using functions.\nAfter this course you will be on your way to becoming a programmer. You will know the basics which can be applied in any programming language and much more.",

No config needed.\nNext.js is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites. React documentation mentions Next.js among \"Recommended Toolchains\" advising it to developers as a solution when \"Building a server-rendered website with Node.js\". Where traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side.\nNext.js also supports Incremental Static Regeneration and static site generation - a compiled version of the website is usually built during build time and saved as a .next folder. When a user makes a request, the pre-built version which are static HTML pages are cached and sent to them. This makes the load time very fast, but it's not suitable for every website because for interactive sites that change often and utilize a lot of user input will not be suitable.\n\n\nIn this series I will go with nextjs basics and teach you how you can get started with becoming nextjs developer. Throughout the course I will teach all the best practices as a web developer you can use in your day to day projects.\n\n\nFew of topics I cover in this series are\n- Introduction & project setup of nextjs\n- Cleanup, folder structure explanation\n- Layout setup with bootstrap\n- Home page, About Page, Contact Page\n- Build & deploy to netlify with git",

You get to keep your DOM and sprinkle in behavior as you see fit.\nAlpine.js is for developers who aren’t looking to build a single-page application (SPA). It’s lightweight and designed to write markup-driven client-side JavaScript.\nThe syntax is borrowed from Vue and Angular directive. That means it will feel familiar if you’ve worked with those before. But, again, Alpine.js is not designed to build SPAs, but rather enhance your templates with a little bit of JavaScript.\n\nIt’s like a replacement for jQuery and JavaScript, but with declarative rendering\nIt allows you to write most of your JS inline in your HTML, making it easier to write declarative code (as opposed to procedural code). According to its creator Caleb Porzio, it aims to fill the void between vanilla JS (or jQuery) and large v-dom frameworks like Vue/React.\nThis course will cover the following topics related to Alpine.JS\nIntroduction to Alpine.js\nLearning how to work with various UI Components like\nDropdown\nModal Dialogs\nSidebar\nTabs\nImages\nHow to do scroll detection\nHow to work with Loops\nHow to handle AJAX Calls and using x-init\nSo what are you waiting for enroll now and start learning today.",

You can still use it as reference.\n\nAngular 2 is going to be a game changer in the Web Development world and would enable you to architect large scale and maintainable software. Angular 2 embraces web technologies and best practices in software development which means that your software will be future proof. Not to mention its performance and blazingly fast internals that would make it the first choice for making mobile applications.\n\nAt this point Angular is still in developer preview but you can get started learning the basic concepts and get ahead of the curve. This course introduces you the basic concepts of Angular 2 namely Components, Annotations, Views, Event Handlers and Directives. In Angular 2 everything is a Component and this course takes a component-centric approach. We will use Components as the main point of discussion and learn about other concepts in Angular 2 in the context of Components.\n\nEven though Angular 2 is still in developer preview, you should set learning Angular 2 as your top priority because not only is Angular 2 going to be the future of web, but also there are a lot of new concepts in Angular 2 that require time to internalize. Also note that this course will be continuously updated as new changes come out. Don't worry about the API changes that much as long as you learn the semantics of the framework, syntax and API changes won't be as important.\nAs an awesome bonus of joining the course, you’ll get my ebook: Angular 2 for beginners for FREE.

      "description": "Object Oriented programming is a programming style that is associated with the concept of Class, Objects and various other concepts revolving around these two, like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation etc.\nObject means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:\nObject\nClass\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\nAbstraction\nEncapsulation\n\n\nObject:\nAny entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.\n\n\nClass:\nCollection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.\n\n\nInheritance:\nWhen one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.\n\n\nPolymorphism\nWhen one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.\n\n\nAbstraction\nHiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.\n\n\nHow is this course structured?\nI will teach you in a hierarchical way from the basic to advance level.\nThere is a video lecture on every topic explained in English.\nWho is the target audience?\nAn Absolute beginner who want to learn OOPs from scratch.",

An understanding of Web technologies like HTML and HTTP is helpful.\nJDBC , Servlets and JSP Objective\n\nLearn the fundamentals of JDBC and using the different interfaces in the JDBC API. Learn how to use Java servlets in the role of Web application control. Identify the options to state management in a Java Web application and understand the pros/cons of each. Understand how JSPs can help to separate Web logic and functionality from page layout.\nJava Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface (API) for the programming language Java, which defines how a client may access a database. It is a Java-based data access technology used for Java database connectivity. It is part of the Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation. It provides methods to query and update data in a database, and is oriented toward relational databases. A JDBC-to-ODBC bridge enables connections to any ODBC-accessible data source in the Java virtual machine (JVM) host environment.\nJakarta Server Pages (JSP; formerly JavaServer Pages) is a collection of technologies that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP, or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems,[1] JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but uses the Java programming language.\nTo deploy and run Jakarta Server Pages, a compatible web server with a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, is required.\nAn application server framework contains a comprehensive service layer model. It includes a set of components accessible to the software developer through a standard API defined for the platform itself. For Web applications, these components usually run in the same environment as their web server(s), and their main job is to support the construction of dynamic pages. However, many application servers do more than generate web pages: they implement services such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing, so developers can focus on implementing the business logic.\n\n\nI'm new here so, I'll try to adapt and build more and more with time.",

      "description": "Vue has quickly become one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks around and in my opinion, it is the most approachable. Frameworks can be very intimidating and nobody wants to spend a long time setting up a local development environment just to spin up a basic application.\nVue is a progressive framework and that might sound like a bunch of marketing jargon to you but I promise you it isn't. This means that you can get started using Vue quickly and easily and as your needs grow the framework will grow with you.\nTo get started with Vue all you need to do is drop a script tag on a page and you are ready to go. This allows you to add Vue to your existing applications without having to buy into complicated toolchains. In this course, all of the examples that we walkthrough can be done by adding Vue to a single HTML file and writing a little bit of JavaScript.\nIf you're a front end web developer that has a working knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript this course is for you. If you just want to learn the basics of Vue in a couple of hours, this course is for you. This course isn't meant to teach everything you need to know about Vue. It will teach you the fundamental building blocks of Vue and it will do so in under two hours.\nYou will learn how to build Vue applications through a series of tutorials, exercises and quizzes meant to reinforce the concepts you learn in this course. You will have access to all of the starting code so that you don't have to spend time writing boilerplate and can focus in on the task at hand. You will also have access to all of the solutions in case you get stuck.\nThis course is meant to help beginners get up and running with Vue JS. What are you waiting for? Enroll in this course today and learn something new.",

It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices.\nBit of History\nIn 2015, designer Frances Berriman and Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell coined the term \"progressive web apps\" to describe apps taking advantage of new features supported by modern browsers, including service workers and web app manifests, that let users upgrade web apps to progressive web applications in their native operating system (OS). Google then put significant efforts into promoting PWA development for Android. Firefox introduced support for service workers in 2016, and Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari followed in 2018, making service workers available on all major systems.\nBy 2019, PWAs were available on desktop browsers Microsoft Edge[5] (on Windows) and Google Chrome[16] (on Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and Linux).\nReact is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications\nLecture 1:Introduction to React.Js\nLecture 2:Introduction to PWA - Progressive Web Applications\nLecture 3:Creating PWA - Progressive Web Application\nLecture 4:Exploring Application Structure and Workflow\nLecture 5:Making Use of React Hooks\nLecture 6:Build and Serve Project\nLecture 7:How to use a service worker\nLecture 8:Offline Cache\nLecture 9:Exploring Manifest.json\nLecture 10:Installing Progressive Web App in Chrome Browser\nLet us start learning to create Progressive Web Applications",

      "description": "First launched in 2014, this simple \"evergreen\" series of short tutorials has proven popular ever since, and shows how to connect to a MySQL database using a PDO connection and display the database records in the browser.\n\nWhy use PDO?\n\nThere is a choice of only two ways to connect to a MySQL database, either mysqli, the 'i' standing for 'improved', or PDO. All the old mysql_* commands are long-since deprecatedand inherently a security risk. No mysql_* commands should be used any more, and they should be replaced in old code.\n\nBoth PDO and mysqli are equivalent in terms of security as both support prepared statements, meaning that user input is not entered straight into the SQL query but sent along a different channel where it is sanitised and safe to use. Both remove the risk of SQL injection inherent in using mysql_ commands.\n\nUnlike mysqli, PDO supports named parameters and placeholder question marks; mysqli only supports placeholders. I will show how to work with both in this tutorial and you will see that named parameters are an easier and more convenient way of working with database fields easier.\nUnlike mysqli, PDO supports many different database vendors – mysqli as we would gather from the name, only supports MySQL databases. If you did have to swap from one database type to another you would still have work to do as the SQL queries would be different, but at least it would be possible without many changes.\nIn summary, PDO is secure, flexible, and convenient and the best choice for all new projects and updates, so let's get started.\nThis tutorial assumes you know how to create a MySQL database in phpMyAdmin on your local machine, but to speed things up I provide an SQL file for you to import the database you need to do the course into phpMyAdmin.",

      "description": "In this course, we will learn to create Blazor Server Applications using ASP.Net Core and Blazor\nBlazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.\nBlazor is a feature of ASP.NET, the popular web development framework that extends the .NET developer platform with tools and libraries for building web apps.\nBlazor can run your client-side C# code directly in the browser, using WebAssembly. Because it's real .NET running on WebAssembly, you can re-use code and libraries from server-side parts of your application.\nBlazor uses open web standards without plug-ins or code transpilation. Blazor works in all modern web browsers, including mobile browsers.\nYour C# code can easily call JavaScript APIs and libraries. You can continue to use the large ecosystem of JavaScript libraries that exist for client-side UI while writing your logic in C#.\nWhen using server-side code execution, Blazor takes care of seamlessly executing any JavaScript code on the client.\nThe course comprises of following topics\nIntroduction to Blazor\nIntroduction to Blazor Server Applications\nFile Folder Structure\nSetup and Database\nScaffolding and Data Access\nCRUD Operations\nForm Validations\nConclusion\nSo what are you waiting for subscribe to this course and start learning today.",

Finally, the last extension is a web scraper / automation tool that will interact with the active web page and perform a set of commands that we can select.\nThe aim of the course is to show how quickly you can prototype ideas using a Chrome Extension and also to help you get to grips with how extensions are built. You will learn how to set up an extension including the manifest file, the different types of extensions you can build & how to quickly prototype your ideas into working extensions.\n(All of the source code that we start with and the completed projects will be available to download to help speed up the development process)\nIf you have ever wondered how a Chrome Extension is created or have an idea for an extension you want to create, then this is the perfect course for you!",

In this project we will get Pokémons from an API and show it to the user, the user can select a Pokemon in order to see the details for that Pokemon, he can also add that Pokemon to his favourites in order to collect a list of Pokémons. We store this favourite list in redux persist, so that the user can come back to the website and the data is kept and persisted.\n\n\nReact Router: In this tutorial we will focus on how to work with the react router. It is important to grasp and learn this Library as it is the Foundation of web applications and you will use it very often.\n\n\n‌Todo list App: this todo list application will allow us to dive deeper into redux without complicating things. It will help you to understand the main principles and concept of redux in a simple way.\n\n\nDad Jokes App: In this project we used an API for getting jokes and showing them to the user. We also used material UI to design this gorgeous user interface.\n\n\nGoogle Maps Travel Advisor App: This allows the user to discover the places around him. We will use google maps to plot the places And we will also use the travel advisor api to get the places for the user's location.\n‌We will use many libraries for React.Js to implement the projects such as Material-UI for making beautiful designs effortlessly, React Redux to allow us to implement a global state system which allows all components to connect to it and access the core data of the web application. We will be using Axios to get data from an API.",

      "description": "Why is PDO important?\nPDO provides a data-access abstraction layer in PHP, which means that, regardless of what database you're using, you write the same functions to issue queries and fetch data.  It's that simple! However, you still need to set a database-specific PDO driver in your php.ini to access the correct database server.\n\n\nHow is this course different?\n\n\nThis is a hands-on project; no fluff or history lessons that you can always search if you're interested.\nThis updated course was originally written in 2019 using PHP 7.3,\nbut it has been reviewed in 2024 using PHP 8.2 to assure its integrity.\nEach section starts with independent code after a brief review of concepts.\nWash, Rinse, and Repeat.\n\n\nUpon completion of this project, you should be able to:\n\n\nSummarize and remember the steps involved in using PHP to accomplish a basic database connection and CRUD.\nHave a solid foundation to take other courses involving PHP and database connections, like using Symfony components, for example.\nYour PDO training starts here.\nThe purpose of this short course is to empower you by giving you the basics before you tackle a framework where everything is more abstract. It's a short study project designed to go slow by repeating core exercises.\n\n\nWhy PHP?\nIn 2025, PHP still powers 76% of websites around the world. PHP has evolved into a powerful, object oriented language. We are not in 2005 anymore.  The job market is wide open for good PHP developers that take time to study fundamentals.\n\n\nThis project informs and teaches; and that is great for reviewing concepts as well.\nAdd it to your collection of periodic drills you must do to stay current with the basics.\nSubscribe today, even if you want to start at a later date.",

      "description": "Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.\n\n\nWhy to Learn Python?\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.\n\n\nPython is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\nPython is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\nPython is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\nPython is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\nPython is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.\n\n\nCharacteristics of Python\nFollowing are important characteristics of Python Programming −\nIt supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.\nIt can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.\nIt provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.\nIt supports automatic garbage collection.\nIt can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.\n\n\nPython is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:\nEasy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.\nEasy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.\nEasy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.\nA broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.\nInteractive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.\nPortable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.\nExtendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.\nDatabases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.\nGUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.\nScalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.",

This unstructured data can contain a mixture of data models, including key-value, document, columnar and graph formats, etc. NoSQL database is especially useful for handling humongous sets of distributed data. These databases have a dynamic schema and no specific query language along with no or very fewer relationships. But it stores the data in the form of collections and documents which enable quick updates.\nThere is a list of NoSQL databases which are used quite heavily in the industry, some of which I have listed below:\nMongoDB\nHbase\nCassandra\nAmazon SimpleDB\nHypertable\nTo know more about NoSQL and it varies from SQL databases, you can check out this article on Differences between SQL & NoSQL Databases.\nIn this Node.js MongoDB tutorial, I will be focussing on only one of these databases, which by now you might have guessed, that is MongoDB. But before I show you how to work with it, let’s get familiar with its nitty-gritty.\nntroduction to MongoDB\nMongoDB is an open source non-relational database that stores the data in the form of collections and documents. This kind of databases preserves most of the functionalities while offering horizontal scalability. This eases the work of a developer by providing persistence to the data and enhancing agility.\nMongoDB stores the JSON documents in the form of collections having dynamic schemas. It stores all the related information together which enhances the speed of query processing. This way, it also helps in bringing down the gap between the key-value stores and relational databases.\nBelow I have listed down a few of the most intriguing features of MongoDB:\nIndexing: It makes use of indexes that helps in improving the search performance.\nReplication: MongoDB distributes the data across different machines.\nAd-hoc Queries: It supports ad-hoc queries by indexing the BSON documents & using a unique query language.\nSchemaless: It enhances the flexibility of the data and needs no script to modify or update data.\nSharding: It makes use of sharding which eases the deployment of very large data sets and provides high throughput operations.\nNow that you are familiar with MongoDB, let’s move ahead with this Node.js MongoDB tutorial and see how simple it is to install MongoDB in the system.\nExpress is one of the most popular web frameworks for Node.js that supports routing, middleware, view system… Mongoose is a promise-based Node.js ODM for MongoDB that provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model our application data along with built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks… In this tutorial, I will show you step by step to build Node.js Restful API for CRUD operations using Express, Mongoose with MongoDB database.",

      "description": "CSS - short for Cascading Style Sheets - is a \"programming language\" you use to turn your raw HTML pages into real beautiful websites.\nClip-path property is your ticket to shape-shifting the monotonous, boxy layouts traditionally associated with flat, responsive design. You will begin to think outside the box, literally, and hexagons, stars, and octagons will begin to take form on your web pages. Once you get your hands dirty with clip-path, there’s no end to the shapes you can generate, simply by tweaking a few values. While the focus of this article is on clip-path using polygons with CSS, all of the demos provide a reference to an inline SVG, in order to gain additional support on Firefox. Generating a responsive SVG clipped shape is trivial once you have created a responsive shape with CSS’ clip-path. We’ll look at this in detail later.\nclip-path makes it easy to clip-out basic shapes using either of the polygon, ellipse, circle, or inset keywords, which are part of the CSS exclusion module.\nPolygon\nPolygon is the most flexible of all the available shapes because it allows you to specify any amount of points, a little bit like an SVG path. The provided points are pairs of X and Y coordinates that can be of any unit (eg: pixel or percent-based). Because it’s the most flexible, it’s also the most complex and you’ll probably want to use a tool to define your points.\nClipping is when we trim a piece from something. In our case, it is an operation that allows us to completely or partially hide elements on a web page. Two other concepts that relate to clipping which we will use in this article are the clipping path and clipping region.\nThe clipping path is the path we use to clip an element, it marks out our clipping region. It can be a basic shape or a complex polygonal path. The clipping region then includes all the area enclosed within the clipping path.\nAnything outside the clipping region is clipped by the browsers. This not only includes backgrounds and other such content but also borders, text-shadows, and so on. Moreover, browsers won’t capture any events like hover or click outside an element’s clipping region.\nEven though our specific element is now non-rectangular, the content around the elements flows exactly the way it would have if the element had its original shape. To make the surrounding elements flow according to the shape of the clipped element, you will have to use the shape-outside property.\nCSS Basic shapes from the “CSS Shapes Module” provide a convenient way to use clip-path. The different shapes available are polygon, circle, ellipse, and inset; inset is for rectangular shapes.\nwith SVG One can, alternatively, create a shape using SVG and then clip an element to this shape via the URL syntax. There are two ways to do this:\nwith a reference to an inline SVG (i.e. the SVG markup exists on the page itself),\nwith a reference to an external SVG document. In both cases, the clipPath element within the SVG is used to wrap the element that determines the clipping path, be it a circle, polygon, path, or another element. Compare the demo below in Firefox and in a WebKit or Blink browser such as Chrome to spot the differences. Square images imply a lack of browser support. Note: The third image does not show up in Safari. Despite extensive debugging, I’m unable to resolve the issue. I’d appreciate a note in the comments section if you come across the solution.\n\n\nThis is a video course full of real downloadable code examples. You'll be able to take the knowledge, as well as the real working code, to your projects and make sure they stand out.\nResponsive Web Design\nCreate Responsive Website Using HTML5 CSS3\nfrontend developers\nwebsite designer\nHtml Developers\nLearn Web Development Courses and Tutorials\nhow to make a responsive website using Html CSS Javascript\nBuild a real-world responsive website\njavascript front end tutorial\nfront end developer course\nfront end development tutorials\nLearn Web Development Courses and Tutorials\nresponsive website design from scratch 2020\nDesign A Complete Responsive Business Website From Scratch\nhtml5 + css3 responsive web design\nLearn Modern Responsive Web Design With Example Step by Step\nResponsive Html5 CSS3 Website\nWeb Design For Beginners\nBuild A Modern Looking Responsive Websites\nLearn Responsive Web Design From Scratch\nReal World Coding in HTML & CSS\nHtml5 CSS3 and Javascript: A Guide To Web Design From Scratch\nWeb Design HTML CSS Create Single Page Website from Scratch\nFront End Web Development\nHelp and inspiration?\nNot only do you get a load of practical, useful starting projects in this course, you can also head over to CSS Animation.rocks for more, and even sign up to a weekly newsletter packed full of tutorials, inspiration, and tips for animating on the web.\nThere’s no better time to learn Animations: You’ve made a smart choice because CSS 3 Animations is the most popular language out there.

Don't worry I have covered it for you where without writing single line of code you can design the site for yourself or for your client. You will be learning entire WordPress framework and will get the complete idea of designing the WordPress site.\n---\nA comprehensive course on building WordPress website (with subtitle) from scratch with:\nScale-able and flexible theme;\nAdd-on theme plugin;\nRelevant functional and compatible plugins.\n---\nThis course also includes all theory teachings and hands-on tutorials, that will allow you to:\n\nBuild complete website to build instant rapport with targeted audience;\nCreate interactive posts with SEO features;\nConvert audience or visitors into subscribers.\n---\nWhat Is WordPress?\nWordPress is a content management system (CMS) that allows you to host and build websites. WordPress contains plugin architecture and a template system so you can customize any website to fit your business, blog, portfolio, or online store.\nWordpress dot org vs WordPress dot com\nThe difference between WordPress dot org and WordPress dot com has to do with who is actually hosting your website.\n---\nHow to Choose Between WordPress dot org or WordPress dot com\nYou may be wondering whether WordPress dot org or WordPress dot com would be a better fit for you. Let’s review a few more of the pros and cons that come with both options so you can make an informed decision.\nWordpress dot org is ideal if you want full power over customizing and controlling your website. However, there is a lot more responsibility that comes with managing a WordPress dot org website site. You have to purchase and set up your own domain name, upload and install all of your custom plugins and themes, edit your website’s code, and manage your website’s security. WordPress dot org is free to use, but you have to pay for everything else that goes into having a website (including but not limited to everything I’ve just listed).\nWordPress dot com is preferable if you’re looking for an option that has most of the hard work done for you. You’ll never need to manage your server, pay for your hosting, or buy a domain. There are also a number of customization options that come with a WordPress dot com plan to help you make your website look the way you want it to.",

With various technologies such as Git, Github, NodeJS, Docker, and Digital Ocean's Cloud, we skip some of the mundane coding basics and dive into building a practical application. In this course I will show you how to build a small RESTful API with Node.js and deploy to the cloud within 30 minutes (excluding intro, some setup, and optional videos!). We will be collecting JSON data from IoT 'devices' and storing said data in a cloud hosted relational database called Postgres.\nSome technologies used:\nDocker\nDigital Ocean\nGit & GitHub\nNode.js and NPM\nVSCode\nPostgreSQL\ncURL\nWith the application will come some security and testing best practices that you'll be able to extend for more production-ready applications.

JavaScript makes it easy to write and execute tests, enabling developers to quickly and easily verify that their software is working correctly.\nWith the right testing tools, developers can ensure that the APIs they are working with are reliable and secure. This is essential for ensuring that the application is able to provide the desired results.\nIn this new tutorial, you will learn how to implement automated API testing with Cypress 10.\n\n\nReady to start?

Well explained, however, if you are using Windows and you are new in Automation Testing, you might find it a bit challenging with adding the SDK Token in your system environment since the instruction used MAC which is completely a different way with windows.

This is a great tutorial for beginners and experienced developers to learn a few techniques in CSS.\nMixer (formerly Beam) is a Seattle-based video game live streaming platform owned by Microsoft. The service officially launched on January 5, 2016.[3] Like competing services, Mixer focuses on video gaming, including playthroughs of video games and live streaming, but is primarily distinguished by features designed to allow viewers to interact with streams. Using an SDK (software development kit), features can be integrated into games to allow users to affect gameplay or vote on elements using buttons displayed alongside the stream. Users earn \"Sparks\" for watching and participating in streams, which can then be spent to activate these features. Mixer advertises that there is a latency of less than a second between the original broadcast and when it is received by users, rather than 10–20 seconds, which facilitates these features and encourages real-time interaction between streamers and their viewers without delays.[4][5]",

By doing so, you will be able to add your social links, more information about you, as well as dynamic content (such as your latest blog posts and You Tube videos).\nIn this course we will cover:\nHow to get started: how to create a free GitHub account and special repo;\nMarkdown: a deep dive into the formatting which underpins everything on GitHub;\nDynamic data: using third party widgets to visualise your activity in graphical format, and a light touch on getting started with GitHub Actions.\nRemember: your GitHub profile is a living project. You will not get this perfect first time and it is important to take that first step to customise it.\nThroughout this course I will give you the tools to continue improving your GitHub Profile. You can then continue making use of these skills in other repositories, raising issues and pull requests.\nA fully customised GitHub profile will definitely increase your visibility and give you that 'wow factor' for employers, clients and your peers.",

For you as a beginner, it will be a great start in Svelte.\n\n\nAs you know Svelte is raising in popularity, and more and more developers starting to use Svelte to build fast reactive front-end applications that can work with their API. The community of the Svelte becoming bigger every day - and now you can join this community and see all features of the Svelte. It's a really easy framework to learn and understand and also if you don't have any experience with front-end frameworks like Vue or React - that's not a problem because in this course we are going to talk only about the basics of the Svelte, so, you will understand everything.\n\n\nAnd yes, we are going also to see the basic use of the Svelte Kit - a toolkit that we can use to build a full Svelte front-end application (but sometimes this toolkit is also used to build a custom API that will work with MongoDB).",

      "description": "Hi, my name is Romans and I am a professional freelance Web application developer. I participated and built many SaaS apps, have worked as CTO for various web start-ups and have been a very active open-source contributor. I teach secondary students how to build useful web apps as a hobby.\nI offer you this ORIGINAL COURSE where I will introduce you to a very powerful \"PHP + ATK + Heroku\" combination. To my knowledge it's the FASTEST and the most EFFICIENT approach for building powerful web apps.\nHow is this course different?\nMy goal is not to give you \"introduction\" to gazillion free web technologies, instead I will keep my focus on those core technologies and keep going deeper and deeper eventually enabling you to build and deploy sophisticated web apps. ATK is pretty new framework, but its core goal is to make web development simpler, more friendly, not more complex.\n\nWhat about Laravel/Symfony?\nIn my course you'll learn an efficient way to build Web UI and work with Data. If you know one of Laravel/Symfony/Wordpress already, you can use it together with ATK.\n\nHow does PHP compare with Ruby/JavaScript/Python?\nPHP is the most popular language for websites and web apps. It alway was. NodeJS is trendy. Ruby on Rails was trendy in 2006 and is now in decline. But there is a good reason why PHP remains #1 for web sites - it runs everywhere, it's easy to install, it's easy to learn and it's really fast. Don't take my word for it - verify it yourself on \"Google Trends\".\nWhat does \"Express course\" mean in the title?\nMost courses I've seen here will start at the very beginning and will dedicate some limited time on various technologies you need to build web apps. 3 lectures on HTML. 2 lectures on CSS and so on. Quite often you have to listen to over 200 lectures before you get your application online!\nFOR EXAMPLE: many professional developers DON'T USE SQL language. They rely on \"data abstraction frameworks\". Also many Web Developers DON'T write CSS or HTML themselves. They use CSS frameworks. So, unless you want to be a Website Designer, there is no real need for you to master HTML/CSS. Yet other courses will insist on giving you a comprehensive introduction for all the fundamentals. Why spend your time on them now, if you might not need them in the future?\nIn my course I only teach you technologies which you will absolutely need to make Web Apps. Sometimes I'll suggest you where you can learn more about those supplementary technologies, but I remain very firmly focused on the goal.\nWhat are the milestones?\nIf know nothing about web apps and you start my course now, then:\nIn one hour, you will know how to run your own web app in the cloud and use version control.\nIn two hours, you will be able to work with database and build interactive applications, and use 3rd party services for sending SMS messages.\nIn three hours, you will learn about relations, expressions and data aggregation.\nIn four hours, you will know how to make SaaS multi-user apps and send out nicely-looking emails.\nIn five hours, you will know how to work with files and accept on-line payments.\nAdditionally, we will be implementing lots of web apps. If you need, pause my videos and try following me with your own code editor. Also - work on assignments.\nDO NOT SKIP LECTURES. To save time I rarely repeat things. Make sure you fully understand every lecture before moving on. If not - please post questions in \"Q/A\" section.\nOther courses to learn?\nAfter finishing this course, I recommend:\nIf you wish to be a better frontend/mobile developer - Learn React. It can interact with ATK / PHP through RestAPI.\nIf you wish to tweak UI - Learn CSS and dig deeper into Semantic UI.\nIf you wish to self-host your apps - learn more about Docker and Kubernetes.\nIMPORTANT: I'm still working to record videos in the curriculum. I typically release several videos every week. Because my material is NOT COMPLETE, I am giving you access to my course FOR FREE. Please consider that before leaving a review.",

It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.\nand Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's proprietary globally distributed, multi-model database service \"for managing data at planet-scale\". It is schema-agnostic, horizontally scalable, and generally classified as a NoSQL database\nWe will also need Node.js which is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.\nNode.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.\nWe will be covering the following items\nLecture 1: Introduction\nLecture 2: Install Node.Js and React\nLecture 3: Setting up Visual Studio Code Editor and Azure Extensions\nLecture 4: Creating Project using React and CosmosDB\nLecture 5: Create Database\nLecture 6: Installing Dependencies\nLecture 7: Connecting to CosmosDB\nLecture 8: Understanding Workflow\nLecture 9: Custom Services and Creating Component\nLecture 10: CRUD Operations - Add Record\nLecture 11: CRUD Operations - Delete Record\nSo let's start learning creating web apps using React and CosmosDB",

      "description": "Hello, Welcome to this course. This WordPress localhost course will help you get started with WordPress on your computer. first, you need to understand one thing if you are thinking that WordPress development on a live server and on a local computer are two different things then you are wrong. developing WordPress on a local server and on the live hosts is a similar thing.\nIf you would learn how to develop a WordPress website on a local computer then you will also develop the entire website on the live server as well. Hello, my name is Hameed Ali Khan and I am a Software Engineer specialized in application programming. you might be thinking that why this guy is showing interest in WordPress?  This is a very good question. The first thing WordPress has a very big market share when you talk about its usage. More than 27 million websites are now live over the internet which is using WordPress at the backend. Being open-source it is very useful when you are thinking to create some very techy. WordPress with its ever-growing popularity it is now an industry-leading skill that you might have in 2020.\nAfter learning WordPress you could easily land a job. But again I remember when I was starting learning WordPress then I bought a domain name and hosting which completely waste of money.  That's why I made this course this course will help you to get a complete business-ready website in just 10 minutes or so. With a starter template and demo content, you will develop a stunning website in just a couple of minutes and all this on localhost mean on your computer. I am assuring you all these techniques will also work on a live server.\nThere is not a single reason why you should learn WordPress localhost. One of the most use cases of WordPress localhost is when you are about to install a new theme or a new plugin. For many large websites that have lots of content on it the developer of that website test most of their plugin on locally this not only gives them, the flexibility to understand what this plugin is doing in the sandbox environment but also helps them to avoid website crashes. As you will become an expert in WordPress you will realize how important is this WordPress localhost testing. If you are a complete newbie or seasonal pro I think you should take this online course of WordPress localhost. After completion of this course, you will be able to install  WordPress and run your complete website on your web browser. you will also learn how to install XAMPP server and start the apache and MySQL module to make your website work. Once you get comfortable with these installations and setup you will make your website in 10 minutes using the starter template. The starter template used in this course is also free you don't have to pay any money to import demo content. This Starter template will help you to make things faster.\nLet's see what you will learn in this course.\nFirst, we will learn how to install the XAMPP server locally on your computer.\nthen we will dive deep into WordPress installation on htdocs folder of the XAMPP server.\nInstall some theme and plugin which will give us a starter template.\nImport demo content and getting started with WordPress.\nThen we will learn to customize that website by using Elementor page builder.\nAfter customizing this website we will take a complete backup and restore that backup to get deleted content.\nCreating a backup plan. This backup plan will take your website backup and save it to your remote storage. This remote storage could be any storage over the internet it could Amazon S3 cloud, Rackspace, Google Drive, or even Dropbox. In this course, we will be focusing on connecting website backup to our google drive to make things easy and simple.\nAfter that, we will learn about the PHPMyAdmin database, and how you could reset your username and password using this PHPMyAdmin.\nNow in this step, we will migrate our complete locally hosted website to a live server. This will give you the taste of the most important aspect of developing WordPress to your computer. After migration, you will see this website by searching on any web browser. This migration process will work similarly to any WordPress website.\nAt the end of this course, you will do everything with WordPress in your computer using XAMPP server.\nNow the question is.\nWhy me?\nyes, I understand this is very important to know your instructor before enrolling in any course. why me? I am a software engineer in computer science. Graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, India. I Have been working as a full-time employee in an IT company based in India. I have been Developing, Testing, and Deploying applications using most of the popular or even unpopular stack on a regular basis for almost 3 years now. Besides that, I love teaching people everything that I know. I am also an avid reader.\nEnroll today and learn most of WordPress without buying hosting and domain. I am super excited to see you in this course.",

      "description": "Hello there! Thank you so much for visiting this WordPress Website 2019 HTTPS, Elementor & Futurio Free Theme course. We will learn how to create an HTTPS WordPress website with Elementor 2019 and Free Futurio Theme, with no coding, in 1,5 hours. Except for the domain and the web host, the tools that are used in this course are all free.  The theme and the plugin that we will use are all free. If you already have the domain and the web host, just skip the first sections to follow along.\n\nIn this WordPress Website 2019 course, we will learn how to create WordPress website using Futurio free WordPress theme and Elementor free plugin. We will have a cool trending self-typing text effect on your website's front page. At the end of this video, you will have a full functional website. In the homepage we will have the self-typing text that is currently trending in the web design world.\n\nWe will start by learning how to get a domain name, that has free domain info protection to protect your private information. Once your private information is out, there is no coming back. This is very crucial if you for example, want to build a website for clients.\n\nWe'll also choose a good web host that is affordable and has free SSL certificate to setup HTTPS version of your website that will not flag your website as \"not Secure\" on modern browsers. We'll learn how to automatically renew this SSL certificate so that you won't have to renew it monthly or in specific period of time.\n\nThen we'll also learn how to set up HTTPS badge on your WP website properly in 5 minutes. This 5 minutes time, is worth your investment. This is also apart of this WordPress Website 2019 course.\n\nWhy? Because we will set up HTTPS without using a plugin. A plugin in WordPress is a 3rd party tool in your website's structure. In your WordPress website's journey, it is most likely that you'll eventually install many useful and cool plugins. However, having many different plugins can cause incompatibilities between these plugins. So to troubleshoot your website, you'll eventually need to disable one, many or even all of your plugins. And your WordPress website's address or URL is the very crucial part of your website. If you disable the plugin to setup your site's HTTPS badge, then your site HTTPS version will not be available, this can cause appearance errors due to the theme files, or even some URL errors that will cause you a headache.\n\nSo set up HTTPS properly from the beginning without a plugin, and this 5-minutes investment will save your website from unnecessary problems in the future.\n\nFurthermore, HTTPS plugins will do more redirections and this can slow down your website. It does not make sense to have beautiful websites, yet slow loading speed, so that your visitors will just go away without even bothering to wait for your site to load. So let's setup HTTPS properly from the beginning when it is only 5 minutes to do it. Let's get started with this WordPress Website 2019 course!",

Join me in Visual Studio and the exciting world of coding to build a browser-centric to-do application using C#, HTML, Razor, and WebAssembly.\nNo prior coding is needed, but I suggest watching the first part in the series, where I teach the critical C# theory required to understand the concepts we use to build the to-do application in this course.\nThe application has two iterations, where the first has all the C# code in the Razor page, and the second uses separation of concerns and encapsulation to break out the to-do-centric C# code into a separate class, which is used from the Razor page.\nMost courses teach C# through short example snippets with no real-world anchoring. Training thousands of students in classrooms and online and studying what works best shows that building real-world applications makes the students retain the knowledge more and makes learning more fun.\nYou learn how to:\nBuild a user interface with HTML, Razor, and Bootstrap\nAdd C# code to make it dynamic.\nRefactor the application with object-oriented programming, separation of concerns, and encapsulation\nUse extension methods to make the code less bloated\nConnect Razor events in the HTML with C# in a code block\nAdd exception handling and debug your code\nCreate a GitHub repository and send your code to it\nCourse Image by catalyststuff on Freepik",

      "description": "★ JOIN MORE THAN 4,000 STUDENTS WHO HAVE LEARNED HOW TO CREATE A WORDPRESS BLOG\n\n\nWordPress course for beginners - learn how to become a blogger!\nDid you know that about 35% of the websites on the internet are powered by WordPress? And it's used by popular brands across the world, some of them are The New Yorker, Microsoft News Center, Beyonce, TechCrunch, and The Official Star Wars Blog. So if you are still wondering if you should learn how to use WordPress, the short answer is yes because you will not be disappointed.\nIn this course, you will learn how to create your WordPress blog in the most efficient way possible, and the best part is that you don't need any prior knowledge. The goal of this course is to teach beginners and show that this content management system is easy to use. Once you understand how everything works, you will be able to create more than just a blog.\nI remember when I started my first WordPress blog and what issues I faced, constantly going through WordPress for dummies tutorials, which did not help much. I didn't know what is hosting or domain name, and how all these things work together. I used to think that to create a WordPress website, you must know how to code. So if you are in the same boat right now, I completely understand how you feel. I'm here to share my knowledge with you and walk you through the creation of your blog.\nIn this step by step course, I will answer your question of how to become a blogger. And within a day, your WordPress blog will be ready!\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn in This WordPress Course\nAt the beginning of this course, I will explain to you what exactly you will need, and how everything works. You will see yourself that WordPress is a very versatile content management system (CMS). And it has to be one of the reasons why it's so popular.\n\n\nSetting up your Hosting and domain\nYou will learn where to get your domain name for free (for a year). Doesn't this sound great? Sometimes choosing the right domain can be very difficult. Naming your website is not an easy task, in some cases, it can take a long time until you come up with a final decision. I'll try to make this process easier by sharing with you some tips for choosing your domain name. A great WordPress blog starts with a great name, which is easy to remember, and it stands out from others.\nWhen I was creating this WordPress course, I kept in mind to keep everything under a low budget. That's why I'll be using affordable hosting, I'll show you how to get a free domain, and most of all, that's why this course is free.\nOnce you have picked a domain name for your WordPress blog, we will move to a more technical part. It's where the whole creation process of your website begins. We will start by setting up our hosting and installing WordPress. I'll walk you through every step, and you will see yourself how easy it is.\nBy this point, you will understand what a domain name is, how to set up your hosting, and install WordPress. So basically, to create your website, you will need these three things, they're the most essential. A domain name will be the name of our website, or we can call it an address. We will use hosting to store all our files, including WordPress, which will be our content management system.\nIn the next step, we will install an SSL certificate on our website. It's that grey padlock next to the URL, which you can see in your browser. It indicates that your connection is secure. If you want to have a professional-looking and trustworthy WordPress blog, you should have it. I'll show you how you can easily install it for free.\nEvery hosting provider has its dashboard, or we can call it a panel. Usually, from first glance, it can look very confusing, because there are lots of different options. But don't worry about that, I'll walk you through the most important settings, which might be very useful in the future for your WordPress blog.\nAs well, with hosting, which I use this course, you'll be able to host multiple websites. I will show you how you can easily do this. And in the future, if you'll decide to create another WordPress website, you'll not need to purchase another hosting plan.\nEvery WordPress website needs a business email, and in this course, you will learn how to create it for free. You will be able to create an unlimited number of email accounts. And when sending email messages, you will look way more professional with your business email than with a regular one.\n\n\nStarting With WordPress\nAfter you understand how to use hosting, we will move to the WordPress lessons. Here you will learn how to navigate the WordPress dashboard. At first glance, it might look very confusing because there are a lot of different settings. I'll walk you through each section so you would understand how everything works.\nFrom here, we will move on to the WordPress settings. I'll show you what adjustments you have to do if you want to have a proper running WordPress blog.\nSince WordPress is a free and open-source content management system, there are plenty of various themes and plugins. By using them, you can create almost any type of website. I'll show you how to install them on your WordPress blog and how to activate them. With various combinations of plugins and themes, you'll be able to create your unique-looking website.\nFor this course, I'll be using a free, yet very customizable, WordPress theme, which is called \"Bam\". Using this theme, I was able to create a nice-looking website, which you will see at the beginning of this course.\nIf you will want to create a different looking WordPress blog, I'll show you where you can get premium themes. These are usually way more customizable, but they cost money. From my own experience, I can tell that they are worth it, but you need to know how to choose right. And this is where I'll help you by sharing some tips for picking premium WordPress themes.\n\n\nAdding content to your WordPress blog\nUsually, WordPress beginners have a difficult time understanding the difference between pages and blog posts. In this course, you'll learn how they are different, and what type of information you should add to them.\nI'll show you how to use the latest version of the WordPress text editor. With it, you'll be able to create great-looking blog posts and pages.\nYou'll learn how to create contact us pages with a WordPress plugin \"Ninja Forms.\" Using this page your visitors will be able to contact you. You'll receive their messages to your email.\n\n\nCustomizing your WordPress blog\nBy following my customization lessons, you'll be able to create a similar-looking WordPress blog, just like the one you saw in the introduction video. I'll walk you through all settings, which you can use to customize a theme in your own way.\nI'll show you how to create a footer for your WordPress blog in which we will include our pages and social media profiles. Most of the free themes don't even let you do that unless you upgrade to a paid version. That's why I like the \"Bam\" theme because with a free version, we will get a lot of customization options, and we will be able to create a footer.\nYou will have two options for how you want your WordPress blog homepage to look. You can display the latest posts, or you can create a static page. By default, WordPress will show the latest posts, but I'll show you how you can change that.
