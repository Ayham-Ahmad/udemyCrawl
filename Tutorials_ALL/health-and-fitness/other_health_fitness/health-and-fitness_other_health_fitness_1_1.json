      "description": "Over the past decade I have documented amazing stories of people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who succeeded in reversing their symptoms. The good news is that people do recover. The bad news is that more people have not succeeded in reversing their symptoms, Why not?\nThey focus on healing from the outside-in rather than the inside-out.\nThis course cuts to the core of what it takes to launch a successful journey down the road to recovery from Parkinson's disease. Healing from the inside-out places primary emphasis on identifying and treating the cause of symptoms, not on simply suppressing symptoms with medications and supplements.\nAre you interested in...\nFinding the cause of Parkinson's symptoms using free methods that require no appointments with doctors?\n\nAddressing the cause of symptoms with therapies that facilitate healing from the inside-out rather than the outside-in?\n\nRemoving roadblocks that obstruct recovery from the get-go?\n\nTaking full control over your program of recovery?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a decade of research to identify the factors that cause Parkinson's symptoms and the therapies that help to reverse them, I have concluded there are five fundamental reasons why recovery is hijacked.\n\nPrimary focus is on suppressing symptoms, not finding and treating causes.\nNegative thinking and false beliefs stymie the process of recovery.\nTrauma wreaks havoc on the neurological system to create persistent stress. .\nEntanglements in family systems stifle recovery.\nExposure to toxins persists.\nThrough the Jump Start to Recovery course you will:\nDiscover for yourself what is causing your Parkinson's symptoms.\nTransform thoughts that facilitate and support the recovery process.\nRelease trauma that feeds your symptoms.\nIdentify and unravel entanglements in your family that stymie recovery\nLocate and eliminate exposure to toxins that provoke symptoms.\nForty-five students were enrolled in Jump Start to Recovery during November which doubled the enrollment. I invite you to join with them on a successful journey down the road to recovery. Be sure to scroll down the course so you can view the many videos that are accessible and free for everyone to watch - students and non-students alike.\nJump Start to Recovery helps persons diagnosed with Parkinson's disease take full control over their own recovery. I put you firmly in the driver's seat and provide your with all the tools you need to make recovery happen. Jump Start to Recovery offers 24 hours of instructional videos on how to identify the causes of symptoms, transform thoughts, release traumas, unravel entanglements in your family and eliminate exposure to toxins.\nJump Start to Recovery focuses on precisely what needs to happen to launch a successful program of recovery from Parkinson's disease. Also included are downloads of my books: Seven Secrets to Healing, What is Wrong with Me?, Language of Recovery and the Parkinsons Recovery Mindfulness Series. In addition, each of the course modules includes PDFs of instructional materials, audio recordings that explain key concepts and links to relevant videos.\nThis course has been fully updated as of October 2024. No question from a student is left unanswered.\nEnrollment and lifetime access to the course comes with my personal guarantee of a 30 day, full money back guarantee - no questions asked. There is nothing to lose and everything to gain by jumping on board with a fresh approach to recovery that puts you in the driver's seat.",

        "Jump Start to Recovery is a gold standard course for individuals who have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (or are experiencing neurological difficulties) and their family members who are interested in learning more about natural approaches and therapies that help to reverse symptoms. You will not find specifics on prescription medications or surgeries in this course. Rather, emphasis is on healing from the inside-out rather than the outside-in through a suppression of symptoms. The focus of the course is on taking full control over your recovery rather than handing decisions over to anyone else.

      "description": "Resonant Frequency Breathing or 'Coherent Breathing', is a simple yet powerful system of breathwork with powerful benefits for your health and wellbeing. When you apply your breath in a certain frequency, you can entrain the blood pressure, heart rate variability, and brain waves to synchronize and flow together in a smooth, pleasant, and highly beneficial pattern.\nThere have been hundreds of scientific studies on Resonant Frequencies showing how in just minutes a day, this breath practice:\nLowers high blood pressure\nTurns on the healing side of your nervous system\nReduces chronic inflammation\nIncreases oxygen transfer and energy\nHeals anxiety and depression\nSignificantly improves sleep\nBalances mind and emotions\nRestores wellbeing and a sense of peace\nThis course gives you both a praxis which blends yoga and meditation technique with highly motivating, knowledge of the latest scientific research.\n\nA daily practice that feels amazing (and anyone can do)\nLaying down or sitting anywhere you happen to be- even on your daily commute - you stick in your headphones, press play, close your eyes and simply breathe with a relaxing audio guide using the sounds of bells to pace your breathing. As you practice, you get better at relaxing 6 key areas in your body as you exhale, thus deepening the benefits. After only a few minutes, you will drift into an awake, clear state of consciousness, and start to feel the pulsations of blood and the movements of your heart. Many people can identify when the nervous system switches on its healing function.\n\n\nResonant Frequency Breathing is about learning to breathe at a frequency which is in resonance with the heart, brain, and blood pressure. This specific rhythm synchronizes several systems of the body together, to flow together. The benefits of this practice are astonishing and far-reaching. Not only does this method of breathing take you into a blissful meditation, it is scientifically backed with real research that shows how deeply it benefits the mind and body.\nMy name is Adrian Cox- I am the founder of two schools of yoga and have spent half of my life in deep study, practice, and teaching thousands of people the arts and science of body and mind. Out of the hundreds of techniques I know, this one is very powerful and useful. I love Resonant Frequency Breathing because I not only feel it working, I see the data.\n\nWho is this course for?\nYou might be someone who:\n\nhas heard about breathing practices and want a place to start\nwant a holistic way to lower high blood pressure and improve your health\nteaches yoga or other mind-body practices and want to level up your skill and knowledge\nA practitioner who wants to add a highly effective method of breathing which is evidence-based.\nShare with others\nAs you go through this course you will undoubtedly think of a person in your life who can benefit from Resonant Frequency Breathing. Perhaps this person is suffering from high stress, high anxiety or one of the health conditions such as high blood pressure, fibromyalgia, arthritis, or others. After completing this course you will have the knowledge you need to share this practice as well as an audio guide you can put on your phone to use as you teach and inspire him or her to add this beautiful, simple practice into their life.\n\n\n====== WHAT TO EXPECT ======\n\nAt the core of this course is a practice of breathing that has a ton of clinical research on it. You will learn the results of these studies, summarized in a way that is motivating and easy to understand. I bring in yogic understandings of body and mind, techniques, and practices that amplify the effects of Resonant Frequency Breathing in a measurable way- practices which I have discovered over the past 25 years and not put together in any one place as they are here in this course.  Because this knowledge is so useful for people's health and wellbeing, it is meant to be shared. Whether you are totally new to conscious breathing and body-mind practices or a life-long experienced practitioner like me, you will get value from this beautiful practice. Resonant Frequency Breathing will dovetail into existing practices of coaching, therapy, yoga, reiki practitioners, meditation, sports, and more.\n\nAs you progress through the six modules of this course, you will learn the science of Resonant Frequency and how it improves health and wellbeing. Most importantly, you will gain knowledge, deepen your self-awareness, and be able to share this powerful technique with others. Included in this course are several practice gems that are part of the go-to techniques I use to help people heal and open their breathing power:\n\nOcean Breathing for Diaphragm Strength\nPear-Cone-Wave Breathing for Optimal Breathing\nSix Bridges Technique for Relaxation Mastery\nThe Salamander Technique for Instant Relaxation Response\n\n\nAt each stage of the program, there will be a practice session that incorporates these practices step by step. By the end of this course, you will have an advanced breathing practice and a new relationship with your body and mind. You will learn how to talk directly to your nervous system and have it respond as you breathe.\n\n\n======COURSE CONTENT======\nWhat the Resonant Frequency is\nThe Four Effects of RFB\nResonant Frequencies\nResonance and Oscillation\nBreathing Practice #1\n\nStress and the Nervous System\nThe Autonomic Nervous System\nThe Fight-Flight Response\nMind and the Stress Response\nStress and Chronic Inflammation\nThe Pear-Cone-Wave Technique\nOcean Breathing Technique\nBreathing Practice #2\n\nThe Vagus Nerve and the Relaxation Response\nThe Vagus Nerve\nVagal Tone\nThe Six Bridges Technique\nBonus Video: Vagal Nerve Release Technique\nBreathing Practice #3\n\nHeart Rate Variability and Blood Pressure\nWhat Heart Rate Variability is\nLow and High Heart Rate Variability\nRespiratory Sinus Arrhythmia\nResonant Frequency and HRV\nBreathing Practice #4\n\nExpanding Your Practice\nTracking Your Results\nEstablishing an ongoing practice\n\n\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures, and practiced when prompted, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and be able to share what you have learned with others.\nLastly, as I continue to add more helpful information to this course over time, you'll have lifetime access to it!

This guy Adrian Cox is amongst the very best. I have thought a lot about what he does that is different. He manages to take these teachings to another level. Not many teachers can give us practical experiences of the mind and how we view the world as a result of our projections and mind stuff. His creativity in creating these experiences through individual and partner exercises is profound.\"\n- Mick Barnes, Owner Yoga Factory Sydney\n\n\"Your studio is incredible. I've been practicing for about six years now and, because I travel a lot, have tried a lot of studios. I can honestly say that yours is one of the best - if not the best - I've come across. The standard of teaching is way out of this world. You really helped me to connect with my body in a way I didn't think was possible. A couple of years ago I gave up on my yoga teacher training because I just \"wasn't getting it\". Thank you for giving me hope that one day I may be able to pick it up again! Thank you so much again! Love and light, Lucy\"\n\n\"It feels like I am 20cm taller and exploring the world TOTALLY new. I feel like I've awoken to a better reality, everything seems much more colorful and beautiful. You hit that nail on the head because I feel like I woke up after a long long long sleep with a bad dream. And for me, this is something that money not can buy. I am really really grateful for that present- I can't put into words how much I have been able to put so much behind me. I can cry I am so happy at this moment! All the thank you's in the world!\" -Klaus Kreft",

Licensed massage therapists or physical therapists can learn how to become a superhero therapist by learning Summa Teq.\n\n\nThe humor and light instruction in this book should be seen as only an overview of the training that a licensed therapist can be taught with in-person or video training in Summa Teq. You can eventually learn the skills to read a person with one touch of your hand, with or without the sight of your eyes.\n\n\nThere’s a code of honor and respect for yourself and the person in your care. You will be able to build trust not by words alone but with the skill of Summa Teq. methods and your own intuition.\n\n\nBuilding a relationship of trust does take a form of communication. This communication is based on the atmosphere you create which includes your work space, your energy and personality, and how you can verbally chit chat to get to know the body on the table. If language is a barrier, use your space, methods, and energy to convey comfort. One hand on the body will tell you how much a person needs you.\n\n\nThrough unique and standard deep tissue and sports massage techniques combined with passive movements to the body, you can manipulate the tissues and the brain to relax tension on a whole new level.\n\n\nTherapists trained in Summa Teq. do not need to verbally advertise their deeper skill with the body until they have complete trust and have had success. Instead, you will let the person in your care figure that out on their own. It has to be their revelation that your skill is unique and successful. There is no place for an ego in Summa Teq.",

If you just keep doing what you’ve been doing? You could continue to go month after month without becoming pregnant because you are missing your fertile window every cycle and you don’t know when (or even if), you are ovulating.\nHOW THE FERTILITY AWARENESS METHOD CAN HELP YOU PINPOINT EXACTLY WHEN YOU ARE FERTILE AND OVULATING IN EACH CYCLE SO THAT YOU CAN BECOME PREGNANT EASILY AND QUICKLY.\nI’ve got an answer that works. Here’s the story.\nI remember when I myself was taught the fertility awareness method.\nI found it remarkable that a woman’s body could tell her very clearly when she was fertile and ovulating, no guessing required, no ovulation prediction kits necessary and all that was required was to track a couple of fertility signs each day and then time intercourse at the right time to become pregnant.\nIt was such a simple, easy, proven and effective method that I knew that every woman trying to become pregnant MUST learn this method to help them properly understand their bodies so that they could become pregnant.\nAs I started teaching it, pregnancy rates amongst my clients started to skyrocket.\nIT WORKED FOR THEM AND IT WILL WORK FOR YOU.\nHere’s what the Fertility Awareness Method did for me.\nI myself struggled with infertility for over 10 years and using the fertility awareness method helped me identify those 3 days in my cycle when I was fertile and where intercourse was most likely going to result in a pregnancy…helped me pinpoint exactly when I ovulated in a cycle…..helped me know when I didn’t ovulate in a cycle and therefore couldn’t be pregnant…… helped me identify if my luteal phase was long enough for implantation of a fertilised egg to occur……helped me to identify if I had a luteal phase defect….helped me find out if my hormones were balanced and my body was working properly to enable a pregnancy to occur.\nAnd it's not just me. Here is what the Fertility Awareness Method has done for others.\n“The Fertility Awareness Method helped me to understand my body and figure out my cycles and what they meant. I had assumed I ovulated towards the middle of my cycle because that is what ovulation prediction tests indicated, but I found out by using the Fertility Awareness Method that I ovulated early on in my cycle which was surprising. From then on it was a matter of having intercourse around my fertile timeframe and I was pregnant naturally within three months\".\nKerry Williams\n“My husband and I started to panic when we hit month 8 and we still weren’t pregnant. I had assumed that I was ovulating because I knew to look for fertile cervical fluid each cycle, I was using ovulation prediction kits and my cycles were regular. After charting for a few months and tracking my basal body temperature it became clear that I wasn’t ovulating at all, which explained why I wasn’t becoming pregnant. I was then able to get treatment for anovulatory cycles and went on to become pregnant. Without learning the Fertility Awareness Method we would have just kept going around in circles and making assumptions with no results, probably ending up having expensive IVF.”\nLisa Pavlovas\nFINALLY, IT’S YOUR TURN\nWhen you enrol to learn the Fertility Awareness Method, you’ll become pregnant more quickly and easily because:\nYou will know exactly when you are entering your fertile window in each cycle so that you can start to time intercourse to coincide with when you are most fertile.\nBe clear on exactly when you ovulated in a cycle so you can check that you correctly timed intercourse around this time.\nKnow whether your luteal phase is long enough for implantation of a fertilised egg to occur.\nKnow whether you are producing fertile cervical fluid.\nKnow with certainty whether you are ovulating or not.\nKnow if your hormones are balanced, and your cycles are ovulatory and fertile.\nIt all comes as part of this online program called ‘Get pregnant faster with the fertility awareness method'.\nAnd you are 100% safe to try this out. That’s all I’m suggesting. Just try it to see if it is helpful for you. If it is, you’ll be delighted – and I think that’s what’s about to happen. You are going learn how to understand and work with your body to become pregnant more quickly and easily. If for some reason you’re not delighted with what you learn in this program. If you don’t find it useful to know how to pinpoint those crucial 3 days in your cycle when you are fertile and ovulating so that you can time intercourse correctly and easily and quickly become pregnant, then you get all your money back.\nIT’S DECISION TIME.\nYou have a choice to make.\nDo what you have been doing (or worse, do nothing at all). You know where that will lead. Is that really where you want to go?\nTake a new action and get a new result. Finally get clarity on when you are most fertile and ovulating in a cycle so that you can time intercourse exactly around your most fertile time to become pregnant.\nWhich do you really want for yourself?\nHere’s what to do now.\nJoin my course to learn The Fertility Awareness Method and get started on the path towards a positive pregnancy test.\nARTICLE - Study show lack of fertility awareness possible cause of infertility - by Dalene Barton\nSurprising results of a recent study by Monash University in Melbourne Australia, showed that only 13 percent of women seeking fertility assistance, could accurately identify the most fertile time in their menstrual cycle. Is it possible that poor fertility knowledge could be a key factor in cases of infertility?\nIt seems rather silly, but fertility awareness is often overlooked as a contributing factor in an infertile woman’s struggle to become pregnant naturally.\nThe study, published in the International Journal of Advanced Nursing, surveyed 204 infertile women seeking Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). Of those 204 women, 68% believed they timed intercourse during their most fertile times each cycle, but really only 13% knew how to accurately identify their most fertile times – optimizing natural conception. Results clearly show that proper fertility awareness education is needed.\nAccording to Kerry Hampton, from Monash University’s Department of General Practice, “Fertility education should be a fundamental part of pre-conception care, and the primary care of couples when they first report difficulty conceiving.”\n“Accurately timed intercourse on fertile days of the menstrual cycle may reduce the time it takes a couple to get pregnant, helping some to avoid unnecessary ART treatment,” Ms Hampton said.\nI couldn’t agree with Ms Hampton more. I review many fertility charts each week and often see couples trying for a baby on the wrong day. Knowing the natural rhythm of your personal menstrual cycle, it’s intricacies and noting changes is something we all should be brought up knowing. The sad truth is, that most women don’t and never will. The more you know about how your menstrual cycle works, the more likely you are to conceive and also verify a potential fertility problem. Fertility Charting is one of the best tools a woman can have to achieve pregnancy naturally!\nLearn to Chart Your Menstrual Cycle\nThe first thing a couple should do if they are struggling to get pregnant is to learn the female partner’s most fertile time each cycle. You have a 6-day window to get pregnant, with only 2 peak days. Begin trying to conceive 3 days prior to ovulation and the day of ovulation. If your male partner has low sperm count or poor sperm health, try to have sex only the day of ovulation. Abstaining from sexual intercourse for the days prior to ovulation will help to build up his sperm count.  Charting helps you to know if and when ovulation may occur, which will help you to know when to try to conceive.\nSee you on the inside.\nThe Natural Fertility Coach\nxx",

      "description": "Learning to breathe better can be pleasurable and fun. In 14 days, I will teach you a logical sequence of powerful breathing lessons to help you go from anxious to calm; from being short of breath to experiencing twice as much breath capacity; from running out of breath as a singer or actor, to getting through that long phrase easily; from insomnia to falling and staying asleep easily; and from trouble concentrating to instantly refocusing. It’s easy to follow along with this 14 day plan. You just begin on day one, and do one 10-minute lesson a day for 14 days. Then, you can repeat the whole cycle, or you can pick and choose your favourite lessons to repeat. So, try something new; something concrete and easy to follow and remember. Based on the brilliant work of doctor Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais, an expert in anatomy, physics, and how the nervous system works, this course is a different from other breathing courses. Here, you'll learn: to use the concrete idea of your skeleton supporting your breath; to use your feet to support your breath, since we spend so many of our waking hours on our feet; to use the minimal amount of tone throughout your whole frame, to bring about simpler and more global habits of breathing; to spread the work of breathing throughout more of yourself, not just using the parts that you habitually rely on to move. And finally, you'll learn to change positions without disturbing the pleasant flow of your breath. Join me, and learn to make pleasurable, easy breathing your default in life!",

This includes visualisations as well as Art Therapy exercises.\nIn the second section we go through a series of games that can be played at work. These will remove tension but BEWARE...if you get caught you may lose your job! (But the games are fun though!)\nSo, a short course aimed at those in work and need a little light relief!\nOf course this is of especial interest now with so many people working at home, perhaps hardly leaving the house. Then of course there are those returning to work, commuting, bored and need of a few office games as they change their mindset!\nLikely outcome:\n1. Less stress at home as you engage in new activities i.e. art therapy. Who knows? You may find out things about yourself that shape your career differently!\n2. Less stress at work as you bring and develop some jollity at working in the same room as other people after all these months!

The treatment is different with traditional Chinese medicine. Rather than points in traditional Chinese medicine, there are somatotopes in YNSA. The physician uses these somatotopes on the head and body to treat patients.\nYNSA is that stimulate points on the head and body by needle. This therapy is very effective in neurologic disease, and pain control.\nYNSA has rare pain when treating, without soreness and numbness, so it is suitable for women and kids.\nThe feature of YNSA: convenience, less pain, Fast outcome, and low price.\nConvenience: We treat patients on the head, without taking off clothes. It is very convenient for women.\nWithout pain: The acupuncture needle is thin, only 0.24mm, so the pain is lesser.\nFast outcome: Pain and discomfort will relieve soon after treatment.\nLow price: Fewer needle than Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, and the cost is lower.\n\n\nThe advanced seminar includes J-K somatotope, I-somatotope, and upper extremity diagnosis.\nJ-K somatotope can alleviate the syndrome of locomotor diseases, such as chest pain,  low back pain, or headache.\nUpper extremity diagnosis can help you to find out the positive reaction of brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar points.\nAfter finished this seminar, you can relieve the discomfort below:\nStroke rehabilitation, numbness of fingers and toes, cold finger and toes, chest tightness, shoulder pain, low back pain.\nThe points in this seminar will support basic points, sensory points, and brain points.",

You'll learn about double-blinded, placebo-controlled designs and discover the potential for Capacilin to boost your clients' athletic abilities.\n\n\nCase 2: The Dangers of Heavily Polluted Farmed Salmon and its Effect on Obesity and Metabolic Disease\nSalmon is often touted as a superfood, but research has shown that large-scale industrial-farmed salmon from Norway contains harmful organic pollutants. In this case study, we'll examine the evidence of the long-term effects of polluted farmed salmon on obesity and metabolic disease in mice. You'll also learn about the experimental design when using animals, giving you a comprehensive understanding of the health risks associated with consuming polluted farmed salmon.\n\n\nCase 3: The Surprising Connection between Cardiorespiratory Fitness, muscle Strength and mortality\nHave you wondered why strength training is so important for our health and wellness?

You'll learn about confounding factors, the difference between correlation and causation, and how to evaluate data quality control. Get ready to dive into the concepts of hazard ratio, relative risk, and absolute risk, and understand why strength training is so crucial for your clients' well-being.\n\n\nCase 4: Debunking the Myths: A Meta-analysis of Ketogenic Diets on Metabolic Health\nWith so many diets trending, it's challenging to know which one is right for your clients.

      "description": "Master Breathwork and Breathing Techniques Certification\nThis comprehensive course on Breathwork and Breathing Techniques is meticulously designed to immerse students in the profound world of controlled breathing. The course begins with a thorough exploration of the fundamentals, providing a solid foundation in the science and historical context of breathwork. Participants will delve into the physiological and psychological impacts of various breathing techniques, understanding how breath influences the autonomic nervous system, stress response, and overall mental clarity.\nOne of the key focuses of the course is stress management and relaxation. Students will learn and practice a range of breathing techniques specifically aimed at reducing stress and promoting a state of calm. These exercises are invaluable tools for managing daily stressors, preventing panic attacks, and fostering a sense of inner peace. The course also addresses sleep improvement, offering breathing routines designed to enhance sleep quality and combat insomnia, enabling participants to wake up refreshed and revitalized.\nBreathing Techniques are simple yet powerful practices that help you manage your breathing in a controlled way. They have been used for centuries across different cultures to improve both physical and mental well-being. By focusing on how you inhale and exhale, you can influence your body's natural functions, such as your heart rate, stress levels, and even mood. These techniques offer a practical way to calm your mind, energize your body, or find balance in your emotions.\nThe history of Breathing Techniques goes back thousands of years, especially in ancient practices like yoga and meditation. In yoga, for example, \"pranayama\" is the practice of controlling your breath to influence your mind and body. In traditional Chinese medicine, deep breathing exercises, known as \"qigong,\" were developed to promote the flow of energy, or \"qi,\" through the body. These ancient cultures understood the importance of breathing for health long before modern science began to study it.\nThere are many types of Breathing Techniques used today, each with its own benefits. For instance, diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing, encourages the use of the diaphragm for deeper breaths, which can help reduce stress. Box breathing, a method often used by athletes and military personnel, involves inhaling, holding, exhaling, and holding the breath again, all for equal counts. This method can improve focus and calm the mind during stressful situations.\nOne of the main benefits of Breathing Techniques is stress reduction. When you are stressed, your breathing tends to become shallow and rapid. Practicing controlled breathing can help slow your heart rate and relax your muscles, making it easier to manage stress. These techniques activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the \"rest and digest\" response, helping the body to relax and recover.\nIn addition to reducing stress, Breathing Techniques can also improve sleep quality. Deep breathing exercises before bed can help calm the nervous system, making it easier to fall asleep and enjoy restful sleep. Some techniques, like the 4-7-8 breathing method, have been shown to help people fall asleep faster by promoting relaxation and slowing the heart rate.\nAnother major benefit of Breathing Techniques is improved concentration and mental clarity. By focusing on your breath, you can clear your mind of distractions and sharpen your focus. This is particularly helpful during meditation or when trying to work on tasks that require mental effort. Controlled breathing can also boost cognitive function by increasing oxygen flow to the brain.\nBreathing Techniques are also useful for managing emotions. When you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed, controlled breathing can help bring you back to a calm state. Techniques like alternate nostril breathing can create balance in your emotional state, helping you feel more grounded and centered.\nFor physical health, Breathing Techniques can improve lung capacity and endurance, making them valuable for athletes and those looking to improve their fitness levels. By practicing deep breathing, you can increase the oxygen supply to your muscles, which in turn improves performance and helps with recovery after exercise. It can also support cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure and improving circulation.\nAnother interesting use of Breathing Techniques is in pain management. Certain breathing methods can help people manage pain more effectively by shifting the focus away from the pain and promoting relaxation. This is why controlled breathing is often recommended for people with chronic pain or for women during childbirth.\nMany modern studies have confirmed the effectiveness of Breathing Techniques in managing various conditions. Researchers have found that regular practice of these techniques can help reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. This has led to the integration of breathing exercises into therapy programs and wellness practices around the world.\nBreathing Techniques are accessible to everyone. Unlike other forms of exercise or wellness practices, breathing exercises don’t require any special equipment or setting. You can practice them anywhere, whether at home, in the office, or while traveling. This makes them a convenient and affordable tool for managing your health and well-being.\nWhat you’ll learn\nUnderstand the core principles of breathwork\nLearn how different breathing techniques affect the body and mind\nDiscover methods to enhance relaxation through controlled breathing\nPractice deep breathing to improve oxygenation and circulation\nExplore various breath patterns to manage stress effectively\nUse breathing exercises to improve sleep quality\nEnhance mental clarity and focus with specific techniques\nIntegrate breathwork into daily routines for overall well-being\nExperience the emotional benefits of mindful breathing\nBoost physical performance by optimizing breath control\nImprove lung capacity and respiratory health\nUtilize breathwork for meditation and mindfulness practices\nStrengthen the immune system with proper breathing techniques\nAlleviate anxiety through targeted breathing exercises\nBalance energy levels throughout the day with breathwork\nUse specific techniques for pain relief and management\nUnderstand the scientific research supporting the benefits of breathwork\nLearn to facilitate breathwork sessions for others\nDevelop a personalized breathwork practice tailored to individual needs\nExplore the historical and cultural significance of various breathing techniques\nBreathing Techniques offer numerous benefits, from reducing stress and improving sleep to boosting focus and supporting physical health. These simple yet powerful exercises have been used for thousands of years and continue to help people manage both their mental and physical well-being. Whether you’re new to breathwork or a seasoned practitioner, incorporating Breathing Techniques into your daily routine can lead to a healthier and more balanced life.\nAnother critical aspect of the course is enhancing focus and concentration. Students will discover how breathwork can significantly improve cognitive function and mental clarity, making it a powerful tool for students, professionals, and anyone needing heightened concentration. Practical sessions will guide participants in integrating these techniques into their daily routines, boosting productivity and mental performance.\nAthletic performance and respiratory health are also prominent themes in this course. Participants will explore how controlled breathing can optimize oxygen utilization, improve endurance, and enhance physical performance. The course offers specialized techniques beneficial for individuals with respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD, aiming to improve lung function and overall respiratory efficiency.\nEmotional well-being is another vital component of the curriculum. Through guided exercises, students will experience the emotional release and healing potential of breathwork. Techniques for balancing emotions, increasing resilience, and releasing stored trauma will be taught, providing participants with tools for emotional stability and personal growth. The course also explores the role of breathwork in meditation and mindfulness, offering methods to deepen meditation practices and cultivate inner peace.\nBreathwork and controlled breathing techniques have played a vital role in health and well-being across cultures for centuries, from ancient yogic practices in India to meditation techniques in Taoist and Zen traditions. In history, these practices were used to center the mind, elevate consciousness, and build resilience, with breath often seen as a life force that connects body and spirit. Ancient civilizations understood the importance of breath for physical and spiritual balance, using controlled breathing to cultivate mental clarity, reduce stress, and promote inner peace.\nIn modern times, the benefits of breathwork are being explored and validated by science, with growing evidence on how specific breathing patterns can positively affect the nervous system, improve cardiovascular health, and even influence emotional regulation. Controlled breathing activates the body’s parasympathetic nervous system, which helps reduce cortisol levels, lower blood pressure, and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Research also shows that breathing exercises can improve lung capacity, increase oxygen delivery, and enhance mental focus by directly affecting the brain's oxygenation.\nToday, breathing techniques are widely used by a diverse range of people, from athletes seeking physical performance boosts to corporate professionals looking to manage stress. Breathwork is also becoming a staple in therapeutic settings, helping patients manage conditions like anxiety, PTSD, and even chronic pain. By integrating breathwork into daily life, individuals can access a simple yet powerful tool for enhancing energy, improving sleep, and developing resilience in the face of life’s challenges. The appeal of breathwork lies not only in its profound health benefits but in its accessibility; it requires no equipment and can be practiced anywhere, making it one of the most adaptable and empowering wellness practices available.\nFinally, the course emphasizes the development of a personalized breathwork practice. Students will receive guidance on creating a breathwork regimen tailored to their individual needs and goals. The program also prepares participants to share and teach breathwork techniques within their communities, fostering a culture of well-being and mutual support. By the end of the course, students will be well-equipped with practical skills and a deep understanding of how to use breathwork and breathing techniques to enhance their physical health, mental clarity, and emotional balance.",

These are designed to optimise your child's brain development while being fun and exciting for the child who is encouraged to discover and understand the world around them with greater joy and confidence.\nI wrote this Course during the Lockdown of 2020, primarily in the hope of helping mothers at home with young children, but the material in this course is suitable for use in Early Childhood Education settings eg. Montessori classrooms, Playgroups, as well as in Primary or Elementary Schools. It is also suitable for use in Child Therapy sessions and may be found particularly beneficial for children with Special Needs eg. varying degrees of autism, ADHD and other cognitive and emotional spectrum disorders.\nI have based this course on my extensive years of experience as a Montessori Teacher and Sound Therapy Tutor. I hope you will enjoy this Course with the children you love.\nPlease note that completing this course will not certify you as being qualified to work with children. You will need to comply with whatever rules and regulations apply in relation to Child Protection, Education and Welfare in your jurisdiction. Further training in Sound Therapy to Practitioner level will be required in order to use the course content professionally.\n\n\nBonus Materials:\nThis course includes two high quality MP3 studio recordings:\n• Journey Through the Rainbow, an enjoyable guided meditation through the colours of the rainbow. 16.05 mins\n• Healing Sounds, An immersion in the healing sounds of Himalayan Singing Bowls, Solfeggio Frequencies and Koshi Chimes.

The power of our hands never can be compare to any machine or injection therapies. That's why for ages  people are keep doing massages.\nDo you know that in 17 century massage therapist was called rubbers?\nRubbers were experts in treating orthopedic problems with manual rubbing and friction.\nMedical rubbers were typically women hired by surgeons to assist with the rehabilitation of patients after surgery. They had very little knowledges, but the modified it by hands on therapy.\nThis was one of the few occupations by which women could make a living outside of the home in those times.\nIn 1850 massage therapy goes to the new level. Thanks to Pehr Henrich Ling of Sweden, who develop Swedish massage. His two-year education program, became an example for many training institutes, which opened later on.\nThe titles masseuse and masseur became common in the 1880s, referring to manual therapists trained in the soft tissue manipulations developed by a European medical doctor named Johann Mezger. Mezger outlined the classic categories of massage techniques: effleurage, petrissage, friction and tapotement. Vibration was added later. Medical gymnasts soon integrated massage into their overall approach, a combination sometimes referred to as mechanotherapy.\nMassage became linked with magnetism and magnetic healing in the latter 1800s. Magnetism was thought to be a divine healing force transmitted to an ailing patient through touch and motion.\nThe field of massage therapy went through a period of transformation between 1970 and 2000. The counterculture movement of the 1960s spawned a generation looking for greater meaning in their lives, and revived an interest in natural healing.\nNowadays, demand for the  therapist, who can maintain they youth and beauty naturally.\nAre you willing to learn?\nMeans, you are in correct place.\nThe course of upper body correction its a part of face spindle therapy procedure, which are best selling treatment on the market today.\nBy starting today to learn those techniques of natural anti-aging, you will earn more and be competitive on the market and most wanted therapist.\nFace spindle therapy is very deep lifting techniques, but in the same time its very relaxing and stress relieving method, which makes your client really enjoy the process comparing to the pain and side effect during the injections or surgical procedure.\nCourse contains protocols for back, neck, head, and décolleté.\nAlso, I add for you a presentation, where I explaining why we should start any of anti-aging face massage from the back, and which role not only in our beauty and youth, but in our life as well  plays our neck and posture.\nI use a simple language, everyone can learn and understand.\nDon't waste your time, and become a therapist with unique technique.",

      "description": "Treatment One: Deep & Hands-Free Thai Massage / How to Give Very Deep Therapeutic Massages without Straining, Exhausting or Injuring Yourself, Helping to Ensure a Long-Term Massage Career - Instead of Rapid Burnout\n\n90+ mins of HD video tutorials enabling you to give a treatment up to 3 hours without getting tired or fatigued\n\nThese Techniques Solve a Major Problem in the Massage Industry...\n\nThere is an enormous problem with almost all traditional massage therapies: they are designed with an in-built imbalance, as the methods were developed purely for the welfare of the massage receiver - while the body of massage giver is entirely forgotten about! The result? The majority of massage therapists find the techniques break their own bodies; strain, exhaustion and repetitive strain injuries are very common.\n\nThe majority of massage therapists burnout and quit within two years. We consider these techniques potentially career-saving for many therapists who quit doing what they love, not realising that they simply need better techniques.\n\nInnovative modern developments of ancient Thai techniques that both embrace principles of modern physiotherapy science to relieve more muscle tension, while simultaneously reducing use of the therapist's muscles and joints, helping to reduce strain, fatigue and exhaustion.\n\nThis massage focuses on training you to develop your sensitivity, showing you how to target problem areas more precisely, to provide a more beneficial therapeutic effect.\n\nThese techniques can also enable you to give much longer treatments, if you choose to do.\n\nA full course companion eBook is also included to assist learning this massage.\n\nTreatment Two: Traditional Thai Yoga Massage - A Satisfying and Easy Massage For All Skill Levels\n\nAn 85-minute tutorial narrated in real time...\nLearning powerful techniques can be quick and easy. Thai yoga massage combines rhythmic acupressure and limb rotations with  stretches which are similar to those found in hatha yoga. It is  sometimes explained as resembling 'having yoga done for you' or a form  of 'lazy man's yoga'. These are not inaccurate descriptions.\nThai yoga massage is an ancient and spiritual practice that embraces  ideas of energy flow, the correction of imbalances and a holistic view  of health. The two main traditions are broadly categorized as the  southern and northern style. This course teaches the northern style  which is gentler and more universally enjoyable.\n\nTraditional Thai massage is one of the most active and effective kinds of massage, a  novel experience that will stretch and apply pressure in ways most  people have never experienced before, relieving tension they never even  realized they were experiencing. It is one of the most rewarding forms  of massage to receive due to the intensity of the relaxing and blissful  feelings that can be released. Furthermore, it is also very rewarding to  give because it can be absorbing and tranquil; a vicariously  pleasurable and therapeutic experience - the closest thing to receiving a Thai massage is giving someone else one.\n\nTreatment Three: Rhythmic / Dynamic Thai Massage - An Introduction to this Style of Massage\n\nA 42-minute narrated tutorial...\n\nThis 42-minute tutorial teaches a selection of rhythmic and relaxing techniques. These methods of Thai massage are gentle and fluid; the effects can be mesmerizing. The goal is to relax, rather than to stretch or apply deep pressure.\n\nMastering these techniques will take some practice. Since the difference between effective and ineffective technique can be subtle, these movements will require some trial and error, while obtaining honest feedback from your receiver.\n\nIf you are a beginner with Thai massage, these techniques are quite advanced.\n\nHowever, if are already experienced in dynamic Thai massage, this routine may not be sufficiently advanced for you, and a different course may be more suitable for you if you are hoping to take your dynamic Thai to a more advanced level.\n\nBlending Your Skills and Personalizing Your Treatments\n\nOnce you have a hold of the basics, it is easy to start modifying the  structure of a routine, re-shuffling it, extending or abbreviating it,  or adding new techniques. It is easy to get a lot of practice with Thai  massage because it is conveniently performed on a hard mat or on the  floor. No oil is required and, additionally, there is no need to disrobe. Therefore, it is a perfect massage to perform in places that  lack privacy, and it is also an ideal treatment for anyone who is shy.  Do not be surprised if you are bombarded with requests!\n\nGain Up to Three CTAA-accredited Certificates From This Course\n\nStudents who pass an online theory exam will be eligible to apply for three fully-accredited certificate in:\n\nThai Yoga Massage\nRhythmic Thai Massage\nThai Deep-Tissue Massage\n\nThese online theory exams can be retaken as many times as necessary, and should not be undertaken until you've completed five practice treatments for each massage.\n\nCTAA certificates are insurable in some countries. However, certain countries do not legally recognize any sort of online certification, and you must check the laws regarding massage, and the policies of insurance companies, in your home country, before any professional practice. This is beyond our ability to accurately and confidently advise our students - who are spread across 135 countries - so please do your own research if certification is important to you. And always remember, it's your skills, your health and your knowledge that will define your massage career - not the pieces of paper on your wall.\n\nPlease Note: The Rhytmic and Traditional Treatments provided on this course are also provided on our 'Massage Professional' course.",

      "description": "Thai massage, which originated in India, has been around for over 2,500 years. Originally regarded as a healing art, traditional Thai massage includes influences from both Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine.Unlike typical Western-type massages, it doesn't involve lying on a massage bed while a massage therapist applies oil to your body and kneads your muscles and pressure points. Instead, you lie fully clothes on a mat on the ground while a practitioner uses stretching, pulling, and rocking techniques to relieve tension, promote relaxation, and improve flexibility and circulation. Sometimes referred to as assisted yoga, Thai massage is focused  on improving the flow of energy throughout your body.\nIf you have migraine or experience tension headaches, traditional Thai massage may help ease your symptoms. In several small studies involving patients with chronic headaches, researchers found that Thai massage reduced the intensity of both migraine and tension headache. If you're interested in trying non-pharmaceutical remedies for headache relief, it's worth nothing that researchers concluded that benefit of Thai massage could last anywhere from several days to 15 weeks.\nIn a traditional Thai massage, practitioners use their hands, thumbs, elbows, forearms, and sometimes even their feet to reduce tension in your muscles.Thai massage is based on the ideas that energy moves through the body along predictable lines or pathways known as sens. To increase the flow of energy along the sens, the practitioner will move your body into yoga-like positions in addiction to pulling and rocking your body in various ways. The combination of stretching, movement, and pressure is that distinguishes Thai massage from other types of massage. Thai massage may be good option for you if you want a more active type of massage, where you move and participate instead of lying down throughout your massage. Giving a neck massage is a great way to relieve that tension.",

Neuromuscular therapy is a highly effective treatment for chronic pain, muscular trauma resulting from an accident/injury, and strain caused by overuse.\nYou can study and complete this entire course in the comfort of your own home with lifetime access to the videos in case you need to go back, review and re-inspire yourself!\nIn this massage course you are going to learn:\n> How to treat the most common painful conditions\n> How to do assessments and special tests\n> How to treat frozen shoulder, tension headaches, nerve impingements and so much more!\nThe Centers for Disease Control report estimated that 20 percent of U.S. adults, approximately 50 million people, have chronic pain, and it is the most common reason adults seek medical care.\nRoughly 20 million people within this demographic have high-impact chronic pain, which impacts their lifestyle by limiting the activities and work they can do. Massage therapy is recommended for pain management by numerous research studies.\nBesides just offering people a solution to their health concerns, neuromuscular therapy offers an opportunity for massage therapists to work closely with other medical professionals, through referrals and networking.

What's even worse is there is a serious lack of knowledge and inconsistent advice, even by professionals, given to  parents.\nYou will find this course to hold answers for you as to WHY your baby is upset and how to help them. What's more it will actually make sense to you! It often contradicts advice you have had from friends, family and even other baby health professionals. I honestly am not sure where some of the advice you get comes from! Like \"there is no cure for colic\", \"all babies cry\", \"just wait until they grow out of it\". You do not have to wait and yes there are ways to help your baby be better now and even healthier into the future because of how you help them now.\nI have dedicate my working life to understanding why babies can be so upset with colic, reflux, why they don't sleep, cry excessively, scream and generally helping parents understand what is wrong with their baby. Parents can feel so helpless when they cannot calm their baby and importantly do not understand what is wrong with them. It's very worrying and made worse by lack of sleep. You have been so focused up until this point of being pregnant and delivering your baby that it hadn't crossed your mind what happens when you actually have a baby that is difficult to settle. This is the course you wished you had done BEFORE you had your baby.\nI can tell you through my 20 plus years of helping babies that there are reasons your baby is upset! And they can be helped. It's all in my course. All my videos are short and easily watched. You can skip around to the sections that are most relevant to you. The help I offer will even set your baby up for improved future health. I have based this on scientific research and I will translate that research into usable and helpful information in my course for you too.\nI have a section on scientific research and I find research that will be of use to you to improve yours health and your baby's now and into the future. I read the research and translate the results and explain to you how you can implement it and why. I also tell you stories of babies I have helped in the past, picking out some of the most unusual stories and extreme baby issues.\nI'm am so pleased with this mother and baby help course, it brings together all my knowledge and all my ebooks I have written. The 7 ebooks are all available for download in this course too. It is the total package for the health of you and your baby.\nCheck out the free preview videos and if you have any questions at all then email me on christian@theperrymount.com. Tell me a bit about your baby's problems and I will make sure that this course will be fantastic value and learning for you.",

This foundational part sets the stage for the rest of the course by establishing why health literacy matters across all levels of the healthcare system.\nThe second section explores health literacy from the healthcare provider's perspective, consisting of eight detailed chapters that focus on communication techniques, patient engagement strategies, and the importance of using plain language and empathetic listening to support patient understanding. It provides actionable tools that providers can implement to ensure they are meeting their patients’ informational needs.\nThe third section shifts the focus to the patient’s perspective, highlighting the importance of preparation before healthcare encounters. It empowers patients by offering guidance on how to ask the right questions, retain critical health information, and actively participate in their own care.\nThe fourth and final section examines health literacy through the lens of healthcare organizations. This part includes eleven chapters that lay out specific, action-oriented steps organizations can take to become truly health literate. These chapters cover essential topics such as staff training, material review, and system-wide communication practices that support equitable access to health information.

You’ll be guided through a blend of breathwork, gentle rehabilitative movement, yoga, posture awareness, and guided meditation to support true, holistic healing—physically, emotionally, and energetically.\nWe dive deep into the mind-body connection, especially in the lower belly and pelvic region—areas that often hold tension, trauma, or disconnection after surgery. You'll learn how to retrain your breath using the diaphragm, activate your deep core muscles safely, and move in ways that support your healing every single day.\nThis course pulls from my background in prenatal/postpartum yoga, athletic postpartum training, somatic movement, and my graduate studies in Traditional Chinese Medicine, bringing you a truly integrative path toward healing—no matter your goals. Whether you’re focused on pain-free daily movement or hoping to return to your favorite workouts, this course gives you the tools to build a strong foundation.\nI love hearing from students about what’s been most helpful in their healing journey and how this course can continue to evolve to meet your needs and those of future mamas.

This is a perfect stepping stone for beginners to master some basic techniques before moving on to a professional-style Swedish or Hawaiian massage.\n\nSwedish Full-Body Massage (55-minute narrated tutorial)\nThis massage style is known in Sweden and throughout most of the world as ‘classic massage’; only the Dutch and English-speaking countries refer to it as ‘Swedish’. True to its classical name, it is generally the most well-known massage in the Western world. The treatment helps to promote the many general benefits of massage. For example, circulation is enhanced while muscular tension is reduced and muscular knots and tightness are removed.\nThis full-body massage is soft and relaxing and employs a little deep tissue work. It is an ideal lesson through which to master the basics of massaging with oil. Once comfortable with these basics, the techniques of many other massages can be attempted with confidence.\nEffleurage, petrissage, friction and percussive strokes are demonstrated.\n\nHawaiian Lomilomi Massage (67-minute narrated tutorial)\n\nFor many centuries, the healing knowledge of lomilomi has been kept secret by shamans known as ‘kahunas’. However, in recent years, these shamans have decided to break their silence and openly share their wisdom, and Hawaiian massage has rapidly become popular worldwide.\nThe motions of this Hawaiian lomilomi massage take inspiration from the four elements: water, fire, air and earth. Lomilomi is famous for graceful whole-body strokes that seek to reflect the waves of the ocean washing over the receiver. To receive one is extremely relaxing, pleasurable and therapeutic, and it can simultaneously be a mesmerising and meditative experience to give one.\n\nStone Massage (45-minute narrated tutorial )\nHot stone massage is not a stand-alone collection of techniques but rather an addition to other styles of treatment. This addition helps make the experience more satisfying for the receiver because the heat is soothing and thoroughly warms up the muscles, allowing more effective deep work.\n\nStones can be incorporated into any oil-based massage. This lesson focuses on the principles of good practice rather than attempting to teach specific movements. This will enable you to perform, for example, Hawaiian massage with hot stones, Swedish massage with hot stones, Thai-Swedish fusion massage with hot stones, or whatever combination you like.\n\nPotential to Gain Up to Three CTAA Certificates\n\nCTAA certificates in Swedish Full-Body Massage, Hawaiian Lomilomi Massage, and Hot Stone Massage may be achieved through this course.\n\nThese certificates are accredited by the CTAA and can be insured in the UK, EU and other countries, but please check relevant law for massage therapy in your country, as this varies from place to place.\n\nTo gain these certificates, you will need to complete some practice treatments, and then pass quite an easy online theory exam. You must pass this exam, but you can repeat it as many times as you like, and ask us for help if you need it.\n\nPlease note, certificates will not be issued during the 30-day refund period.\n\nPlease do contact us if you have any questions before or after enrolment. Bradley and Pete, i.e. the course creators, are always here to help.",

      "description": "Welcome to my course Feldenkrais for neck pain :)\nThe Feldenkrais Method, named after its founder Dr. Moshé Feldenkrais, is a unique approach to somatic learning.\nFeldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons (ATMs) teach you how to move more efficiently and improve your self-awareness.\n\nThis course focuses on the main movements of our neck:\n\n- Turning\n- Tilting\n- Nodding\n\nThe movements will be explored in different positions (lying on the back or side and in sitting). You will learn how to do these neck movements in a healthy functional way. This will make your neck more flexible and reduce pain.\nThe movements are gentle and can be done by almost anybody, no matter how old or physically fit you are.\n\n\nHow is a Feldenkrais lesson done:\nAt the beginning you start with a \"body scan\", which is a short awareness exercise to sense your current state. Then you try a reference movement to feel how difficult or easy it is. The main part is the actual movement lessons. You will do a sequence of small and slow movement exercises, that help you to reorganize your movement patterns. At the end of the lesson you will come back to the body scan to see if your sensations have changed and you will repeat the reference movement to sense if it has become easier.\n\n\nSee you inside :)\n\n\n(DISCLAIMER: The movement exercises in this course must be done slowly and gently and are performed at your own risk. I will not take any responsibility if an injury occurs. If you are not sure, whether you can take this course or not, please consult your doctor or physical therapist.)",

Many people undergo Indian head massages during periods of stress and worry.\nRelieves headaches and migraines\nTension in the mid-back, neck and head can cause headaches and migraines.

How is this supposed to work if babies can’t understand instructions? Does this help babies in their swimming education or it is just a fun time in the water?\nThese are some of the questions that people always ask us.\nWell first of all water is a wonderful environment for babies as they were created in very similar conditions. Babies also have limited movements on land due to a weak and developing muscular system, however they can move freely in the water, which will speed their growing process. It is also very important to understand that play is the best way for babies to learn; they love wondering around and discovering their surroundings with tasting, touching and playing. It is true that they don't understand most of the verbal instructions however they respond to conditioning and in these classes, we educate parents about how to make this happen. After many years of experience we can now agree that children who start their swimming education with babies and toddlers swimming background perform much better than those who are new to swimming. Swimmers with this background tend to have magnificent water familiarisation, buoyancy and mobility skills this means they enjoy swimming lessons much more than others with no background.",

We go over their circulation pathways, key concepts associated with them, their attributes, symptoms of disharmony, and sequences on how to harmonize them.\nStudents are expected to have taken In Movement With Jin Shin Jyutsu first, or at least to have equivalent knowledge. I have included a brief review of the Safety Energy Locks and the Depths. The class is organized into ten chapters. Each chapter includes two to three videos and a quiz to practice the presented material. I have also included videos on the Five Elemental Energy cycle (the TCM Five Element Theory) and how the various aspects of the twelve-fold Function Energy interplay and affect each other. On several occasions, I have given examples of how the Five Element Theory can help us go beyond the immediate symptoms and help us pinpoint the culprit for disharmony more effectively.\nOne important aspect of this class is that it gives a comparative study of the various Function Energy aspects. For example, we go over what distinguishes Kidney, Umbilicus, and Small Intestine FE in their help of ear discomforts. Cookbook recipes for flows that help this or that symptom have not been very helpful in my experience.\nThe final exam in the last chapter is for students who wish to test their overall knowledge and receive a certificate of completion.",

This course will offer parents of children with cerebral palsy the chance to understand the basic brain-related mechanisms underlying motor performance and motor improvement and, therefore, understand what type of activities could be beneficial (or even harmful) for their home-programs. All evidence-based knowledge will be translated into simple, non-experts language. Practical tips  will be presented and analyzed so that knowledge attained will be easily transferred into everyday home practice. After this course, parents will have a whole different opinion on what they do and on how to change it, for promoting motor benefits for their children.\nThe basic fields of knowledge that will be presented in this course (Neural Plasticity, Motor Learning Theory and Dynamic Systems Theory) will be analyzed in a way that will respect both their scientific value and the level of specified knowledge of the students (which most parents probably lack, since they are not experts). Also, these fields of knowledge simply cannot be presented to their full extend in this course, that’s why I will try to pick the most relevant and important aspects of them.",

      "description": "Baby massage (learn with the Udemy online course) / English Language\n\nBabies are little connoisseurs: they fully enjoy the intensive touch of a gentle massage. This is one of the most important ways for them to make contact with their environment. After all, speech, gestures and facial expressions are not yet sufficiently developed to enable communication. It is different with touch, because they are familiar with it. They were already able to feel and experience them in the womb, and touch also plays an important role after birth. It gives the little ones a sense of security, protection and closeness. Massages are therefore an ideal way to do something good for babies and increase their well-being.\n\nBut how does baby massage (traditional Indian) really work? Which preparations and movements are important in detail and in what order? How do I treat the baby so that it can enjoy the baby massage optimally and effectively?\n\nYou can learn and get answers to all these questions and points by completing our distance learning course in baby massage (WIP Academy). Each main chapter is divided into several lessons, which in turn consist of clear videos or short scripts - so learning is fun, and you can practice and try out the baby massage techniques directly at home. Small review questions at the end of each chapter help you to check what you have learned. At the end of the online distance learning course, you will receive a certificate from UDEMY, which can be downloaded directly online:\n\nYour advantages:\n\n- Everything 100% online\n- Free time management\n- Really no stress\n- No previous knowledge - no exams\n\n= Let's go, start today!\n\nBest regards Your Uli Pötter\n(Director of the WIP Academy)\nWellnessInPerfektion WIP GmbH\nWe are a certified education institute",

      "description": "An old proverb states that \"breath is life and the way you breathe is the way you live\". 20 years ago I discovered the healing qualities of proper breathing and I have been living it ever since. Teaching others how to use their natural breath and controlled breathwork to bring about optimal mind-body health is a rewarding experience.\nIn this course you will learn dynamic and passive breathing exercises to help you activate a \"stuck\" diaphragm, strengthen and lengthen primary breathing muscles. Plus learn how to recognize abnormal breathing patterns that lead to dis-ease within the mind and body. By recognizing these abnormal patterns, you can then learn to correct them. We will work with the parasympathetic nervous system to reduce the stress response, promote relaxation and encourage healing.\nYou will learn basic anatomy and physiology of breathing to help you attain a deeper understanding of how the body utilizes proper gas exchanges. When the breath is slow and steady the lungs have optimal time to exchange fresh, healing oxygen for toxins and CO2. When the lungs are at optimal breath regulation the body is in perfect pH balance.\nBreathing techniques can increase vitality in every age population for a magnitude of reasons and uses. This course is designed for both individuals and health practitioners looking to add another element to their therapies.",

Our videos walk you through the treatments movement by movement, step by step, from start to finish.\n\nEnrich your social life with these awesome skills, as taught by the critically-acclaimed team, Ebodhi.\n\nIndian Head Massage - a 45-minute treatment\n\nKnown in India as ‘champi’, Indian head massage grew out of the Ayurvedic medical system and has been widely practiced for around a thousand years. The massage focuses on the head, neck, shoulders and upper arms. Since tension tends to accumulate in these areas, this treatment can be very effective.\n\nThe techniques are designed to infuse the receiver with feelings of comfort, relaxation and tranquillity. They can also help reduce muscle tension and eyestrain, relieve headaches and areas of soreness, and enhance flexibility, blood circulation and lymphatic drainage. By calming the nerves and relaxing the muscles, the treatment encourages deep abdominal breathing and benefits the whole body. Furthermore, improved circulation through the scalp may promote strong and healthy hair growth — effects which can potentially be compounded if special oils are applied to the hair.\nOn a spiritual level, Indian head massage may help to re-balance the energy flow through the chakras. On a practical level, it is a convenient but satisfying massage that can be given anywhere, in a short space of time if necessary, and many of the techniques can be performed without oil.\n\nThis video was filmed on a beach near Legzira in Morocco.\n\nDeep Scalp Massage - a 16-minute tutorial\n\nPerformed in a face-down position, this massage combines methods from Indian head massage, Hawaiian lomilomi, and an extremely useful technique from modern physiotherapy. This treatment focuses on sensitive palpation, identifying tension,and learning to massage intuitively and methodically. The result is the ability to give a deeper and more therapeutic scalp and neck massage.\n\nThis video was filmed in a studio - a 2021 update to our previous content.\n\nHand Massage (basic)\n\nThe hand is one of the most sensitive and repetitively strained areas of the body. Our hand massage tutorial teaches intriguing techniques that are designed to unlock the tension that accumulates during everyday life. The forearm is also cared for.\n\nThe video was filmed near a stream in the famous 'Paradise Valley' in Agadir, Morocco.\n\nFoot Massage (basic)\n\nReflexologists from all traditions agree that foot massage can relax and benefit the whole body. A variety of techniques are explained and demonstrated in this lesson, as well as how to use hot stones on the feet. Charts are provided which illustrate the target areas of reflexology and Thai reflexology, as well as the marma points of Ayurveda, and the acupuncture points of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which are the same as those used in acupressure.\n\nThis video was filmed in our High Street Kensington, London practice.\n\nDeep Indian Fusion\n\nThis course also provides a non-narrated demonstration of an Indian Head Massage that also integrates an emphasis on deep tissue techniques, which is particularly useful for many receives who store a lot of tension in their shoulders.\n\nThis video was filmed on an English beach.\n\nGain Up to Three CTAA-accredited Certificates From This Course\n\nStudents who complete the required practice treatments will be eligible to apply for a fully-accredited certificate in:\n\nIndian Head Massage\nDeep Scalp Massage\nHand & Foot Massage\n\nCTAA certificates are insurable in some countries. However, certain countries do not legally recognize any sort of online certification, and you must check the laws regarding massage, and the policies of insurance companies, in your home country, before any professional practice. This is beyond our ability to accurately and confidently advise our students - who are spread across 101 countries - so please do your own research if certification is important to you. And always remember, it's your skills, your health and your knowledge that will define your massage career - not the pieces of paper on your wall.",

      "description": "What is IASTM – and Why Should You Learn It?\nIf you’ve ever struggled to release stubborn knots, break up scar tissue, or reach those deep, hidden restrictions that hands alone can’t quite get to, you’re not alone. That’s exactly why Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilisation (IASTM) was developed.\nIASTM uses specially designed tools—most often made of smooth stainless steel—to detect and treat soft tissue dysfunction. These tools act like an extension of your hands, giving you the ability to go deeper, work smarter, and achieve faster results without straining your fingers and wrists.\nWith the right techniques, IASTM can:\nBreak up abnormal tissue densities like scar tissue and adhesions.\nRelease deep fascial restrictions that limit movement.\nStimulate the body’s natural healing response.\nReduce pain, restore mobility, and improve performance.\nHow it works:\nWhen soft tissue is injured—whether through an accident, overuse, or repetitive strain—your body produces scar tissue as a quick patch. While this helps healing, scar tissue is less flexible and can cause pain or restricted movement. IASTM “reawakens” the area by creating a controlled microtrauma, which prompts fresh blood flow and collagen production, allowing the tissue to remodel and heal more effectively.\nThis method isn’t just for scar tissue. It’s also highly effective for conditions like:\nChronic and acute back pain\nShoulder injuries and rotator cuff problems\nAchilles tendinopathy\nIT band syndrome\nPlantar fasciitis\nAnd more…\nWhy therapists love IASTM:\nIt gives your hands extra strength and precision.\nIt allows you to treat more clients without fatigue.\nIt produces results your clients can feel—often after just one session.\nWhy you’ll love learning it in this course:\nIn our Level 1 IASTM Technique Course, you’ll gain the skills to confidently use IASTM in your practice—or even start a new career offering it. You’ll learn how to hold and move the tools, how to assess restrictions, and how to apply safe, effective techniques for different body areas. Even if you’re brand new to therapy work, we’ll guide you step-by-step until you’re confident and ready to practice.\nThis is a skill that clients value, results speak for, and your hands will thank you for. Whether you’re a massage therapist, physiotherapist, chiropractor, sports therapist, fitness trainer—or simply someone passionate about helping others heal—IASTM can take your treatment results to the next level.",

      "description": "Unlock the Power of Your Body’s Hidden Healing Network\nImagine a quiet, tireless guardian working inside your body every hour of every day. It does not make a sound, it does not demand attention, but without it, your health would quickly collapse. This guardian is your lymphatic system, a complex yet often overlooked network that keeps your immune system strong, flushes out toxins, and supports your body’s natural healing processes.\nMost people have no idea how essential it is until it stops working properly. Sluggish lymph flow can lead to constant fatigue and low energy, swelling and puffiness in the face or limbs, slow recovery from illness or surgery, weakened immunity, and toxin buildup that leaves the body feeling heavy and unwell.\nThe good news is you can activate and support your lymphatic system through gentle, targeted massage techniques. That is exactly what you will learn in this course.\nWhat Makes the Lymphatic System So Vital\nThe lymphatic system is part of your body’s immune defence and detoxification network. It includes lymphatic vessels that transport lymph fluid throughout the body, lymph nodes that filter out damaged cells, bacteria, and viruses, and specialized organs such as the thymus, spleen, tonsils, and appendix that produce infection fighting white blood cells.\nLymph fluid carries nutrients, proteins, and minerals to nourish your tissues while removing harmful waste, toxins, and foreign particles. Unlike blood circulation, the lymphatic system does not have its own pump. It relies on breathing, muscle movement, and manual stimulation to keep the fluid moving.\nWhen lymph flow slows, waste products linger longer in your tissues, causing swelling, inflammation, and reduced immunity. Learning lymphatic drainage massage gives you the ability to improve this flow, support the immune system, and promote overall wellness.\nWhat You Will Learn in the Complete Lymphatic Drainage Massage Course\nIn this course, you will gain a solid foundation in both the theory and practice of lymphatic drainage massage. You will learn how the lymphatic system works and why it is key to maintaining health and preventing illness, gentle professional techniques to stimulate lymph flow in different areas of the body, full body lymphatic drainage routines for relaxation, detoxification, and rejuvenation, methods to reduce swelling and support recovery after surgery or injury, the link between lymph health and skin glow, how to create a safe and comfortable environment for clients or loved ones, and important contraindications and precautions to ensure treatments are safe for everyone.\nWhy This Course is Perfect for You\nThis course is designed for beginners wanting to learn a valuable new skill in holistic wellness, massage therapists and spa professionals looking to expand their services, beauty therapists wishing to add in demand treatments to their menu, and health conscious individuals wanting to care for themselves and their loved ones.\nBenefits of Learning Lymphatic Drainage Massage\nBy the time you complete this training, you will be able to help boost immune system performance naturally, reduce swelling, puffiness, and water retention, speed up healing after cosmetic or medical procedures, improve skin health, tone, and elasticity, support detoxification, increase energy levels, and promote deep relaxation and stress relief. These techniques are gentle, safe, and effective for people of all ages.\nA Skill That Gives Back Again and Again\nLymphatic drainage massage is an investment in long term health. For professionals, it is a highly sought after service that brings clients back regularly. For individuals, it is a lifelong skill that can be used to care for yourself, your family, and your community.\nYou will learn in a way that is clear and easy to follow, even for complete beginners, with practical hands on guidance you can apply immediately. This course is rooted in professional standards to prepare you for real world use.\nYour body already has an incredible built-in healing system. Now is the time to learn how to activate it, support it, and make it work at its best.\nEnrol today in the Complete Lymphatic Drainage Massage Course and take the first step towards helping yourself and others achieve better health, faster healing, and lasting wellness.",

      "description": "Cranio-Cervical Stability Testing for Manual Clinicians: The Definitive Guide                                           Updated  November 2024\nAs a manual clinician, have you ever worried that a patient may have specific damage to the cervical spine including the craniovertebral joints? A car accident, a fall, or maybe an infection is at fault? How do you deal with this patient?\nI have reasons for spending hours of my time, developing and producing this course. It all relates to a serious car accident I had a few years ago. I initially didn't present with any issues but steadily I physically declined and eventually had fusion surgery to restrain an unstable C7 T1 which was producing spinal cord signs. I knew what was happening to me but will a patient understand the symptoms? It is imperative if you treat patients with trauma, infection, or congenital issues, to learn what to do with these patients.\nLearn the signs and symptoms of serious pathology in the cervical spine.\nLearn the differential diagnoses and causes of instability in the region.\nLearn to test the neurological system and know what to look for in your examination.\nLearn to stress test the ligaments of the craniovertebral joints and the cervical spine.\nDiscover the latest studies on this topic.\nI'm hoping you will find this course an adjunct to your practice. As a manual clinician, a Physiotherapist, a Chiropractor, a manipulator, you may stress ligaments of peripheral joints all the time but it is a rarity to stress test spinal joints. A manual clinician must be able to discern an unstable or hypermobile segment in a spine. This will give the clinician an advantage in the management of the patient. It is important for the safety of the joint and is very important for the safety of your patients.\n\n\nMy objectives for you:\nAfter this course, participants will be able to understand the principals and practical application of the following:\n1. Describe five diseases that may compromise the stability of the cervical region and how.\n2. Demonstrate three stability tests of the cervical region and interpret the results.\n3. Apply a neurological scan to clear spinal cord and neurological dysfunction in the cervical spine.\n4. Adopt a vigorous mandatory scan for all patients to rule out serious pathology of the cervical spine and the neurological system.\n\n\nCome with me and learn.\n\n\nPlease Note:\nThis course is designed for medical professionals, not for the general public.

How about a Chi gong, Nei Gong or Tai chi practitioner looking to deepen the softeness in your technique? Or maybe you are simply looking for a soft, unique, powerful and profound approach to movement and health?\nHeavyBody if the first of the 6 'Bodies' in the MartialBody training system. This system is the distilation of the developmental training methods found in the martial arts to focus on the development of 6 key attributes found in the elite Martial Artists.\nHeavy\nStable\nConnected\nAgile\nComplex\nFluid\nHeavyBody invigorates the body with deepening levels of internal awareness and softness. You will learn how to connect to your own body weight and use it to fuel your movement, to open your joints, and create powerful 'heavy' techniques.\nThis course will guide you though the foundation training techniques to begin to develop the HeavyBody. This training will help you in the following areas.\n- Removing Tension -\nWe carry unwanted Tension around with us all the time and this limits our ability to utilize our weight. HeavyBody Training will resolve this.\n- Using our own Weight -\nWe use our own bodyweight to release tension and open the joints of the body so that they are freer. This produces deep health benefits as well as usable body mechanics for combat.\n- Healthy Joints -\nHeavyBody training helps us to release tension around the body. As a result the joints will be gently released of tension or sticking points increasing range of motion and joint health.\n- Precise, Focused, Pressure. -\nWhen your Body is constantly expressing the heavyBody attribute, you can target your weight to any point on your opponent. This can create crushing pressure.\n- Heavy Hands -\nFar from being a 'gift' some fighters have , Heavy Hands are a quality that can be trained through understanding of softness and our ability to cast our weight into our target. But the first thing to get is a 'HeavyBody'\n- Aaaannd Relax -\nUnderstanding the tension in our bedy, how it affects our movement, and how to resolve it has a big supplimentary benefit. It allows us to recognise and resolve tension so as to increase relaxation and reduce stress.\nMake no mistake about it, effective release and relaxation are hard things to do. They are the opposite side of the coin to contraction and tension and just like contraction they must be trained to become effective and fast.\nMuch of the work in this area is related to neurology and our ability to ‘switch off’ the signals that are making unwanted tension creep into the body. We can consciously do this with a variety of physical movements and targeted breathing methods that will help us to connect to the ‘relax’ mechanism much like we do with the ‘contract’ mechanism.\nSo take this opportunity to learn  the foundations of this facinating system of training, drawn from years of experience in the Martial Arts and Personal training. You will feel new levels of power, freedom and Efficiency!",

But today, it has become an efficient, scientifically recognized solution and also overcomes the failings of allopathic medicine. When faced with the bacteria and virus resistance, dehumanization of the patient in mass medical practice, natural medicine emerges as a veritable asset for creating a symphony of therapies in today’s world.\nThanks to the involvement of numerous researchers and physicians throughout the world, natural medicine has entered the age of science. It is no longer just an old wives’ cure ; today it has become a medicine whose results have been validated through studies and university protocols.\nPr. Roch Domerego is one of those scientists who has devoted his entire life to laying the basis of natural medicine. A standing guest professor at the Calixto Garcia faculty of medicine in Havana, he has conducted several clinical studies which have led to the application of such techniques. He has thus been able to set down certain protocols guaranteeing the replication of results on the various patients. As Director of the API-AR International laboratory in Brussels for 11 years, he has pursued his work on medication of natural origin with a view to strengthening its efficiency and systematizing its production process.\nToday, in numerous countries, scientific protocols applied to natural medicine make render it more efficient and reproducible.\nBut, Pr. Roch Domerego’s research has gone even further. It has highlighted the superiority of natural substances as opposed to allopathic medication for various pathologies. In many fields of interest, natural medicine hence displays its advantages.\nPr. Roch Domerego has taught in several universities or has presented lectures in over 20 countries the world over. He is author and co-author of 14 books, some of which are benchmark publications.\nOur “Academy” endeavours to share the knowledge it has acquired over the years with the general public. Other instructors, all international experts, will be joining his team and offering you their expertise for optimal use of an excellent quality of Natural Medicine.",

      "description": "If you want to improve other people’s lives as an equine therapy assistant, then check out this \"How To Be an Equine Therapy Assistant\" guide.\nA person with a disability is only limited if they allow themselves to be. Where doctors’ methods fail, horses are there to help provide results. Equine therapeutic riding (commonly called horse therapy) is a fairly new form of therapy designed for people of all ages who live with any number of both physical and mental impairments.\nIn its simplest sense, riding forces the human body to mimic the movement patterns of the horse’s pelvis, which in turn adds to their own range of movement while away from the barn. The results of therapy riding visibly increase with each passing week. This guide explains the processes that take place at the therapy barn and the results that can be seen in the riders afterward, all written from the point of view of a current horse therapy volunteer.\nHere’s what you’ll learn by reading this guide:\n• Eligibility requirements for riders\n• Explanations behind the reason that equine therapy works\n• How to become a volunteer, which is a necessary component of every therapeutic riding program\n• The positions open to volunteers\n• Tips on handling the horses\n• The equipment used during lessons\n• The variety of exercises and activities utilized in each lesson\n• The role of the volunteers in the improvement of the riders\n• The visible/audible benefits of therapy riding\n• The emotional impact of therapy riding on the volunteers\nEquine therapy is a life-changing experience for everyone involved. There’s plenty more to learn in these pages before signing up to be a volunteer yourself!\n\n\nAbout the Expert\nMy name is Dana Feiwus. I am a recent graduate of the University of North Texas with a major in English, Creative Writing. I began volunteering at ManeGait Therapeutic Horsemanship in McKinney, Texas two years ago because I was always fond of horses. However, I soon learned that therapy riding is about much more than horses, and I have been there almost every weekend since I began. From weekly lessons to fundraising events to the annual horse show, there is no place I would rather spend my free time.\nThough I have worked with many riders, one rider, in particular, holds a special place in my heart. This five-year-old girl with cerebral palsy and I shared our first lesson at ManeGait together and two years later she’s now walking with no support and riding like a champ. As much as riding has improved her life, she has undoubtedly improved mine as well.",

Foot massage is beneficial to both physical and mental health. Here is a list of the most important benefits of foot massage:\nPain Relief:\nFoot massage is one of the most common alternative treatments to relieve pain. A study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of foot reflexology on fatigue, pain, and sleep has revealed that foot reflexology is a very useful nursing intervention that relieves fatigue and promotes good sleep. Foot massages coupled with regular foot exercises can cure chronic heel pain.\nAllays Back Pain:\nFoot health and posture have been proven to be associated with back pain. The edge of the foot has pain-points that are associated with back pain. While massaging these points the pain and stiffness in the spineare relieved There exists a spine line between the big toe and the heel of the foot. Massaging this line from the front to the back of the toe by applying pressure can be very effective in back pain relief. A study conducted by the Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research has revealed that the nurses who suffered from a backache greatly benefited from a foot massage.\nImproves Blood Circulation & Lowers Blood Pressure:\nSedentary lifestyle might make one unaccustomed to using feet muscles regularly andthey hardly get any kind of exercise. Foot massages stimulate nerve functions, eiminate toxins and improve circulation. A study conducted among dementia patients revealed that foot massage reduced blood pressure, improved their moods and lessened their anxiety levels.\nReduces Symptoms of Certain Ailments:\nVarious studies have reported a correlation between foot reflexology and improvement in symptoms of certain ailments such as cancer, symptomatic idiopathic detrusor over-activity, diabetes, sleep disorders, multiple sclerosis, migraine, depression, and dementia. Therapeutic massage reduces symptoms, improves symptom control and promotes general wellness. A foot massage also helps alleviate symptoms of pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) such as irritability, mood swings, headaches, anxiety, insomnia, unhappiness, and fatigue. Likewise, it can also minimize symptoms of menopause.\nPrevents Injuries of Foot & Ankle:\nMassaging feet can help recover from an injury and reduce soreness of foot muscles. When combined with strengthening exercises, it can help prevent future injuries.\nReduces Anxiety and Depression:\nA foot massage goes beyond just putting you in a relaxed state during the process. Frequent sessions of foot massage significantly reduce anxiety and depression.\nWho this course is for:\nMassage Therapists\nHair Stylists\nBarbers\nYoga Teachers\nAyurvedic Practitioners\nHerbalists\nMassage Loving Humans\nNOTE:\nAfter completing this course, you will receive a Massage certificate of completion from my side, which you can share with your family, friends, relatives, co-workers.

      "description": "Our course offers an in-depth exploration of Russian classical massage techniques, designed to equip aspiring therapists with both theoretical knowledge and practical proficiency. Beginning with a rigorous module on anatomy, participants transition to practical applications, delving into fundamental massage techniques inherent to the Russian classical school.\nThe course meticulously covers five primary massage techniques:\nStroking: The foundational technique primarily applied to the skin and subcutaneous fat, often commencing and concluding massage blocks. Emphasis is placed on gentle movements, necessitating the use of oil for optimal efficacy.\nRubbing: A deeper technique targeting subcutaneous fat and surface muscles, facilitating muscle warmth and enhanced elasticity. Intensive yet controlled movements form a core aspect of this method.\nKneading: Focused on muscle work, this technique requires adept use of fingers, the base of the palm, or knuckles to engage large skeletal muscles. The intensity is notably higher, contributing to comprehensive muscle engagement.\nPressure on Trigger Points: Also known as myofascial release, this technique involves penetrating deeply into muscles to release tension. By applying static pressure to specific zones, therapists can facilitate profound muscle release.\nVibration or Percussion: Concluding many massage blocks, vibrational actions serve to calm clients post-intense exposure. Vital for relaxing the nervous system, these actions are carefully integrated into the massage sequence.\nBeyond technique mastery, the course delves into critical considerations such as the duration and intensity of each technique. The optimal exposure time, supported by research on glycogen utilization in muscles, ranges from 30 to 60 seconds, ensuring efficacy without compromising client comfort.\nA substantial segment is dedicated to aftercare, an integral component of a therapist's responsibility. Participants learn to communicate effectively with clients, explaining potential post-massage reactions and providing detailed aftercare advice. This section covers hydration, dietary adjustments, lifestyle modifications, and strategies for a smooth recovery, enhancing the client's overall experience.\nFurthermore, the course emphasizes the importance of ongoing wellness discussions. Therapists are guided on recommending treatment programs tailored to individual needs, addressing stress, lifestyle changes, and additional professional support. Sensitivity and tact are underscored in these conversations, ensuring a holistic approach to client well-being.\nBy the course's conclusion, participants emerge as proficient Russian classical massage therapists, adept not only in technique execution but also in client communication, aftercare, and wellness recommendations. The holistic training prepares them to deliver exceptional massage experiences and contribute to clients' long-term health and relaxation.",

Sometimes this headache is caused by mental or emotional tension and stress.\n\n\nReady-made sets of point combinations are widely used by different acupuncture and acupressure traditions.\n\n\nAn important aspect of the point combinations is that they can be relied on as a very effective therapeutic tool even by practitioners with only basic training in manual therapy and without any knowledge of medical theory.\n\n\nIn addition, the use of point combinations establishes a solid foundation for the development of intuitive awareness of the energy lines and points.\n\n\nUnlike a general treatment for the entire body, a treatment routine is aimed at treating an existing disorder, and focuses on only a few select areas, lines, and points (sometimes stretches are also used).\n\n\nThe lines and points of a specific routine are the core of the treatment, while other parts of the body are ignored or treated only when time allows.\n\n\nThis treatment routine is one of 60 different Thai acupressure treatment routines for orthopedic disorders.

      "description": "Are you interested in learning chiropractic?   Then this course is for you!\nAfter completing it, you will understand the theory behind chiropractic; how to assess the spinal column to determine what bones to adjust; how to formulate a typical chiropractic treatment plan; how to adjust the neck, mid back and lower back; and tips for managing a new patient.\nThis course is designed for chiropractic students, new and experienced chiropractors and those who are considering a chiropractic career.   Manual therapy and fitness specialists like physical therapists, kinesiologists, physiatrists, massage therapists and athletic trainers who are interested in chiropractic can especially benefit from this course since they already are familiar with treating/ improving the human body with their hands.\nThis course is laid out in a procedure-progressive sequence:\nIntroduction\nThis video summarizes the entire course.  In it, I explain that while the course obviously does not intend to replace formal chiropractic education, it condenses the practice of chiropractic-- its core elements-- to provide a clear picture of the profession to those who are interested in pursuing a career in chiropractic; or incorporating chiropractic treatment into their practice or services.\nThe course touches on chiropractic theory, exam techniques, adjusting (spinal manipulation) techniques and the basics of new patient handling-- all the things a chiropractor deals with every day in practice.\nSection 1, Principles of Chiropractic\nThis video explains chiropractic theory; i.e. its unique approach to healthcare.  After completing it, you will understand the rationale behind chiropractic adjustments: why chiropractors do adjustments to the spine; what happens when you correct an abnormally aligned vertebral segment; and the resulting health benefits.\nThe video is highly visual and makes the concepts easy to grasp.  When you understand them, it will benefit your clinical skills: you will diagnose conditions better; be better able to \"connect the dots\" in all your cases; be a better adjuster; and devise and prescribe better treatment plans.\nSection 2, Spinal Evaluation\nPosture:  In this video I teach you how to develop a \"chiropractic eye\" for subtle, postural deviations.   A person's posture outwardly reveals his spine's alignment inside, so it is naturally the first thing a chiropractor should check on a patient.  After completing this lecture, you will be able to determine which areas of a person's spine are out of alignment with just a brief check of his posture.\nStatic Palpation:  Palpation is the diagnostic skill of assessing the body through touch.  With reference to chiropractic, static palpation means feeling for abnormal joint movement while the patient's spine is in a static, neutral position.  This information is correlated with the patient's symptoms and complaints, and other tests to narrow down the problem area.\nStatic palpation is used to locate body landmarks to precisely locate individual vertebra for adjusting; feel for areas of edema and heat; feel for tenderness; assess muscle tone, and other abnormalities that can be detected by touch.  It is the second procedure done in a typical chiropractic spinal exam (posture, static palpation, motion palpation).\nMotion palpation is an evaluation technique that involves palpating spinal joints while they are in motion (rotation, flexion, extension, or side bending) to assess for any movement restrictions in any plane, which would indicate vertebral misalignment and/or fixation.  It is the third procedure done in a typical chiropractic spinal exam (posture, static palpation, motion palpation).\nOrthopedic and Neurological Testing:  In this video I explain how to do several standard orthopedic & neurological tests.  Chiropractors use orthopedic and nerve testing to further narrow down the location, nature and extent of the patient's condition.\nSection 3, Treatment Fundamentals\nOnce you know how to identify a spinal problem, the next important decision is what to recommend to the patient -- how many treatments to prescribe; what modalities are appropriate; and how long before improvement is expected.\nI explain the logic behind a typical chiropractic treatment plan (prescription) so that you can explain it with confidence to a patient, and increase compliance.\nSection 4, Six Important Skills of Adjusting\nBefore you start adjusting patients, you must understand these six, important fundamentals.  Chiropractic adjusting is a unique combination of fine motor dexterity and biomechanically-advantaged force generation.  When done right, it is actually comfortable; but when done wrong, it can be uncomfortable to the patient, and even painful.\nDoing adjustments wrong may also cause injury to you, the chiropractor, as well and shorten your career.  It is a very physical occupation that is tough on your back and joints.  Learn what to do with your body; and more importantly, what not to do when you are adjusting.\nSection 5, Spinal Adjusting\nIn this section, I go to great lengths to explain the fine details of adjusting the spine so that students \"get it.\"\nOne cannot expect to learn how to adjust the spine simply by observing a chiropractic adjustment itself.  While it may look simple in casual observation, what you can't see are the force vectors the chiropractor uses-- the angles and amplitudes needed to move the vertebra, and the subtle things the chiropractor does to stabilize the spine before delivering the thrust.\nTherefore, to truly learn how to do an adjustment properly, the procedure needs to be dissected into its individual parts.  In all the videos, I point out the key steps of the technique at the precise moment they occur, freeze-framing the step and explaining how it is done, with screen annotations to make sure you understand.  Not knowing how to do just one of these things will render the adjustment ineffective!\nThe three videos are:\nHow to Adjust the Cervical Spine (Neck):  I demonstrate how to adjust an occiput fixation, a C-1 fixation, and a C4 fixation.\nHow to Adjust the Thoracic Spine: I demonstrate how to adjust a thoracic segment using three, different techniques.\nHow to Adjust the Lumbar Spine:  I demonstrate how to adjust the lower and upper lumbar segments using two, different techniques.\nSection 6, Tips for Managing a New Patient\nMost practice consultants will tell you that patient communication--what to say and what not to say; how you say it and when you say it-- are absolutely critical to the success of a chiropractic practice.\nIn this video, I will explain the proper mindset needed when communicating with a new patient.  You want your patient to feel confident in you so that she will comply with treatment, get the best results and refer her friends to your office.  The way to accomplish this is through effective communication.  Many chiropractors mess this opportunity up by saying the wrong things and scaring the patient away; never to return, never to refer.  I'll reveal the items you must address and the things you should leave out in order to get the best results-- clinically and for business.\nSection 7, Chiropractic Resources:  I have provided key resources to get you started in your practice.  I also reveal two individuals who I believe are the best in the business for helping chiropractors get their practices going.",

The heme-degrading enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has cytoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.

They spend too much energy during each treatment, which limits their earning potential, and they often feel exhausted after just a few hours of massage.\n\nPhysiotherapists agree that deep, sustained pressure to is required to relieve muscular tension; this is both what clients really want, and need; but, without, the right techniques, this can be very challenging to do effectively, and safely. Many therapists simply cannot provide enough therapeutic value to keep their clients coming back; they struggle financially if they do not work enough, and they struggle physically if they work too much.\n\nThe majority of massage therapists are sadly forced to quit within the first two years of their careers.\n\nOur Solution: Utilise these Innovative, Powerful, Very Deep and Targeted, Hands-Free Thai Techniques\n\nIn this enlightening course, we teach a wide variety of innovative, low-effort Thai techniques, designed to utilize the power of gravity, and your knees, shins, forearms and elbows, so that you can really satisfy the needs of your clients.\n\nLearn to give a deeper, more therapeutic massage, without fatiguing your own muscles, and risking your hands, wrists, shoulders and thumbs.\n\nEmpower yourself to give more massages, and much longer treatments.\n\nOffer a one-of-a-kind therapeutic experience, and spend less time marketing.\n\nStay healthy, earn more money, and avoid a career burn-out.\n\nWe start with the basics, so this course is suitable for anyone.

      "description": "We are not supposed to sit for more than thirty minutes a day & it should be on the floor, not in a chair. We are also supposed to change our position every two minutes. When we sit, our butt muscles turn off and can't stabilize the spine, which in return places our shoulders in a compromised position. Does that mean we are in trouble and will always have pain? Not at all. We only need to learn our bodies and understand that our shoulders and hips are the engines that keep us stable and pain-free.\nThe human body is the most sophisticated machine built to date. The only problem is we never received the owner's manual to operate it correctly. I personally suffered from chronic shoulder pain in both shoulders, and I had very little success with the traditional \"one size fits all\" approach. This shoulder program is a combination of my undergraduate and master's education, personal experience, and over 20 years as a physio to multiple world-class athletes all over the world.\nThe bigger the disaster your shoulder is the better. You are built to spec, and your shoulder pain is most likely 100% your fault. However, that also means you can take control and own 100% of the results. By reframing blame and pain, you create a new relationship that empowers you to become better and teaches you the tools to become and STAY pain-free. Einstein said it best \"Don't keep doing the same thing and expect different results. That is the definition of insanity.\"\nAs a bonus, I have included my lifestyle portion too. Fixing the shoulder is only one part of the solution. Let's focus on lifestyle changes/optimizations that will prime your body and decrease the wear and tear. That makes you even more UNBREAKABLE!\n\n\nThe Lifestyle Portion Includes:\n1. My Cold Shower Routine - Your New Warm Friend\n2. The Breath Better Module - Optimize your Diaphragm Breathing\n3. Take Some Time For Yourself - My Quick Personal Meditation Practice\n4. Sleep Boost - Not All Sleep is the Same\n5. Water Boost & Coffee Boost Module",

The treatment is different with traditional Chinese medicine. Rather than points in traditional Chinese medicine, there are somatotopes in YNSA. The physician uses these somatotopes on the head and body to treat patients.\nYNSA is that stimulate points on the head and body by needle. This therapy is very effective in neurologic disease, and pain control.\nYNSA has rare pain when treating, without soreness and numbness, so it is suitable for women and kids.\nThe feature of YNSA: convenience, less pain, Fast outcome, and low price.\nConvenience: We treat patients on the head, without taking off clothes. It is very convenient for women.\nWithout pain: The acupuncture needle is thin, only 0.24mm, so the pain is lesser.\nFast outcome: Pain and discomfort will relieve soon after treatment.\nLow price: Fewer needle than Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, and the cost is lower.\n\n\nThe expert seminar includes introduction, change, cancel, and updated somatotopes in 2018. We will still introduce the new diagnosis method and demonstration.\nThis seminar is the newest version of YNSA in the world.\nAfter finished this seminar, you can relieve the discomfort below:\nStroke rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease, knee pain, autonomic dysfunction, and pain control.\nThe new diagnosis in this seminar will support Hoku, upper extremity, and neck diagnosis.",

      "description": "What is Fire Cupping Therapy?\nFire cupping is an ancient and effective therapeutic technique in which glass, bamboo, or plastic cups are placed on the skin, creating suction through the use of heat. This non-invasive treatment increases blood circulation to targeted areas, helping to relieve pain, promote healing, and expel toxins from the body. Commonly used for joint and muscle pain, as well as respiratory and skin conditions, fire cupping is a powerful method to support your body’s natural healing processes.\nRooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine, fire cupping operates on the principle that cold is an evil force that stagnates energy in the body. The heat from the cupping therapy helps remove this \"cold\" and promotes the flow of Qi (vital energy), re-energizing the body and restoring balance. This rejuvenating process is believed to provide a significant boost to both physical and mental well-being.\nWhy You Should Enrol:\nLearn how fire cupping can relieve chronic pain and muscular tension.\nExplore the benefits for respiratory health and skin conditions.\nUnderstand the science behind cupping and how it works with the body’s natural healing mechanisms.\nWhat is Hijama Cupping Therapy?\nHijama, also known as wet cupping, is a specialized cupping therapy that involves a minor surgical procedure to remove harmful toxins from the body. This practice, which involves creating small incisions on the skin before applying cups to extract blood, is deeply rooted in Islamic traditions and recommended in Prophetic Medicine for improving blood circulation, detoxification, and overall health. While widely practiced by Muslims, hijama is also gaining popularity among non-Muslims seeking its therapeutic benefits.\nHijama is recognized for its holistic approach to healing, focusing not only on physical ailments but also on the energy balance of the body. By extracting stagnant blood and toxins, hijama helps promote a healthier flow of energy and vitality throughout the body.\nWhy You Should Enrol:\nDiscover the profound health benefits of wet cupping, including enhanced circulation and detoxification.\nLearn the principles behind Prophetic Medicine and its application in modern healing practices.\nExplore how hijama can improve both physical and spiritual health.\nHistory of Hijama Treatment\nThe practice of cupping therapy dates back over 5000 years, with roots in ancient civilizations such as China and Egypt. While the exact origins of Hijama are debated, it is well-documented in Islamic texts and has been a cornerstone of traditional Arabic medicine. Early forms of cupping were performed using animal horns, which were used to suck out blood and drain toxins. Over time, these were replaced with more refined tools, including bamboo cups, and later glass and plastic cups.\nCupping’s long history underscores its proven effectiveness in treating a variety of conditions. Whether used for pain relief, detoxification, or energy balancing, cupping has stood the test of time as a safe and powerful therapeutic practice.\nWhy You Should Enrol:\nLearn the historical significance of hijama in traditional and Islamic medicine.\nUnderstand how ancient practices have evolved and how they can be applied in modern health.\nConnect with a time-honored tradition of healing, gaining wisdom passed down for generations.\nBy enrolling in this course, you’ll not only master the techniques of fire cupping, dry cupping, and hijama but also gain a deeper understanding of their cultural, spiritual, and therapeutic significance. With a blend of practical skills and historical insight, this course will empower you to use these therapies for healing, well-being, and even as a professional practice.",

It includes using equipment such as telephones, fax machines or computers and interactive multimedia. Telemedicine transports medical information through telecommunication links, PC's, imaging equipment and specialized audio and video for the treatment and diagnosis of patients. It has the ability to improve health care over far and distant locations and reduce expenses.\nThis Telemedicine |Telehealth | Teleconsultation course is meant for Doctors, Health workers, Care Takers & Patients.\nFor Doctor's (RMP's) and Health workers it provides guidelines and the ways to persuie Telemedicine in their set ups.\nFor patients it gives them idea regarding Teleconsultation and the way in which it can be used by them.\nTelemedicine and teleconsultation are the application and development of the telecommunication networks. Health experts can solve problems by using the electronic and communication technologies without distance limitation. In this study, we try to develop the telemedicine and teleconsultation system between local site and consulting expert site. Two applications of this system in clinical medicine are discussed. The system at each site has a workstation including a cable modem or ADSL connection, a monitor, a web camera, speakers, a microphone for communication, and NetMeeting application software. The first application in this study is to develop a school-based intervention program by using this system for high-risk school-age children in one of the earthquake-struck areas. The preliminary result of this study is that the telemedicine and teleconsultation system is more effective than traditional consultation and supervision. Moreover, we can apply this system in training local volunteers, educators, and welfare workers. Meanwhile, we can save lots of cost and time since we don't need to travel between the local site and the expert site.\nAt the end of the Course Students will receive a course completion certificate from Udemy.",

First, circulation of blood and lymph are stimulated during a session, which supports nutrient and waste exchange in the body’s tissues and supports natural detoxification. Clients tend to breathe deeply during a session, which helps the body get more oxygen to its tissues.\nMassage lengthens chronically shortened muscles, creating more muscular balance in the body and supporting free movement.\nSpecific techniques can be used to decrease pain and other symptoms caused by repetitive activities, sports injuries, or diseases and medical conditions.\nMassage soothes the nervous system to decrease stress and relieves the symptoms of a number of stress-related conditions. An accepted part of many physical rehabilitation programs, massage has proven benefits for conditions like arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, headache, low-back pain, and neck pain.\nThere are people and loved ones going through physical and psychological issues, and massage therapy could be beneficial for them.

      "description": "Yamamoto New Scalp Acupuncture (YNSA) is invented by Japanese physician, Dr. Toshikatsu Yamamoto. It was published in 1973. The treatment is different with traditional Chinese medicine. Rather than points in traditional Chinese medicine, there are somatotopes in YNSA. The physician uses these somatotopes on the head and body to treat patients.\nYNSA is that stimulate points on the head and body by needle. This therapy is very effective in neurologic disease, and pain control.\nYNSA has rare pain when treating, without soreness and numbness, so it is suitable for women and kids.\nThe feature of YNSA: convenience, less pain, Fast outcome, and low price.\nConvenience: We treat patients on the head, without taking off clothes. It is very convenient for women.\nWithout pain: The acupuncture needle is thin, only 0.24mm, so the pain is lesser.\nFast outcome: Pain and discomfort will relieve soon after treatment.\nLow price: Fewer needle than Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, and the cost is lower.\n\n\nThe basic seminar includes basic points, sensory points, brain points, 12 cranial nerve points, and Hoku diagnosis.\nBasic points can alleviate the syndrome of musculoskeletal disease.\nSensory points can alleviate the syndrome of facial features.\nBrain points and 12 cranial nerve points can alleviate the syndrome of cranial nerves and central nervous system.\nAfter finished this seminar, you can relieve the discomfort below:\nLocomotor system: acute phase of contusion and sprain, lower back pain, neck pain, and limb pain.\nFacial feature: dry eye syndrome, tinnitus, hearing loss, rhinitis, stuffy nose, and sore throat.\nNeurologic disease: stroke rehabilitation, Parkinson’s disease, and Bell’s palsy.",

By reducing breathing volume and slowing breathing rate, these exercises have been proven to enhance relaxation, mood, anxiety, asthma, respiratory health, immunity, digestion, cognition, cardiovascular health, athletic performance, energy levels, and sleep.

The theory focuses on the eustachian tube, its function and dysfunction - we go into great detail to understand how the eustachian tube, works - how it functions in a system of other organs, its location in the cranium plus the reasons for its dysfunction. This gives the osteopath the grounding to understand the causes of Otitis Media, an important stage before moving onto the practical aspect of the course.\nThe practical section teaches the student to observe, examine and most importantly treat the infant with ear infections (Otitis Media). The course goes to great lengths to give the student a firm grounding in the theoretical and physiological understanding of ear infections so that the practical is grounded in a strong basis.\nThe technique section is unique in that it delves into multiple osteopathic approaches to the condition including classical osteopathy, cranial osteopathy and lymphatic osteopathic techniques.\nThe course does require a basic knowledge of anatomy, physiology and osteopathy but it suitable both for the new graduate and the experienced osteopath giving all who participate in this osteopathic training a firm knowledge and skill of the osteopathic approach to otitis media.",

It is one of the most ancient of skills, mastered by our human ancestors as they relied on it to hunt and procure food. Many traditional cultures still practice this art but regrettably it is slowly dying out.\nThe course is ideal for anyone involved in search and rescue teams as employing tracking skills allows search areas to be reduced and efforts to be refined when searching for lost persons. Tracking teams can supplement ground and aerial searches and are used extensively as a vital component of search and rescue efforts.\nPeople with an interest in observing nature, monitoring or photographing wildlife will benefit from the skills taught on the course as animal behaviour is discussed among other topics. Anyone seeking a more intimate understanding of the natural environment in any respect will gain much from the observation and perceptual training presented during the course.",

Finally, \"blossom\" represents the culmination of this process, where full potential is realized, akin to a plant blooming into its full beauty.\nThe workshop begins with an introduction, where you'll gain an overview of the course, and set goals and expectations. The course covers detailed information about pregnancy, including the trimesters and fetal development, and the common symptoms and changes you might experience during each trimester. You'll learn about the schedule and importance of regular prenatal visits to ensure the health of both mother and baby. Nutrition and diet are crucial, so we provide guidelines for each trimester to help you maintain a healthy diet. Exercise is also vital; we offer safe exercise routines for each trimester, including the benefits of Kegel exercises. The workshop addresses common pregnancy discomforts, such as morning sickness, heartburn, back pain, and sleep issues, providing strategies for management. Additionally, we focus on emotional and mental health, helping you cope with mood swings and manage stress and anxiety. Special situations, like high-risk pregnancies and conditions such as gestational diabetes and iron deficiency anemia, are also covered to ensure you're prepared for any eventuality.\nWishing you a happy and a healthy pregnancy in advance!",

The author is not a doctor, so nothing in this video is intended to treat, cure, diagnose or otherwise substitute for professional certified medical advice!  This is a look at history, Cherokee lore, Appalachian tales, and folk uses of plants for health and wellness.  The information is geared toward ethical use and understanding, survival, and relationship with the natural world.  This is a video version of Spencer's popular class offered through Land of the Sky Wilderness School in Western NC.   students will learn about different preparation methods and can identify using color slides and detailed photos with key features. Woods for tools, flowers, fruit, roots, bark, and fungus get a treatment in this class.\n\nSpencer explain not just which plants are which, but ways to recognize them from a distance and know where they like to grow. If you are interested in a knowledge and wisdom hidden from the American educational system by a for profit health industry, there’s a lot to cover, but this class is a great first step.\n\nFurthermore the supply chain disruptions in recent year have highlighted the need to know some basic of food and home sourced provisions. In this class we also cover proper plant materials for making cordage, snares, and trap triggers from wood - what they look like too - although the detail is of course a separate class.",

        "Even if your child has already taken swimming lessons, there’s always more to learn. Perhaps he or she learned one swimming stroke, and now it’s time to learn something new.",
        "You don’t have to be a strong swimmer to teach your child how to swim. The lessons are easy to understand, and designed to give you, as a parent, the skills you need to support your child’s learning process.",

      "description": "Yamamoto New Scalp Acupuncture (YNSA) is invented by Japanese physician, Dr. Toshikatsu Yamamoto. It was published in 1973. The treatment is different with traditional Chinese medicine. Rather than points in traditional Chinese medicine, there are somatotopes in YNSA. The physician uses these somatotopes on the head and body to treat patients.\nYNSA is that stimulate points on the head and body by needle. This therapy is very effective in neurologic disease, and pain control.\nYNSA has rare pain when treating, without soreness and numbness, so it is suitable for women and kids.\nThe feature of YNSA: convenience, less pain, Fast outcome, and low price.\nConvenience: We treat patients on the head, without taking off clothes. It is very convenient for women.\nWithout pain: The acupuncture needle is thin, only 0.24mm, so the pain is lesser.\nFast outcome: Pain and discomfort will relieve soon after treatment.\nLow price: Fewer needle than Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, and the cost is lower.\n\n\nThis course includes new somatotopes in 2020~2023 and case reports of GBS and SSHL. We will still introduce the new diagnosis method and demonstration.\nThis seminar is the newest version of YNSA in the world.\nAfter finished this seminar, you can relieve the discomfort below:\nFoot numbness, temporomandibular disorders, Parkinson's disease, Guillain–Barre´ Syndrome, sudden sensorineural hearing loss",

      "description": "History of Hijama Therapy\nHijama, an ancient Arabic practice, is a holistic therapy used for centuries to treat various ailments. While its exact origin remains debated, Hijama’s rich history spans multiple ancient cultures, including Chinese and Egyptian medical practices. It is believed that cupping therapy originated over 5,000 years ago, initially using animal horns to draw blood and toxins from the body. Over time, these horns evolved into bamboo cups and eventually transitioned to glass, refining the technique into what we know today.\nHow Hijama Works\nHijama therapy involves a specific process to promote healing. The practitioner strategically places cups on the skin, targeting acupuncture points or areas of pain. These cups create suction through air pressure or a traditional fire method. For fire cupping, a flame heats the air inside the cup, creating a vacuum when the flame is removed. The cup is then placed on the skin, typically for 5 to 15 minutes, allowing the suction to draw toxins from the body.\nCupping Therapy at a Glance\nCupping therapy uses negative pressure to increase blood circulation and stimulate healing. The process helps to draw toxins out from the skin’s surface, improving the flow of blood and promoting detoxification. Cups are typically applied to areas like the neck, shoulders, back, or any area where pain or tension is felt. The therapy has evolved, and now includes various cupping techniques, each serving different purposes.\nTypes of Cupping\nThere are several types of cupping, each offering unique benefits:\nDry Cupping: This form of cupping creates suction without drawing blood. It is often used to treat pain and tension by increasing blood circulation and relieving muscle stiffness. The practitioner uses a cotton ball soaked in alcohol, lit on fire, and placed inside the cup to remove oxygen before placing the cup on the body.\nWet Cupping: Known for its detoxifying properties, wet cupping involves creating small punctures in the skin to draw out a small amount of blood, removing toxins and impurities from the body. This method can provide relief from conditions like headaches, joint pain, and inflammation.\nMoving Cupping: In this technique, the cups are moved across the skin, providing a massage-like effect. This type of cupping is especially effective for promoting muscle relaxation and increasing lymphatic drainage.\nAir Cupping: As a modern alternative to fire cupping, air cupping uses a handheld suction device to remove air from the cups. This method is considered more comfortable for patients and eliminates the need for flames, offering a safer, gentler approach.\nWhy Should You Join This Course?\nThis course is perfect for those interested in advanced Hijama therapy, whether you’re a beginner looking to start your cupping practice or an experienced practitioner seeking to enhance your skills. Through this course, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of the different cupping techniques, body mapping, and the science behind cupping therapy. You’ll also learn how to integrate Prophetic healing methods and Ruqyah into your treatments, offering a holistic approach that combines modern and traditional healing practices.\nWhether you’re a healthcare professional, therapist, or someone passionate about alternative medicine, this course will empower you to treat a wide range of conditions and elevate your practice with advanced cupping techniques and spiritual healing principles.\nD2D Therapies is a trusted training provider, offering comprehensive courses with practical techniques and insights from industry leaders.",

      "description": "You've been diagnosed with breast cancer. Now what? Educate yourself! I've made it easy for you to make the most informed decisions for your health. All in one place I've compiled and sifted through years of research and studies to bring you the most expansive collection yet easily summarized wealth of information on breast cancer prevention and survival. In this course you will find the work of years of my own personal research and experience from multiple peer-reviewed sources including medical journals. You will learn about the types of breast cancer, risk factors, the most important recommendations for breast cancer survival, and critical lifestyle changes associated with prevention and diagnosis. Do not leave the treatment option up to your doctor. You may be overwhelmed, but ultimately it's you who decides. Taking charge of the decision process empowers you emotionally and physically.\nWelcome to my course, Natural Protocols for Breast Cancer!\nHello, my name is Diana Wright ND, BSN, MBA, AADP-BC, NEA-BC and I want to thank you for considering this course. I have been in the healthcare field for 40 years, first as a Registered Nurse and more recently a board-certified naturopathic doctor.\nI have an internationally-acclaimed, award-winning documentary called The Unbelievable Plight of Mrs. Wright that you can watch to hear my full story but here is a brief summary.\nIn 2012, I was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer, along with cancer throughout my whole abdomen, heart vessels, and brain tumors. I was given the death sentence of eight months to live and options consisting of only three “treatments”: surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Not wanting to give up on my family and my employees, I followed the doctors’ treatment plan. Meanwhile, I read anything about cancer treatments I could get my hands on and changed my lifestyle. An RN friend stumbled across alternative treatments and Dr. Ralf Kleef, an oncologist and naturopath based in Austria at the time.\nAfter a few rounds of chemotherapy and little improvement, I left America and flew to Austria with my husband to get treated with regional hyperthermia, IV Vitamin C, and other natural methods. I came back cancer-free and have been an advocate of natural treatments for cancer ever since. Through obtaining my doctor of naturopathy, I discovered the world of natural, homeopathic treatments for almost every disease and ailment. Naturopathic care is effective, but sometimes you have to get allopathic intervention to buy time for your length of life so you have enough lifespan for naturopathic care to work.",

      "description": "How to fully prepare yourself for your IVF or medical fertility treatments\nIf you are thinking about or preparing to start IVF or any medical fertility treatment but you have no idea what is ahead. If you are unsure of the process, what is involved and what you will need to do. If you are confused about the different treatments on offer and you feel anxious, fearful and worried that your fertility treatment may not work, then this message is for you.\nHere’s why.\nI have a comprehensive program that is going to help you thoroughly prepare for every aspect of your fertility treatment so that you feel completely informed and in total control of what you are going through, and therefore more likely to get a successful outcome.\nAnd you need to realise that there is a cost to not preparing for and learning everything you need to know about your fertility treatment.\nIf you aren’t fully informed about your fertility treatment, if you aren’t always clear about what is happening to you or why, or what all your options are, then this could ultimately impact whether your treatment is successful or not.\nWhat most people do when they start fertility treatment is that they assume their doctor will explain everything that they need to know to them. But for a lot of people they are left even more confused because doctors don’t always have time during appointments to explain everything in detail about the fertility treatment or the different options available. Many people then turn to searching the internet or online groups for advice and information about IVF or their medical fertility treatment. But they end up getting incorrect and misleading information that isn’t from qualified medical experts.\nAnd what happens if you just do nothing? If you just show up to your treatment and put your faith in doctors and medicine?\nWell you might end up making some ill-informed decisions that could negatively impact your fertility treatment and the outcome you get.\nThis program will help you become informed and feel empowered and in control of your fertility treatment.\nI’ve got an answer that works. Here’s the story.\nWhen my doctor told me that he was going to refer me for IVF I realised how little I knew about medical fertility treatments. My treatment was due to start in a couple of weeks and I wanted to find out as much as I could so that I was fully informed and in the driver’s seat of my fertility treatment.\nMy doctor didn’t have time to go through everything with me in our brief appointments and the clinic gave me a couple of basic brochures to read, so I went online to find out more. But with all the conflicting information I ended up more confused and anxious about my treatment.\nI needed a resource that was going to give me an in-depth understanding of my IVF treatment from beginning to end and that was easy to understand with no complicated medical terminology or doctor speak.\nAnd that is how this program came about.\nIt has helped me and many other people, and it will help you too.\n‘I was so unprepared. I didn’t even know what the letters, IVF stood for, let alone what was involved in medical fertility treatments. I was going to be spending so much money to have a baby this way and I wanted to make sure that I was doing everything I could to get the best outcome. This program left me feeling empowered and ready to conquer my fertility treatment as opposed to feeling in the dark, confused and unsure’.\nSara Foster\n‘There is no way my fertility doctor would have been able to go through everything I learnt in this program to help prepare me. Not only was the program interesting, but I learnt so much about how to cope with the emotional side of fertility treatments. I loved how easy the program was to understand and how much I now know as I continue my treatments with knowledge and confidence’.\nKerry Saxton\nHere’s what an understanding of IVF and medical fertility treatments did for me personally.\nIt helped me be very clear on exactly what was going to happen to me at each stage of my fertility treatment and why. I felt less stressed and anxious about my treatment, I felt more confident and in control and I was able to make better decisions about what I wanted or didn’t want when it came to my specific treatment and protocols.\nBut it’s not just me, here’s what the program has done for others.\nKate – The program helped me understand exactly what was going to happen in my treatment cycle.\nMary – I found out exactly what to do (and what not to do), to maximise the chance of a successful outcome. I was pregnant in my second round of IVF.\nOlive – After doing this program I felt more fully informed about the different treatment options and was able to bring them up and discuss them with my doctor to put in place the best treatment for me.\nNow it's your turn.\nWhen you enrol in this program you’re going to:\nFind out what IVF and medical fertility treatments are and how they can help you become pregnant.\nLearn how to find the perfect fertility clinic for you.\nUnderstand the different types of fertility treatments you might be offered.\nLearn about the clinic, staff and the doctors and what will happen at your first appointment.\nKnow how to prepare for the start of your treatment.\nFind out what happens during your egg collection and embryo transfer.\nFind out how to survive the two-week wait and what you should and shouldn’t do during this time.\nYour male partner also has access to a module that covers the male side of fertility treatments.\nYou will learn more about the pros and cons of using donor eggs and sperm.\nYou will get lots of practical advice on what you can do to influence the success of your treatment as well as cope with the emotional side of your fertility treatment.\nGet an understanding of your options if your fertility treatment doesn’t succeed.\nLearn what happens and next steps after you get your positive pregnancy test.\nAnd you’re 100% safe to try this out.\nThat’s all I’m suggesting. Just try this program to see if it helps you. If it does, you’ll be delighted – and I think that’s exactly what’s about to happen. If for some reason you’re not delighted with how in control, empowered and informed you feel about your fertility treatment, then just let me know – and you’ll get all your money back.\nIt's decision time.\nYou have a choice to make.\nDo you want you’ve doing, perhaps googling, getting advice from Facebook groups or hoping that you doctor will tell you what you need to know? You know where that will lead.\nOr, are you ready to take a new action and get fully informed and in control of your fertility treatments?\nHere’s what to do now.\nJoin my course 'Everything you need to know before starting IVF or ART' and get started on the path towards a successful fertility treatment.\nSee you on the inside\nThe Natural Fertility Coach\nxx",

Fibroblasts play an important role in helping skin wounds heal as well as maintaining skin firmness and tightness.\nPlasma fibroblast therapy uses a pen-like device that discharges a high-frequency electric current to small areas of the skin.\nThe plasma tip doesn’t directly touch the skin, but instead releases a targeted current just above the skin. The hot current creates small holes, or micro-injuries, in the skin’s layer.\nPlasmapen-fibroblast therapy:\nbreaks down proteins in the skin\nencourages tissue regeneration\nstimulates fibroblast activity\ncauses tissue contraction (tightening)\n\n\nWhat’s the procedure like?\nWhile the procedure may vary slightly based on where you’re having the treatment, the basic steps typically include:\nCleansing the skin and applying a topical anesthetic (numbing) cream. You may need to wait about 30 minutes for the numbing cream to take effect.\nTreating the designated skin area with the plasma pen. The pen will create small arcs of microcurrents that make small scab-like dots on the skin.\nA professional will remove the numbing cream and apply a cooling gel to minimize the tingling and burning sensation whenever possible.\nThe procedure usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes to perform.",

The Taoist way of dealing with stress is to perform the Six Healing Sounds.\nIn ancient times when Taoists sat quietly and listened inwardly, they became aware of different inner sounds and discovered that each organ had its own sound. Later they called them the 6 Healing Sounds.\nSome techniques require months and years of practice before any noticeable results occur. Thankfully, that’s not the case with the Six Healing Sounds. The Six Healing Sounds are so simple and easy to perform that they seem almost too good to be true.\nThe Six Healing Sounds should be practiced daily. Regular practice recycles more and more negative energy. Negative emotions need not be dreaded, for with the use of the Six Healing Sounds they can easily be transformed into refreshing vital life-force.\nThis course consists of 8 short videos with subtitles explaining the theory, movements, meditation and breathing exercises.\nThese short and simple, yet tremendously efficient practices will teach you to listen to your body and transform negative, unhealthy energy into positive energy. It will help you to become more energetic, healthy and peaceful.",

This is a beautiful practice of active meditation to connect with another human being, sharing space and do also beneficial bodywork for yourself. So you learn to master your body, feel inside the other, transform energies and discover how to work with your body weight from your Hara. The Thai Yoga Massage is also called „sacred dance“. Enjoy!",

It also releases \"happy\" hormones in you too helping reduce stress levels, increase milk production and combat PND.\n\nOur courses lead you through a carefully designed programme, which will give you the confidence and skills to perform a daily massage routine with your baby; deepening the bond between you and your baby and promoting feelings of love and attachment.\nThe course is split into sections. Introduction and 4 core lessons with revision and extra toolkits sections too.

Recently, Ayurveda is receiving accolades from medical practitioners from around the world for its in-depth understanding of how to heal from the root of illness, rather than working on prevention of symptoms. UN and WHO recognize Ayurveda an authentic medical system and many governments around the world, including USA, recognize Ayurveda as a complimentary therapy for legal and insurance purposes. Many people who tried Ayurveda Therapies from authentic places, can vouchsafe the efficacy of Ayurveda, beyond any theoretical doubts.\n\n\nMore than massages and therapies, Ayurveda is a vast science of living a Life in tune with Mother Nature and to let the Nature take care of the body! Ayurveda can help us in deciding the right diet, life style changes, and psychological attitude towards our body, which are at the root of all medical problems.\nAyurveda education provided in Ayurveda colleges is meant for doctors who need to spend three to five long years to study, all the Sanskrit works and train to be professional doctors. Ayurveda resorts and hospitals in Kerala, Goa and other parts of India, where one can try Ayurveda courses / therapies, do not explain or teach the underlying knowledge behind this great science of life.\nOne can also learn about Ayurveda from media/online and can even buy the Ayurvedic medicines online or over the counter!\nHowever, they don’t work as they promise as the quality of factory produced Ayurvedic medicines are doubtful. Without proper diagnosis, based on physical and mental constitution, and appropriate diet & lifestyle changes, oral medication may not show its effect!\nSo, Fakira ji  has decided to develop short term ayurveda courses with training and certification for common people to apply ayurveda in their daily lifestyle.\n\n\nTopics to be covered:\nIntroduction to Ayurveda\nPancha Maha Bhootas (Five elements) and their qualities\nTridoshas viz. Vata, Pitaa and Kapha\nDoshas and their physical and psychological properties\n6 tastes and connection to doshas\nSeasons and Doshas\nAnalysis of the dosha\nDifferent foods and properties\nSome Important Herbs and properties\nDina Charya (Ayurvedic daily routine)\nMedicines in Ayurveda\nTrigunas viz. Satva, Rajas and Tamas\nEffect of Gunas on food\nConnection of Gunas and Doshas and their application to daily life\nIntroduction to Pancha Karma\nTheory of Shat Kriyas of Yoga\nPancha Karma vs Shat Kriyas\nAyurvedic cooking",

The course emphasizes the skills, knowledge, and ethical foundations necessary to ensure accurate, professional, and culturally appropriate communication between patients and healthcare providers.\nThe journey begins with an introduction to the foundations of medical interpreting, where learners explore professional roles, ethical boundaries, and core standards of practice. Building on this, learners develop proficiency in medical terminology, gaining confidence in interpreting anatomy, diagnoses, procedures, and medications across languages without resorting to guesswork.\nThe course also provides structured training in effective communication techniques, enabling interpreters to manage tone, pacing, body language, and first-person speech while handling emotionally charged or complex interactions. A dedicated module on cultural competence equips learners to recognize and address cultural differences that impact health communication, helping them navigate sensitive issues without compromising neutrality.\nRecognizing the pressures of clinical environments, the course offers practical strategies for high-stress situations, including emergency scenarios and the delivery of difficult news. Learners also engage with real-world ethical challenges, applying structured decision-making frameworks to dilemmas involving dual roles, misinformation, or advocacy boundaries. Finally, the program concludes with practical field skills, preparing interpreters for pre-session briefings, clinical documentation, technology use, and professional self-assessment.\nBy integrating knowledge, practice, and reflection, this course empowers interpreters to deliver safe, accurate, and culturally responsive interpretation, building trust and supporting equitable patient care across diverse healthcare settings.",

      "description": "The Five Tibetans are practiced worldwide, but there is a lot of misinformation out there and very few people have access to the original 1939 Peter Kelder instructions.  This course strives to change that.  Krista Power was first introduced to the Five Tibetans in March of 2016 and was instantly captivated.  Setting off on a journey to learn all she could about this ancient practice, Krista began researching, practicing and huting for the original instructions.  A series of events led Krista to an original 1939 copy of Peter Kelder's book The Eye of Revelation, the book that started it all.  Realizing the value of the information she now possessed and determine to share it, Krista wrote her own book, which was published in April 2019.  Based on Krista Power's book The Original Five Tibetans, An Exploration of the Historic 1939 Peter Kelder Book, The Eye of Reveation,  this course guides you through this ancient practice of rejuvenation the way it was originally intended to be done.  You will learn Peter Kelder's authentic 1939 instructions for this practice, where it came from, why we do it and what it's all about.  A teacher and practitioner of both Yoga and the Five Tibetans, Krista is passionate about this practice and is driven to share her knowledge and experience and ultimately to keep Peter Kelder's original work alive.  Krista will discuss the fascinating background story and history of the Five Tibetans, the energetic system the practice is based on (the Vortexes), how to perform each movement in detail, how to set up your own daily practice, tips for success and more.  Often put under the Yoga umbrella, Krista will also offer her thoughts on why she does not consider the Tibetans to be Yoga.  Join Krista for this engaging, informative course and begin your own journey toward \"youthification\".",

Rather than offering a complete, step-by-step traditional Reiki program, this course focuses on what I believe is most essential: the energetic transmission itself. It offers a unique, experience-based path, focusing on placements and experiences, allowing you to connect deeply with the energy in a way that feels natural, personal, and intuitive.\n\n\nYou'll receive all three core Usui/Holy Fire Reiki symbols, for level II. You’ll be introduced to their essence, including how and when to use them, how to activate them through drawing, intention, or visualization, and how to invite their presence into your daily life. Each symbol – from Cho Ku Rei (power), to Sei He Ki (emotional healing), to Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen (distance and timeline healing) – carries a unique vibration and purpose.\n\n\nRather than just memorizing shapes, you’ll learn to connect with each symbol as a living energy, awakening your intuitive understanding of when and how to use it. You’ll discover how symbols can be used to cleanse spaces, energize crystals, food and water (yes – you’ll even learn how Reiki-treated water tastes different!), offer protection, or enhance personal clarity and grounding.\n\n\nThis course doesn’t focus on theory, perfection or mastering fixed techniques. Instead, it invites you to explore your own relationship with yourself and Reiki. And to develop a personal, heart-led practice that resonates with who you are right now.\n\n\nWhether you're looking to recharge your Reiki path or open a new doorway in your spiritual journey, this course offers a clear, warm, and grounded space to reconnect, recharge and realign with your purpose and your inner light.",

With this knowledge you can correctly treat these types of patients. Respiratory Acidosis, Respiratory Alkalosis, Metabolic Acidosis, Metabolic Alkalosis, and Mixed Acidosis are all covered in detail.\nThis is a super easy way of learning how to work with ABGs. The X method has been presented to many of my student and within a short period of time (usually less than one hour) they have become well versed on how to read ABGs. You can also learn how to read ABGs quickly.

When people think of poverty alleviation and child welfare, they think of social workers. Those types of things are done by many social workers, but we do a lot more.\nWe focus on both the person and the environment in social work, which makes us different from other professions. We deal with the things outside a person's control that affect their situation. In addition, we help clients and communities cope effectively with their reality and change that reality when necessary through assessment and intervention. Clients are helped by social workers not just with how they feel, but also with what they can do.\nThere are countless ways to be a caregiver. They help elders, sick people, and disabled people. Small and big tasks they help with every day. Over time, they can become exhausted and stressed if the caregiving responsibilities get too intense.\nThere's nothing complicated about the word. In the word itself is the meaning. A caregiver is someone who gives care. Someone who supports, helps, or aids someone who needs it. When someone can't take care of themselves, they care for their loved ones, friends, family, or others. It's a diverse group of caregivers - they provide care in a bunch of different situations. Taking a step back, let's ask ourselves, “what is a caregiver? We can support caregivers in our lives once we know who they are.\nIn this master course, I would like to teach 5 major topics,\n1. Introduction and importance of social worker, caregiving and caregiver support\n2. Caregiving and home health care business plan and benefits\n3. Caregiver for special needs child and elderly\n4.

It will help you understand why virgin unrestored teeth might show symptoms.

      "description": "Sunnah Hijama Cupping – Course Overview\nHistory of Hijama Therapy\nHijama, meaning \"suction\" or \"drawing out,\" is an ancient healing practice with roots going back over 5000 years. It has been documented in Chinese, Egyptian, and Greek medical traditions and was later perfected in Islamic medicine as a Prophetic healing method. Early cupping used animal horns to extract toxins, evolving to bamboo, glass, and now modern suction cups.\nHow Does Hijama Work?\nHijama therapy involves controlled suction and bloodletting to remove stagnant blood, detoxify the body, and restore balance. The process follows three key steps:\nCup Placement: Cups are applied to specific points based on pain areas and acupuncture meridians.\nSuction Therapy: The vacuum effect draws toxins and increases blood flow, aiding circulation and cell regeneration.\nBloodletting (Wet Cupping Only): Small, superficial incisions are made before reapplying the cups to extract stagnant blood and toxins.\nTypes of Cupping Therapy\nThere are different techniques in Hijama, each serving a unique purpose:\nDry Cupping: Suction-only therapy that stimulates blood flow without cutting the skin.\nWet Cupping (Sunnah Hijama): Suction is followed by light incisions to remove toxins and stagnant blood.\nMoving Cupping: Oil is applied to the skin, and cups are glided over muscles to release tension.\nAir Cupping: Uses a handheld pump instead of fire to create suction, a modern alternative to traditional fire cupping.\nWhat You Will Learn in This Course\nThis comprehensive training will equip you with the knowledge and hands-on skills to perform safe, effective, and Sunnah-compliant Hijama therapy. Topics include:\nThe Science Behind Hijama – Understanding how cupping improves circulation, detoxification, and pain relief.\nAnatomy, Physiology & Pathology – Learn about blood composition, skeletal structure, and common health conditions addressed by Hijama.\nSunnah Hijama Points & Traditional Methods – Discover authentic techniques used throughout history.\nStep-by-Step Cupping Techniques – Master dry, wet, moving, and air cupping through guided practice.\nSafety, Hygiene & Aftercare – Prevent infections, follow best practices, and guide clients on post-Hijama recovery with diet & lifestyle tips.\nWhy Enroll in This Course?\nLearn from Experts – Taught by experienced practitioners following traditional healing methods.\nPractical Hands-on Training – Gain real experience performing Hijama with confidence.\nPremium Certification Available – Students have the option to obtain a premium certification for an additional fee.\nStart a Career in Holistic Healing – Open doors to a fulfilling and profitable health practice.\nJoin us and revive this traditional healing method.

You don't doubt that regular dumbbell lifts develop biceps muscles, do you? A muscle that works under workload gets stronger and bigger in volume - it's a well-known fact. Muscles in the face are smaller and thinner than those in the other parts of the body, but they still have the same structure. Thus, it's obvious that they will get toned, grow in size and become stronger.\n\nHow soon will I get the results?\nFirst changes will become visible within two weeks after you've started practicing. The quality of the skin and the complexion will improve; you will also notice that your muscles have become toned. More profound changes will take place after 2 or 3 months of regular practice. To preserve the results and to prevent new wrinkles from appearing, it is necessary to keep practicing without interruptions.\n\nThis course provides a powerful set of exercises for face lifting, toning and smoothing.

      "description": "This is a short course designed for owners and trainers. In this first module you will learn about the function of the neck in locomotion, as well as 4 very important muscles of the neck which I believe every horse owner or trainer should know about.\nYou will learn to identify each of these 4 muscles, perform a basic visual assessment of each one, and apply simple but effective techniques to reduce tension in each one.\nThere are 3 or more techniques per muscle, with a clear video with audio demonstrating and explaining how to perform each one, as well as the nuances of how each technique and each protocol can be modified to suit the individual horse. The techniques are gentle and non-invasive but they are also very effective.. They work accumulatively, which means that the more you do them, the better they work. You will be working with your horse's nervous system to create lasting positive changes.\nYou will learn about the function of each of the 4 muscles in this course, and common causes of pain, dysfunction, or tension in each one.\nYou will also learn how to perform a simple visual assessment of a horse's neck overall.\nMost importantly, you will learn to read your horse's body language and work with your horse to relieve tension in their neck.\nThis course is designed to provide a rewarding and beneficial way to deepen your bond with your horse through touch.\nThere are many online courses about bodywork or anatomy, but as so many of them are costly and contain quite an overwhelming amount of information to absorb, I created this course as a way for you to gently dip your toe into the world of equine anatomy and bodywork.\nI decided to release this course in 5 separate modules, to keep the amount of information in each one to a comfortable amount. This way you can also choose to start with the parts of the body you are most interested in, or you can take all of the modules in order to gain a more holistic overview of your horse's body.\nI will release a total of 5 simple modules on 5 important areas of the body: The Neck, The Shoulders & Thoracic Sling, The Back & Ribcage, The Hindquarters, and The Head & Poll.\nThese modules should provide a great foundation should you wish to study bodywork further, and also if you wish to explore the world of biomechanics in your training. However, please note that this is not a certification course and will not enable you to practice as a professional equine bodyworker. Practicing as a professional bodyworker is something that is regulated differently in every country, and many countries and states require that you have a recognized qualification to provide equine bodywork as a paid service. That is not the purpose of this course.\nI have decided to release each module as I create it, so I hope you gain value from this first one!",

      "description": "This 20 (CEU) Home Study program has been set up for your success!\nBarefoot Sports Therapy is a unique Eastern modality in which the therapist's primary tool is his or her feet. The feet achieve effortless deep tissue massage. The feet apply broader and deeper ranges of pressure than the hands or elbows. Most importantly, feet sustain deep tissue techniques for longer periods without injuring the therapist's wrists or thumbs.\nBarefoot Sports Therapy is also unique because clients can remain comfortably clothed in shorts and a top during their massage. Many potential clients do not feel comfortable with the idea of being naked, even if they know they will be covered with a sheet. Having a fully clothed massage option can open your business up to a new target market. There are whole groups of people who will never schedule a traditional Swedish massage but will eagerly book a Barefoot Sports Therapy massage knowing they can keep their clothes on.\nAnother unique feature of Barefoot Sports Therapy is no private room is needed; it can be done anywhere and at anytime! This makes it a great choice for outdoor sporting events such as marathons, soccer games, track or field events and other athletic occasions. Barefoot Sports Therapy can be offered beside a pool, in a park, on a balcony or at the beach. If desired, Barefoot Sports Therapy can be offered in a private room, but it is not required because clients do not need to undress.\nThe greatest advantage of Barefoot Sports Therapy is its versatility. There are so many ways it can be offered. For example, you can offer:\n30-minute shoulder, back and neck treatments on any massage table with a 28-inch wooden stool for balance.\n60- or 90-minute full-body treatments on a massage table with overhead bars (permanent or portable).\n30-, 60- or 90-minute treatments on a mat on the floor. This is a great choice for outdoor events.\n30-, 60- or 90-minute treatments on a Pilates Cadillac in an open space while other clients are getting physical therapy or having a Pilates lesson.",

The treatment is different with traditional Chinese medicine. Rather than points in traditional Chinese medicine, there are somatotopes in YNSA. The physician uses these somatotopes on the head and body to treat patients.\nYNSA is that stimulate points on the head and body by needle. This therapy is very effective in neurologic disease, and pain control.\nYNSA has rare pain when treating, without soreness and numbness, so it is suitable for women and kids.\nThe feature of YNSA: convenience, less pain, Fast outcome, and low price.\nConvenience: We treat patients on the head, without taking off clothes. It is very convenient for women.\nWithout pain: The acupuncture needle is thin, only 0.24mm, so the pain is lesser.\nFast outcome: Pain and discomfort will relieve soon after treatment.\nLow price: Fewer needle than Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, and the cost is lower.\n\n\nThis course includes new somatotopes in 2019. We will still introduce the new diagnosis method and demonstration.\nThis seminar is the newest version of YNSA in the world.\nAfter finished this seminar, you can relieve the discomfort below:\nStroke rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease, knee pain, limb numbness, and pain control.\nThe new diagnosis in this seminar will support Hoku, upper extremity, and neck diagnosis.",

We then give detailed written instructions for each massage tutorial, as well as brief tutorial notes for the purposes of convenient revision.\n\nThe 'Massage Professional' course has been designed for:\n\n1) New massage careers - most therapists unfortunately fail to really get off the ground after training. 'Massage Professional' starts from the very basics but also provides a complete, comprehensive, high-end skill set that should give a new massage career with an advantageous kick-start. Please note that succeeding in any industry will, of course, always require dedication, and we always suggest that therapists get into this work for the love of these healing arts, and of people -- not for the money!\n2) Amateurs and Beginners:\nThis course is accessible for people who have no prior knowledge of massage and you can dip into it as you wish. If you wish to enrich your life with a professional touch, then this course is highly recommended.\n\n3) Professionals who want to learn new styles of massage, expand their skill set, revise methods, and find inspiration for fusion massage should find this course very useful.\n\nWe listen to the thoughts and suggestions of our students and make updates to our course regularly.\n\nWe May Award Up to 11 CTAA Certificates in the Following Types of Massage:\n\nSwedish Full-Body Massage\nHawaiian Lomilomi Massage\nHand & Foot Massage\nThai Yoga Massage\nRhythmic Thai Massage\nIndian Head Massage\nHot Stone Massage\nChair Massage\nDeep Tissue Massage\nZen Shiatsu (Practical)\nInternational Fusion Massage\n\nThese will be awarded after students have watched the relevant materials, have fully learned the health and safety guidelines for massage and completed five practice treatments for each certificate.\n\nTheory exams will need to be passed for each certificate. These exams are easy but have a high pass mark.\nSuccess in gaining a certificate is very achievable but not guaranteed as we have a duty to protect the public against bad practice.\n\nPlease note: certificates are not available during the 30-day trial period. Please message us with any questions.\n\nOur certificates are insurable in the UK, EU and many other countries but please check the law in your country for practicing professional massage. If you wish to practice professional massage via our certificates, it is very important to check that CTAA certificates are insurable in your country and to check the law in your country to see if online certificates are recognized.\n\nThis course is not suitable for those who simply want to rush learning massage. Although we provide a huge amount of content, we encourage our students to learn one style of massage at a time; approaching them all at once and expecting professional quality results overnight is both unrealistic and unsafe. As such, once again, if certification, and especially rapid certification, are important reasons for your purchase, message us with any queries before you buy and start practicing.",

The descriptions in the course manual are detailed and there are many clear illustrations.

This sequence is one I have used in corporates and private practice for many years, but do chop and change it and make it your own.\nMassage, with it’s incredible ability to physically affect the body, can not only improve physical well-being, but can also improve mental and emotional wellness too. If you are a massage therapist, this treatment is wonderful to offer clients who suffer with headaches and migraines, scalp and hair concerns, neck and shoulder tension, and just general overall stress.\nIt is a wonderful treatment to offer at corporate wellness days as it targets those areas of stress that most of us struggle with. It is a quick effective treatment and as the use of oils is optional and the person receiving the treatment doesn’t need to get undressed, it is a super useful treatment to have in your repertoire as a masseuse, all you need is a comfy chair!\nHave massaged for many years in the corporate and private sector, I developed this routine which was easy and effective. Whatever has drawn you to learn Indian Head and Shoulder Massage, at the end of this course, you will be able to offer a divine, soothing, stress relieving treatment.\nEnrol now to unlock the magic of Indian Head and Shoulder Massage!",

Western medical scientists say that autism cannot be cured, yet parents have to invest a great deal of time and money on all sorts of long term intervention programs for the child.\nSpecial Need Children Specialists can't completely explain in which way the intervention program can improve the child. At the same time, back in the mind, \"Autism cannot be cured\".\nDifferent intervention experts disagree with each other, and each expert believes that their intervention plan is the most effective.\nThis video course \"Autism: From Understanding to Solution Action\" studies and analyses how Western medical scientists have dealt with autism since 109 years ago till today.\nWe especially discuss the different theories they use. What is missing?\nThen, we introduce the ancient wisdom, Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic.\nWe discuss how the overall integrated theory of Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic can logically explain the various disorders and behavior problems of various autistic children.\nAt the same time, the same theory will be used to do balancing work to the autistic children, to improve their problems.\nThis is also a marked difference from Western medicine theory.

Within a few months of setting up my practice, I had many beauty enthusiasts and a few clients\ntoo expressing their interest in learning the subject and getting the required know-how to pursue the science of beauty.\nTeaching comes to me naturally, as I have been a professor for 12 years from the very beginning of my career with\nNDMVP Samaj Medical College, Adgaon, Nashik, Maharashtra, India, and I love sharing my knowledge and imparting\ntraining in my field of expertise. Also, another key reason for setting up professional courses in cosmetology was the lack\nof technical schools to impart this education back then. It pained to see clients having their skin gone bad with regular\nfacials or parlour treatments not suited for their skin type. There was a clear need to educate every beauty consultant at\nthe very grass-root level to understand the basics of skin-type analysis and scientific skin care. This is where it all began,\nthe book then was just a few pages of bullet point notes provided to students for reference; but, today, it is a full-fledged\nvolume that covers every subject in extreme detail. The book elaborates how to conduct a procedure from beginning to\nend. It is a perfect guidebook for all those practising cosmetology already or considering the idea of it.\nMay we together continue to make this world more and more beautiful.",

I have been where you are, alcohol became something that I couldn’t stop drinking despite how miserable it made me.\nAlcohol replaced the ‘real me’ with a fat, unhealthy zombie. I got sick of waking up full of regret and guilt. It wasn’t fair on my wife, children or myself!\nEvery day I made excuses about why I needed the alcohol even more, failing to make the connection that the alcohol was the reason for the vast majority of my problems.\n\"I think I tried absolutely everything to get rid of that poison\"\nAA was too depressing, and I didn’t want to label myself as an alcoholic. Rehab was too expensive for my joyless and broke self. The thought of putting dangerous prescription drugs into my body in an attempt to rid myself of another drug didn’t make sense at all.\n\nFinally... I realized willpower was not the answer. I’d been fighting a losing battle!\n\n\nWhen I eventually landed on the secret to controlling my cravings for alcohol without willpower, life became...easy. I lost weight, slept like a baby, reconnected with my family, and regained my career.\n\n\nIt is no stretch to say it both changed my life and saved my life, and it’s become my life mission to do the same for other people in my same situation—people just like you.\n\n\nThat’s why I created this affordable, private, and fast-acting how to stop drinking program, so you don’t have to struggle as long as I did to control your craving for alcohol.\nFinally I discovered an easy solution to my addiction\nOnce you discover the secret of how alcohol is keeping you in a painful loop you will easily get back in control of your drinking in less than 3 weeks.\nWAIT let me be clear, I do not mean you will have to go around telling people you are not allowed to drink. The urge to drink will just fade away, you will no longer want to drink as often (or at all).\nYou should trust me on this, when I finally figured out how to stop drinking it turned my life around. I lost 57lbs in weight, all my health problems disappeared and I started enjoying time with my friends and family again.\nThis is all waiting for you just as soon as you get started today.",

According to MD Kathleen Fry, “It is different from conventional herbal or naturopathic medicine, it is a form of alternative, vibrational healing that stimulates the body’s ability to heal itself without drugs by strengthening the Vital Force. The Vital Forces is the unseen, energetic power that guides every physiologic function of living beings.”\nThe goal of homeopathic treatment for any ailment is to assist the Vital Force to achieve optimal health. The lack of disease symptoms reflects this healthy state. All symptoms are simply a communication from the vital force signaling the need for assistance. As a result, headaches serve a function. The cornerstone of treatment is determining which remedy the vital force is demanding and then taking that remedy for as long as necessary. Homeopathic doctors believe that by addressing the underlying cause of headaches or any other condition, their remedies can successfully support a return to health. There is no need to continue taking a remedy once this return to health is attained unless a new set of symptoms emerges.\n.\nHomoeopathy is one of the most extensively utilized complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) in Europe. It arose from the German physician Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann's repeated clinical observations in the 18th century, which led him to reformulate a therapeutic principle known in medical history, 'the rule of Similars.' It is described as “a system of medical practice that treats a disease especially by the administration of minute doses of a remedy that would in larger amounts produce in healthy persons symptoms similar to those of the disease.\nThis course comes with an external diploma certificate.\n\n\n\n\nSECTION ONE Introduction & the History of Homeopathy\n1.INTRODUCTION\n2.

You can execute Hand Reflexology on yourself, as well as others.\nIn 2002 I first realised that many people wanted to learn Hand Reflexology in their own homes. When I first noticed this, I decided to co-write my now international best-selling book “Hand Reflexology” with my sister Louise Keet. At the time I wrote the book in 2003, I wanted to produce a method within the book as a solution for people to learn Hand Reflexology at home.\nHowever, in the past few years, I came to the conclusion that even though you can learn some aspects of Hand Reflexology from reading a book, the power of video is a much better medium to learn this type of Complementary Therapy, because of its physical hands-on nature.\nAlso, many of the hundreds of students who have attended my Hand Reflexology workshops at my college in London and various locations around the world also indicated to me that they would have loved to a have a video of the Hand Reflexology Sequence that would reinforce what they had learnt in the classroom setting.\nAs well as teaching Reflexology at diploma level for over 30 years, I have a Degree in Podiatry and a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). I am also a qualified First Aid teacher and facilitate the One Day Person Appointed HSE approved Course\nI am an author of the best Selling book “Hand Reflexology” which has sold in excess of 200,000 copies and has been translated into 12 different languages world-wide.\nI have taught Reflexology to well over 10000 people over the last 30 Years.\nI provide Reflexology training in countries all over the world including Japan, Turkey, Grenada and Oman.\nMy clients have included celebrities from Film, Music and Theatre, as well as members of Royalty, and the National England Football Squad.\nI have been featured in the UK Media including “Vogue” and “GQ” magazine, as well as appearing on UK GMTV with Lorraine Kelly, as well as having my own segment on Health Programmes on SKY TV\nMy production team and I have spent the last year creating The Online Hand Reflexology Course that helps people wanting an easy and effective way to learn Hand Reflexology in the comfort of their own home like you.

      "description": "WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT IN THIS COURSE?...\nAs a physical therapist, I work with thousands of people who need help with stretching, mobility, and dysfunctional joints. I've created thousands of home exercise programs for people since I graduated with my Master's in Physical Therapy as well as becoming a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS).\nMy name is Nick Helton The TravelPhysio, and I hope to be your instructor! I work full time as a physical therapist in an orthopedic setting.\nJoin the over 7,000 students who have already enrolled in one Nick's courses!\nI created this course because I want to achieve 4 main objectives:\nWHY should or shouldn't you stretch - This question comes up ALL the time. Do I need to stretch? What kind of benefit can stretching provide for me? Take this course, and\nI'll walk you through if you should or shouldn't stretch\n.\nWHEN should you stretch - I get asked this all the time as well. What's the proper amount of time to stretch for? Should I stretch before or after or during a workout? Does the timing matter? Take this course, and\nI'll walk you through when you should stretch and for how long.\nHOW do I stretch - This one is simple. I've created 21+ videos (more to be added based on request) that will walk you though HOW to perform a stretch, as well as stretching for major muscle groups in the body. The great thing about the videos is you can re-watch them anytime you need to! They are available to you for life! That way, any time you want to try them you have access. You can watch them on your mobile device or on your computer at home.\nAnd finally, the reason I created this course is to help YOU move. OneBetter Movement is all about helping people move. I created this course to try to help as many people as I can move better. I put hours of editing and video creation into this course. I hope you get value out of it, and I hope that you like it enough to enroll in some of my other courses!\nThis Course is for you if...\nYou've ever wanted to increase your flexibility\nYou want to know how to stretch major muscle groups of the body\nYou want to learn the difference between flexibility and mobility\nHere's a breakdown of what you're going to learn:\nStretching: Defined\nLearn the 4 Types of Stretching\nStretching vs Mobility: What’s the Difference\nA Bonus Course Preview!\nWhat is the best amount of time to stretch?\nWhen should I  stretch?\nIs Stretching a Warm Up?\nCan Stretching Help pain?\nWhen to NOT stretch!\nSimple Anatomy: Complex Topics made Easy\nVideo Library of Stretching!\nBONUS #2: Video Review of the BEST Equipment to help you Stretch/Perform/Improve Range of Motion\nIn this course, I'm also going to give you Video Demonstrations on how to stretch, with over 21+ videos (AND more to come) including:\nHow to Stretch your Hamstrings\nHow to Stretch your Adductors - Version 1 + 2\nHow to Stretch your IT Band\nHow to Stretch your Quads\nHow to Stretch your Calf (gastrocnemius)\nHow to Stretch your Anterior Tibialis\nHow to Stretch your Glutes (gluteus maximus)\nHow to Stretch your Piriformis\nHow to Mobilize your Hip Internal and External Rotation\nHow to Stretch your Rotator Cuff - Internal Rotation\nHow to Stretch your Forearm Flexors - Version 1 + 2\nHow to Stretch your Forearm Extensors - Version 1 + 2\nHow to Stretch your Triceps\nHow to Stretch your Upper Traps (Neck)\nHow to Stretch your SCM (SternoCleidoMastoid)\nHow to Stretch your Levator Scapula\nHow to Perform a Full Spine Stretch\nHow to Perform a Prone Lumbar Extension (Prone Cobra)\nHow to Perform Lower Trunk Rotations\nHow to Perform Upper Trunk Rotations\nI've also included videos on simple Anatomy to help you understand the basics of what I'm going over. By no means is it comprehensive on all anatomy (Maybe more in part 2!) but I want you to have a basic fundamental idea of what I'm going over and how I am addressing these drills.\nI made this course for people to achieve a baseline understanding of stretching, mobility, and beginner level activity. I will be releasing a mega course focusing on advanced concepts in stretching, mobility, posture, and range of motion of all joints, which current students of this course will have first access to, discounts for, and also have the opportunity to obtain some special bonus content!\nRemember that you can use the discussion portion of this course to ask questions, suggest/request exercises and stretches, as well as to interact with me. I am also available for questions and post tips/free content on Instagram TravelPhysio.\nI appreciate YOU for looking at this course, and I look forward to HELPING you to reach YOUR goals for this upcoming year!\nNick Helton                                                                                                                                                                          The TravelPhysio",

It will allow you to add much more variety to your face massage.\nThe course is mostly practical, since we covered basic theory last time. As before, it is broken down into modules with me demonstrating, so that you can progress in small stages in your own time. There are also written notes with points to remember for each move.\nYou will learn additional techniques, some of which are based on those learned in level 1, and some brand new ones, several of which are especially rejuvenating. You will learn the meridians and points on the scalp,  extending  the meridians over the head.  And you will learn a routine I have devised for using rollers on the face, either ridoki or other types, such as jade rollers.\nSo go ahead, sign up, and I will see you very soon",

Sustainable Thinking explores how values and sustainability can reshape the way design management is practised and applied. It explores to be able to think ethical and sustainable means to assess the consequences and impact of ideas, opportunities and actions.\nTeaching as a priority.\nWe need to be creative and innovative. The teachers who motivate, differentiate, make content relevant and leave no student behind are more important than any other factor in particular. For students like the subject only when they like the teacher and is hence a directly proportional element within a classroom. The drive by the teacher in the class, with the vocabulary is signified with the equilibrium of learning together rather than teaching. The say, “Teachers know the best”, activates wisdom just in the say but in action. The sole reason for this far-fetched approach lies in the nutshell element of an easy approach of open knowledge which is free, versatile and dual with surprises. The satisfaction and the wow element within classrooms only prevails where there is a taste of “It is in the book, Ma’am, tell us something new!” As a teacher, it is our wisdom to inculcate the “I can do approach” instead of “I shall try approach” and that is universally possible only when we use kind words in the class. Compliment each kid, specially the difficult ones. That might be the only positive thing they hear all day.\n\n\nThe module explores in a big way towards learning.",

This course provides an opportunity to dive more deeply into an aspect of Reiki that often isn't covered thoroughly in the usual Reiki training courses.\n\n\nChannelling Reiki regularly will naturally help you become more intuitive over time. Giving yourself Reiki relaxes and calms the mind, lowers the brainwaves and helps your body shift from active/doing mode into receptive/receiving mode. Your nervous system begins to move from a state of alertness into one of relaxation. The more relaxed you are, the more receptive you are to psychic information. This then leads you to become more intuitive in all other areas of your life.\n\n\nIn this course you'll learn how to receive psychic information from the aura - your own and others. Don't worry that you have to be visual/clairvoyant to see energy: you may indeed 'see' colours or dense heavy spots in the aura but you can also 'feel' different energies with your hands, 'feel' the emotions stored in someone's energy field as an emotional reaction  or receive information as a 'knowing' or inner voice. We all have different psychic abilities and your sensitivity will develop with practice. Keep an open mind and be open to how this information can come to you.",

If you believe you have this or have been diagnosed with Sciatica and have NOT found relief with the common treatment of medication, rest, injections, and crappy Physical Therapy or Chiropractic, than this course is for you.\nWe take the very same process that we've been using for 15 years to help individuals just like yourself finally solve the Sciatica problem. It is most commonly due to a soft tissue or disc injury in the low back (lumbar spine). Understanding how this affects the Sciatic nerve and how to move in an appropriate direction to reduce the soft tissue is key to finally fixing the issue.\nCome with us as we take you through the steps of first understanding what Sciatica is, how to identify your correct movement, how to use that movement to fix your pain, and then how to get strong with a series of specific exercises.\nThere is a lot of information out there about different treatments and methods to solve this problem. If you have pain that is intermittent and changes with certain times of day, movements, positions, or activities, and you believe that you can get better, this course is for you.",

      "description": "Have you ever thought “is cupping really working?” while treating? Or while getting out your cups, fumbled with an explanation of how they work when your client asks? If so, you are in the right place.\nCupping has been gaining popularity rapidly, particularly after the last Olympics when several athletes were seen with the classic red circle marks of cupping. Celebrities are on the bandwagon as well. All of this is for good reason. The health benefits to be had from the regular use of myofascial cupping therapy are vast.\nMany massage therapy programs are now teaching basic cupping techniques as part of their program, and if not, taking a cupping course is usually one of the first courses taken for CE credits by many therapists. This course is the next level. I will be going over key concepts such as:\nHow to accurately identify myofascial adhesions\nHow to painlessly and quickly treat adhesions\nThe most up to date research on how cupping works\nHow to seamlessly add cupping into your treatment plan\nI have been using cups as a regular part of treatment for almost a decade. I have treated hundreds of patients, and through that experience, I have developed a technique that has given me the fastest, longest lasting and most reliable results when using cups.\nThis course is designed to build a strong foundation for using myofascial cups. I will show you how to go beyond treating general myofascial adhesions. I have thoughtfully and painstakingly put together the most comprehensive course on myofascial cupping, but it all starts with assessment.\nAs an instructor at one of the most successful massage colleges in Canada, I have realized that identifying and assessing myofascial adhesions is the hardest concept to grasp. This course demonstrates the exact technique on how to do so with complete clarity.\nNote: This course is not valid for continuing education credits/hours.",

      "description": "Prostate issues aren't something that most men talk about very often. But unfortunately, no matter how much we may wish to ignore or sideline the issue, the fact is that the vast majority of men will experience prostate issues at some point during their life... Your father, your brother, your male friends, even you will likely, at some point, suffer from one of these uncomfortable, painful, embarrassing, or even life-threatening prostate conditions.\nAccording to recent statistics, one in seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (1,2). And roughly half of all men 50 or over suffer from an enlarged prostate (also known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia or BPH) (3). In fact, by the age of 80, 90% of all men live with BPH (4).\nAlthough there are many different incredible (even life-saving) procedures that can be used to treat BPH and prostate cancer, unfortunately these treatments commonly result in two drastic side effects, incontinence, and erectile dysfunction. In fact, up to 40% of men develop stress incontinence and almost all men develop erectile dysfunction after receiving one of these commonly used prostate surgeries (5,6).\nHowever, the inability to maintain continence, healthy erections, and strong ejaculation is experienced by men with no history of prostate issues.\nBut, of course, statistics don't tell the full story. Because once a man develops stress incontinence, everything in his life changes. Now, even relatively minor physical exertion can cause you to lose control of your bladder. It's not just that vigorous physical exercise becomes a thing of the past. Even everyday acts like coughing, sneezing, bending over, or just sitting down or standing up can cause anything from a few dribbles to a complete loss of your bladder control. In fact, some men even lose control of their bladder during sex.\nAnd so, with stress incontinence, your new priorities in life are preventing embarrassing accidents and making sure you have immediate access to the bathroom. Long business meetings become difficult (or impossible) to sit through. Aisle seats become absolutely vital for that emergency escape route to the bathroom. Even going on vacation loses its appeal because weeks away from home are no longer an exciting adventure but an uncomfortable journey outside of your comfort zone.\nAnd while adapting your lifestyle to accommodate stress incontinence is difficult enough, perhaps more significant is the mental and emotional toll it places on you. To try and contain embarrassing accidents, many men take to wearing absorbent pads or pants but struggle with the feeling of a loss of dignity. For others, the constant nagging worry of being 'found out' coupled with the fear that an embarrassing accident could happen at any moment leads them to withdraw socially and slip into depression.\nOf course, the consequences of erectile dysfunction can be equally as harsh to bear. Inability to get or maintain an erection can destroy your sex life, put a serious strain on your relationship or marriage, make it difficult (or impossible) to get your partner pregnant, and lead to feelings of embarrassment, inadequacy, and low self-esteem.\nBut, the good news is that even though both of these common side effects of prostate treatments can cause a huge impact on your quality of life, it is possible to manage them effectively...and do it entirely without invasive surgery or expensive drugs.\nSo, in this eBook, we're going to be looking at a safe, effective, natural, and pain-free way that you can regain control of your bladder, your sex life, and your confidence.\nIntroducing the Contone Method™ The Contone Method™ is an in-depth pelvic floor exercise system created by a certified osteopath and APPI-trained Pilates instructor that teaches you:\n• How to identify your pelvic floor muscles.\n• How to perform pelvic floor exercises correctly so that you can be sure you're strengthening the correct muscles instead of wasting your time.\n• A simple pelvic floor exercise routine that's easy to follow, easy to remember, and gets results in just five minutes a day.\n• Why you mustn't overtrain your pelvic floor muscles (and how you can make sure you avoid overtraining).\n• How to use an innovative new pelvic floor exercise called hypopressives to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, take pressure off of your pelvic organs and structures, and retrain your deep abdominal musculature.\n• ...and more.\n\n\n1.

      "description": "Yamamoto New Scalp Acupuncture (YNSA) is invented by Japanese physician, Dr. Toshikatsu Yamamoto. It was published in 1973. The treatment is different with traditional Chinese medicine. Rather than points in traditional Chinese medicine, there are somatotopes in YNSA. The physician uses these somatotopes on the head and body to treat patients.\nYNSA is that stimulate points on the head and body by needle. This therapy is very effective in neurologic disease, and pain control.\nYNSA has rare pain when treating, without soreness and numbness, so it is suitable for women and kids.\nThe feature of YNSA: convenience, less pain, Fast outcome, and low price.\nConvenience: We treat patients on the head, without taking off clothes. It is very convenient for women.\nWithout pain: The acupuncture needle is thin, only 0.24mm, so the pain is lesser.\nFast outcome: Pain and discomfort will relieve soon after treatment.\nLow price: Fewer needle than Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, and the cost is lower.\n\n\nThe medium seminar includes Y points and neck diagnosis.\nY points can alleviate the syndrome of internal medicine disease, such as chest pain, palpitation, or headache.\nNeck diagnosis can help you to find out the positive reaction of Y points.\nAfter finished this seminar, you can relieve the discomfort below:\nDigestive system: diarrhea and constipation.\nRespiratory System and cardiac system: chest pain and arrhythmia.\nUrinary system: Frequent urine.\nNeurologic disease: Trigeminal neuralgia, stroke rehabilitation, Bell's palsy, and kinetic disorders.",

      "description": "Receiving a diagnosis of autism, whether for yourself or your child is often a shock. This then leads to a need to know more about the condition. Sometimes the information available can be a bit matter of fact and make it hard to understand exactly how it feels to be on the autistic spectrum.\nThis course is a combination of an introduction to autism and ASD and various essays that I have written over the years. I feel that the one supports the other. It gives a good overview of the subject whilst also providing information of specific experiences and challenges of those on the spectrum and giving a feel for the condition.\nCompleting this course will give you facts and information to help understand the subject along with an insight about how autism and Asperger Syndrome actually impact people's lives. In addition there are loads of references which will provide a good starting point for researching the subject further.\nAbout me\nMy first knowledge of Asperger Syndrome was when I took my son for his 3 year check up. It was this introduction to the subject that lead me to understand the numerous problems that my family and I have gone through over the years. It has lead to an amazing amount of self understanding and enlightenment. Since then I have read extensively and completed a degree level course on the subject.",

      "description": "YOUR Empowered Pregnancy & Birth!\nLearn how to support your mind and body during pregnancy with yoga, exercise, breathing exercises, and guided meditation. Special addition~ 2 BONUS sections for YOUR Birth Prep and Postpartum Recovery!\nThis course is divided into four sections, one for each trimester of pregnancy, and the fourth section is dedicated to preparing your mind and body for a smooth labor and delivery.\nIn YOUR 1st Trimester practice, we will focus on training areas of the body that are most affected in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Our focus will be:\n\n\nDiscussion- In this interactive lecture I will break down your bodily changes in your 1st trimester and talk about how your fluctuating hormones are impacting your mood and the way you feel.\nExercise- We will work on establishing good squat and hip hinge form, connecting to your pelvic floor, strength, and conditioning for your hips and legs as well as hip mobility and ROM.\nYoga- A foundational, prenatal yoga class that helps you work on reducing fatigue, morning sick, and other general 1st trimester ailments. At the end of the yoga class, I will lead you through a relaxing guided meditation.\nMindfulness Practices- 360 Breath Practice and Pelvic Clock Exercise for pelvic floor connection.\n\n\nThe 2nd-trimester practice will focus on taking full advantage of the 2nd-trimester energy surge that many pregnant folks tend to experience by working on strengthening our core system and preparing it for the significant body changes in the last stretch of our pregnancy.\n\n\nDiscussion- We will dive into how your body and your baby are changing and growing in this trimester. In the lecture portion, you will see slides that show you how your baby is progressing and what physical changes your body may be experiencing.\nExercise- This is my favorite exercise portion to teach because we break down stereotypes of core training during pregnancy and really begin to train your \"Core 4\" muscles. We'll have a big focus on breath work in this section and how important it is for your core function.\nYoga- This is a fun yoga flow practice that is more powerful and playful than your typical prenatal yoga class. We will flow from traditional prenatal yoga movements into some somatic experiences to help fortify your nervous system and reduce stress hormones.\nMindfulness Practices- Guided Meditation Practice\n\n\nIn the 3rd trimester practice, we will be integrating the things we learned in our first 2 trimesters to help us maximize our exercise and yoga practices to stay feeling healthy and minimize the common pregnancy ailments that usually accompany this phase.\n\n\nDiscussion- In the lecture portion, we will explore the changes in your final trimester of pregnancy and build upon the foundations we created in the first two trimesters.\nExercise- This practice has exercise that focus on upper body strength and continuing to hone our core connection skills as our body prepares to use those muscles and stamina for birth.\nYoga- Our 3rd trimester yoga practice is a restorative practice that has a \"Chair Yoga\" warmup that is accessible to most folks.\nMindfulness Practices- We will explore \"Tapping\" for pregnancy and Somatic Movements, both to de-stress and regulate our nervous system.\n\n\nIn the 4th, BONUS section of this course, we will learn how to use our exercise and breath practices to have a strong, empowered and fear FREE birth. This section is great to practice with your birth partner so they can help you navigate your labor on the big day.\n\n\nDiscussion- We will talk about what you can expect during labor and delivery and how you (and your birth partner) can incorporate some tools to cope with labor.\nYoga Postures and Partner Movements for a smoother birth process.\nBreath Exercises- Your Birth Prep Breathing Exercise will help you navigate each phase of labor with mindfulness and ease.\nBirth Prep Mantras- You will receive a printed resource of some of my favorite birth prep mantras.\n\n\n5.  The Postpartum Recovery unit focuses on your early postpartum healing phase, or, the first 6 weeks after your birthing day.\nTreat this course like a growing process, try not to skip ahead to the next section until you have completed the first one. Even if you join us in your second or third trimester, I recommend going through the 1st (and 2nd) to fully understand how your body is changing along the way. It will help you adapt your mindset and movement to facilitate these changes.",

I explain the practical problems we face in everyday restorations, which leads to the formation of each protocol and the materials used. My goal is after you have taken this series is for you to have predictable results in everyday practice. That is why i included in my videos both basic and difficult cases. Ranging from class I restorations, deep margin elevation, class 5 restorations to restorations in adjacent teeth. That way you can gain confidence in handling cases that might have troubled you before. The solution to each clinical problem we face is a protocol taking into consideration the different circumstances. For me a protocol means a route to repeatable, safe and effective results, so that i can anticipate the instruments, the materials and the time i will need for each case. Don't forget that after practice, working times are reduced. I will share many tips and tricks to address many of these problems. Also, i chose videos that i use simple instruments and not intricate or expensive ones, so that these protocols can be applied by more practitioners. I hope you enjoy it and i am open to suggestions for other topics or questions that you might have. Please feel free to contact me for anything that you might want.",

Are we breathing in a way that helps us relax and boosts our concentration? Are we increasing our breathing capacity? This course will teach you how to breathe right, how to breath with the maximum efficiency, how to better relax and concentrate with breathing, and how to increase your breathing capacity. This course will also teach you several breathing techniques and how to breathe right while walking, sitting, standing, waiting, running and meditating. It will teach you pranayama and how to use a neti pot.\nThis course is based upon my book on breathing, titled, \"Breathing to Heal.\" A free copy of this book is included with the purchase of this course!  And the author of this book has personally narrated all of this course! (No robots)\nAfter the introduction video, the first lesson will be about the physiology of the lungs and airways, and how our bodies consume oxygen and expel carbon dioxide and waste matter. This will show how the lungs work, how the sinuses work too.\nThe third video is about the stuff we breathe. This defines what good healthy air is, and the various forms of pollution that we breathe in outside, inside and at our workplaces. This also gives numerous tips on how to keep our air cleaner.\nThe fourth video is about some of the health conditions that can interfere with breathing, including asthma, allergies and sinusitis.\nThen we explore several breathing techniques and what each are good for.

It also discusses breathing while we sleep and sleeping and sitting postures that help maintain healthy breathing. This section also covers pranayama and Dr. Andrew Weil's 4-7-8 breathing method.\nThe sixth video shows you how to increase your lung capacity. Increasing breathing capacity is important to athletes and anyone who wants to be healthier.

      "description": "Discover the soothing, holistic benefits of Hopi Ear Candling in this comprehensive self-guided course. Rooted in ancient Egyptian, Roman, and Greek practices, Hopi ear candling, also known as ear coning or thermo-auricular therapy, is a gentle, non-invasive treatment that uses hollow, lighted candles applied to the ears to promote relaxation and well-being. While it does not remove earwax directly, it helps to soften blocked wax, supporting the body's natural expulsion process.\nIn this course, you will learn not only the traditional technique of Hopi ear candling but also how to integrate a calming facial procedure to enhance lymphatic drainage, reduce puffiness, and promote a sense of deep relaxation.\nWhat You’ll Learn:\nIntroduction to Your Training Provider: Meet your instructor and understand the course structure.\nProfessional Standards: Learn about safe, ethical, and hygienic treatment practices.\nAnatomy and Physiology: Explore the structure of the ear and the effects of ear candling.\nMassage Techniques: Discover facial massage methods for lymphatic drainage and skin rejuvenation.\nMassage Mediums: Understand which oils and products are best for facial treatments.\nHistory of Therapy: Learn about the rich history and modern interpretation of Hopi ear candling.\nEquipment and Treatment Area: Set up a safe and comfortable environment for treatments.\nHealth, Safety, and Consultation: Prioritize client safety and fire precautions.\nDemonstration of Therapy: Follow step-by-step video lessons for practical guidance.\nCase Studies and Practice: Complete six case studies to gain hands-on experience and apply your learning.\nCase Study Requirement:\nTo receive an optional professional qualification, you must complete 6 case studies—one treatment per week for six consecutive weeks with different clients. After documenting your results, submit your case studies for review.\nOptional Professional Qualification:\nFor those who wish to pursue a professional qualification, you can apply for an optional certificate after completing the required case studies. This additional certificate can support your ability to access professional insurance and membership organizations, which may be required for commercial practice. Please note, an additional fee applies for this certification, which is separate from the Udemy Certificate of Completion. This professional qualification demonstrates your proficiency and readiness to practice in a professional setting.\nWhy Take This Course?\nLearn from a seasoned professional with years of experience.\nAccess a wealth of resources, including video demonstrations and written materials.\nDevelop your skills in a natural, holistic therapy to enhance well-being.\nPractice and share the therapy with family, friends, or clients.\nThis course is suitable for anyone wanting to complement in-person training or expand their therapy knowledge.\nCertification:\nUpon course completion, you will receive a Udemy Certificate of Completion. This certificate is for personal enrichment and does not qualify you as a licensed practitioner.\nFor those wishing to pursue a professional qualification, an optional certificate from the course provider is available after completion of case studies. Please note, this certificate is separate from the Udemy certificate and requires an additional fee.\nCourse Format and Expectations:\nThis is a self-paced, online course, ideal for independent learners worldwide.\nVideo lessons, demonstrations, and written materials are provided to guide you through the course.\nStudents are encouraged to engage in the student area for support and discussion.\nThe course typically takes about 5 months to complete, depending on your pace and case study progress.\nImportant Notes:\nHealth and Safety: Hopi ear candling involves a lighted flame, so extra caution is essential.\nMedical Device: Ear candles are a complementary wellness tool, not a medical treatment. Ensure you adhere to regional regulations.\nProfessional Qualification: The course provides foundational knowledge for personal use and private practice but does not replace formal training or licensing.\nAre you ready to explore the relaxing, holistic benefits of Hopi Ear Candling and share it with others? Enrol today to begin your journey into the ancient art of natural ear therapy!",

There is a millennia-old tradition of people using their own hands to alleviate mental, emotional, and bodily discomforts. We hold our wrist and we feel relaxed. When we are uncertain, we fold our arms in front of the body. These are not just personal quirks or cultural accidents - it is a genetic memory of long-forgotten knowledge on how we can help ourselves through our hands.\nIn this class, I will introduce you to the principles of an ancient healing art that helps us release tension and boosts our innate healing abilities. It is powerful, it is versatile, it comes with no side effects or contraindications, it can be practiced together with any other modality including conventional medicine, and above else – it requires only our two hands and nothing else.",

      "description": "This course is very special, it provides a combination of medical terminology and anatomy. It links them together with visuals to make them easily grasped and remembered. It is divided into two sections. The first section, on one hand, features five chapters:\n1. Chapter of a general introduction which lays the foundation for this course. It introduces the different word parts that compose the medical term, which are the word root, affixes (prefixes and suffixes), and the combing vowel. In addition, it highlights the smart dissection technique that unveils the tricks on how to understand medical terms. Finally, this introduction brings to light the singular and plural forms of medical terminology and how to memorize them.\n2. Chapter of suffixes which includes all the types of suffixes.\n3. Chapter of prefixes which includes all the types of prefixes.\n4. Chapter of anatomical and directional terminology which highlights the body planes, sections, positions, and body surface terms.\n5. Chapter of an overview on the body systems which furnishes the medical terms with their medical contexts.\nOn the other hand, the second section covers thirteen medical specialties. They are dermatology, hematology, orthopedics, gynecology & obstetrics, endocrinology, cardiology, otorhinolaryngology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, neurology, ophthalmology, urology and immunology.\nEach chapter begins with a concise introduction to the medical specialty, and then delineates its relevant medical terms. In other words, it divides the medical specialty into word parts, which are usually body organs, and list their related medical terms with the help of the different medical prefixes and suffixes. In urology, for example, both nephr/ and ren/ are word roots referring to kidney (a body organ). Each word root is highlighted separately, and its medical terms are listed with adding the medical affixes, such as nephr/o/logy, nephr/itis, nephr/otomy, etc.",

My name is Laura Dirtu and I’m a certified fitness trainer based in London. I began my study in 2012. Upon completing the Master Trainer course, I began working at a female-only personal training centre in Sicily, Italy. Soon after, I started studying sports since at University and was continuing working part time as a PT. I have also worked as an intern in a physiotherapy centre , helping women over 40s to recover from injuries.\nAfter my graduation and obtaining my Bachelor of Science degree in Sports Science, I moved to London and from there it all began! After such an amazing response from my clients, I began to build an online course. Now I'm collaborating with MeanMuscles an online muscle building and fitness club to help our clients achieve incredible, life-changing results. Together, we hope to continue bringing life-changing experiences to more and more women around the world! Including YOU!\nHere's a little reality check message from me.\nYou have tried all things possible within your means to lose weight. You must have stopped eating junk food altogether and have been substituting them with all the fresh and natural produce and lean meats based on some nutrition advice be it verified or not.\nBut you still have not seen a good number on the scale. This is simply because everybody is so different. The human body is so complex. Each one of us has a different level of metabolism, set of hormones, underlying health issues that could all play a huge role to determine how much weight you lose.\nSo, seeing noticeable results can take time. You need to keep yourself disciplined, consistent, patient and always maintain a positive mindset.\nAnd now allow me to do my bragging rights about this course!\nN.B. First of all, this is NOT a crash course!\n\n\nLet me quickly introduce you to this fitness innovation, which is now helping as many plus size women as possible to gain back their confidence and trust in themselves through an effective and proven weight loss program that won’t make you starve or create any sort of weird cravings as usual regimes do.\nAfter years in the industry, I’ve worked with the LEAN experts and came up with a method that, once applied, will take your routine further, bringing you results you still can’t imagine. But it supports hundreds of women feeling good in their own skin, and PLEASE don’t take it just as another weight loss course.\n\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE YOUR LIFE\nSimply because it’s much more than a fitness class…\nWhat is now in store for you is the result of deep research and development to create a routine that:\nIs personalized, as everybody has different needs.\nWorks based on your actual physical conditions without over-stressing your body with exercises not made for you.\nCan actually sustain and empower your body without transforming your fitness time into hell on earth.\nBut, above all, it is specifically designed to tone up your body now that you’re on the verge of your 40s, and we both know how important it is to preserve your body health at this point…\nSee, the fact is…\nThe closer you get to your 40s, the more you need to be careful not only to eat healthily. but to exercise too.\nYet you need to keep in mind that your metabolism is not the same anymore; and even if maturity implies many good things - self-acceptance included - there are many aspects on which you just can’t indulge anymore.\nTHIS IS WHY L.E.A.N IS THE FITNESS ROUTINE DEVELOPED TO BOOST YOUR METABOLISM, HELP YOU FIGHT MENOPAUSE, AND REGULARIZE YOUR HORMONES WHILE MAKING YOU LOSE WEIGHT IN 21 DAYS.\nAnd no, this is not an exaggeration. As I mentioned, every woman’s body changes throughout the years, making it easier and easier for extra weight to pile up and in this sense.\nIf you’re used to thinking that it will be enough to cut down some calories and avoid that piece of cake once in a while, then you’d be surprised to learn how hard this same process becomes once you hit the 40s.\nOf course, it’s not only about menopause, even if it’s the bigger cause of hard-to-shed extra weight for most women out there. But as we age, the fibers of our muscles tend to wear out, basically giving us the perception to lose tone and skin elasticity.\nThis factor is also increased if you’ve never been extra active as you were younger, so as a result, you see your body changing, feeling like you can’t do anything to avoid it.\n\n\nL.E.A.N is the system optimized to work on mature bodies, guaranteeing results within 21 days, as every fitness routine you practice will…\nStrengthen your fitness levels without over-stressing and overloading your body, taking you from beginner to advanced progressively and with relevant result\n\nNot starve you with impossible-to-follow regimes, but rather it will give your body the nutrients and elements it needs to feel good and learn how to benefit the most from any kind of food, basically forgetting about the common idea of dieting.\n\nGive you a true well-being sensation since this course is not focused on making you FEEL beautiful. It's designed to make you feel happy and great in your own skin, improving the quality of your life, working on the assets you need the most.\nAll of this in total respect of your natural physiological rhythm, without pushing uselessly harder and therefore avoiding those feelings of inadequacy and frustration that often make you quit. So what exactly does L.E.A.N. stands for?\nL-ifestyle\nE-xercise\nA-ttitude\nN-utrition\nThis is what you’ll actively learn in the next 21 days!\nAs you commit to being part of the LEAN community, you’ll soon understand how important it is to maintain a healthy routine, but the best is…\nYou’ll base yours according to what suits you best to obtain the maximum effect from this journey; you only have to dedicate some time during the week!\nAnd if you’re worried about not having time because of your job or even your kids, well, this is the game-changer. This is a routine designed to F.I.T your schedule, and not the other way around.\nSee, the real fact is that most of us DO NOT NEED ONLY A FITNESS ROUTINE. Most of us need a loyal companion to trust while learning new habits. Most of us need a trustworthy partner to work and obtain results in the long term.\nBECOMING THE BEST VERSION OF THEMSELVES.\nWith L.E.A.N, you won’t enroll in another fitness group that will “amaze” you in front of the mirror…\nBut you’ll join a focused group of like-minded individuals ready to change and get the best out of every single session of learning.\nL-ifestyle: writing a personal journal of good habits you can introduce or enhance to your today’s routine\n\nE-xercise: Shaping each routine to your own rhythm and balance, empowering your body without challenging it over its limits, conquering solid fitness milestones at a sustainable and effective pace\n\nA-ttitude: forget about the quitter mindset you often fall into when it comes to fitness and learn the secret benefits of reinforcing a positive attitude towards yourself and your life\n\nN-utrition: strike the hacks that can completely give you another perspective on your actual nutrition, making you aware and conscious about what you eat, and this means also avoiding useless restrictions, knowing the effect each food has on your body, and therefore balancing it in a bearable routine\n\nSTEP BY STEP, YOU’LL CONQUER THE WAY TOWARDS YOUR BEST SELF\nAs the effects of a positive LEAN routine won’t be visible ONLY on your body. The more you apply a healthy lifestyle, the more you’ll shine daily of your own light.\nThe more you exercise, the less stress you’ll accumulate, becoming less anxious and nervous… cutting off extra cortisol production that can harm your body in the long term.\nThe more you focus on a proactive and positive attitude, the more your life will change accordingly, offering you occasions you still don’t see.\nThe more your nutrition respects your biological clock and real natural needs, the more your body will feel strong and energized.\nAnd you can imagine by yourself what this can mean for life as you know it. Now, there’s another super important thing you need to keep in mind while enrolling in the LEAN project.\n\n\nTHIS IS NOT ABOUT A NUMBER ON THE SCALE.\nBut it’s an actual tool to get back to the inner and real you, full of happiness and purpose.\nEVEN IF YOU’RE CLOSE TO YOUR 40S! Honestly, the 40s are seen today as the worst moment for a woman, as she’s not as young as she used to be and…\n...it’s easy to believe that every moment that matters is behind\n...it’s easy to believe that now you have very little to expect as it feels like there’s nothing more you can do than what you did so far…\n...it’s FRUSTRATING knowing that your body won’t react to your efforts the same way it used to back in the day…\n\n\nAND THE BEST PART IS THAT YOU DO NOT NEED TO SPEND AN ARM AND A LEG TO BUY ANY HOME EQUIPMENT\nAs YOU are the only thing you need to THRIVE AND FLOURISH. Becoming your best version from today to the rest of your life.\nSaying goodbye once and for all to muscle and bone pain related to the normal aging progress, as well as the most common menopause symptoms, giving you the balance and energy you need to crash your daily tasks feeling fully confident about your body. In fact, each training session is propaedeutic to the other and…\nNO, don’t worry if you think you don’t have time.\nYou can follow the training and fit it into your daily schedule, which is better than doing nothing at all.\nNO, don’t worry if you’re not the super sporty kind of person, as the whole program is made to make you master your fitness level according to your real abilities.\nSo, be ready to enter a new fitness dimension, with me by your side taking you to the results you dream of while offering you a fast and effective solution from day one.\nAll you have to do is click the button and enroll today in your LEAN master class fitness program and… watch the rest unfold.\nSee you super soon!\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: How do I know if 21-day L.E.A.N. program is right for me?\nA: Do you want to lose weight, get lean, and increase your cardiovascular fitness? Are you a beginner who needs an expert to walk you through it? Do you want to establish an at-home fitness routine? Are you stuck at home, can’t get to the gym and don’t have any exercise equipment? Are you short on time for exercise and just want something fast and effective?\nIf you answered ‘Yes’ to any of the above, the 21-day L.E.A.N. program is for YOU!\nQ: What is body-weight exercise and what results will I see?\nA: Body-weight training removes the need for equipment by using your own weight as resistance against gravity.\nThe program is designed to help you lose weight, get lean and boost your cardio fitness. You will also see improvements in your functional strength, endurance, flexibility, and coordination.\nQ: What do I need to do to prepare?\nA: The only equipment you need is you.\nThat’s right, no dumbbells, no resistance bands – just your body and a can-do attitude!\nWhat about your workout space? So as long as you have enough room to fully extend your body, you can train anywhere: your living room, courtyard, the park, garage and etc.\nQ: I’m really sore from my workouts, what should I do? Is it okay to skip a workout?\nA: Muscle soreness is definitely something you may experience after a great workout. Some things you can do to help support your recovery include:\n• Low-intensity cardio such as a walk or easy jog\n• Foam rolling\n• Stretching\nIf you’re so sore you feel like you can’t even walk or move, try rearranging the workouts for the rest of the week so that you have another day off before you work the sore body part again.\nQ: The workouts are too long for the amount of time I have. Can I shorten them?\nA: Definitely! Shortening the workout is definitely better than skipping it or feeling frustrated and quitting. All you need to do is do one less set than the workout calls for in each exercise. If the workout is set as 4 sets of 12 reps, feel free to do 3 sets of 12 reps of each exercise if needed. Simple as that!\nQ: I’m not sore anymore! Is this bad?\nA: Being sore can be a good indicator of how hard you pushed yourself, but if you’re not sore, that doesn’t necessarily mean your workout was unsuccessful. The body is incredibly efficient at adapting, so just because you don’t feel sore doesn’t necessarily mean your workout was bad! The most important factor is to make sure you are giving each and every workout everything you have!\nQ: Can I still do this program if I don’t want to lose weight? I’m more interested in shaping my muscles and building my fitness level. Is this the right fit for me?\nA: Yes! The only modification you’ll make is that you won’t drop the calories if you don’t lose weight. You’ll keep them at the starting calories. If you do lose weight and don’t want to, you’ll actually want to slowly increase calories until you find a place where you feel great and are maintaining your body weight. Try adding about 50-100 calories every week or so until you find your maintenance level.\nQ: I have both back and knee pain, is this program right for me?\nA: This program will help you to strengthen you back and stomach. They help support your spine, relieving back pain. It will also help you to strengthen your leg muscles and help prevent injury and keep the legs strong. Stretching will also help keep the muscles flexible, which can prevent or alleviate knee pain.\nQ: Can I still do this program if I'm on menopause?\nA: Yes!\nYou might be more stress-sensitive (as we know, there is a decline in the ovarian production of oestrogen and progesterone, which act as ‘controls’ for cortisol and insulin) and as such, we have factored this in our workout program.\nTherefore, shorter intense bursts of exercise will be more beneficial; strength training, high-intensity interval training and limiting your workouts to no more than 45-60 minutes.\nAlso, we highly recommend including relaxing activities such as walking, yoga and different types of massage.\nQ: Do I need to eat before working out?\nA: It’s ALWAYS best to eat before working out, but it can be difficult to do if you work out very early in the morning or simply prefer to exercise on an empty stomach. If you find that doesn’t work for you, working out on an empty stomach is OK. Just be sure you stay hydrated.\nQ: This course comes with a nutrition recipe eBook guide. How do I use it?\nA: It’s very simple. Eat these suggested recipes for your breakfast, lunch and dinner as you work out through your 21 days. Never mind even if you are not a good cook or a total stranger in the kitchen. The recipes are very easy to cook. Just follow the instructions and enjoy your meals!\nQ: What happens after 21 days? Do I need to carry on with all the suggested workouts?\nA: After 21 days, you are in a much better shape and form and have created yourself a great platform to do everything that you couldn't before you embarked on this weight loss program. This is all your hard work. You wouldn't want to lose it!\nIf you want to lose more weight, than you may carry on with this program starting from Day 1. Follow the order of the workouts exactly. Do your 10,000 steps or more on your alternate rest days and eat the recommended recipes for your nutrition.\nIf you are very satisfied with your results after 21 days, and wish to maintain it, then you can do your own workouts whichever you find that suits you. Use the exercises and techniques you learnt from this course and execute them properly. Do regular walking and eat healthily. Moderation in whatever you eat is key.\nQ: Is this another crash course? 3 weeks sounds too short to lose any considerable weight.\nA: No. This is not a crash course. The structure of this course is created in a strategic way for you to lose weight fast. The meal plan that comes with this course helps you to lose weight faster. I also need to highlight that the end result highly depends on the individual's efforts too. You need to stay positive, disciplined and avoid any form of distractions.\nQ: I've gone through a 2-month weight loss regime before and did not really see much of a satisfactory result. What can I achieve in just 3 weeks?\nA: You need to trace back what you have been doing is not so right. There are many factors to look at for your unsatisfactory results. These are just a few I can point out.\nYou may be eating the wrong foods\nYou may not be getting sufficient sleep\nYou may be still under some stress\nThe exercises themselves may not be suitable for weight loss\nPoor execution of the exercises\nMisinformation\nThe list can just go on. If you can resonate with any of these points mentioned, then you are susceptible to poor results. That's why I've come up with a great 21 days framework for an effective weight loss routine. Here I introduce the right workouts to do in a certain order and with proper execution. Including the proper nutrition plan too! That makes a whole lot of difference!\n\n\nResults Disclaimers\n1.

      "description": "Reflexology is an ancient healing method opening its way through various healthcare centers worldwide. Reflexology clients are “patients” seeking ancient healing practices like reflexology. They know that these natural healing modalities are very harmless and effective.\nThe sense of well-being is the best offer of these modalities. Reflexology has countless benefits and is an excellent part of services in many beauty/relaxing centers and clinics. However, it seems crucial for reflexologists to know about its contraindications and precautions. Why? Because as we mentioned, the majority of reflexology clients are among patients; they have their prescriptions and instructions from their doctors. Therefore, reflexologists must know when to refer their clients to a doctor for advice before or after their reflexology practice.\nToday's reflexologists must be able to work in advanced health/medical settings. They must know how to communicate with other healthcare professionals to offer their clients safer and more effective reflexology practices.\nIn both title and content, this unique course will illuminate a safe and professional reflexology practice that benefits many clients and patients today. Reflexologists can use it as a heads-up to the new world of reflexology, which is believed to help cure many illnesses. It is 2025! People, including clients and patients, are more specific in their questions; the old answers do not satisfy them. Suppose you want to work as a manual therapist in a more professional environment. In that case, you need to address peoples` needs, never as a medical doctor, but as a holistic practitioner who manages clients. This course equips you with the adaptability to meet these changing needs.",

As a reflexologist, knowing about various diseases and their general conditions is vital. While it is not within the scope of a reflexologist to diagnose or prescribe medication, they should be able to provide patients with information on how reflexology can help their ailments and when it may not be suitable. It is also essential to advise patients to consult with a licensed healthcare practitioner in the case of an emergency. This course provides a comprehensive guide on addressing patients who seek reflexology for medical conditions. It emphasizes the importance of addressing emergencies first, determining the best time for treatment, and providing patients with answers to their general questions. It also highlights the need to consider any precautions or contraindications, especially in surgery or other medical procedures. If you want to advance your career and work in settings such as clinics or hospitals, this course can equip you with the essential knowledge to succeed.",
        "Reflexologists and massage therapists who intend to improve their practical knowledge, skill, and consultation capabilities in higher-level healthcare workplaces. It helps them work with other healthcare professionals, share information, and manage more patients.",
        "All manual therapists need to know when is the best time to ask vital questions of their clients, evaluate their primary needs, and, if needed, refer them to their doctors before even touching their bodies. It results in safer and more professional practice.",
        "What is essential in this course is that all the contraindications/precautions are presented in case scenarios, which are more \"touchable\" for learners; instead of just explaining the theories, real people with related problems are discussed to make it easier to discuss."

      "description": "The \"Basics of Sensory Integration\" course is meticulously designed to equip participants with an in-depth understanding of sensory integration theory, its practical applications, and its crucial significance across various settings. Sensory integration is a complex neurological process in which the brain organizes and interprets sensory information from the environment. This process enables individuals to effectively interact with their surroundings, perform daily activities efficiently, and engage meaningfully in social, occupational, and recreational pursuits.\n\n\nThroughout this comprehensive course, participants will explore the foundational principles of sensory integration, gaining insights into how the brain processes sensory inputs from different modalities such as touch, sound, sight, smell, taste, and proprioception. The curriculum is structured to offer a thorough understanding of how these sensory systems work in concert to form a cohesive perception of the world, facilitating smooth and adaptive responses to various stimuli.\n\n\nThe course will cover a range of topics, including the identification and assessment of sensory processing disorders, which occur when the brain has difficulty organizing and responding to sensory information. Participants will learn to recognize the signs and symptoms of these disorders, which can manifest as hyper-sensitivity or hypo-sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and may impact daily functioning and behavior.\n\n\nIn addition to theoretical knowledge, the course will emphasize practical strategies for addressing sensory processing difficulties. Participants will be introduced to a variety of intervention techniques and therapeutic approaches designed to enhance sensory integration. These interventions may include sensory diets, environmental modifications, and specific activities tailored to improve sensory processing and integration.\n\n\nThe course will also highlight the significance of sensory integration in diverse contexts, such as educational settings, clinical environments, and home-based care. By understanding the pivotal role of sensory integration in learning, behavior, and emotional regulation, participants will be better equipped to support individuals with sensory processing challenges, fostering their ability to engage fully in life's activities.\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, participants will have a robust knowledge base and practical skill set to identify sensory integration issues and implement effective interventions. They will be prepared to make a positive impact on the lives of individuals struggling with sensory processing difficulties, enabling them to achieve greater success and fulfillment in their daily activities and interactions.",

Foot massage is beneficial to both physical and mental health. Here is a list of the most important benefits of foot massage:\nPain Relief:\nFoot massage is one of the most common alternative treatments to relieve pain. A study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of foot reflexology on fatigue, pain, and sleep has revealed that foot reflexology is a very useful nursing intervention that relieves fatigue and promotes good sleep. Foot massages coupled with regular foot exercises can cure chronic heel pain.\nAllays Back Pain:\nFoot health and posture have been proven to be associated with back pain. The edge of the foot has pain-points that are associated with back pain. While massaging these points the pain and stiffness in the spineare relieved There exists a spine line between the big toe and the heel of the foot. Massaging this line from the front to the back of the toe by applying pressure can be very effective in back pain relief. A study conducted by the Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research has revealed that the nurses who suffered from a backache greatly benefited from a foot massage.\nImproves Blood Circulation & Lowers Blood Pressure:\nSedentary lifestyle might make one unaccustomed to using feet muscles regularly andthey hardly get any kind of exercise. Foot massages stimulate nerve functions, eiminate toxins and improve circulation. A study conducted among dementia patients revealed that foot massage reduced blood pressure, improved their moods and lessened their anxiety levels.\nReduces Symptoms of Certain Ailments:\nVarious studies have reported a correlation between foot reflexology and improvement in symptoms of certain ailments such as cancer, symptomatic idiopathic detrusor over-activity, diabetes, sleep disorders, multiple sclerosis, migraine, depression, and dementia. Therapeutic massage reduces symptoms, improves symptom control and promotes general wellness. A foot massage also helps alleviate symptoms of pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) such as irritability, mood swings, headaches, anxiety, insomnia, unhappiness, and fatigue. Likewise, it can also minimize symptoms of menopause.\nPrevents Injuries of Foot & Ankle:\nMassaging feet can help recover from an injury and reduce soreness of foot muscles. When combined with strengthening exercises, it can help prevent future injuries.\nReduces Anxiety and Depression:\nA foot massage goes beyond just putting you in a relaxed state during the process. Frequent sessions of foot massage significantly reduce anxiety and depression.\nFoot massage is a time-honored therapeutic practice that has been cherished for thousands of years for its ability to alleviate pain, reduce stress, and promote relaxation. The origins of foot massage can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt, China, and India, where it was viewed not just as a form of relaxation, but as a critical component of holistic healing. In ancient Egypt, for example, both royal figures and commoners alike enjoyed foot massages for their health benefits, with records showing that the art of foot massage was practiced for improving circulation, soothing sore muscles, and calming the nervous system. Similarly, ancient Chinese medicine developed the concept of reflexology, a technique that involves applying pressure to specific points on the feet that correspond to other parts of the body. This practice was grounded in the belief that stimulating these reflex points could promote health and balance throughout the entire body. In India, Ayurvedic medicine has long recognized the therapeutic power of foot massage as part of its holistic approach to health, using it to harmonize the body’s energy, improve circulation, and promote overall well-being.\nIn the modern era, foot massage has become a cornerstone of spa therapies, wellness centers, and professional massage practices. Foot massage therapy has grown in popularity due to its profound benefits, which extend beyond simply soothing tired feet. It has been recognized for its ability to improve circulation, reduce stress and anxiety, alleviate pain, and improve sleep quality. A well-performed foot massage can stimulate the relaxation response in the body, helping to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for calming the body and reducing stress. The act of massaging the feet also encourages blood flow, which is particularly beneficial for individuals who suffer from poor circulation, swelling, or conditions such as plantar fasciitis. Additionally, many people find that foot massage helps relieve tension in the feet and lower legs, easing discomfort from long periods of standing, walking, or exercise.\nOne of the most significant benefits of foot massage is its effect on the nervous system. The feet are home to a network of nerve endings, and massaging them can stimulate these nerves, sending signals throughout the body to promote relaxation and balance. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who experience high levels of stress, anxiety, or fatigue. Foot massage has been shown to help lower heart rates and reduce the production of stress hormones like cortisol, leading to a greater sense of calm and relaxation. Additionally, because the feet are rich in reflex points, foot massage can have a far-reaching impact on the body. By focusing on specific areas of the feet, a skilled therapist can target organs and systems in the body, promoting overall health. This technique, known as reflexology, is an integral aspect of foot massage therapy that helps address everything from digestive issues to headaches and muscular pain.\nWhat you’ll learn\nComplete Massage Techniques For Beginner/Advanced Students\nEasy To Follow Massage Techniques\nYou will learn the techniques to give an incredible foot massage that your partner, family or massage client will absolutely love\nThe Benefits Of Foot Massage\nEliminates Muscular Pain and Contraction Through Massage\nIn this course, you will learn the fundamentals of foot massage therapy, including the most effective techniques to relieve tension and promote relaxation\nFoot massage is also increasingly used as a form of self-care. In today's fast-paced world, people are often seeking natural ways to unwind and manage their physical and emotional health. Learning how to perform foot massage on oneself or others can be a powerful tool for relaxation and stress relief. Regular foot massages can help improve mood, enhance mental clarity, and even boost energy levels by encouraging the release of endorphins, the body’s natural feel-good chemicals. As a form of self-care, foot massage offers a convenient, accessible way for individuals to take charge of their well-being, whether as a routine relaxation practice at home or as a means of addressing specific physical discomforts. Many people who suffer from chronic pain conditions such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, or plantar fasciitis turn to foot massage as a natural and non-invasive way to manage their symptoms.\nThe use of foot massage in the modern wellness industry has become a global trend, with foot massage therapy being offered in spas, wellness centers, and chiropractic offices as a complementary therapy for relaxation and healing. Many massage therapists incorporate foot massage techniques into their treatments, recognizing the benefits of stimulating the feet as part of a full-body massage or as a standalone treatment. In addition to its therapeutic applications, foot massage is also used in some medical and rehabilitation settings to aid in recovery and rehabilitation after surgery or injury. For example, after foot or ankle surgery, gentle foot massage can promote healing by improving blood flow to the affected area, reducing swelling, and alleviating discomfort. Furthermore, reflexology and foot massage are often used in palliative care and hospice settings, providing comfort and relaxation to individuals facing terminal illness or chronic conditions.\nThe growing popularity of foot massage can also be attributed to its relatively low cost and accessibility. Unlike more complex forms of bodywork or massage, foot massage requires minimal equipment and can be easily performed at home, in the office, or even while traveling. With the rise of at-home wellness practices and a focus on self-care, people are increasingly recognizing the value of learning how to perform foot massage techniques on themselves or their loved ones. It’s a practice that fits seamlessly into a daily routine, whether it's a quick evening ritual to unwind after a long day or a weekly self-care treatment to enhance relaxation and overall health.\nWho this course is for:\nMassage Therapists\nHair Stylists\nBarbers\nYoga Teachers\nAyurvedic Practitioners\nHerbalists\nMassage Loving Humans\nThis course is perfect for those looking to become professional foot massage therapists or expand their existing skillset with specialized foot massage techniques\n. Individuals experiencing foot pain, stress, or circulation issues, or those simply looking for a natural way to improve overall well-being, can benefit from learning foot massage techniques\nIn conclusion, foot massage therapy is a powerful and accessible tool for promoting relaxation, relieving pain, and improving overall health. With its rich history spanning multiple cultures and its growing popularity in modern wellness practices, foot massage continues to offer a wide range of benefits for those seeking a natural and effective way to improve their physical and emotional well-being. Whether used in professional therapeutic settings or as part of a personal wellness routine, foot massage remains a timeless and invaluable practice for nurturing the body and mind.",

      "description": "Do you have numerous tender points (especially between the shoulder blades), sore muscles, sore fascia and connective tissue, crazy headaches (or even migraines), and areas of skin that have slowly become supersensitive and very painful?\nYou might have a crazy build-up of copper or copper toxicity. Your body will replace a zinc deficiency with copper (they are besides each other on the periodic table of elements so easy for your body to confuse the two) and that spells trouble, trouble like all the above symptoms. These are actually also classic symptoms of the diagnosis known as fibromyalgia.\nNaturopaths first discovered or determined that fibro pain could be caused by a copper toxicity. They also figured out to give molybdenum to help,bring down the level but did not seem to know why it worked (let me tell you here — molybdenum helps the copper metallothionein form molybdopterin which is critical to the function of the metallothionein in removing the copper).\nSo you ask — what is a metallothionein and why is it important? We have 23 known metallothioneins in our body, apparently one designed for each metal including copper — these make sure the particular metal, for which they were designed, goes to the right spot in the body where it is needed. Aftermuch study and research I assumed that this was where the dysfunction occurred in fibro patients, probably secondary to,some genetic issue or SNP (since fibromyalgia does tend to run in families).\nThe results of our 43 patient study were stunning so now we are planning a bigger study for JAMA. We are not joking around here —this really worked. First, all the patients in the study had diagnosed fibromyalgia, some severe, and secondly and more notably they all had abnormally high levels of serum copper (when we calculated their levels using a formula called the NCC). Third, many had copper deficiencies on an intracellular basis (using an FDA and HHS approved and validated lab technology called Spectracell Micronutrient Panel). Fourth, when we shotgun treated them with seven supplements (purchased off Amazon so nothing special) that were known to be critical to the function of the copper metallothionein, they all got much better — as a matter of fact most of their symptoms resolved completely. Notably (again) their intracellular copper deficiencies resolved (this should happen if the copper metallothionein). My friends in the pain management world went crazy. I’ve also had the opportunity to speak about this all over the world, mostly to physicians (and oddly gotten more than one standing ovation— unusual I think). We also combined the seven supplements into one. Easier and cheaper.\nI’ve also discovered several more things about fibro. Avoid high cooper foods such as almonds, spinach, kale, cashews, shellfish, dark chocolate, avocados, and check peas — and I am very serious about this and you should be too. Second, take your metallothionein supplement, and take more if your symptoms don’t resolve or come roaring back. Glutathione is CRITICAL to metallothionein function so take it too —and there is only one validated working reduced glutathione on the market and it is ours — we developed it for the study because none others in the market actually worked (we have a patent and $30 million backing it for FDA approval to testify of its efficacy. Start low and go slow — start on a small dose and gradually increase or you’ll dump copper which can be very uncomfortable.\nIf you’ve tried everything (and got the usual poor results), it would not hurt to try our Metallothionein Support along with our VARS Reduced Glutathione to see.

Would you like to learn more about the common causes of behavior problems in senior pets? If the answers are YES, then this is the course for you.\nI will detail the different causes for behavior changes in senior pets, how to diagnose them, and how to treat them.\nBehavior changes can arise out of medical issues (e.g. organ dysfunction), \"Alzheimer's\" like syndrome called cognitive dysfunction syndrome, and many other reasons. Although not many pet owners are aware (and probably not many veterinary professionals), these issues are very common. Beyond a certain age the frequency of these issues rise dramatically.\nEarly intervention is important to slow down or resolve some of these problems so this is a must have knowledge.\nWhat are the treatment options that are available? Behavior modification, environmental management, medications, and food supplements and diets. I will explain more about each of these topics.\nThis is a short course that was originally designed for veterinary students and was presented many times at the university where I'm currently doing my residency. But this course is actually an improved version of the original, with more information and better slides.\nI hope you will enjoy this course as much as I did making it.\n\n\nMusic: \"A New Beginning\" from Bensound",

      "description": "Do you want to learn a method so you will soon start working like an experienced professional?\nA technique that will set you apart from the competition, as you will offer something different and complete to your clients.\nA standard massage technique, which is based on just a handful of rules and principles.\nIn addition to the detailed videos, take advantage of the theoretical material that you will receive in the form of an e-book and avoid the mistakes that are usually made by beginners and experienced therapists who do not offer a service of great value like you will be able to offer.\nHealing Flow Massage is a method that you will find easy to internalize and adopt to your own personality and temperament.\nA few basic rules will set you free and let you design your own pattern of movements, pressures and touches.\nNot everything in life has to be difficult and complicated. Massage is one of them.\nThe purpose of every massage session is either relaxation or therapy or both—relaxation and healing of body and soul.\n\n\nTo achieve this, our technique and our method must be simple but essential.\n\n\n\n\nIn this massage course, you are going to learn:\n• What constitutes a \"perfect session\".\n• The three fundamental, non-negotiable conditions to ensure this ideal session for our clients.\n•What we should take care of and improve in ourselves first.\n• How to set up an excellent atmosphere for your client.\n•Ηow to know if we can take on a client and what to look out for.\n•An easy-to-understand method, with few and effective rules.\n• Τhe basic anatomy that concerns our work as massage therapists.\n• And much, much more! Don't forget, you'll also receive a 55-page eBook!\nWhat pushed me to create something as unique as the Healing Flow massage Course?\nIt is common for programs aimed at beginners to contain a lot of techniques, a lot of knowledge and information. Unfortunately, many times such an overload of information causes confusion during the session, negatively influencing the results.\nMy personal contact with people, who were taught or tried to be taught by such a program, convinced me that one main reason they failed is because of the complexity of such programs. Try such a complicated program yourself, and you will find it very difficult if not impossible for a beginner to master complex techniques, with many rules and multiple specific movement patterns.\nMy own way of working came up naturally, from my interaction with my clients, and from my effort to provide a complete result of relaxation and rest of the body, but also a journey to the soul and mind.\n\n\nThe reactions of my clients during our sessions, but also their feedback after our sessions, have been my primary guide for the development of the Healing Flow Massage Technique. My clients have and continue to trust me with their mental and physical well-being. Who better to inspire and encourage a professional other than his satisfied clients?\nI like to think of the Healing Flow Massage Therapy Technique as a mix of various movements and pressuresin context, a \"choreography” that really achieves its goal.\nIt offers rest while it relaxes and heals soul and body.\nThere is a wide range of massage training programs available. Similarly, there are also a lot of massage therapists. Are they all exquisite? Obviously not.\nPerhaps you too have had a negative experience from a massage session that did not impress you, or even worse, you remember it with displeasure.\nDon't become such a professional. Learn something simple that you can do perfectly and that will offer you excellent results.\nThe surefire way to convince you to follow this tutorial would be for me to offer you a massage session. I am sure that after this, you would have no doubt that this program is right for you.\nObviously, it is almost impossible to offer you a one-on-one session, maybe we are separated by a few thousand kilometers!\nBut I would like to share with you some of my customer reviews on Google. Maybe they mentally convey to you the feeling my clients recorded after our session.\n\n\nWhat my students and my clients say about my work\nTheodora P\n“A fantastic experience in a workshop with a remarkable person and excellent professional therapist with magical hands and deep knowledge of massage and the body.\nMr. Pateras is a giving trainer, having the gift of imparting the information to you, to understand correctly, and he is there every step of the way to make sure that the practice is done correctly.\nUnique and unforgettable experience with a unique therapist and teacher. Thanks!”\n\n\nX-19\n“In addition to his gift as a therapist with deep knowledge of the human body and its needs, he is excellent at imparting knowledge in the workshops he organizes.\nGentle, giving, tireless and on top of each participant constantly to make sure that practices are done correctly and that his students get the most out of his lesson.\nAlso, the massage session with Mr. Pateras is truly an experience that will be unforgettable for anyone who chooses to give themselves this gift.\nHe stands out in the field as a therapist and as a teacher.”\nGiannis Sideras\nFirst let me say that in addition to a very good professional trainer I met a very good person. I attended Mr. George Patera's massage seminar and I can say that it was one of the best experiences I've ever had and he really made me love it. Always correct in his work, contagious and step by step by my side without leaving me. Now it's my job and I thank him for everything.\n\n\nMegan Nugent\n“Incredibly restorative and professional body worker. Gentle adjustments and muscle release. Thank you!”\n\n\nMargarita Mos\n“Honestly 1000% recommended! As someone who gets regular massages, I don’t think I have ever had a massage with his unique technique which was not only unbelievably enjoyable but also left me feeling refreshed and took care of all my body pains. Please try him, you will not regret it!”\n\n\nCharis Charis\n“George is amazing, a combination of practices. I have been doing massage for years. Sports, therapeutic and relaxing. With George I had the combination of everything! I am waiting for the next time!”\n\n\nDimitra Dimitriadou\n“When relaxation becomes therapy, it means you just had an appointment at this address :-) I recommend it in good conscience and unconditionally. This act must be patented. I'm already looking forward to the next appointment”\nAlexandra Anagnostou\n“Unique, real professional masseuse. Amazing experience!”\n\n\nSophia Xanthopoulou\n“Excellent professional. It gives you the feeling of security and that he knows exactly what he is doing. It is not an ordinary type of massage, but a more thorough technique that you do not find in conventional massage and massage institutes. Congratulations.”\n\n\nCharalabos Kalpakidis\nThere are good therapists in every city, and then there is PaterasBodyworks. George Pateras isn't just a therapist; he is a healer. He has mastered numerous techniques of physical therapy through years of training and experience. He offers a clean, modern, and calming environment. He listens AND he hears you when you describe your pain.\nHe works your body. And then he makes your body work.\nExcellent therapist. Excellent human being.\n\n\nAlexandros B\n“A hidden diamond in the city of Kavala. One of the best massages I have ever experienced!”\n\n\nSusanne Grossniklaus\n“While passing through Kavala I was looking for an ergotherapist or chiropractor or massage therapist as I had buttock muscle pain but didn't know if it was related to the hip or if it was a muscular pain. I searched the internet to find someone in Kavala who could help and I came across George Pateras. I got an appointment the next day. Mr. Pateras treated me very professionally and was also very considerate while massaging, even while applying great pressure to the muscle. Mr. George Pateras ishighly professional and I can recommend him unconditionally. He also gave me tips along the way for regular stretching exercises, as I left the city the next day. I felt very well taken care of and treated. Thank you very much!”\n\n\nXrisi Kalopisi\n“Whether you choose the massage for relaxation and relief from daily stress, or for the relief of musculoskeletal pain, Giorgos can really help you and offer you a unique experience. His knowledge, his love, and his many years of experience in the subject are clearly seen in the way he works and cares for his patients. The place is warm and spotlessly clean and the services completely value for money. I believe he offers the best massage in town and I highly recommend him”\n\n\n\n\nWho this course is for:\n· \"Healing Flow Massage\" method is designed for you who want your work to talk about you and your clients about your work soon.\n· Are you new to practicing massage?\n· Do you already practice it but have little experience?\n· Are you a professional and want to learn something new and upgrade your way of working.\n· Massage therapists, Physiotherapists, Personal Trainers, Chiropractors, Spa Therapists and any other body worker.\n“Healing Flow Massage” is designed for you!\n\n\nCertificate of Attendance\nBy completing this course you become eligible to receive a Certificate of Attendance with the quality seal of the IHPM (International Practitioners of Holistic Medicine).",

      "description": "In this online massage course, manual osteopath and registered massage therapist Mike Everson is going to guide you through how to do modern cupping massage. Cupping therapy is an ancient alternative medicine practice that involves placing cups on the skin to create suction. The cups can be made of various materials such as glass, bamboo, plastic and silicone. It's believed to promote healing by increasing blood flow to a specific area of the body and improving the flow of energy.\nIn recent years, cupping has come out of nowhere and exploded to massive popularity worldwide most likely due to professional athletes singing its praises like Michael Phelps, which has thrust it to the forefront for massage therapists, physiotherapists and a variety of health practitioners.\nCupping therapy is often used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, improve blood flow, and promote relaxation. It is commonly used in clinics and spas for conditions such as back pain, neck pain, digestive disorders, and general pain conditions. It is also believed to help with respiratory issues and certain chronic pain conditions.\nYou can study and complete this entire course in the comfort of your own home with lifetime access to the videos in case you need to go back, review and re-inspire yourself!\nIn this course you are going to learn:\n> Cupping techniques for a wide variety of common conditions\n> The theory behind how and why cupping works\n> The different styles and techniques you can use to get the best results\n> Massage techniques that anyone from beginner to pro can learn from to elevate their health and wellness practice\nEnroll now!

      "description": "IF YOU SUFFER WITH INSOMNIA YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE\nWelcome to the Sleep for Life Ultimate Insomnia Treatment created by internationally-renowned sleep therapist and bestselling author, Sasha Stephens.\nYou don't need to go elsewhere, you don't need to look any further. The answers you seek are here. All of them. If you are an insomniac, you spend your days exhausted and miserable. You feel different and alone. I understand this. You may well be dependent on sleeping pills that leave you groggy and unrefreshed. You may have spent hundreds or even thousands on useless insomnia cures and over the counter sleep aids. You may be worried that your problem is getting worse. You may feel you would give anything to get over your problem, that the usual cures for insomnia ‘never seem to work’. I know why that is.\nYour sleeping problems may be affecting your work, your career, your social life and even your relationships. You may spend your days in fear and stress at the thought of the sleep you are going to miss. Your heart may be pounding, right now, at the thought of what tonight will bring. I can take away that fear.\nDo you have these sorts of unwanted thoughts about sleep?\n‘Lack of sleep is ruining my life‘\n‘Sleep aids and sleeping pills don’t work for me’\n‘I’ll never get better’\n’My sleep mechanism is broken’\n‘I’m just a bad sleeper’\n‘My insomnia is incurable’\n‘Can I die of insomnia?’\nThen this course is for you.\nBecause no matter how long you have suffered, IT STOPS HERE!\nIn this course, I’m going to take you back to basics, to the beginning, back to the child inside you that sleeps effortlessly, without thinking or worrying or stressing. I’m offering you an easy to follow, yet powerful system that not only allows you to become a better sleeper, it teaches you to become a great sleeper, rediscovering your innate ability to sleep, normally and naturally.\nI’ll speak to you on a deep emotional level by changing your core beliefs and feelings about sleep.  This results in a transformation that is long lasting.\n\n\nRE-DISCOVERING YOUR NATURAL ABILITY TO SLEEP\nWe are all born with the ability to sleep, without thinking or wondering or stressing. Where does that ability go?  Did we lose it or outgrow it?  Did the stresses of modern life destroy it?\nThe truth is, our ability to sleep never leaves us. It’s always inside, safe and secure. We’re going to rekindle your inborn power to sleep. We will take you back to the child inside you that sleeps perfectly, without thinking, without stressing or wondering.\nLet’s trigger that falling asleep instinct so that it works perfectly every night.\n\n\nTHE COURSE IS DIVIDED INTO SIX MAIN SECTIONS:\n\n1. GETTING STARTED – We start by making the proper preparation for good sleep to enter your life once again. This first lesson will provide an introduction to the course and its philosophy and methodology. I’ll give you an outline of how to get the best out of this course and tell you all about my own history with insomnia, and my incredible recovery. This will reassure you that no matter how bad your problem, you can recover.\n2. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO YOU? – In this section, I’ll show you the mechanics of the problem, why insomnia occurs in the first place, and how it can escalate. I'll explain how we often get it wrong without realising. There are certain actions and activities that will always work to keep insomnia firmly wedged in your life. In this section, we’ll begin shaking loose all these destructive influences, eliminating all those things that keep your insomnia locked into your life. I’ll expose some of the myths you may currently believe about sleep and overcoming insomnia. I'll also explain exactly why nothing seems to work and that sleeping pills, far from helping you to overcome insomnia, often just make the problem worse. And most importantly, I’ll show you how to begin setting things right.\n3. PUTTING THING RIGHT – The course really begins to kick off with this powerful and motivating lesson. I'll explain that good sleep is not something we make happen while lying in bed. You'll learn that rather than focusing on the bad night itself, we should be more concerned with everything that has led up to it. In this way, when bedtime approaches you will be in the perfect state for sleep to occur. Sleep will then happen automatically, naturally, and without having to do anything at all once we get into bed.\n4. THE TWELVE PROMISES – At this stage f the course, your insomnia is already beginning to crumble; its foundations have been weakened and the problem is now on shaky ground. And now, we move onto the real ‘meat’ of the course. In this lesson we begin tackling the sleeping problem head on, with the precise steps necessary to create a new great sleeping habit. Much of this advice will be completely new to you and may even contradict what you have been told in the past. But trust me: follow the easy steps on this lesson and you’ll watch in wonder as insomnia begins to retreat out of your life, allowing deep delicious sleep to re-enter your life.\n5. THE FINAL PIECE IN THE JIGSAW – This super-motivational, confidence-boosting lesson ties everything up together and leaves you feeling empowered and optimistic about the future and your ability to sleep. I’ll tell you where to go from here, what to do when the 30 days is up and finally… I reveal to you the last essential step in total insomnia recovery.\n6. THE SAFETY BLANKET – Deisigned specifically for the bad nights, I have created a series of 5 videos for those who might be feeling panicky or extra low. Each recording provides comfort with just the right words and advice when you need it the most.\n\n\nYou’ll also get…\nBonus 1. A FULL SET OF BRAIN ENTRAINMENT SLEEP TOOLS\nThese audio recordings were specially created for this program using brain entrainment technology. They are designed to guide your brain into just the right state for sleep. They include\nThe Sleep Booster Tool. A powerful SMR recording that has the incredible effect of making it easier to sleep in the future.\nSasha's Sleep Inducer. To guide you all the way down to Delta sleep - the deepest and most refreshing sleep of all\nSasha's Fantastic Stress Reliever. For a relaxing daytime break.\nPlus LOADS more..\nBonus 2. SIX CUTTING-EDGE RELAXATION TECHNIQUES\nRecorded in Sasha’s own voice, you'll find these techniques quite unlike anything you have heard before and they go way beyond the usual breathing or visualisation methods\nBonus 3. THREE FULL-LENGTH PEACEFUL MEDITATION AUDIO TRACKS\nTake a break from the outside world. Just put on your headphones, sit back and let the gentle nature sounds work their magic. Choose from gentle rainfall, ocean sounds or a babbling stream.\n\n\nNote: The techniques, ideas, and opinions here are not intended as a substitute for proper medical advice.

It is my goal to give you the foundation you need to begin to take your health into your own hands.\n\n\nWe will move through three different realms of wellness. First we begin with the physical body and how breath can be used to maximize it’s functioning. We then move into the mental and emotional realm where we often find the root cause to physical ailments. Breath plays a big role in our mental and emotional intelligence. Finally, we touch on connecting to your spirit and intuition. Here, we learn to open up to clarity and guidance.\n\n\nHow do you even begin to take your health into your own hands? By knowing Why AND How.\n\n\nIn this experience we blend the science WITH the mysticism; a modern twist on ancient practices. Our ancestors have used  breath as a guide for millennia and our modern science tells us why we might use one technique over another in a given situation!\n\n\nBoth science and mysticism have their place in teaching us how much power we actually hold over our own well-being!\n\n\nThe lectures will give you the knowledge to feed your brain and the practices will give you the experience to feed your soul. It is only with the combination of knowledge and experience that you achieve wisdom... However that shows up for you.\nThe best way for you to get the most out of this course is to submerse yourself in it until you move all the way through.\nSubmersing yourself is the fastest way to change!",

My name is Crystal Uribe, I am a nurse practitioner currently living in Miami, Florida. I started my nursing career in the emergency department in the South Side of Chicago. The hospital I started in was not a level one trauma center but oftentimes was treated as one. I learned a bulk of my IV skills during these years in the emergency department as I cared for some of the sickest patients in a poor, unserved community. I spent many nights researching about the venous anatomy to help understand how I can improve. I spent the last several years doing travel nursing and continued to perfect my IV skills. I saw there was a huge missing piece in nurses and healthcare professionals never getting an opportunity to learn how to place peripheral IVs. This course is intended to be a guide in how to quickly increase your success during peripheral IV insertion. I discuss: advanced anatomy of the venous system and how you can manipulate it for increased IV success, how hypovolemia, increased age and obesity all impact the veins and how you can best position patients for increased IV success, and how cancer and chemotherapy impacts the veins. We go over case studies together and discuss our answers. This is a course that will help provide you with insight on what changes you can make to help increase your IV success.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer Regarding Medical Advice\nThis Course pro­vides gen­eral infor­ma­tion and dis­cus­sion about peripheral intravenous insertion, general health and related sub­jects.

Don’t worry – we give you the tools, techniques and worksheets you will need to do this if you get stuck!\n\n\nDeveloping an understanding of WHY we as humans do what we do is an essential step in overcoming any patterns of behaviour we want to change.\nThere are LOTS of reasons why we emotionally eat and we have divided these up into three main areas to explore in detail:\nBiological reasons\nPsychological reasons\nEnvironmental reasons.\nOnce we have the facts, our attention turns to how patterns of emotional eating are maintained through an emotional eating cycle. When we see this cycle more clearly we discuss ways you can disrupt the cycle and find other ways to respond to emotions without food.\n\n\nTo do this we need to re-frame emotional eating as our bodies way of communicating an important message. The longer we ignore the message, the longer the emotional eating will continue! We offer you tools to identify emotions you are feeling in the moment and offer suggestions about the hidden messages emotional eating might be trying to give.\n\n\nTime is taken to help you tell the difference between physical and emotional hunger and empower you to eat in line with your bodies cues.\n\n\nFinally, in the last section of the course, we explore a range of ways to cope with emotions WITHOUT using food and discuss ways to take care of your health and wellbeing in ways that really work for you.\n\n\nShort on time to sit and watch a course? Our courses are designed so you can watch them as a video OR listen to them as an audio track.\n\n\nWe have created helpful worksheets that complement the content and will support you in applying the techniques that are discussed.\nIf you purchase this course via Udemy you will have lifetime access!

      "description": "Buccal massage has become very popular thanks to Meghan Markle, the British lady, who made this technique famous all over the world.\nNowadays, every second girl is looking for specialists in buccal massage\nTherefore, those who own this technique have long been a priority for customers.\nThe origins of this procedure begins in France.\nIn post-Soviet countries, speech therapists use this massage when they restore diction in children.\nDentists around the world are increasingly recommending buccal massage specialists to their clients, as spasm in the muscles provokes tooth abrasion, bruxism and poor circulation.\nAs you can see, this procedure is in demand and does not require large investments in devices, products, etc.\n\n\nHaving learned this massage, you will be able to fully receive clients, even without possessing other skills.\nWork for yourself, or in the salon, any manager will be happy with such a specialist.\n\n\nDuring the course you will learn:\nHow to release the tense of the muscles inside in the mouth\nHow to shape the jaw line\nLift the cheekbones by using interoral techniques\nImproving nasolabial fold\nDecreases the eye puffiness and dark circles\n\n\nMassage techniques can be used to replace injection methods of rejuvenation and surgical interventions. Therapy is much safer, rarely provokes complications, if it is carried out by an experienced specialist. The cost of the procedure is much lower than that of surgical and injection methods of rejuvenation. Other positive sides:\n\n\n1 restores the youth of each layer, increases turgor;\n2 strongly affects the blood flow in the dermis and muscles, which contributes to the nutrition of each integument;\n3 stimulates the formation of collagen and elastin fibers;\n4 restores the health of each integument, eliminating the root cause of aging.\nThe technique works even those muscles that are most often left without load. The massage procedure helps to achieve the following effects:\n\n\nstops muscle overstrain;\nstimulates local blood flow;\naccelerates the outflow of venous blood;\nincreases the regenerative function of the dermis;\naligns the face oval;\nremoves small and deep wrinkles, prevents aging;\ntightens the skin;\nreduces the thickness of subcutaneous fat;\nimproves the color of the face, eliminates rashes, redness, gray shades;\nremoves muscle contractures that appeared after a stroke, surgical operations.\nContraindications:\nCongestion,  active acne;\nOpen wounds;\nHigh fever;\nRecent botox or fillers (less then 14 days).",

      "description": "In this massage course, Mike Everson, Manual Osteopath, Registered Massage Therapist and Yoga Teacher is going to guide you through how to deliver visceral abdominal massage. Visceral abdominal massage is traditionally done by osteopaths but can easily be done by any manual therapy practitioner as a way to treat abdominal pain, constipation, back pain, pelvic pain, and much more.\nVisceral abdominal massage is a gentle, hands-on therapy used to help your internal organs (viscera) glide smoothly within your body. Your internal organs are surrounded by connective tissue that holds them in place in the body. Healthy connective tissue should move easily to allow organs to slide on each other when you flex or rotate your torso.\nAdhered or inflamed connective tissue impedes small but significant movements. This creates visceral discomfort and dysfunction which can lead to restricted movement and pain in other parts of the body. Other things like underlying conditions, post-surgical adhesions and infections can also cause abdominal restrictions and referral pain.\nThis course is perfect for therapists looking to have a complete understanding of the human body, knowing how the health of the organs can effect pain all over the body and also how to treat that pain is essential for any manual therapist to know to be as effective and helpful as possible.\nYou can study and complete this entire course in the comfort of your own home with lifetime access to the videos in case you need to go back, review and re-inspire yourself!\nIn this course you are going to learn:\n> How to assess the abdominal area for any restrictions that could be causing issues elsewhere\n> Learn techniques for all the organs including the diaphragm, liver, gallbladder and bladder etc.\n> Become a specialist for people who have pelvic pain, constipation, digestive issues and much more\n> Learn the anatomy and physiology of the organs as it relates to local and global pain within the body\nEnroll now!

      "description": "This course will cover how to microneedle and apply stem cells for hair restoration. Where the candidate is suitable the estimate is a 90% success rate using stem cell PTT-6 technology. I will cover the causes of hair loss, who might be a suitable candidate for this treatment. We will also go into depth of why and how the stem cells stimulate hair growth by elongating the growth cycle.\nThis course covers how to treat with a derma stamp and a microneedling pen but not a derma roller. It is my opinon that a derma roller can be more risky for treatment to the professional and that the channels created are inferior to microneedling. You will need to purchase the stem cells and they will also include sterile wipes and a derma stamp. This is not treating the cause of hairloss rather the symptom. All treatments carried out by you are your responsibility. You must adhere to local laws and regulations and have insurance where applicable. Do an intake form and keep records for up to seven years. Calecium is a bio derived stem cell from placental cord lining from deer - I am an affilate and do receive a referral commission. I do recommend this range because of its efficacy . Not all stem cells are equal and I believe that this is superior to synthetic stem cells or PTT-6.",

This course takes you through protocols meant for individuals with an intermediate to advanced understanding of skincare, for use in professional settings.

There will be links provided for raw material sourcing, though participants are recommended to also do their own research on availability based on their location.\n\n\nThere are two key small-medium scale business models you will be taught, based on Dr.TWL’s expertise as the head of Asia’s first dermatologist-led custom compounding skincare pharmacy. These two models are clinically tested in a dermatology practice with high efficacy and client retention rate. They are selected on the basis of its suitability for small-scale beauty entrepreneurs who may wish to offer a custom skincare service, specialising in cosmeceuticals.\n\n\nCustom Medi-Essence Service\nCreate a cosmeceutical essence customised to your client’s skin type and concern, based on a novel Skin Physiotype Protocol. Unlike traditional skin typing and off-the-shelf product recommendations, this system focuses on building a long term relationship with your client and forms the basis of a sustainable small-medium scale business model that ensures long term client retention in the ultra-competitive skincare industry.\n\n\nSkincare Plus Accelerate Program\nStand out from your competitors by guaranteeing an instant glow-up, with measurable results. Learn to manage client expectations with a solid grounding in skin science and evidence-backed skincare technologies. Offer outstanding service, establishing yourself as the go-to skin expert in your region. The program includes strategies on upselling high-yield skincare devices backed by the latest advancements in aesthetic medicine. The program is designed to complement the Custom Medi-Essence Service—building on the step-wise strategies of a unique, personalised skincare service offered by a trained expert. Dr.TWL teaches you how to select dermatologist-recommended skincare technologies and home-use devices that synergise with your customised essence service.\n\n\nPart 2 Complete Cosmeceutical Syllabus\nThis comprehensive set of tutorials provide grounding in the science of cosmeceuticals. The notes are compiled from the latest in dermatology research and are written for advanced skincare practitioners.\n\n\nWho is this for?\nAre you a beauty or skincare entrepreneur who faces these difficulties?\nLack of structured education in skin science\nNeed to distinguish between the functions of many confusing skincare ingredients available in the marketplace\nStruggling to build brand credibility/authority from scratch\nHigh MOQ for OEM/ODM, warehousing/storage issues\nHave an existing beauty/aesthetic practice & looking to introduce a product/service that clients can only get from you and nowhere else\n\n\nThis course is perfect for you if you are a beauty entrepreneur looking to start your own customised skincare service .\n\n\nAccess a structured system jointly created by a pharmaceutical engineer and a board-certified dermatologist ideally created to help you stand out in today’s cut-throat skincare industry\nMaster the science of skincare ingredients\nSmall to medium scale aesthetic/skincare businesses\nAll-in-1 POP-UP customised skincare service experience\nProven high customer retention/repeat order rates\nBuild client loyalty with a service they can get no where else\n\n\nWhat you will learn\nSECTION A - FOUNDATIONAL COURSE\nWhat are cosmeceuticals?\nImportance in dermatology and skincare\nMechanisms of action - how cosmeceuticals work\nWhy skincare products take time to work, how long and how to make your service stand out from other skin experts\nSECTION B - ACQUIRING THE SKILLS FOR CUSTOMISED COMPOUNDING\nDr.TWL Skin Physiotype\nA new, efficient way of skin subtyping for cosmeceutical use\nEmphasis on skin concerns for higher client satisfaction rates\nHow to titrate and source cosmeceutical skincare actives\nThe science behind Dr.TWL’s secret recipe\nThe 7 key cosmeceuticals that set you up for success\nSetting up a customised skincare service\nLearn how the Dr.TWL Medi-Essence Formulation System allows you to provide a complete personalised skincare service for your clients from the comfort of your own home.\nCustom Medi-Essence System\nClient consultation process\nCompounding at home without a facility\nReference chart for customised compounding for skin concerns\nRaw materials/sourcing\nAdditional downloadables\nLecture notes with full color visuals\nClient consultation templates\nClient progress monitoring - skincare planner template\nSECTION C - UPSELLING YOUR SKINCARE SERVICE WITH HOME DEVICE TECHNOLOGIES\nManage client expectations by imparting solid understanding of the skin cycle\nBiohack the skin cycle with advanced skincare technologies like microdermabrasion and hydrodermabrasion\nSkincare Plus Accelerate Program\nWays to enhance cosmeceutical absorption to accelerate results\n5 pillars of the instant glow\nInside-out, outside-in approach\nHandheld microdermabrasion and hydrodermabrasion system\n\n\nEXTRA WORKSHOP: MASTER SKINCARE INGREDIENTS\nLearn how to stand out from other skincare experts and skincare services by offering retinol alternatives.

In the course you'll learn about birth but you'll also receive several different tools, such as:\n\nGuided Meditations (to prepare your mind)\nPrenatal Workout + Nutrition Guide (to prepare your body)\nLabor Day Handbook (with simple tips and tricks that can transform your birth experience)\nBy the end of this course you'll have a clear understanding of how birth works and how you can have a painless birth! You'll also be prepared to avoid the MOST COMMON pitfalls that lead to a medicated birth. Having a baby doesn't have to be a traumatic experience, in fact, it can be beautiful, but preparation is key. My first birth was 17+ hours long, hard and exhausting but I had zero tools. When baby number two came along I spent every month researching and preparing myself. I was in hard labor for less then 7 hours and barely made it to the hospital in time (in fact, I still had on my street clothes when my baby was born). The biggest difference was in my commitment to prepare myself every single day. Now, I would love to pass along the transformational information to YOU.",

      "description": "Hijama is a traditional healing modality from the Muslim world. Steeped in mystery and traditions modern medicine is now discovering its benefits in promoting improved circulation and blood quality. Hijama has been helpful as an adjunct treatment for many difficult to treat conditions. I will be discussing all aspects of the theory and hands on practicalities involved with performing this treatment sprinkled with a traditional Chinese medicine perspective. This course will enhance your understanding and give you confidence to perform this treatment. Packed with easy to reference diagrams I will break this down to make this easy to follow and support you along your journey. Hijama has many healing benefits and it is important to know not just who to cup, but when to cup them and how many cups to use.  I will be able to explain about the lunar calendar, it's impact on cupping in strength and how seasonality and climatic effect are considerations for your treatment. Hijama is used in the Muslim culture to perform Al Ruqyah, getting rid of evil eye and dealing with Jinn. I will be delving into the sidr or black magic that can be treated with hijama and discussing relevant considerations. There is an additional section going over what is and what is not haram for your health. While hijama can help maintain health it is important to follow the traditional principals for good health.  This extra section is just my personal understanding from a non-muslim interpretation and merely voicing of my opinion and interpretation meant as a guideline for those wishing to go deeper on their personal wellness journey for themselves and their family.",

      "description": "Welcome to my course Feldenkrais for shoulder pain :)\nThe Feldenkrais Method, named after its founder Dr. Moshé Feldenkrais, is a unique approach to somatic learning.\nFeldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons (ATMs) teach you how to move more efficiently and improve your self-awareness.\n\nThis course focuses on the main movements of our shoulders:\n\n- Lifting & Lowering\n- Moving Forward & Backward\n- Circling\n\nThe movements will be explored in different positions (lying on the back or side and in sitting). You will learn how to do these shoulder movements in a healthy functional way. This will make your shoulders more flexible and helps to reduce pain.\nThe movements are gentle and can be done by almost anybody, no matter how old or physically fit you are.\n\n\nHow is a Feldenkrais lesson done:\nAt the beginning you start with a \"body scan\", which is a short awareness exercise to sense your current state. Then you try a reference movement to feel how difficult or easy it is. The main part is the actual movement lessons. You will do a sequence of small and slow movement exercises, that help you to reorganize your movement patterns. At the end of the lesson you will come back to the body scan to see if your sensations have changed and you will repeat the reference movement to sense if it has become easier.\n\n\nSee you inside :)\n\n\n(DISCLAIMER: The movement exercises in this course must be done slowly and gently and are performed at your own risk. I will not take any responsibility if an injury occurs. If you are not sure, whether you can take this course or not, please consult your doctor or physical therapist.)",

The skin protects us from microbes and the elements, helps regulate body temperature, and permits the sensations of touch, heat, and cold.\nSkin has three layers:\nThe epidermis, the outermost layer of skin, provides a waterproof barrier and creates our skin tone.\nThe dermis, beneath the epidermis, contains tough connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands.\nThe deeper subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis) is made of fat and connective tissue.\n\n\nWhat are skin lesions?\nA skin lesion is a part of the skin that has an abnormal growth or appearance compared to the skin around it.\nTwo categories of skin lesions exist: primary and secondary. Primary skin lesions are abnormal skin conditions present at birth or acquired over a person’s lifetime.\nSecondary skin lesions are the result of irritated or manipulated primary skin lesions. For example, if someone scratches a mole until it bleeds, the resulting lesion, a crust, is now a secondary skin lesion.\n\n\nE-Atlas  is an collection of relevant images denoting to a specific disorder or disease that help in gaining information of presentation of Disease and it's variable forms.\nUnder this course the E-Atlas of Psoriasis, Scabies , Vitiligo, Acne vulgaris, Keloid etc have been covered.\n\n\nHappy Learning!",

(Since the filming, Caroline has resigned from The Three Monkeys.)\nHistory\nBack in 2011 Three Zhineng Qigong Teachers met up to discuss what we could do to help Zhineng Qigong grow and develop in the UK.\nOver the following years we combined our experience, skills and opinions and developed a modular Teacher Training programme.\n(This film is the entry point for people who just wish to learn the form, or indeed engage with our Community or School in any way.)\nOur aim at the Three Monkeys is to further Zhineng Qigong in the UK through the development of a community of practitioners, supporting both those who want to share their understanding and experience through teaching and those who want to develop and explore this powerful practice.\nWe believe that this community should be:\nOpen – a closed community is unable to be fully aware, it’s unable to listen and learn from others perspectives. In order to truly grow we must be aware and this can only happen when we are open.\nRespectful – Respect helps us to be humble enough to constantly learn. Without respect we can more easily fall into the trap of feeling superior, knowledgeable or even correct.\nAccessible – Our view is that everyone can benefit from exploring the practice of Qigong so it’s important to build a sustainable, supportive group that is accessible to everyone.\nWhat is Zhineng Qigong?\nDeveloped by Dr Pang Ming, Zhineng Qigong is an open system that is both a highly effective in healing and spiritual development.\nDrawing together a range of Qigong practices as well as both Buddhist and Daoist influences, Zhineng Qigong represents a point in the evolution of Qigong that is both complex enough to support modern academic study, while retaining a simplicity that makes the practice truly accessible to anyone.\nWhether you are looking for a powerful healing system with a proven track record of effectiveness or a tool with which to explore the more spiritual aspect of practice, Zhineng Qigong has a wealth of information and practice for you.",

      "description": "Tai Chi is often seen as an exercise for older people but the truth is it has massive benefits for people in their twenties and thirties too. If you live a busy lifestyle, recognise that you should be taking better care of your health, want to feel more energised to do the things you love then this course is for you.\nLearn Simple Exercises That Boost Your Energy and Make You Feel Great Every Day\nIn addition to Tai Chi, you will learn some simple Daoist exercises that will help you relax your body, calm your mind, boost your energy and build your confidence.\nYou will learn:\n+How to warm your body up the Tai Chi way (Gentle and nourishing)\n+How to breathe properly if you want to relax and boost your energy\n+The basic animal stances of the Lishi Daoist Tai Chi\n+Daoist Yoga for increased flexibility\n+Qigong Energy Work exercises\n+Tai Chi for a high energy lifestyle\n+A simple exercise for helping you sleep\n+The beginnings of moving meditation\nRelax and Strengthen Your Mind and Body\n\nI have been practising the Chinese exercise system called Lishi (pronounced \"Lee\" \"Sher\") for twenty years and in that time I have seen remarkable changes in the energy levels and happiness of thousands of my students lives. You will immediately feel the benefits of the exercises and can start making a positive difference in your life very quickly.\nIf you want to take better care of yourself and enjoy even higher energy levels than you do now then making these exercises part of your day will do it for you.\nCourse Overview\nI have structured the course for beginners so that your knowledge builds progressively. We will start with a gentle warm-up so you can start to feel good from gently moving all the muscles and joints of your body.\n\nNext we will look at how to breathe properly in a way that maximises your oxygen intake, calms your emotions, relaxes you mind and body and boosts your energy. I guarantee this will be different from the way that you breathe right now.\nThe foundations of Tai Chi and all of the other Taoist exercises of Lishi are the stances. I teach you seven basic stances in a fun way that will strengthen your legs and make the following sections easier to enjoy.\nDaoist Yoga is different from other forms of yoga because it encourages you to always keep moving and never hold postures. We move in and out of the postures smoothly and fluidly. This develops suppleness in a much more natural way and helps you to embody the principles of flowing with life.\nWe do some standing energy cultivation exercises (Qigong) which are very simple to do but not necessarily easy so I have created 3 different videos to help you progress, strengthen your stamina and build up your energy.\nWith the firm foundation of the previous exercises in place you are now ready to learn the first three sequences of the Tai Chi Form. We will look at the stance-work, the hand and arm positions and the breathing so that you can co-ordinate all three, perform the moves fluidly and start to experience moving meditation.\nThe course is designed to give you an introduction to the exercises without overwhelming you with technical detail. If you enjoy the exercises, feel the benefits and start making them part of your life I outline how you can go deeper and further into these exercises to get even more benefit from this course.",

      "description": "A cancer diagnosis is terrifying and life changing, and the process towards recovery is long and arduous; but with the right tools, can be mostly successful. A feeling of hope and empowerment is tremendously helpful in turning health around and discussion with knowledgeable physicians can go a long way to putting your mind at ease. But so often we do not know what questions to ask, to help us feel better. Doctors are inundated with patients and do not always have the time to reassure us that all will be well, and indeed, the events of 2020 and COVID 19 have resulted in a reduction in hospital and doctor consultations for fear of exposure, and this has left our other health conditions floundering. In many cases we have been left to our own devices, not knowing where to turn or what to do.\nBreast cancer, or indeed any cancer, needs care and individual treatment and we, as the breast cancer sufferers, need a plan of action and reassurance that what we do for our own health has a basis in science and will support and not harm us.\nIndeed, in the treatment of cancer there are many forgotten therapies that have positive and beneficial results and are within our own power to include in our daily activities, with confidence… knowing we are making good choices.\nThe following forgotten therapies are all beneficial in either reducing tumour size, increasing survival or even reducing our risk of contracting cancer in the first place and yet many specialists do not add these to the standard treatment.\nThe list includes:\nu Iodine\nu Progesterone\nu Choline\nu Stress\nu Oestrogen\nu Vitamin D levels\nu Weight\nu Inflammation\nu Genetic involvement and microbiome\n\n\nWhether you adopt these yourself, or even use the studies and links provided to open a discussion with your doctor, after doing this course you will be armed with beneficial, scientifically researched therapies that may assist you to feel a sense of positive empowerment and no longer passive fear.\nI encourage you to discuss these with your doctor. We forget, in our anxiety, that we pay the doctors to serve us and, in that way, they are service providers. The substantial fees are paid so that they can help ‘us’ and this includes being willing to answer any questions you have, as well as being willing to support well-founded and researched therapies you may wish to include in your journey towards health. Knowledge is power and it is my intention in this course, to give you additional information that, as you progress through the course, you will see can only help you get well again.

      "description": "Equine Partnered Bodywork will introduce a light touch therapy technique we can do WITH our horse. Through practicing mindfulness and presence, we observe interactions that create a meaningful connection with our horse. By applying a light touch to the neck of a horse, we will see and recognize different levels of response, by staying on the point or area, the horse will ‘process and release’ their own tension, be it physical, mental, emotional. We in turn will feel our stress level melt away into relaxation. This activity will increase the joy of riding and being with horses while putting us in a blissful state of being!\nThis course is presented in an ‘active learning’ format. Get involved when seeing, reading, listening, feeling and sensing. Imagine you are doing this work as you watch - the ability to remember and perform will be 10 times better! Having applied this inner work first, the difference when you actually go out to work with a horse, is astounding!\nOur use of visualizing, hearing,and reading during the demonstration, creates retention of what we are doing and looking for with the horse. Horses tend to disconnect when we aren’t prepared and connected. Focus fully, when in front of the computer or phone - listen, read, take it all in, then go be with your horse. Learners who take this course come from all over the world, speak many languages, are all ages. The content as presented can be easily translated into many languages as well as the language of ‘energy’. Adjust the Udemy resolution to best and speed settings as needed for faster or slower delivery.\nPersonal responsibility of the student who chooses to engage in activities presented in this course:\nPARTICIPANTS WHO ENGAGE IN EQUINE ACTIVITIES ASSUME THE RISKS OF ENGAGING IN AND LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR INJURY, LOSS, OR DAMAGE TO PERSON OR PROPERTY RESULTING FROM THE INHERENT RISKS OF EQUINE ACTIVITIES\nNor will you want to start working with a horse that has issues or injuries that would be better addressed by a Veterinarian.\nThe skeletal image used in videos - left, right and top view are screenshots from 3D Horse Anatomy software from Biosphera3D.\nThe design of added circles and acupoints (© Nancy Horne) show major areas used in EPB bodywork.

      "description": "Photobiomodulation is a non-thermal process that uses non-ionizing light sources (either the coherent light of lasers or the non-coherent light of LEDs) in order to reduce the pain, increase tissue healing , decrease inflammation and this will improve the function of cells which will improve the function of tissues and organs ) to trigger redox biology-chemical reactions in which the oxidation state of atoms is changed, normally through the transfer of electrons between chemical species. Regarding the effect of Photobiomodulation in different Medical ,Dental and Veterinarian fields; we will highlight the definition, mechanism of action, advantages, indications and contraindications of the process. We will give you an idea about the difference between LED Vs LASER and red Vs blue Lasers.The power of Lasers usually higher than LED while beam Size of Lasers Usually is smaller than LED. So Power Density of Laser is much higher than LED. The absorption and scattering of light in tissues are both much higher in the blue region of the spectrum than the red, because the principle tissue chromophores (hemoglobin and melanin) have high absorption bands at shorter wavelengths, tissue scattering of light is higher at shorter wavelengths, and furthermore water strongly absorbs infrared light at wavelengths greater than 1100-nm. Photons of the light usually used in the PBM (red, near infrared) have not enough energy to break the molecular chemical bonds of nucleic acids (DNA); therefore, they are not carcinogenic, but from a conceptual point of view could speed up proliferative processes underway. Finally we will demonstrate the idea of conversion of stress cells to healthy cells.",

      "description": "Limitless: How Nootropics Can Enhance Your Brain Function\nImagine living in a state where you experience limitless energy throughout the day,\nImagine possessing laser sharp focus and the ability to concentrate at will,\nImagine experiencing twice the productivity in half the time,\nImagine remaining ten steps ahead of everyone else and your decision-making is instant, clear, and free of doubt or second-guessing,\nImagine a state where creativity expands allowing you to see things from a limitless perspective\nSound too good to be true? Well, it’s not.\nYou’ve probably seen or at least heard of the movie Limitless. It's not just a movie...it's a real possibility. You can expand your potential infinitely and essentially become limitless. And I’ll show you how. In this course, you will learn about Nootropics--supplements, functional foods and drugs that can enhance your brain function in ways that you cannot even imagine. Join me to explore this exciting world of nootropics where you will discovers ways to optimize your brain’s performance, expand your capacity to focus, increase your creativity and create an epic, supercharged life!\nIntro\n\"Not wired, wasn’t high, just clear. I knew what I needed to do and how to do it.\" – Eddie Morra, from the movie “Limitless”\nWho wouldn’t want this? Clarity of thought, clear direction and, laser focus, flawless memory, pre- cognition and reasoning without cognitive dissonance.\nMost of us have used, or currently use, supplements to enhance or manipulate brain performance; caffeine, energy drinks, fish oil, green tea, melatonin, and L-theanine to name a few. We explore ways to help the brain become smarter, acquire more focus, enhance cognition and experience flawless decision-making. The brain is an enigmatic masterpiece of nature’s creation. It starts working even before we draw our first breath and has a staggering capacity that is still yet to be fully realized.\nWhat if you could “bend” the brain and take advantage of, or expand its current capacity? What if you could go far beyond what the average human is currently capable of from a cognitive perspective? Sounds like something from the science fiction realm but it’s not, it is currently being achieved by utilizing substances referred to as nootropics.\nThe word nootropic means to bend the mind (nous = mind, trepein = to bend). In scientific terms, nootropics are drugs that protect and boost functions of the brain such as learning, memory and cognition through the enhancement or suppression of existing processes. Put simply, nootropics are chemicals, supplements, or herbs that change the way the brain works. They improve function by increasing energy production and blood flow, altering neurotransmitter levels and even make structural modifications to the brain hardware.\nNootropics is what this course is all about. You will learn:\nThe benefits, side effects, dosage and properties of over 25 nootropics\nSpecific adaptogenic uses of certain nootropics\nHow nootropics can improve the working efficacy of different parts of the brain by improving the blood supply or neurotransmitter mix in those areas\nHow to improve how different brain areas inter-link to enhance learning\nWhich nootropics possess neuroplasticity and neuroprotective functions, boosting NGF (nerve-growth factor) and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which aid in healing and slowing the degenerative aging of neurons\nWhat racetams are and how they work\nWhich racetams have a greater affect on focus, memory, and concentration, while others will have a greater affect on mood and anxiety\nWhich racetams enhance the senses to boost visual, sound, or other sensory qualities\nAbout target areas in the brain and their communication pathways\nHow to stack nootropics for better results\nAbout herbal nootropics and which ones to stack for specific results\nThe concept of enhancing the brain is nothing new; it has been a common theme across many cultures for centuries. The ancient Chinese used herbal compounds such as ginkgo biloba, ginseng, and gotu kola to enhance mental focus and learning. The Indian culture also focused on cognitive enhancement in Ayurvedic medicine through the use of Medhya Rasayanas. Medha means intellect or retention and Rasayana means therapeutic treatment/preparation. These medicinal preparations were used to boost or enhance memory, intellect, health, and longevity. Even the U.S. military were using something called “go” pills (adrafinil and modafinil) since WWII.\nNow you will have access to the exciting possibilities that nootropics can offer. Please keep in mind, this course is more than a quick overview of these substances. Rather I offer in-depth and comprehensive information that allows you to make intelligent choices for your health and well-being.\nRemember that this course is for all levels of knowledge regarding this special topic. I put this course together to help people better understand nootropics. This course is designed for all levels of knowledge of this topic. If you are a biohacker, or just a person who is interested in enhancing your abilities with being more creative, or to be more focused, this is the course for you.\nI will take you through those processes to help you better understand the world of nootropics. You are also going to find some in-depth stuff on brain neurotransmitters and some neurochemistry. This course will satisfy those biohackers out there who are interested in knowing the actual science behind all of this, but you don’t necessarily have to have a science background to understand the boots on the ground stuff that we are going to talk about in this course.\nDisclaimer\nWhile they are available and marketed in the U.S. as supplements, food products, or even as research chemicals, “for research purposes only.” Many are considered prescription medications in some countries and are banned in others. This makes it important to have an understanding of what you are trying to achieve and how the nootropics might affect your brains’ function. It is not advisable to take a haphazard approach and think that because you can buy them on the Internet, that they are safe. I highly recommend that you speak with a knowledgeable physician before trying these out. This course is for purely educational purposes and is not in any way intended to be a substitute for medical advice.",
      "target_audience": [
        "This course is directed at the student who understands the limitless nature of the brain and cognition. For those that are curious about the world of nootropics and even those that are experienced biohackers. This course is intended for both those with an in depth understanding of brain neurochemistry as well as those that are new and untrained in this arena. If you feel like you have a weak or negligible background in neuroscience then be sure to watch the Neurotransmitter module first and download the PDF associated with the module, this will give you the necessary background and basic understanding of neurochemistry.",
        "This course is not for the advanced nootropic user looking for information on the newest nootropics. Most of the nootropics discussed are ones with long and established track records. There are newer nootropics on the market that are still in experimental stages and this is not the place to learn about those."
