      "description": "This webinar was conducted on 31st March 2018 with Rohit, CEO Paripath Inc.\nWe start with Electronic design automation and what is machine learning. Then we will give overall introduction to categories of machine learning (supervised and unsupervised learning) and go about discussing that a little bit. Then we talk about the frameworks which are available today, like general purpose, big data processing and deep-learning, and which one is suitable for design automation. This is Machine Learning in general with a focus on CAD, EDA and VLSI flows.\nThen we talk about Applied Theory (data sets, data analysis like data augmentation, exploratory data analysis, normalization, randomization), as to what are the terms and terminologies and what do we do with that, accuracy, how do we develop the algorithm, essentially the things that are required to develop the solution flow, lets say, you as the company wants to add a feature in your product using machine learning, what you would be doing, and what your flow will look like and this is what is shown as pre-cursor of flight theory as what you should be looking out.\nAnd then we start with regression, which is first in supervised learning. In the regression, we will give couple of example, like first is resistance estimation, second is polynomial regression which is capacitance estimation. For resistance estimation, we have the dataset from 20nm technology. And finally, we go on to create a linear classifier using logistic regression.\nNext will be dimensionality reduction, meaning, you have a large dataset and how to you reduce the size of that so that you can run on a laptop or even on your cell phone. Then there is a big example of that. Everything has mathematics behind that, this wont be a part of the webinar.\n\n\nAbout Rohit - Rohit Sharma is Founder and CEO of Paripath Inc based in Milpitas, CA. He graduated from IIT Delhi.He has authored 2 books and published several papers in international conferences and journals. He has contributed to electronic design automation domain for over 20 years learning, improvising and designing solutions. He is passionate about many technical topics including Machine Learning, Analysis, Characterization and Modeling, which led him to architect guna - an advanced characterization software for modern nodes.He currently works for Paripath Inc.",

      "description": "See things in your data that no one else can see – and make the right decisions!\nDue to modern technology and the internet, the amount of available data grows substantially from day to day. Successful companies know that. And they also know that seeing the patterns in the data gives them an edge on increasingly competitive markets. Proper understanding and training in Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling will give you the power to identify those patterns. This can make you an invaluable asset for your company/institution and can boost your career!\nMarketing companies use Machine Learning to identify potential customers and how to best present products.\nScientists use Machine Learning to capture new insights in nearly any given field ranging from psychology to physics and computer sciences.\nIT companies use Machine Learning to create new search tools or cutting edge mobile apps.\nInsurance companies, banks and investment funds use Machine Learning to make the right financial decisions or even use it for algorithmic trading.\nConsulting companies use Machine Learning to help their customers on decision making.\nArtificial intelligence would not be possible without those modeling tools.\nBasically we already live in a world that is heavily influenced by Machine Learning algorithms.\n1. But what exactly is Machine Learning?\nMachine learning is a collection of modern statistical methods for various applications. Those methods have one thing in common: they try to create a model based on underlying (training) data to predict outcomes on new data you feed into the model. A test dataset is used to see how accurate the model works. Basically Machine learning is the same as Statistical Modeling.\n2. Is it hard to understand and learn those methods?\nUnfortunately the learning materials about Machine Learning tend to be quite technical and need tons of prior knowledge to be understood.\nWith this course it is my main goal to make understanding those tools as intuitive and simple as possible.\nWhile you need some knowledge in statistics and statistical programming, the course is meant for people without a major in a quantitative field like math or statistics. Basically anybody dealing with data on a regular basis can benefit from this course.\n3. How is the course structured?\nFor a better learning success, each section has a theory part, a practice part where I will show you an example in R and at last every section is enforced with exercises. You can download the code pdf of every section to try the presented code on your own.\n4. So how do I prepare best to benefit from that course?\nIt depends on your prior knowledge. But as a rule of thumb you should know how to handle standard tasks in R (courses R Basics and R Level 1). You should also know the basics of modeling and statistics and how to implement that in R (Statistics in R course).\nFor special offers and combinations just check out the r-tutorials webpage which you can find below the instructor profile.\nWhat R you waiting for?\nMartin",

      "description": "Do you want to create a talking chatbot that interacts with your visitors? In this tutorial, you will learn how to create Python chatbots using Rasa NLU and Rasa Core. They provide several Natural Language processing functions that parse user input and match it to the right response. Integrating NLP into your bot can be difficult, but with Rasa, it is much easier to create a Facebook Messenger bot or a website chatbot.\n\n\nRasa is a powerful open-source machine learning framework for developers to create contextual chatbots and expand bots beyond answering simple questions. In this course, you will study both Rasa NLU and Rasa Core.\n\n\nRasa NLU is an open-source natural language processing tool for intent classification and entity extraction in chatbots. You can think of it as a set of high-level APIs for building your own language parser using existing NLP and ML libraries. Among the main reasons for using open-source NLU are: 1) you don’t have to hand over all your chatbot training data to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Facebook; 2) Machine Learning is not one-size-fits-all. You can tweak and customize Python chatbot models for your training data; and 3) Rasa NLU runs wherever you want, so you don’t have to make an extra network request for every chatbot message that comes in.\n\n\nRasa Core leverages developers’ existing domain knowledge to help them bootstrap from zero training data, and adopts an interactive learning approach. With Rasa Core, you manually specify all the things your bot can say and do. We call these actions. One action might be to greet the user, another might be to call an API, or query a database. Then you train a probabilistic model to predict which action your Python chatbot should take given the history of a chatbot conversation.\n\n\nThis Python chatbot course will help you:\nBuild chatbots with Python using Rasa NLU & Rasa Core\nUnderstand intents and entities.\nBuild a Facebook Messenger bot.\nDeploy chatbots on cloud platforms such as Heroku.",

      "description": "Learn how we implemented Deep Learning Object Detection Models on Raspberry Pi and accelerated them with Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick.\nWhen we first got started in Deep Learning particularly in Computer Vision, we were really excited at the possibilities of this technology to help people. The only problem is, that image classification and object detection runs just fine on our expensive, power consuming and bulky Deep Learning machines. However, not everyone can afford or implement AI for their practical applications.\nThis is when we went searching for an affordable, compact, less power hungry alternative. Generally if we'd want to shrink our IoT and automation projects, we'd often look to the Raspberry Pi which is versatile computing solution for numerous problems. This made us ponder about how we can port out deep learning models to this compact computing unit. Not only that, but how could we run it at close to real-time?\nAmongst the possible solutions we arrived at using the raspberry pi in conjunction with an AI Accelerator USB stick that was made by Intel to boost our object detection frame-rate. However it was not so simple to get it up and running. Implementing the documentation, we landed up with a series of bugs after bugs, which became a bit tedious.\nAfter endless posts on forums, tutorials and blogs, we have documented a seamless guide in the form of this course; which will show you, step-by-step, on how to implement your own Deep Learning Object Detection models on video and webcam without all the wasteful debugging. So essentially, we've structured this training to reduce debugging, speed up your time to market and get you results sooner.\nIn this course, here's some of the things that you will learn:\nGetting Started with Raspberry Pi even if you are a beginner,\nDeep Learning Basics,\nObject Detection Models - Pros and Cons of each CNN,\nSetup and Install Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS) SDK,\nCurrently, the OpenVINO is available for Raspbian, so the NCS2 is already compatible with the Raspberry Pi, but this course is mainly for the Movidius (NCS version 1).\nRun Yolo and Mobilenet SSD object detection models in recorded or live video\nYou also get helpful bonuses:\n*OpenCV CPU inference\n*Introduction to Custom Model Training\nPersonal help within the course\nI donate my time to regularly hold office hours with students. During the office hours you can ask me any business question you want, and I will do my best to help you. The office hours are free. I don't try to sell anything.\nStudents can start discussions and message me with private questions. I answer 99% of questions within 24 hours. I love helping students who take my courses and I look forward to helping you.\nI regularly update this course to reflect the current marketing landscape.\nGet a Career Boost with a Certificate of Completion\nUpon completing 100% of this course, you will be emailed a certificate of completion. You can show it as proof of your expertise and that you have completed a certain number of hours of instruction.\nIf you want to get a marketing job or freelancing clients, a certificate from this course can help you appear as a stronger candidate for Artificial Intelligence jobs.\nMoney-Back Guarantee\nThe course comes with an unconditional, Udemy-backed, 30-day money-back guarantee. This is not just a guarantee, it's my personal promise to you that I will go out of my way to help you succeed just like I've done for thousands of my other students.\nLet me help you get fast results.  Enroll now, by clicking the button and let us show you how to develop Accelerated AI on Raspberry Pi.",

Anyone who experimented with GANs on their own knows that it's easy to throw together a GAN that spits out MNIST digits, but it's another level of difficulty entirely to produce photorealistic images at a resolution higher than a thumbnail.\n\n\nThis course comprehensively bridges the gap between MNIST digits and high-definition faces. You'll create and train a GAN that can be used in real-world applications.\n\n\nAnd because training high-resolution networks of any kind is computationally expensively, you'll also learn how to distribute your training across multiple GPUs or TPUs. Then for training, we'll leverage Google's TPU hardware for free in Google Colab. This allows students to train generators up to 512x512 resolution with no hardware costs at all.\n\n\nThe material for this course was pulled from the ProGAN, StyleGAN, and StyleGAN 2 papers which have produced ground-breaking and awe-inspiring results. We'll even use the same Flicker Faces HD dataset to replicate their results.\n\n\nFinally, what GAN course would be complete without having some fun with the generator? Students will learn not only how to generate an infinite quantity of unique images, but also how to filter them to the highest-quality images by using a perceptual path length filter. You'll even learn how to generate smooth interpolations between two generated images, which make for some really interesting visuals.",

      "description": "Welcome to Statistics Fundamentals! This course is for beginners who are interested in statistical analysis. And anyone who is not a beginner but wants to go over from the basics is also welcome!\n\n\nAs a science field, statistics is a discipline that concerns collecting data, and mathematical analysis of the collected data, describing data and making inference from the data. Using statistical methods, we can obtain insights from data, and use the insights for answering various questions and decision making.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis is now applied in various scientific and practical fields. It is essential in both natural science and social science. In business practice, statistical analysis is applied as business analytics such as human resource analytics and marketing analytics. And now, it is an essential tool in medical practice and government policymaking. Besides, baseball teams utilize it for strategy formation. It is well known a SABRmetrics.\n\n\nHowever, if we do not use appropriate methods, statistical analysis will result in meaningless or misleading findings. To obtain meaningful insights from data, we need to learn statistics both in practical and theoretical viewpoints. This course intends to provide you with theoretical knowledge as well as Python coding. Theoretical knowledge enables us to implement appropriate analysis in various situations. And it can be a useful foundation for more advanced learning.\n\n\nThis course is a comprehensive program for learning the basics of statistics. It consists of the 9 sections. They cover theory and basic Python coding. Even if you do not have Python coding experience, I believe they are easy to follow for you. But this program is not a Python course, so how to install Python and construct environment is not covered in this course.\n\n\nThis course is designed for beginners, but by learning with this course, you will reach an intermediate level of expertise in statistics. Specifically, this course covers undergraduate level statistics. After enrollment, you can download the lecture presentations, Python code files, and toy datasets in the first lecture page.\n\n\nI’m looking forward to seeing you in this course!\n\n\n*In some videos, the lecturer says \"... will be covered in later courses\", but it should be \"later sections.\"\n\n\nTable of Contents\n1.

      "description": "IMPORTANT: This course requires an INTERMEDIATE level and it may NOT be for you if you just recently started with Snowflake and/or Data Science, relational databases, with SQL and/or Python programming. It occasionally deals with advanced notions that are not explained here. Check the minimum Requirements for this course, and the \"What this course is NOT about\" section below, before buying this course!\n\n\nWhat is Snowflake Cortex\nSnowflake got heavily involved into AI and ML only in the past two years. I know, because I've been around since the beginning. In Jan 2021 I was selected by them as a \"Snowflake Data Superhero\". And in my last two years alone I passed many DS and ML certification exams (see below).\nIn mid-2023 they came up with Snowpark ML. Then with some built-in ML-powered functions, about regression and classification. The new Model Registry from Snowpark ML - added in Jan 2024 - allows now end-to-end ML on the platform.\nYou'll see side-by-side data science experiments I will present to you \"the old way\", on Snowflake. Many of them with integrations with ChatGPT (about which I talked in detail in another course of mine). To compare them now with the new LLM functions, as Snowflake decided to host their own Large Language Models.\nMost of these (and other features yet to come) are now presented under the Snowflake Cortex umbrella.\nWhat you will learn\nHigh-level picture of the new Snowflake Cortex AI & ML platform.\nDetailed views on each of the Snowflake Cortex areas.\nHow ML experiments were done on Snowflake before Cortex.\nHow ML experiments can be implemented today with the Snowpark ML APIs, part of Snowflake Cortex.\nEnd-to-end Machine Learning with Snowpark ML and its Model Registry.\nHow to use the new regression and classification ML-powered classes and functions, in Snowflake Cortex.\nHow to call the new LLM functions from Snowflake Cortex, and compare them with ChatGPT.\nWhat to expect from Snowflake Copilot and other incoming Snowflake features in Cortex.\nWhat was the roadmap and what are the future plans of Snowflake for Snowflake Cortex or in the AI & ML areas.\nWhat this course is NOT about\nI will not teach you data science and machine learning here from ground up. You are expected to have some basic knowledge about ML, DL, LLMs...\nI will not teach you about many other areas in Snowflake. You are expected to have basic knowledge of Snowflake and data warehouses in general.\nI will not teach programming in Python or SQL. It's a hands-on course and you are expected to have some basic knowledge in this area. However, I may come-up with some small Streamlit apps, but I'll keep everything simple and easy to understand.\nThis will not cover EVERYTHING you can do as data science in Snowflake. While you will see experiments \"the old way\" with scikit-learn, or integrations with ChatGPT, these are not part of Cortex! We have to limit mostly to Snowflake Cortex, as that's a huge platform.\nWhile Snowpark Container Services are also very new and they also target mostly ML and DL experiments (especially the new containers with GPUs), there will not be enough time to go deeper in detail. And this is also a very specialized and more difficult platform to understand. I may come up later on with a more advanced course on SPCS, but for now this course does not require such an advanced level of preparation.\nWho I am\nThe only world-class expert from Canada selected for the Snowflake Data Superhero program in 2021.\nSnowPro Certification SME (Subject Matter Expert) - many SnowPro exam questions have been created by me.\nPassed four SnowPro certification exams to date (with no retakes): Core, Architect, Data Engineer, Data Analyst.\nSpecialized in Snowflake for the past few years: I worked for Snowflake Partner companies. I served dozens of clients in this capacity or as an independent consultant. Today I share my knowledge with highly specialize courses on Snowflake.\nA few of my latest Data Science and Machine Learning certifications\nAWS Certified in Machine Learning\nMicrosoft Azure Data Scientist Associate\nMicrosoft Azure AI Engineer Associate\nMicrosoft Azure AI Fundamentals\nTensorFlow Developer Certificate\nAlteryx Machine Learning Fundamentals Certified\nDataiku ML Practitioner Certified\nDataiku MLOps Practitioner Certified\nNeo4j Graph Data Science Certified\nTigerGraph Graph Algorithms for Machine Learning\nThis course truly offers a complete coverage of the new Snowflake Cortex, and my intention is to update it frequently. Enroll today, and keep this course forever!\n[Disclaimer: We are not affiliated with or endorsed by Snowflake, Inc.]",

      "description": "Hi.. Hello and welcome to my new course, Machine Learning with Python for Dummies. We will discuss about the overview of the course and the contents included in this course.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Machine Learning  and Deep Learning Neural Networks are the most used terms now a days in the technology world. Its also the most mis-understood and confused terms too.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence is a broad spectrum of science which tries to make machines intelligent like humans. Machine Learning and Neural Networks are two subsets that comes under this vast machine learning platform\n\n\nLets check what's machine learning now. Just like we human babies, we were actually in our learning phase then. We learned how to crawl, stand, walk, then speak words, then make simple sentences.. We learned from our experiences. We had many trials and errors before we learned how to walk and talk. The best trials for walking and talking which gave positive results were kept in our memory and made use later. This process is highly compared to a Machine Learning Mechanism\n\n\nThen we grew young and started thinking logically about many things, had emotional feelings, etc. We kept on thinking and found solutions to problems in our daily life. That's what the Deep Learning Neural Network Scientists are trying to achieve. A thinking machine.\n\n\nBut in this course we are focusing mainly in Machine Learning. Throughout this course, we are preparing our machine to make it ready for a prediction test. Its Just like how you prepare for your Mathematics Test in school or college.  We learn and train ourselves by solving the most possible number of similar mathematical problems. Lets call these sample data of similar problems and their solutions as the 'Training Input' and 'Training Output' Respectively. And then the day comes when we have the actual test. We will be given new set of problems to solve, but very similar to the problems we learned, and based on the previous practice and learning experiences, we have to solve them. We can call those problems as 'Testing Input' and our answers as 'Predicted Output'. Later, our professor will evaluate these answers and compare it with its actual answers, we call the actual answers as 'Test Output'. Then a mark will be given on basis of the correct answers. We call this mark as our 'Accuracy'. The life of a machine learning engineer and a data-scientist is dedicated to make this accuracy as good as possible through different techniques and evaluation measures.\n\n\nHere are the major topics that are included in this course. We are using Python as our programming language. Python is a great tool for the development of programs which perform data analysis and prediction. It has tons of classes and features which perform the complex mathematical analysis and give solutions in simple one or two lines of code so that we don't have to be a statistic genius or mathematical Nerd to learn data science and machine learning.

      "description": "Welcome to our Machine Learning Projects course! This course is designed for individuals who want to gain hands-on experience in developing and implementing machine learning models. Throughout the course, you will learn the concepts and techniques necessary to build and evaluate machine-learning models using real-world datasets.\nWe cover basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, and the types of problems that can be solved using these techniques. You will also learn about common machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees.\n\n\nML Prerequisites Lectures\nPython Crash Course: It is an introductory level course that is designed to help learners quickly learn the basics of Python programming language.\nNumpy: It is a library in Python that provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, and a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\nPandas: It is a library in Python that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. It is built on top of Numpy and is widely used for data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation.\nMatplotlib: It is a plotting library in Python that provides a wide range of visualization tools and support for different types of plots. It is widely used for data exploration and visualization.\nSeaborn: It is a library built on top of Matplotlib that provides higher-level APIs for easier and more attractive plotting. It is widely used for statistical data visualization.\nPlotly: It is an open-source library in Python that provides interactive and web-based visualizations. It supports a wide range of plots and is widely used for creating interactive dashboards and data visualization for the web.\n\n\nML Models Covered in This Course\nLinear Regression: A supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on a set of independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\nLogistic Regression: A supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a binary outcome based on a set of independent variables. It uses a logistic function to model the probability of the outcome.\nDecision Trees: A supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. It is often used for classification and regression tasks.\nRandom Forest: A supervised learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to increase the accuracy and stability of the predictions. It is an ensemble method that reduces overfitting and improves the generalization of the model.\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the best boundary (or hyperplane) that separates the different classes in the data.\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the k nearest points to a new data point and classifies it based on the majority class of the k nearest points.\nHyperparameter Tuning: It is the process of systematically searching for the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. It is used to optimize the performance of the model and to prevent overfitting by finding the optimal set of parameters that work well on unseen data.\nAdaBoost: A supervised learning algorithm that adapts to the data by adjusting the weights of the observations. It is an ensemble method that is used for classification tasks.\nXGBoost: A supervised learning algorithm that is an extension of a gradient boosting algorithm. It is widely used in Kaggle competitions and industry projects.\nCatBoost: A supervised learning algorithm that is designed to handle categorical variables effectively.\n\n\nUnsupervised Models\nClustering algorithms can be broadly classified into three types: centroid-based, density-based, and hierarchical. Centroid-based clustering algorithms such as k-means, group data points based on their proximity to a centroid, or center point. Density-based clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN, group data points based on their density in the feature space. Hierarchical clustering algorithms such as Agglomerative and Divisive build a hierarchy of clusters by either merging or dividing clusters iteratively.\nK-Means: A centroid-based clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their proximity to a centroid. It is widely used for clustering large datasets.\nDBSCAN: A density-based clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their density in the feature space. It is useful for identifying clusters of arbitrary shape.\nHierarchical Clustering: An algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters by merging or dividing clusters iteratively. It can be agglomerative or divisive in nature.\nSpectral Clustering: A clustering algorithm that finds clusters by using eigenvectors of the similarity matrix of the data.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): A dimensionality reduction technique that projects data onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information.\n\n\nAdvanced Models\nDeep Learning Introduction: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers, called deep neural networks, to model and solve complex problems such as image recognition and natural language processing. It is based on the idea that a neural network can learn to automatically learn representations of the data at different levels of abstraction. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of deep learning model that is a feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs. MLP is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. MLP is based on the idea that a neural network with multiple layers can learn to automatically learn representations of the data at different levels of abstraction.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP): Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the interaction between human language and computers. One of the common techniques used in NLP is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). Tf-idf is a statistical measure that reflects the importance of a word in a document or a corpus of documents. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Tf-idf is used in NLP for tasks such as text classification, text clustering, and information retrieval. It is also used in document summarization and feature extraction for text data.\n\n\nAre there any course requirements or prerequisites?\nNo introductory skill level of Python programming required\nHave a computer (either Mac, Windows, or Linux)\nDesire to learn!\nWho this course is for:\nBeginners python programmers.\nBeginners Data Science programmers.\nStudents of Data Science and Machine Learning.\nAnyone interested in learning more about python, data science, or data visualizations.\nAnyone interested in the rapidly expanding world of data science!\nDevelopers who want to work in analytics and visualization projects.\nAnyone who wants to explore and understand data before applying machine learning.\nThroughout the course, you will have access to a team of experienced instructors who will provide guidance and support as you work on your projects. You will also have access to a community of fellow students who will provide additional support and feedback as you work on your projects.\nThe course is self-paced, which means you can complete the modules and projects at your own pace,",

The staging allocation process is covered in depth before the introduction to the concepts of feeder models (PD, LGD and EAD models).\nDespite the non-prescriptive nature of the accounting principle, common practice suggest relying on the so-called probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) framework. Banks estimate ECL as the present value of the above three parameters product over a one-year or lifetime horizon, depending upon experiencing a significant increase in credit risk since origination. Three main buckets are considered : stage1 (one-year ECL), stage 2( lifetime ECL), stage3 (impaired credits).\nThe concepts of Next 12 month probability of default (PD), Lifetime Probability of Default, marginal default and modeling and validation concepts of LGD and EAD for IFRS9 has been explained step by step from scratch using R Programming.\nThis course also explains how Expected Credit Losses (ECL) affects regulatory capital and ratios. Modeling concepts for low default portfolios and scare data modeling is also covered. For modeling, both Generalized Linear Models (GLMS) and Machine Learning (ML) modeling methodologies has been explained step by step from scratch.",

      "description": "Welcome to GIS & Geospatial Analysis with Python, Geopandas, and Folium course. This is a comprehensive project-based course where you will learn step-by-step on how to perform geospatial analysis techniques specifically leveraging GIS for urban planning. You will build projects like mapping population density, monitoring air quality, mapping flood risks, mapping snow cover, modeling and optimizing routes, and we will be using Python libraries like Pandas, Geopandas, Folium, Geocoder, and Ipyleaflet. The course perfectly combines geospatial analysis with urban planning, providing an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your geospatial knowledge. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of geospatial analysis, such as getting to know its use cases, understanding geospatial analysis workflow, learning about technical challenges and limitations in GIS. Then, in the next section, we will learn about geospatial data visualization methods like choropleth maps, heatmaps, 3D maps, flow maps, point maps, and cartogram maps. This section is very critical because it provides you with the necessary tools to communicate your analysis effectively to stakeholders and decision-makers involved in urban planning. Afterward, in the next section, we will download geospatial datasets from Kaggle, the datasets contain valuable information like demographic data, land use data, and climate data. Before starting the project, we will learn about basic geospatial techniques, like importing geospatial data, displaying interactive maps, extracting coordinates from map, calculating distance between two locations, finding nearby cities using proximity analysis, performing geocoding and reverse geocoding. This section is very essential because it provides you with the fundamental skills and knowledge needed to effectively work with geospatial data and prepare you well for the upcoming projects. In the next section, we will start the projects. There will be five projects. In the first project, you will analyze population density to identify densely populated areas and assess their suitability for urban planning initiatives. For the second project, you will focus on monitoring air quality to identify areas with high pollution levels and assess their impact on public health and the environment. In the third project, you will map flood risk areas to facilitate disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts. In the fourth project, you will map snow cover to support transportation planning and finding safer travel routes during winter season. Lastly, in the fifth project, you will develop optimal transportation routes to improve efficiency and reduce travel times for urban commuters.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we learn about geographic information systems and geospatial analysis? Well, here is my answer: geographic information systems are essential for understanding spatial relationships and patterns in data, enabling us to make informed decisions and solve real-world problems more effectively. These technologies play a crucial role in various industries, for example, urban planning, environmental science, and public health, allowing us to analyze spatial data and derive meaningful insights for better decision-making. Additionally, there are tons of business opportunities, for example, you can develop custom GIS applications like property valuation tools, supply chain optimization platforms, or tourism route planners. These applications leverage location-based insights to drive decision-making and enhance operational efficiency.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of geospatial analysis and its use cases\nLearn geospatial analysis workflow. This section covers data collection, data preprocessing, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, spatial analysis, and modeling\nLearn about geospatial data visualization methods like choropleth maps, heatmaps, 3D maps, flow maps, point maps, and cartogram maps\nLearn how to display interactive map and topographic map using Geopandas, Folium, and Ipyleaflet\nLearn how to calculate distance between two locations\nLearn how to extract geographic coordinates from map\nLearn how to perform geocoding and reverse geocoding\nLearn how to conduct proximity analysis for finding nearby cities\nLearn how to analyze and calculate population density\nLearn how to visualize population density on interactive map\nLearn how to analyze air quality index\nLearn how to monitor air quality in multiple locations\nLearn how to analyze and calculate flood risk\nLearn how to map flood risk on interactive map\nLearn how to analyze snowfall and snow depth in multiple locations\nLearn how to map snow cover using Folium\nLearn how to model and optimize route using Open Street Map Network X\nLearn how to model and optimize bus routes using Dijkstra algorithm",

No previous Regular Expressions experience required!\nRegular expressions are also referred to as Regex, Regexes or Regexp (sometimes called a rational expression)\nThis course is designed to advance you from beginner to expert. It is laid out logically so that you can incrementally build your regular expressions' knowledge. Essential Regex foundations are established first to facilitate in-depth comprehension of this key skill.\nThe real world and real-life examples explored in this course will deepen your understanding of REGEX and how to apply what you’ve learnt authentically and appropriately. Experimentation with a new skill is vital in exercising and integrating wider application; which is why we’ll explore practical Regular Expression examples because it ingrains the information contained here.\nOur world is pretty much run by data now, and those that know how to intelligently interrogate and manage data have a distinct advantage. Regular expressions unlock the powerful possibilities of any data set.\nData analysis is vital in a variety of industries and circumstances and being able to deploy and utilise this formidable tool will strengthen your skills set, enhance your confidence and give you an edge.\n\n\nASK YOURSELF:\nAre you battling to learn Regex?\nHave you tried many Regular Expression courses on Udemy and YouTube and you are still not getting it?\nAre you a programmer that avoids using Regex because you are not confident?\nAre you a beginner and you have heard about this and are not sure where to start?\nAs a Data Scientist, you know that this will help you query and clean data, but you don't have a proper foundation to start from.\nHave you started programming in Python, PHP, JavaScript, Java etc and you need to have a better understanding of Regular Expressions?\nAre you using Google Sheets to clean data up and you would like to make the process faster?\nAre you a system administrator using PowerShell and you would like to run scripts that make your job easier?\nDo you know REGEX? How about advanced REGEX? Date Matching? Regular Expressions with Leap Years?\nIf you have answered YES to any of these questions - then you NEED this course!\n\n\nAre you looking to solve some or all of these issues in your day-today job?\nText search and manipulation: Regex can be used to search and manipulate text, including finding specific words or phrases, replacing text, and extracting data from a string.\nInput validation: Regex is useful for validating user input in web forms or other applications. You can use Regex to ensure that user input meets certain requirements, such as a specific format or range of values.\nData parsing: Regex can be used to extract data from text files or other sources, such as logs, spreadsheets, or databases.\nWeb scraping: Regex is an essential tool for web scraping, allowing you to extract data from HTML or other markup languages.\nAutomated testing: Regex can be used to write automated tests for software applications, ensuring that the output of the application meets the desired format or requirements.\n\n\nHOW CONFIDENT AM I? Take this course. If you don't learn everything you need to know about Regular Expressions (Regex) in the next 30 days, I'll refund every penny!\n\n\nWhat questions do we answer?\nWhat is a Regular Expression (Regex)? A Regular Expression, or Regex, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It is a powerful tool for matching and manipulating text.\nWhat is the syntax for writing Regex patterns? Regex patterns consist of a combination of characters and metacharacters that define the search pattern. The syntax for writing Regex patterns varies depending on the programming language or application.\nWhat are metacharacters in Regex? Metacharacters are special characters that have a specific meaning in a Regex pattern. Examples of metacharacters include \"^\", \"$\", \".\", \"*\", \"+\" and \"?\".\nWhat are some common Regex use cases? Regex is commonly used for tasks such as validating user input, searching and replacing text, extracting data from text, and parsing log files.\nWhat is the difference between a greedy and non-greedy Regex pattern? A greedy Regex pattern matches the longest possible substring that satisfies the pattern, while a non-greedy pattern matches the shortest possible substring that satisfies the pattern.\nWhat is Regex Backtracking? Regex backtracking occurs when a Regex engine tries to match a pattern, but fails at some point, and then tries different combinations of the pattern until a match is found.\nWhat is Regex Lookahead and Lookbehind? Regex Lookahead and Lookbehind are called lookaround, and they allow you to specify a pattern to match only if a certain condition is met ahead or behind the pattern.\nWhat is Regex Character Class? Regex Character Class is a set of characters that can be used to match a single character from a given set of characters. For example, [a-z] matches any lowercase letter in the English alphabet.\nWhat is Regex Quantifiers? Regex Quantifiers specify the number of times a character or a group of characters can be repeated in a pattern. Examples of quantifiers include \"*\", \"+\", \"?\" and \"{m,n}\".\nAnd many more.\n\n\nAnd the full 30 day no-questions-asked Udemy instant guarantee is your assurance of the quality and potential of this course.\nGet started today by clicking \"Buy Now\" and get full, lifetime access to this unique Regular Expressions (Regex) course with all future updates and all current and future course materials included!\n\n\nDon't just take our word for it - our students consistently give us high marks for our engaging content, expert instruction, and practical approach.

      "description": "USED BY SOFTWARE STUDENTS AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - WORLD CLASS DEEP LEARNING COURSE - UPDATED CONTENT January 2018\nMaster practical deep learning and neural network concepts and fundamentals\nMy course does exactly what the title describes in a simple, relatable way. I help you to grasp the complete start to end concepts of fundamental deep learning.\nWhy you need this course\nComing to grips with python isn't always easy. On your own it can be quite confusing, difficult and frustrating. I've been through the process myself, and with the help of lifelong ... I want to share this with my fellow beginners, developers, AI aspirers, with you.\nWhat you will get out of this course\nI will give you straightforward examples, instructions, advice, insights and resources for you to take simple steps to create your own neural networks from scratch. By the end of the course you will be able to create neural networks to create your very own image classifier, able to work on your own images.\nI personally provide support within the course, answering questions and giving feedback on what you're discovering/creating along the way. I don't just throw you in at the deep end - I provide you with the resources to learn and develop what you need at a pace to work for you and then help you stroll through to the finish line. Studies have shown that to learn effectively from online courses tutorials should last around ten minutes each. Therefore to maximise your learning experience all of the lectures in this course have been created around this amount of time.\nMy course integrates all of the aspects required to get you on the road becoming a successful deep learning developer. I teach and I preach, with live, practical exercises and walkthroughs at the end of each section!\nWhy this price?\nAs a professional AI developer I have over five years in Senior positions in software development and technology entrepreneurship, with experience in tutoring and creating online courses, catering to thousands of students. Face to face I charge $50 per hour for a student. To complete the curriculum that I offer it would cost them between $500 - $1000.\nTo reach more people than I could face to face I decided to create this course. As I add more content I intend to raise the price but for now I've decided on this price - the cost of around just three lessons.\nBy paying a small cost for this course I believe you will get your value back, with a lot more by the time you have completed it.\nAsk yourself - how much is mastering the fundamentals of python (and setting up your skills for AI engineering) worth to you?\nHow long will it take?\nAlthough everyone is different, on average it has taken existing students between 4 - 6 weeks to complete the course, whilst developing their skills and knowledge along the way.\nWho this is not for\nThis course is not for anyone looking for a one-click fix. Although I provide you with a path walked enough times that it can be a relatively smooth journey it still requires a lot of time and effort from you to make it happen. If you're not interested in putting in your energy to truly better yours skills in python then this may not be the right course for you.\nIs there a money back guarantee if I'm not happy?\nAbsolutely. I am confident that my course will bring you more value than you spend on the course. As one of the previously top featured Udemy Instructors my motto is 'your success is my success'. If within the first 30 days you feel my course is not going to help you to achieve your goals in python programming then you get a no questions asked, full discount.\nWhat materials are included?\nThe majority of my lectures I have chosen to be in video format so that you can hear and see me when we're going through each and every area of the course.\nAswell as the course lectures, presentations, scripts and quizzes the course will soon also offers my full support as an instructor to answer questions, provide feedback and support\nI will be constantly adding more valuable content and resources to the course as time goes by. Keep checking back here if you're not sure right now and feel free to send me a message with any questions or requests you may have.\nSo go ahead and click the 'Take this course' button at the top right of your screen. I look forward to seeing you on the course.",

      "description": "Genetic algorithms are an important area of Artificial Intelligence responsible for solving complex real world problems. There are several practical applications of this type of algorithm, which can be applied to problem solving in everyday business situations. A classic example is solving the problem of teacher schedule in schools, in which there are different combinations of schedules and classes and the goal is to build the schedule dynamically according to the number of classes and the availability of each teacher. Other examples are: telecommunications companies can design new optical networks, carriers can better plan the delivery route for goods, investors can choose the best investments; among several others.\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to enter the world of genetic algorithms! What makes this course unique is that you will learn the basic intuition and especially, the step-by-step implementation without using pre-built libraries. In other words, we are going to implement genetic algorithms from scratch using Python. If you have never heard about this subject, at the end of the course you will have all the theoretical and practical basis to solve your own problems or the problems of the company you work for!\nIn part 1, we are going to implement a genetic algorithm from scratch to solve a very common problem that is related to transportation of products. Let's suppose we need to load some products on the truck, but we need to select the most profitable products and also take into account that there is not enough space on the truck to load them all. So, the goal of the genetic algorithm will be to choose the best set of products to maximize the profit of the company. At the end we will integrate our algorithm with a database in MySql, so it will be easier to know how to deal with commercial applications!\nIn part 2 (after you learn the whole intuition and implement genetic algorithms from scratch), it's time to learn how to work with libraries to solve the same problem. In addition to the case study of product transportation, we will also solve another problem that is related to finding the lowest prices of airline tickets for people traveling in group. We will solve both problems using two libraries: DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) and MLROSe. The interesting is that we will be able to compare the results of the libraries with the results of our genetic algorithm implemented from scratch.\nThis can be considered the first course on genetic algorithms, and after completing it, you can move on to more advanced materials. At the end you will have the practical background to develop some simple projects and take more advanced courses. During the lectures, the code will be implemented step by step using Google Colab, which will ensure that you will have no problems with installations or configurations of software on your local machine.",

It is an randomized algorithm where each step follows randomization principle.\nGenetic Algorithm was developed by John Holland, from the University of Michigan, in 1960. He proposed this algorithm based on the Charles Darwin’s theory on Evolution of organism. Genetic Algorithm follows the principal of “Survival of Fittest”. Only the fittest individual has the possibility to survive to the next generation and hence when the generations evolve only the fittest individuals survive.\nGenetic Algorithms operates on Solutions, hence called as search based optimization algorithm. It search for an optimal solution from the existing set of solutions in search space. The process of Genetic Algorithm is given as,\n1. Randomly choose some individuals (Solutions) from the existing population\n2. Calculate the fitness function\n3. Choose the fittest individuals as parental chromosomes\n4. Perform crossover (Recombination)\n5. Perform Mutation\n6. Repeat this process until the termination condition\nThis steps indicated that Genetic Algorithm is an Randomized, search based optimization Algorithm.\nThis course is divided into four modules.\nFirst module – Introduction, history and terminologies used in Genetic Algorithm.\nSecond Module – Working of genetic algorithm with an example\nThird Module – Types of Encoding, Selection, Crossover and Mutation methods\nFourth module – Coding and Applications of Genetic Algorithm\n\n\nHappy Learning!!!",

      "description": "The history of data science, machine learning, and artificial Intelligence is long, but it’s only recently that technology companies - both start-ups and tech giants across the globe have begun to get excited about it… Why? Because now it works. With the arrival of cloud computing and multi-core machines - we have enough compute capacity at our disposal to churn large volumes of data and dig out the hidden patterns contained in these mountains of data.\nThis technology comes in handy, especially when handling Big Data. Today, companies collect and accumulate data at massive, unmanageable rates for website clicks, credit card transactions, GPS trails, social media interactions, and so on. And it is becoming a challenge to process all the valuable information and use it in a meaningful way. This is where machine learning algorithms come into the picture. These algorithms use all the collected “past” data to learn patterns and predict results or insights that help us make better decisions backed by actual analysis.\n\n\nYou may have experienced various examples of Machine Learning in your daily life (in some cases without even realizing it). Take for example\nCredit scoring, which helps the banks to decide whether to grant the loans to a particular customer or not - based on their credit history, historical loan applications, customers’ data and so on\nOr the latest technological revolution from right from science fiction movies – the self-driving cars, which use Computer vision, image processing, and machine learning algorithms to learn from actual drivers’ behavior.\nOr Amazon's recommendation engine which recommends products based on buying patterns of millions of consumers.\nIn all these examples, machine learning is used to build models from historical data, to forecast the future events with an acceptable level of reliability. This concept is known as Predictive analytics. To get more accuracy in the analysis, we can also combine machine learning with other techniques such as data mining or statistical modeling.\n\nThis progress in the field of machine learning is great news for the tech industry and humanity in general.\nBut the downside is that there aren’t enough data scientists or machine learning engineers who understand these complex topics.\n\n\nWell, what if there was an easy to use a web service in the cloud - which could do most of the heavy lifting for us? What if scaled dynamically based on our data volume and velocity?\n\n\nThe answer - is new cloud service from Microsoft called Azure Machine Learning. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based data science and machine learning service which is easy to use and is robust and scalable like other Azure cloud services. It provides visual and collaborative tools to create a predictive model which will be ready-to-consume on web services without worrying about the hardware or the VMs which perform the calculations.\n\n\nThe advantage of Azure ML is that it provides a UI-based interface and pre-defined algorithms that can be used to create a training model. And it also supports various programming and scripting languages like R and Python.\n\n\nIn this course, we will discuss Azure Machine Learning in detail. You will learn what features it provides and how it is used. We will explore how to process some real-world datasets and find some patterns in that dataset.\n\n\nDo you know what it takes to build sophisticated machine learning models in the cloud?\nHow to expose these models in the form of web services?\nDo you know how you can share your machine learning models with non-technical knowledge workers and hand them the power of data analysis?\n\nThese are some of the fundamental problems data scientists and engineers struggle with on a daily basis.\n\n\nThis course teaches you how to design, deploy, configure and manage your machine learning models with Azure Machine Learning. The course will start with an introduction to the Azure ML toolset and features provided by it and then dive deeper into building some machine learning models based on some real-world problems\n\n\nIf you’re serious about building scalable, flexible and powerful machine learning models in the cloud, then this course is for you.\n\n\nThese data science skills are in great demand, but there’s no easy way to acquire this knowledge. Rather than rely on hit and trial method, this course will provide you with all the information you need to get started with your machine learning projects.\n\n\nStartups and technology companies pay big bucks for experience and skills in these technologies They demand data science and cloud engineers make sense of their dormant data collected on their servers  -  and in turn, you can demand top dollar for your abilities.\n\nYou may be a data science veteran or an enthusiast - if you invest your time and bring an eagerness to learn, we guarantee you real, actionable education at a fraction of the cost you can demand as a data science engineer or a consultant. We are confident your investment will come back to you many-fold in no time.\n\n\nSo, if you're ready to make a change and learn how to build some cool machine learning models in the cloud, click the \"Add to Cart\" button below.\n\n\nLook, if you're serious about becoming an expert data engineer and generating a greater income for you and your family, it’s time to take action.\n\n\nImagine getting that promotion which you’ve been promised for the last two presidential terms. Imagine getting chased by recruiters looking for skilled and experienced engineers by companies that are desperately seeking help. We call those good problems to have.\n\nImagine getting a massive bump in your income because of your newly-acquired, in-demand skills.\n\n\nThat’s what we want for you.

After thousands of years of evolution, humanity has managed to create machines that can conduct specific intelligent tasks when trained properly. How? Through a process called machine learning or deep learning, by mimicking the behaviour of biological neurons through electronics and computer science. Even more than it is our present, it is our future, the key to unlocking exponential technological development and leading our societies through wonderful advancements.\nAs amazing as it sounds, it is not off limits to you, to the contrary!\nWe are both engineers, currently designing and marketing advanced ultra light electric vehicles. Albert is a Mechanical engineer specializing in advanced robotics and Eliott is an Aerospace Engineer specializing in advanced space systems with past projects completed in partnership with the European Space Agency.\nThe aim of this course is to teach you how to fully, and intuitively understand neural networks, from their very fundamentals. We will start from their biological inspiration through their mathematics to go all the way to creating, training and testing your own neural network on the famous MNIST database.\nIt is important to note that this course aims at giving you a complete and rich understanding of neural networks and AI, in order to give you the tools to create your own neural networks, whatever the project or application. We do this by taking you through the theory to then apply it on a very hands-on MATLAB project, the goal being for you to beat our own neural network's performance!\nThis course will give you the opportunity to understand, use and create:\nHow to emulate real brains with neural networks.\nHow to represent and annotate neural networks.\nHow to build and compute neural networks with matrices.\nUnderstand and master the mathematics and algorithms behind deep learning and neural networks.\nTrain and test neural networks on any data set.\nHow to use the MNIST handwritting numbers training and testing datasets.\nImport the MNIST data in MATLAB.\nCreate a complete neural network in MATLAB including forward and backwards propagation with both Leaky Relu and Sigmoid activation functions.\nTrain and test your own neural network on the MNIST database and beat our results (95% success rate).\nWe will thoroughly detail and walk you through each of these concepts and techniques and explain down to their fundamental principles, all concepts and subject-specific vocabulary. This course is the ideal beginner, intermediate or advanced learning platform for deep learning and neural networks, from their fundamentals to their practical, hands-on application. Whatever your background, whether you are a student, an engineer, a sci-fi addict, an amateur roboticist, a drone builder, a computer scientist, a business or sports person or anyone with an interest in data science and machine learning, at the end of this course, you will be capable of creating brains within machines!\nIf you have questions at any point of your progress along the course, do not hesitate to contact us, it will be our pleasure to answer you within 24 hours!\nIf this sounds like it might interest you, for your personal growth, career or academic endeavours, we strongly encourage you to join! You won't regret it!",

These are the people who actually write, test, produce and release the R code to the general public by way of the CRAN mirrors. It is a rich and detailed 10-session course which covers much of the content in the contemporary 105-page CRAN manual. The ten sessions follow the outline in the An Introduction to R online manual and specifically instruct with respect to the following user topics:\n1. Introduction to R; Inputting data into R\n2. Simple manipulation of numbers and vectors\n3. Objects, their modes and attributes\n4. Arrays and matrices\n5. Lists and data frames\n6. Writing user-defined functions\n7. Working with R as a statistical environment\n8. Statistical models and formulae; ANOVA and regression\n9. GLMs and GAMs\n10. Creating statistical and other visualizations with R\nIt is a comprehensive and decidedly \"hands-on\" course. You are taught how to actually use R and R script to create everything that you see on-screen in the course videos. Everything is included with the course materials: all software; slides; R scripts; data sets; exercises and solutions; in fact, everything that you see utilized in any of the 200+ course videos are included with the downloadable course materials.\nThe course is structured for both the novice R user, as well as for the more experienced R user who seeks a refresher course in the benefits, tools and capabilities that exist in R as a software suite appropriate for statistical analysis and manipulation. The first half of the course is suited for novice R users and guides one through \"hands-on\" practice to master the input and output of data, as well as all of the major and important objects and data structures that are used within the R environment. The second half of the course is a detailed \"hands-on\" transcript for using R for statistical analysis including detailed data-driven examples of ANOVA, regression, and generalized linear and additive models. Finally, the course concludes with a multitude of \"hands-on\" instructional videos on how to create elegant and elaborate statistical (and other) graphics visualizations using both the base and gglot visualization packages in R.\nThe course is very useful for any quantitative analysis professional who wishes to \"come up to speed\" on the use of R quickly. It would also be useful for any graduate student or college or university faculty member who also seeks to master these data analysis skills using the popular R package.",

Originally designed to help students pass the now-retired Cloudera Certification exams, the material remains useful for those wanting to practice their skills on Spark and Hadoop clusters. However, its primary focus was certification preparation, which many students successfully completed.\n\n\nApache Spark is currently one of the most popular systems for processing big data.\n\n\nApache Hadoop continues to be used by many organizations that look to store data locally on premises. Hadoop allows these organisations to efficiently store big datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes.\n\n\nAs the number of vacancies for data science, big data analysis and data engineering roles continue to grow, so too will the demand for individuals that possess knowledge of Spark and Hadoop technologies to fill these vacancies.\n\n\nThis course has been designed specifically for data scientists, big data analysts and data engineers looking to leverage the power of Hadoop and Apache Spark to make sense of big data.\n\n\nThis course will help those individuals that are looking to interactively analyse big data or to begin writing production applications to prepare data for further analysis using Spark SQL in a Hadoop environment.\n\n\nThe course is also well suited for university students and recent graduates that are keen to gain exposure to Spark & Hadoop or anyone who simply wants to apply their SQL skills in a big data environment using Spark-SQL.\n\n\nThis course has been designed to be concise and to provide students with a necessary and sufficient amount of theory, enough for them to be able to use Hadoop & Spark without getting bogged down in too much theory about older low-level APIs such as RDDs.\n\n\nOn solving the questions contained in this course students will begin to develop those skills & the confidence needed to handle real world scenarios that come their way in a production environment.\n\n\n(a) There are just under 30 problems in this course. These cover hdfs commands, basic data engineering tasks and data analysis.\n(b) Fully worked out solutions to all the problems.\n(c) Also included is the Verulam Blue virtual machine which is an environment that has a spark Hadoop cluster already installed so that you can practice working on the problems.\n\n\nThe VM contains a Spark Hadoop environment which allows students to read and write data to & from the Hadoop file system as well as to store metastore tables on the Hive metastore.\nAll the datasets students will need for the problems are already loaded onto HDFS, so there is no need for students to do any extra work.\nThe VM also has Apache Zeppelin installed. This is a notebook specific to Spark and is similar to Python’s Jupyter notebook.\n\n\nThis course will allow students to get hands-on experience working in a Spark Hadoop environment as they practice:\n\n\nConverting a set of data values in a given format stored in HDFS into new data values or a new data format and writing them into HDFS.\nLoading data from HDFS for use in Spark applications & writing the results back into HDFS using Spark.\nReading and writing files in a variety of file formats.\nPerforming standard extract, transform, load (ETL) processes on data using the Spark API.\nUsing metastore tables as an input source or an output sink for Spark applications.\nApplying the understanding of the fundamentals of querying datasets in Spark.\nFiltering data using Spark.\nWriting queries that calculate aggregate statistics.\nJoining disparate datasets using Spark.\nProducing ranked or sorted data.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Machine Learning (beginner to guru) course by Uplatz.\n\n\nMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn without having to be explicitly programmed. Machine learning is concerned with the creation of computer programs that can adapt to new data. In this post, we'll go through the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use Python to construct a simple machine learning algorithm. Many modules have been built by the Python community to assist programmers in implementing machine learning. The NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn modules will be used in this course.\nMachine learning entails training a computer with a particular data set and then using that training to predict the characteristics of incoming data. Specialized algorithms are used in the training and prediction phase. The training data is sent into an algorithm, which then utilizes the training data to make predictions on fresh test data. Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of computer science that allows computers to make sense of data in the same manner that humans do. In simple terms, machine learning (ML) is a form of artificial intelligence that uses an algorithm or method to extract patterns from raw data. The goal of machine learning is to allow computers to learn from their experiences without having to be explicitly programmed or requiring human involvement.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\n\n\nRecognize the range and depth of machine learning applications and use cases in real-world applications\nUsing Python libraries, import and wrangle data, then partition it into training and test datasets\nUnderstand Machine Learning concepts and types of ML\nTechniques for preparing data, such as univariate and multivariate analysis, missing values and outlier treatment, and so on\nLearn Machine Learning algorithms - regression, classification, clustering, association\nImplement various types of classification methods such as SVM, Naive bayes, decision tree, and random forest\nInterpret unsupervised learning and learn to use clustering algorithms\nImplement linear and polynomial regression, understand Ridge and lasso regression, and implement various types of classification methods such as SVM, Naive bayes, decision tree, and random forest\nOverfitting avoidance, Bias-variance tradeoff, Minibatch, and Shuffling, ML solution tuning\nUnderstand various types of Recommender Systems and start building your own!\n\n\nUplatz provides this end-to-end training on Machine Learning using Python programming.\nYou'll understand what machine learning is and what are the most prevalent approaches in the field are at the conclusion of this learning route.

      "description": "This course offers you practical training in machine learning, using the R program. At the end of the course you will know how to use the most widespread machine learning techniques to make accurate predictions and get valuable insights from your data.\nAll the machine learning procedures are explained live, in detail, on real life data sets. So you will advance fast and be able to apply your knowledge immediately – no need for painful trial-and-error to figure out how to implement this or that technique in R. Within a short time you can have a solid expertise in machine learning.\nMachine learning skills are very valuable if you intent to secure a job like data analyst, data scientist, researcher or even software engineer. So it may be the right time for you to enroll in this course and start building your machine learning competences today!\nLet’s see what you are going to learn here.\nFirst of all, we are going to discuss some essential concepts that you must absolutely know before performing machine learning. So we’ll talk about supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, about the distinctions between prediction and inference, about the regression and classification models and, above all, about the bias-variance trade-off, a crucial issue in machine learning.\nNext we’ll learn about cross-validation. This is an all-important topic, because in machine learning we must be able to test and validate our model on independent data sets (also called first seen data). So we are going to present the advantages and disadvantages of three cross-validations approaches.\nAfter the first two introductory sections, we will get to study the supervised machine learning techniques. We’ll start with the regression techniques, where the response variable is quantitative. And no, we are not going to stick to the classical OLS regression that you probably know already. We will study sophisticated regression techniques like stepwise regression (forward and backward), penalized regression (ridge and lasso) and partial least squares regression. And of course, we’ll demonstrate all of them in R, using actual data sets.\nAfterwards we’ll go to the classification techniques, very useful when we have to predict a categorical variable. Here we’ll study the logistic regression (classical and lasso), discriminant analysis (linear and quadratic), naïve Bayes technique, K nearest neighbor, support vector machine, decision trees and neural networks.\nFor each technique above, the presentation is structured as follows:\n* a short, easy to understand theoretical introduction (without complex mathematics)\n* how to train the predictive model in R\n* how to test the model to make sure that it does a good prediction job on independent data sets.\nIn the last sections we’ll study two unsupervised machine learning techniques: principal component analysis and cluster analysis. They are powerful data mining techniques that allow you to detect patterns in your data or variables.\nFor each technique, a number of practical exercises are proposed. By doing these exercises you’ll actually apply in practice what you have learned.\nThis course is your opportunity to become a machine learning expert in a few weeks only! With my video lectures, you will find it very easy to master the major machine learning techniques. Everything is shown live, step by step, so you can replicate any procedure at any time you need it.\nSo click the “Enroll” button to get instant access to your machine learning course. It will surely provide you with new priceless skills. And, who knows, it could give you a tremendous career boost in the near future.\nSee you inside!",

This is the classic example of a recommender system!\nIn this course, you will learn in theory and practice how recommender systems work! You will implement an algorithm based on the collaborative filtering technique applied to movie recommendations (user-based filtering and item-based filtering). We are going to use a small dataset to test all mathematical calculations. Then, we will test our algorithm using the famous MovieLens dataset, which has more than 100.000 instances. At the end of the course (after implementing the algorithm from scratch), you will learn how to use two pre-built libraries: LibRecommender and Surprise!\nWhat makes this course unique is that you will implement step by step from scratch in Python, learning all mathematical calculations. This can be considered the first course on recommender systems, so, if you have never heard about how to implement them, at the end you will have all the theoretical and practical background to develop some simple projects and also take more advanced courses.

For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that.\nA machine learning course teaches you the technology and concepts behind predictive text, virtual assistants, and artificial intelligence.

Many companies will give offers to those who rank highly in their competitions. In fact, Kaggle may become your full-time job if you can hit one of their high rankings.\n\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\n\n\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\n\n\nWhat is Kaggle used for?\nKaggle is a website for sharing ideas, getting inspired, competing against other data scientists, learning new information and coding tricks, as well as seeing various examples of real-world data science applications.\n\n\nIs Kaggle free to use?\nDoes Kaggle cost anything? The Kaggle Services may be available at no cost or we may charge a monetary fee for using the Services.\n\n\nWhat are typical use cases for Kaggle?\nKaggle is best for businesses that have data that they feel needs to be analyzed. The most significant benefit of Kaggle is that these companies can easily find someone who knows how to work with their data, which makes solving the problem much easier than if they were trying to figure out what was wrong with their system themselves.\nWhat are some popular competitions on Kaggle?\nThere are many different types of competitions available on Kaggle. You can enter a contest in everything from predicting cancer cells in microscope images to analyzing satellite images for changes overtime on any given day.\nExamples include:\nPredicting car prices based on features such as horsepower and distance traveled\nPredicting voting patterns by state\nAnalyzing satellite images to see which countries have the most deforestation\n\n\nIs Kaggle good for beginners?\nDespite the differences between Kaggle and typical data science, Kaggle can still be a great learning tool for beginners. Each competition is self-contained. You don't need to scope your own project and collect data, which frees you up to focus on other skills.\n\n\nHow does Kaggle work?\nEvery competition on Kaggle has a dataset associated with it and a goal you must reach (i.e., predict housing prices or detect cancer cells). You can access the data as often as possible and build your prediction model. Still, once you submit your solution, you cannot use it to make future submissions.\nThis ensures that everyone is starting from the same point when competing against one another, so there are no advantages given to those with more computational power than others trying to solve the problem.\nCompetitions are separated into different categories depending on their complexity level, how long they take, whether or not prize money is involved, etc., so users with varying experience levels can compete against each other in the same arena.\n\n\nWhat type of skills do you need to compete on Kaggle?\nYou should be comfortable with data analysis and machine learning if you're looking to get involved in competitions.\nData science is a very broad term that can be interpreted in many ways depending on who you talk to. But suppose we're talking specifically about competitive data science like what you see on Kaggle. In that case, it's about solving problems or gaining insights from data.\nIt doesn't necessarily involve machine learning, but you will need to understand the basics of machine learning to get started. There are no coding prerequisites either, though I would recommend having some programming experience in Python or R beforehand.\nThat being said, if competitive data science sounds interesting to you and you want to get started right away, we have a course for that on Duomly!\n\n\nHow does one enter a competition on Kaggle?\nThe sign-up process for entering a competition is very straightforward: Most competitions ask competitors to submit code that meets specific criteria at the end of each challenge. However, there may be times when they want competitors to explain what algorithms they used or provide input about how things work.\n\n\nWhat are some Kaggle competitions I could consider solving?\nSuppose you want to solve one of their business-related challenges. In that case, you'll need to have a good understanding of machine learning and what models work well with certain types of data. Suppose you want to do one of their custom competition. You'll need to have a background in computer science to code in the language associated with the problem.\n\n\nHow do Kaggle competitions make money?\nMany companies on Kaggle are looking for solutions, so there is always a prize attached to each competition. If your solution is strong enough, you can win a lot of money!\nSome of these competitions are just for fun or learning purposes but still award winners with cash or merchandise prizes.\n\n\nWhat tools should I use to compete on Kaggle?\nThe most important tool that competitors rely on every day is the Python programming language. It's used by over 60% of all data scientists, so it has an extremely large community behind it. It's also extremely robust and has many different packages available for data manipulation, preprocessing, exploration to get you started.\nTensorFlow is another popular tool that machine learning enthusiasts use to solve Kaggle competitions. It allows quick prototyping of models to get the best possible results. Several other tools are used in addition to Python and Tensorflow, such as R (a statistical programming language), Git (version control), and Bash (command-line interface). Still, I'll let you research those on your own!\n\n\nWhat is the main benefit of using Kaggle to solve problems?\nKaggle aims to give you the tools necessary to become a world-class data scientist.

This means that your job application cannot be contingent on only your Kaggle profile\n\n\nIs Kaggle a software?\nKaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners.\n\n\nIs Kaggle still popular?\nIt's a great ecosystem to engage, connect, and collaborate with other data scientists to build amazing machine learning models. Over the years, Kaggle has gained popularity by running competitions that range from fun brain exercises to commercial contests that award monetary prizes and rank participants.\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\n\n\nDoes machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it. An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systems.\n\n\nWhat is the best language for machine learning?\nPython is the most used language in machine learning. Engineers writing machine learning systems often use Jupyter Notebooks and Python together. Jupyter Notebooks is a web application that allows experimentation by creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and more. Machine learning involves trial and error to see which hyperparameters and feature engineering choices work best. It's useful to have a development environment such as Python so that you don't need to compile and package code before running it each time. Python is not the only language choice for machine learning. Tensorflow is a popular framework for developing neural networks and offers a C++ API. There is a machine learning framework for C# called ML. NET. Scala or Java are sometimes used with Apache Spark to build machine learning systems that ingest massive data sets. You may find yourself using many different languages in machine learning, but Python is a good place to start.\n\n\nWhat are the different types of machine learning?\nMachine learning is generally divided between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. In supervised machine learning, we train machine learning models on labeled data. For example, an algorithm meant to detect spam might ingest thousands of email addresses labeled 'spam' or 'not spam.' That trained model could then identify new spam emails even from data it's never seen. In unsupervised learning, a machine learning model looks for patterns in unstructured data. One type of unsupervised learning is clustering. In this example, a model could identify similar movies by studying their scripts or cast, then group the movies together into genres. This unsupervised model was not trained to know which genre a movie belongs to. Rather, it learned the genres by studying the attributes of the movies themselves. There are many techniques available within these two types of machine learning, for example: deep learning, reinforcement learning, and more.\n\n\nIs machine learning a good career?\nMachine learning is one of the fastest-growing and popular computer science careers today. Constantly growing and evolving, you can apply machine learning to a variety of industries, from shipping and fulfillment to medical sciences. Machine learning engineers work to create artificial intelligence that can better identify patterns and solve problems. The machine learning discipline frequently deals with cutting-edge, disruptive technologies. However, because it has become a popular career choice, it can also be competitive. Aspiring machine learning engineers can differentiate themselves from the competition through certifications, boot camps, code repository submissions, and hands-on experience.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between machine learning and artifical intelligence?\nMachine learning is a smaller subset of the broader spectrum of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence describes any \"intelligent machine\" that can derive information and make decisions, machine learning describes a method by which it can do so. Through machine learning, applications can derive knowledge without the user explicitly giving out the information. This is one of the first and early steps toward \"true artificial intelligence\" and is extremely useful for numerous practical applications. In machine learning applications, an AI is fed sets of information. It learns from these sets of information about what to expect and what to predict. But it still has limitations. A machine learning engineer must ensure that the AI is fed the right information and can use its logic to analyze that information correctly.\n\n\nWhat skills should a machine learning engineer know?\nA machine learning engineer will need to be an extremely competent programmer with in-depth knowledge of computer science, mathematics, data science, and artificial intelligence theory. Machine learning engineers must be able to dig deep into complex applications and their programming. As with other disciplines, there are entry-level machine learning engineers and machine learning engineers with high-level expertise. Python and R are two of the most popular languages within the machine learning field.\n\n\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\n\n\nWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?\nPython is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quickly.\n\n\nHow long does it take to become a data scientist?\nThis answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.\n\n\nHow can I learn data science on my own?\nIt is possible to learn data science on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Oak Academy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.\n\n\nDoes data science require coding?\nThe jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skillsset.\n\n\nWhat skills should a data scientist know?\nA data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings, data scientists require knowledge of visualizations. Data visualizations allow them to share complex data in an accessible manner.\n\n\nIs data science a good career?\nThe demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. Data science is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds. If this sounds like a great work environment, then it might be a promising career for you.\n\n\nWith my up-to-date course, you will have a chance to keep yourself up to date.

He is entertaining as well as knowledgeable about the subject. - Prakash Shelke\nSpectacular step by step instructions with great examples and labs. -Donato\nGreat course !!!!! You learn how to use the Pandas library for its own sake and not as a part of some courses devoted to other topics. -Giovanni De Angelis\nThe course is really impressive. Tons of information, and I learned a great deal. I had no Python background, and now I feel a lot more confident about working with Python than ever. Thanks for the course.  Austin\nHonestly Mike your classes speak for themselves. They're informative, concise and just really well put together. They're exactly the kind of courses I look for. -Alex El\nI have been a software engineer for more years than I care to admit. I found the presentation, speed and depth fit what I was looking for perfectly. I believe at this point I understand enough about Pandas so that I can move forward with this branch of learning. - Danny\n\nCourse Description\nWelcome to Data Wrangling in Pandas for Machine Learning Engineers\nThis is the second course in a series designed to prepare you for becoming a machine learning engineer.\nI'll keep this updated and list only the courses that are live.  Here is a list of the courses that can be taken right now.  Please take them in order. The knowledge builds from course to course.\nThe Complete Python Course for Machine Learning Engineers\nData Wrangling in Pandas for Machine Learning Engineers (This one)\nData Visualization in Python for Machine Learning Engineers\n\n\nLearn the single most important skill for the machine learning engineer: Data Wrangling\n\nA complete understanding of data wrangling vernacular.\nPandas from A-Z.\nThe ability to completely cleanse a tabular data set in Pandas.\nLab integrated. Please don't just watch. Learning is an interactive event.  Go over every lab in detail.\nReal world Interviews Questions.\nThe knowledge builds from course to course in a serial nature. Without the first course many students might struggle with this one. Thank you.\n\nMany new to machine learning believe machine learning engineers spend their days building deep neural models in Keras or SciKit-Learn. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but that isn’t the case.\nA recent study from Kaggle determined that 80% of time data scientists and machine learning engineers spend their time cleaning data. The term used for cleaning data in data science circles is called data wrangling.\nIn this course we are going to learn Pandas using a lab integrated approach. Programming is something you have to do in order to master it. You can't read about Python and expect to learn it.\nPandas is the single most important library for data wrangling in Python.\nData wrangling is the process of programmatically transforming data into a format that makes it easier to work with.\n\nThis might mean modifying all of the values in a given column in a certain way, or merging multiple columns together. The necessity for data wrangling is often a byproduct of poorly collected or presented data.\nIn the real world data is messy. Very rarely do you have nicely cleansed data sets to point your supervised models against.\nKeep in mind that 99% of all applied machine learning (real world machine learning) is supervised. That simply means models need really clean, nicely formatted data.  Bad data in means bad model results out.\n**Five Reasons to Take this Course**\n\n1) You Want to be a Machine Learning Engineer\nIt's one of the most sought after careers in the world. The growth potential career wise is second to none. You want the freedom to move anywhere you'd like. You want to be compensated for your efforts. You want to be able to work remotely. The list of benefits goes on. Without a solid understanding of data wrangling in Python you'll have a hard time of securing a position as a machine learning engineer.\n2) Most of Machine Learning is Data Wrangling\nIf you're new to this space the one thing many won't tell you is that much of the job of the data scientist and the machine learning engineer is massaging dirty data into a state where it can be modeled. In the real world data is dirty and before you can build accurate machine learning models you have to clean it. This process is called data wrangling and without this skills set you'll never get a job as a machine learning engineer.  This course will give you the fundamentals you need to cleanse your data.\n3) The Growth of Data is Insane\nNinety percent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years. Business around the world generate approximately 450 billion transactions a day. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5 exabytes a day. That number doubles every month.  Almost all real world machine learning is supervised. That means you point your machine learning models at clean tabular data. Python has libraries that are specific to data cleansing.\n4) Machine Learning in Plain English\nMachine learning is one of the hottest careers on the planet and understanding the basics is required to attaining a job as a data engineer.  Google expects data engineers and their machine learning engineers to be able to build machine learning models.\n5) You want to be ahead of the Curve\nThe data engineer and machine learning engineer roles are fairly new.  While you’re learning, building your skills and becoming certified you are also the first to be part of this burgeoning field.  You know that the first to be certified means the first to be hired and first to receive the top compensation package.\nThanks for interest in Data Wrangling in Pandas for Machine Learning Engineers\nSee you in the course!!",

      "description": "Facial detection is a subarea of Computer Vision that aims to detect people's faces in images or videos. Smartphones and digital cameras use these features to select people in a photo, usually placing a rectangle around the face. This type of application has gained considerable relevance in security systems, in which it is necessary to identify whether there are people in an environment for the alarm to be triggered. On the other hand, facial recognition aims to recognize people's faces and one example is security systems that can use these features to identify whether or not a person is present in an environment. It is important to highlight the differences between face detection and recognition techniques: while the first only indicates if a face is present, the second indicates whose face is detected.\nIn this step by step course using Python programming language, you are going to learn how to detect and recognize faces from images, videos and webcam from the most basic to the most advanced techniques!

As renewables grow, gas plants become essential for flexibility, but optimizing their dispatch requires understanding both systems simultaneously. Poor coordination between gas and electric systems costs billions annually in inefficiencies and can cause cascading failures like the 2021 Texas crisis. The shift to hydrogen and power-to-gas technologies makes integrated modeling even more critical. Companies need professionals who can optimize across energy vectors, not just within silos. Whether planning infrastructure investments, managing real-time operations, or designing resilient energy systems, the ability to model coupled networks is becoming mandatory.

This cutting-edge technology is poised to revolutionize how we create and interact with all kinds of digital content.\nSo, What exactly is generative AI? At its core, it refers to AI models that can generate new data, rather than just analyzing existing data. This could include generating text, images, audio, video, computer code, and more - often starting from just a basic prompt or input from a user. What makes this technology so powerful is how user-friendly it is becoming. You can simply describe a scene or concept, and the AI model generates high-quality digital content in response - almost like magic!\n\n\n1. Artificial Intelligence:\nThis prime spot is reserved for just plain AI. It's a broad term, the overarching goal: machines that mimic human intelligence. That includes everything from playing chess to diagnosing diseases, from composing music to writing this blog.\n\n\n2. Machine Learning:\nMachine Learning (ML), a subset of AI. It's where the magic of learning from data happens. ML algorithms don't need explicit programming – they gobble up data, identify patterns, and improve their performance over time.\n\n\n3. Deeper and Deeper: When ML Gets Fancy - Deep Learning\nThis is ML on steroids, using complex artificial neural networks loosely inspired by the human brain. Deep learning is the secret sauce behind many of AI's recent breakthroughs, allowing for crazy-powerful stuff like image and speech recognition.\n4. Generative AI\nThis is the elephant baby of the AI world or the rebellious teenager with a paintbrush. It uses machine learning to create entirely new content, from composing electronic dance music symphonies to generating hyperrealistic images of, well, anything you can imagine (including, unfortunately, deepfakes so convincing they'd make our grandma believe the orange cats can dance).",

      "description": "Welcome to the course \" Outlier Detection Techniques \".\nAre you Data Scientist or Analyst or maybe you are interested in fraud detection for credit cards, insurance or health care, intrusion detection for cyber-security, or military surveillance for enemy activities?\nWelcome to Outlier Detection Techniques, a course designed to teach you not only how to recognise various techniques but also how to implement them correctly. No matter what you need outlier detection for, this course brings you both theoretical and practical knowledge, starting with basic and advancing to more complex algorithms. You can even hone your programming skills because all algorithms you’ll learn have implementation in PYTHON, R and SAS.\nSo what do you need to know before you get started? In short, not much! This course is perfect even for those with no knowledge of statistics and linear algebra.\nWhy wait? Start learning today! Because Everyone, who deals with the data,  needs to know  \"Outlier Detection Techniques\"!\n\n\n\n\nThe process of identifying outliers has many names in Data Mining and Machine learning such as outlier mining, outlier modeling, novelty detection or anomaly detection. Outlier detection algorithms are useful in areas such as: Data Mining, Machine Learning, Data Science, Pattern Recognition, Data Cleansing, Data Warehousing, Data Analysis, and Statistics.\nI will present you on the one hand, very popular algorithms used in industry, but on the other hand, i will introduce you also new and advanced methods developed in recent years, coming from Data Mining.\nYou will learn algorithms for detection outliers in Univariate space, in Low-dimensional space and also learn innovative algorithm for detection outliers in High-dimensional space.\nI am convinced that only those who are familiar with the details of the methodology and know all the stages of the calculation, can understand it in depth. So, in my teaching method, I put a stronger emphasis on understanding the material, and less on programming. However, anyone who interested in programming, I developed all algorithms in R , Python and SAS,  so you can download and run them.\n\n\nList of Algorithms:\nUnivariate space:\n1. Three Sigma Rule ( Statistics , R + Python + SAS programming languages)\n2. MAD ( Statistics , R + Python + SAS programming languages )\n3. Boxplot Rule ( Statistics , R + Python + SAS programming languages )\n4. Adjusted Boxplot Rule ( Statistics , R + Python + SAS programming languages )\nLow-dimensional Space :\n5. Mahalanobis Rule ( Statistics , R + Python + SAS programming languages )\n6. LOF - Local Outlier Factor ( Data Mining , R + Python + SAS programming languages)\n\n\nHigh-dimensional Space:\n7. ABOD - Angle-Based Outlier Detection ( Data Mining , R + Python + SAS programming languages)\nI sincerely hope you will enjoy the course.",

      "description": "When people talk about artificial intelligence, they usually don’t mean supervised and unsupervised machine learning.\nThese tasks are pretty trivial compared to what we think of AIs doing - playing chess and Go, driving cars, and beating video games at a superhuman level.\nReinforcement learning has recently become popular for doing all of that and more.\nMuch like deep learning, a lot of the theory was discovered in the 70s and 80s but it hasn’t been until recently that we’ve been able to observe first hand the amazing results that are possible.\nIn 2016 we saw Google’s AlphaGo beat the world Champion in Go.\nWe saw AIs playing video games like Doom and Super Mario.\nSelf-driving cars have started driving on real roads with other drivers and even carrying passengers (Uber), all without human assistance.\nIf that sounds amazing, brace yourself for the future because the law of accelerating returns dictates that this progress is only going to continue to increase exponentially.\nLearning about supervised and unsupervised machine learning is no small feat.\nAnd yet reinforcement learning opens up a whole new world. As you’ll learn in this course, the reinforcement learning paradigm is more different from supervised and unsupervised learning than they are from each other.\nIt’s led to new and amazing insights both in behavioural psychology and neuroscience. As you’ll learn in this course, there are many analogous processes when it comes to teaching an agent and teaching an animal or even a human. It’s the closest thing we have so far to a true general artificial intelligence. What’s covered in this course?\nDeep Learning.\nGoogle Colab\nAnaconda.\nJupiter Notebook.\nActivation Function.\nKeras.\nPandas.\nTensorFlow 2.0\nNeural Network\nMatplotlib.\nscikit-learn.\nOpenAI Gym.\nPytorch.\nPolicy gradient algorithm.\nMarkov Chain.\nPolicy iteration algorithm.\nMonte Carlo method.\nQ-Learning.\nDeep-Q networks.\nDouble Deep-Q networks.\nDuelling Deep-Q networks.\nREINFORCE algorithm.\nThe multi-armed bandit problem.\nWays to calculate means and moving averages and their relationship to stochastic gradient descent.\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs).\nDynamic Programming.\nTemporal Difference (TD) Learning (Q-Learning and SARSA).\nActor-critic algorithm.\nAdvantage Actor-Critic (A2C).\nDeep Recurrent Q-Learning algorithm and DRQN agent Implementation .\nAsynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm and A3C agent Implementation.\nProximal Policy Optimization algorithm and PPO agent Implementation .\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm and DDPG agent Implementation.\nContextual bandits.\nIf you’re ready to take on a brand new challenge, and learn about AI techniques that you’ve never seen before in traditional supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, or even deep learning, then this course is for you.\nMoreover, the course is packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life examples. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get some hands-on practice building your own models. There are five big projects on healthcare problems and one small project to practice. These projects are listed below:\nRobot control.\nHill Climbing game.\nAtari game.\nFrozen Lake environment.\nCoin Flipping gamble\nCalculating Pi.\nBlackjack game.\nWindy Gridworld environment playground.\nTaxi problem.\nThe MAB problem.\nMountain car environment.\nOnline Advertisement.\nCryptocurrency Trading Agents.\nBuilding Stock/Share Trading Agents.\nThat is all. See you in class!\n\n\n\"If you can't implement it, you don't understand it\"\nOr as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: \"What I cannot create, I do not understand\".\nMy courses are the ONLY course where you will learn how to implement deep REINFORCEMENT LEARNING algorithms from scratch\nOther courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?\nAfter doing the same thing with 10 datasets, you realize you didn't learn 10 things. You learned 1 thing, and just repeated the same 3 lines of code 10 times...",

It is a user friendly software which allows to create new function commands to solve statistical problems. It runs on a variety of UNIX platforms (and similar systems such as LINUX), Windows and Mac OS.\nR is the most preferred open-source language for analytics and data science. At Microsoft, R is used by its data scientists, who apply machine learning to data from Bing, Azure, Office, and the Sales, Marketing, and Finance departments. Twitter has been using R for measuring user-experience. On the other hand, the cross-platform compatibility of R and its capacity to handle large and complex data sets make it an ideal tool for academicians to analyze data in their labs.\nR can be used for simple calculations, matrix calculations, differential equations, optimisation, statistical analysis, plotting graphs, etc. Also, it is useful to anybody who wishes to undertake extensive statistical computations and data visualization.\nAny data analysis is incomplete without statistics. After getting the data, any statistical analysis starts with descriptive statistics which aims to extract the information hidden inside the data. The tools of descriptive statistics are based on mathematical and statistical functions which are to be evaluated using the software. The statistical software are paid as well as free. Most of the statistical software are paid software. A popular free statistical software is R.\nWhat are the basic tools of descriptive statistics and how to use the R software for descriptive statistical analysis is the objective of the course to be taught.",

We learn about the term artificial intelligence and its origins. We then define the term in the current context.\n\n\nOnce these basics are clear, we move on to Understand the various types of Artificial Intelligences like Regression, Classification and Clustering. We also look at reinforced learning and its uses. We talk about each of these in detail along with some real-life examples. We also Take a look back at some real-life artificial intelligence examples like a self-driving car and try to Segment the AI used in this into constituent components like regression classification and clustering.\n\n\nOnce equipped with the basic understanding, we define the parts of Artificial Intelligence systems in detail and use real life examples to clarify concepts. The parts like input data, algorithm and output are pretty much common across artificial intelligence models. Having a clear understanding of these as well as their limitations is necessary for strong foundations in the subject.\n\n\nFinally, we develop our own usable AI models. These models are created using no-code method but are completely customizable. In fact, you can even download the code for the AI models that you have created and use it as you would like it. You will define the input, select the algorithm to be used and finally will also evaluate the output produced by the model.\n\n\nThe models we create are:\nImage Detection Model\nPose Detection Model\nAudio Detection Model\nThe course is supposed to be purchased by adults over the age of 18.

Everything is here, in this course, explained visually, step by step.\nSo, what’s covered in this course?\nFirst of all, we are going to study some more techniques to evaluate the mean differences. If you took the intermediate course- which I highly recommend you – you learned about the t tests and the between-subjects analysis of variance. Now we will go to the next level and tackle the analysis of covariance, the within-subjects analysis of variance and the mixed analysis of variance.\nNext, in the section about the predictive techniques, we will approach the logistic regression, which is used when the dependent variable is not continuous – in other words, it is categorical. We are going to study three types of logistic regression: binomial, ordinal and multinomial.\nThen we are going to deal with the grouping techniques. Here you will find out, in detail, how to perform the multidimensional scaling, the principal component analysis and the factor analysis, the simple and the multiple correspondence analysis, the cluster analysis (both k-means and hierarchical) , the simple and the multiple discriminant analysis.\nSo after finishing this course, you will be a real expert in statistical analysis with R – you will know a lot of sophisticated, state-of-the art analysis techniques that will allow you to deeply scrutinize your data and get the most information out of it.

      "description": "Gartner has ranked Microsoft a Leader in the Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms for the thirteenth year in a row.\nPower BI makes it incredibly simple to consolidate your data into a single location for improved accessibility, organisation, and visibility in your reporting efforts. It supports up to 70+ connectors, allowing businesses to load data from a wide range of popular cloud-based sources, including Azure (Azure Data Warehouse), DropBox, Google Analytics, OneDrive, and SalesForce, as well as Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, and data stored on-premises, such as SQL Database.\nYou can load pre-built Power BI dashboards in seconds and execute advanced data analysis in minutes with these built-in connections. You can always further customise aspects to your preference, or have your data professionals start by importing your datasets and creating your own dashboards and reports.\nPower BI’s drag-and-drop interface also eliminates the need to code or copy and paste anything to get started, and Power BI can combine various files (like Excel spreadsheets) and analyse the combined data in a single report.\nPower BI’s Power Pivot data modelling engine (shared with Excel) is a highly performant columnar database that compresses databases and ensures they load fully into memory for the greatest possible speed.\nIt’s fairly uncommon for your Power BI Workbook (.PBIX file) to be much less than your original data sets – in fact, 1GB databases are typically compressed down to roughly 50 – 200MB in size.\nWhile Excel begins to slow down when dealing with huge models, Power BI is designed to handle tables with more than 100 million records without breaking a sweat. Power BI also uses automatic, incremental refreshes to ensure data is constantly up to date, which is a great benefit that further simplifies visual reporting for end users.\nIn summary, Power BI effectively condenses and loads millions of records into memory, allowing end-users to have a faster and more responsive data analysis experience.\nPower BI has a multitude of pre-packaged basic data graphics to use in your interactive reports, including bar, column, line, map, matrix, pie charts, scatter, table, and waterfall – each with its own set of customisation options for improved presentation and usefulness.\nHowever, to add a personal touch, you may utilise free custom graphics produced by developers (or in-house) and shared with the Power BI community to display your data in the best way possible.\nThere’s a remarkable selection of rich and complicated graphics to take use of, including bullet graphs, correlation plots, decision trees, heatmaps, sparklines, and more, with custom visual files accessible from both Microsoft and the community over at the AppSource Marketplace.\nIf you want to show your data in a unique way, Power BI allows you to easily design your own visualisations rather than being limited to the standard options. It’s also really beneficial to observe and apply what the larger Power BI community is doing to improve your own design skills.",

      "description": "This is a hands-on, project-based course designed to help you master the foundations for unsupervised machine learning in Python.\n\n\nWe’ll start by reviewing the Python data science workflow, discussing the techniques & applications of unsupervised learning, and walking through the data prep steps required for modeling. You’ll learn how to set the correct row granularity for modeling, apply feature engineering techniques, select relevant features, and scale your data using normalization and standardization.\n\n\nFrom there we'll fit, tune, and interpret 3 popular clustering models using scikit-learn. We’ll start with K-Means Clustering, learn to interpret the output’s cluster centers, and use inertia plots to select the right number of clusters. Next, we’ll cover Hierarchical Clustering, where we’ll use dendrograms to identify clusters and cluster maps to interpret them. Finally, we’ll use DBSCAN to detect clusters and noise points and evaluate the models using their silhouette score.\n\n\nWe’ll also use DBSCAN and Isolation Forests for anomaly detection, a common application of unsupervised learning models for identifying outliers and anomalous patterns. You’ll learn to tune and interpret the results of each model and visualize the anomalies using pair plots.\n\n\nNext, we’ll introduce the concept of dimensionality reduction, discuss its benefits for data science, and explore the stages in the data science workflow in which it can be applied. We’ll then cover two popular techniques: Principal Component Analysis, which is great for both feature extraction and data visualization, and t-SNE, which is ideal for data visualization.\n\n\nLast but not least, we’ll introduce recommendation engines, and you'll practice creating both content-based and collaborative filtering recommenders using techniques such as Cosine Similarity and Singular Value Decomposition.\n\n\nThroughout the course you'll play the role of an Associate Data Scientist for the HR Analytics team at a software company trying to increase employee retention. Using the skills you learn throughout the course, you'll use Python to segment the employees, visualize the clusters, and recommend next steps to increase retention.\n\n\nCOURSE OUTLINE:\n\n\nIntro to Data Science in Python\nIntroduce the fields of data science and machine learning, review essential skills, and introduce each phase of the data science workflow\n\n\nUnsupervised Learning 101\nReview the basics of unsupervised learning, including key concepts, types of techniques and applications, and its place in the data science workflow\n\n\nPre-Modeling Data Prep\nRecap the data prep steps required to apply unsupervised learning models, including restructuring data, engineering & scaling features, and more\n\n\nClustering\nApply three different clustering techniques in Python and learn to interpret their results using metrics, visualizations, and domain expertise\n\n\nAnomaly Detection\nUnderstand where anomaly detection fits in the data science workflow, and apply techniques like Isolation Forests and DBSCAN in Python\n\n\nDimensionality Reduction\nUse techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE in Python to reduce the number of features in a data set without losing information\n\n\nRecommenders\nRecognize the variety of approaches for creating recommenders, then apply unsupervised learning techniques in Python, including Cosine Similarity and Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)\n\n\n__________\n\n\nReady to dive in?

      "description": "Case Studies in Data Mining was originally taught as three separate online data mining courses. We examine three case studies which together present a broad-based tour of the basic and extended tasks of data mining in three different domains: (1) predicting algae blooms; (2) detecting fraudulent sales transactions; and (3) predicting stock market returns. The cumulative \"hands-on\" 3-course fifteen sessions showcase the use of Luis Torgo's amazingly useful \"Data Mining with R\" (DMwR) package and R software. Everything that you see on-screen is included with the course: all of the R scripts; all of the data files and R objects used and/or referenced; as well as all of the R packages' documentation. You can be new to R software and/or to data mining and be successful in completing the course. The first case study, Predicting Algae Blooms, provides instruction regarding the many useful, unique data mining functions contained in the R software 'DMwR' package. For the algae blooms prediction case, we specifically look at the tasks of data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive model construction. For individuals completely new to R, the first two sessions of the algae blooms case (almost 4 hours of video and materials) provide an accelerated introduction to the use of R and RStudio and to basic techniques for inputting and outputting data and text. Detecting Fraudulent Transactions is the second extended data mining case study that showcases the DMwR (Data Mining with R) package. The case is specific but may be generalized to a common business problem: How does one sift through mountains of data (401,124 records, in this case) and identify suspicious data entries, or \"outliers\"? The case problem is very unstructured, and walks through a wide variety of approaches and techniques in the attempt to discriminate the \"normal\", or \"ok\" transactions, from the abnormal, suspicious, or \"fraudulent\" transactions. This case presents a large number of alternative modeling approaches, some of which are appropriate for supervised, some for unsupervised, and some for semi-supervised data scenarios. The third extended case, Predicting Stock Market Returns is a data mining case study addressing the domain of automatic stock trading systems. These four sessions address the tasks of building an automated stock trading system based on prediction models that utilize daily stock quote data. The goal is to predict future returns for the S&P 500 market index. The resulting predictions are used together with a trading strategy to make decisions about generating market buy and sell orders. The case examines prediction problems that stem from the time ordering among data observations, that is, from the use of time series data. It also exemplifies the difficulties involved in translating model predictions into decisions and actions in the context of 'real-world' business applications.",

If you spend them, which is very unlikely, you will pay only for what you use.\nBy following course lectures, you will learn about Amazon Web Services, especially Lambda, API Gateway, S3, CloudWatch and others. You will be introduced with various real-life use cases which deploy different kinds of machine learning models, such as NLP, deep learning computer vision or regression models. We will use different ML frameworks - scikit-learn, spaCy, Keras / Tensorflow - and show how to prepare them for AWS Lambda. You will also be introduced with easy-to-use and effective Serverless Framework which makes Lambda creation and deployment very easy.\nAlthough this course doesn't focus much on techniques for training and fine-tuning machine learning models, there will be some examples of training the model in Jupyter Notebook and usage of pre-trained models.",

It has a huge impact on our everyday life, and this crisis is increasing day by day. In the near future, it seems difficult to eradicate this virus completely.\nTo counter this virus, Face Masks have become an integral part of our lives. These Masks are capable of stopping the spread of this deadly virus, which will help to control the spread. As we have started moving forward in this ‘new normal’ world, the necessity of the face mask has increased. So here, we are going to build a model that will be able to classify whether the person is wearing a mask or not. This model can be used in crowded areas like Malls, Bus stands, and other public places.\n\n\nThis is a hands-on Data Science guided project on Covid-19 Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts. We will build a Convolutional Neural Network classifier to classify people based on whether they are wearing masks or not and we will make use of OpenCV to detect human faces on the video streams. No unnecessary lectures. As our students like to say :\n\"Short, sweet, to the point course\"\n\n\nThe same techniques can be used in :\n\n\nSkin cancer detection\nNormal pneumonia detection\nBrain defect analysis\nRetinal Image Analysis\n\n\nEnroll now and You will receive a CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION and we encourage you to add this project to your resume. At a time when the entire world is troubled by Coronavirus, this project can catapult your career to another level.\n\n\nSo bring your laptop and start building, training and testing the Data Science Covid 19 Convolutional Neural Network model right now.\n\n\n\n\nYou will learn:\n\n\nHow to detect Face masks on the static images as well as in the video streams.\nClassify people who are wearing masks or not using deep learning\nLearn to Build and train a Convolutional neural network\nMake a prediction on new data using the trained CNN Model\n\n\n\n\nWe will be completing the following tasks:\n\n\n\n\nTask 1: Getting Introduced to Google Colab Environment & importing necessary libraries\n\n\nTask 2: Downloading the dataset directly from the Kagge to the Colab environment.\n\n\nTask :3 Data visualization (Image Visualization)\n\n\nTask 4: Data augmentation & Normalization\n\n\nTask 5: Building Convolutional neural network model\n\n\nTask 6: Compiling & Training CNN Model\n\n\nTask 7: Performance evaluation & Testing the model & saving the model for future use\n\n\nTask 8: Make use of the trained model to detect face masks on the static image uploaded from the local system\n\n\nTask 9: Make use of the trained model to detect face masks on the video streams\n\n\nSo, grab a coffee, turn on your laptop, click on the ENROLL NOW button, and start learning right now.",

      "description": "Nature offers a wide range of inspirations for biological processes to be incorporated into technology and computing. Some of these processes and patterns have been inspiring the development of algorithms that can be used to solve real-world problems. They are called bio-inspired algorithms, whose inspiration in nature allows for applications in various optimization and classification problems.\nIn this course, you will learn the theoretical and mainly the practical implementation of the main and mostly used bio-inspired algorithms! By the end of the course you will have all the tools you need to build artificial intelligence solutions that can be applied to your own problems! The course is divided into six sections that cover different algorithms applied in real-world case studies. See below the projects that will be implemented step by step:\n\n\nGenetic Algorithms (GA): It is one of the most used and well-known bio-inspired algorithm to solve optimization problems. It is based on biological evolution in which populations of individuals evolve over generations through mutation, selection, and crossing over. We will solve the flight schedule problem and the goal is to minimize the price of air line tickets and the time spend waiting at the airport.\nDifferential Evolution (DE): It is also inspired in biological evolution and the case study we will solve step by step is the creation of menus, correctly balancing the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\nNeural Networks (ANN): It is based on how biological neurons work and is considered one of the most modern techniques to solve complex problems, such as: chatbots, automatic translators, self driving cars, voice recognition, among many others. The case study will be the creation of a neural network for image classification.\nClonal Selection Algorithm (CSA): It is based on the functioning of the optimization of the antibody response against an antigen, resembling the process of biological evolution. These concepts will be used in practice for digit identification and digit generation.\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO): It relies on the social behavior of animals, in which the swarm tries to find the best solution to a specific problem. The problem to be solved will be the timetable: there is a course, people who want to take it and different timetables. In the end, the algorithm will indicate the best times for each class to take the course.\nAnt Colony Optimization (ACO): It is based on concepts of how ants search for food in nature. The case study will be one of the most classic in the area, which is the choice of the shortest path.\nEach type of problem requires different techniques for its solution. When you understand the intuition and implementation of bio-inspired algorithms, it is easier to identify which techniques are the best to be applied in each scenario. During the course, all the code will be implemented step by step using the Python programming language! We are going to use Google Colab, so you do not have to worry about installing libraries on your machine, as everything will be developed online using Google's GPUs!",

      "description": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning. In the RL training method, desired actions are rewarded, and undesired actions are punished. In general, an RL agent can understand and interpret its environment, take actions, and also learn through trial and error.\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is also a subfield of machine learning. In Deep RL, intelligent machines and software are trained to learn from their actions in the same way that humans learn from experience. That is, Deep RL blends RL techniques with Deep Learning (DL) strategies.\nDeep RL has the capability to solve complex problems that were unmanageable by machines in the past. Therefore, the potential applications of Deep RL in various sectors such as robotics, medicine, finance, gaming, smart grids, and more are enormous.\nThe phenomenal ability of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to process unstructured information fast and learn like a human brain is starting to be exploited only now. We are only in the initial stages of seeing the full impact of the technology that combines the power of RL and ANNs. This latest technology has the potential to revolutionize every sphere of commerce and science.\n\n\nHow Is This Course Different?\nIn this detailed Learning by Doing course, each new theoretical explanation is followed by practical implementation. This course offers you the right balance between theory and practice. Six projects have been included in the course curriculum to simplify your learning. The focus is to teach RL and Deep RL to a beginner. Hence, we have tried our best to simplify things.\n\n\nThe course ‘A Complete Guide to Reinforcement & Deep Reinforcement Learning’ reflects the most in-demand workplace skills. The explanations of all the theoretical concepts are clear and concise. The instructors lay special emphasis on complex theoretical concepts, making it easier for you to understand them. The pace of the video presentation is neither fast nor slow. It’s perfect for learning. You will understand all the essential RL and Deep RL concepts and methodologies. The course is:\n• Simple and easy to learn.\n• Self-explanatory.\n• Highly detailed.\n• Practical with live coding.\n• Up-to-date covering the latest knowledge of this field.\n\n\nAs this course is an exhaustive compilation of all the fundamental concepts, you will be motivated to learn RL and Deep RL. Your learning progress will be quick. You are certain to experience much more than what you learn. At the end of each new concept, a revision task such as Homework/activity/quiz is assigned. The solutions for these tasks are also provided. This is to assess and promote your learning. The whole process is closely linked to the concepts and methods you have already learned. A majority of these activities are coding-based, as the goal is to prepare you for real-world implementations.\nIn addition to high-quality video content, you will also get access to easy-to-understand course material, assessment questions, in-depth subtopic notes, and informative handouts in this course. You are welcome to contact our friendly team in case of any queries related to the course, and we assure you of a prompt response.\n\n\nThe course tutorials are subdivided into 145+ short HD videos. In every video, you’ll learn something new and fascinating. In addition, you’ll learn the key concepts and methodologies of RL and Deep RL, along with several practical implementations. The total runtime of the course videos is 14+ hours.\n\n\nWhy Should You Learn RL & Deep RL?\nRL and Deep RL are the hottest research topics in the Artificial Intelligence universe.\n\n\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning concerned with the actions that intelligent agents need to take in an environment in order to maximize the reward. RL is one of three essential machine learning paradigms, besides supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\nLet’s look at the next hot research topic.\n\n\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is a subset of machine learning that blends Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Learning (DL). Deep RL integrates deep learning into the solution, permitting agents to make decisions from unstructured input data without human intervention. Deep RL algorithms can take in large inputs (e.g., every pixel rendered to the user’s screen in a video game) and determine the best actions to perform to optimize an objective (e.g., attain the maximum game score).\nDeep RL has been used for an assortment of applications, including but not limited to video games, oil & gas, natural language processing, computer vision, retail, education, transportation, and healthcare.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Content:\nThe comprehensive course consists of the following topics:\n1.

however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis You will want to know either Python or R and SQL SQL is a query language designed for relational databases Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases Those are the three most-used programming languages Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up\nHow long does it take to become a data scientist?\nThis answer, of course, varies The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn It will also depend on your starting place If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field\nHow can ı learn data science on my own?\nIt is possible to learn data science projects on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available Start by determining what interests you about data science If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated\nDoes data science require coding?\nThe jury is still out on this one Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skillset\nWhat skills should a data scientist know?\nA data scientist requires many skills They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science Familiarity with machine learning is also important Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point Finally, to communicate findings\nIs data science a good career?\nThe demand for data scientists is growing We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers The jobs also generally pay well This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you First and foremost, you must think analytically Data science from scratch is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks\nPython vs R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools When deciding between Python and R in data science , you need to think about your specific needs On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object To generate an object in Python you need a class You can think of a class as a template You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications You can use Python to create desktop applications Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own\nWhat is R and why is it useful?\nThe R programming language was created specifically for statistical programming Many find it useful for data handling, cleaning, analysis, and representation R is also a popular language for data science projects Much of the data used for data science can be messy and complex The programming language has features and libraries available geared toward cleaning up unorganized data and making complex data structures easier to handle that can't be found in other languages It also provides powerful data visualization tools to help data scientists find patterns in large sets of data and present the results in expressive reports Machine learning is another area where the R language is useful R gives developers an extensive selection of machine learning libraries that will help them find trends in data and predict future events\nWhat careers use R?\nR is a popular programming language for data science, business intelligence, and financial analysis Academic, scientific, and non-profit researchers use the R language to glean answers from data R is also widely used in market research and advertising to analyze the results of marketing campaigns and user data The language is used in quantitative analysis, where its data analysis capabilities give financial experts the tools they need to manage portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other assets Data scientists use R in many industries to turn data into insights and predict future trends with its machine learning capabilities Data analysts use R to extract data, analyze it, and turn it into reports that can help enterprises make better business decisions Data visualization experts use R to turn data into visually appealing graphs and charts\nIs R difficult to learn?\nWhether R is hard to learn depends on your experience After all, R is a programming language designed for mathematicians, statisticians, and business analysts who may have no coding experience For some beginning users, it is relatively simple to learn R It can have a learning curve if you are a business analyst who is only familiar with graphical user interfaces since R is a text-based programming language But compared to other programming languages, users usually find R easier to understand R also may have an unfamiliar syntax for programmers who are used to other programming languages, but once they learn the syntax, the learning process becomes more straightforward Beginners will also find that having some knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and probabilities makes learning R easier\nPython vs R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools When deciding between Python and R, you need to think about your specific needs On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics,

      "description": "Hi There!\n\n\nwelcome to my new course 'YOLO Custom Object Detection Quick Starter with Python'. This is the fourth course from my Computer Vision series.\n\n\nAs you know Object Detection is the most used applications of Computer Vision, in which the computer will be able to recognize and classify objects inside an image.\n\n\nWe will be specifically focusing on (YOLO), You only look once which is an effective real-time object recognition algorithm which is featured in Darknet, an open source neural network framework\n\n\nThis course is equally divided into two halves. The first half will deal with object recognition using a predefined dataset called the coco dataset which can classify 80 classes of objects. And the second half we will try to create our own custom dataset and train the YOLO model. We will try to create our own coronavirus detection model.\n\n\nLet's now see the list of interesting topics that are included in this course.\n\n\nAt first we will have an introductory theory session about YOLO Object Detection system.\n\n\nAfter that, we are ready to proceed with preparing our computer for python coding by downloading and installing the anaconda package and will check and see if everything is installed fine.\n\n\nMost of you may not be coming from a python based programming background. The next few sessions and examples will help you get the basic python programming skill to proceed with the sessions included in this course. The topics include Python assignment, flow-control, functions and data structures.\n\n\nThen we will install install OpenCV, which is the Open Source Computer Vision library in Python.\n\n\nThen we will have an introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks , its working and the different steps involved.\n\n\nNow we will proceed with the part 1 that involves Object Detection and Recognition using YOLO pre-trained model. we will have an overview about the yolo model in the next session and then we will implement yolo object detection from a single image.\n\n\nOften YOLO gives back more than one successful detection for a single object in an image. This can be fixed using\na technique called as NMS or Non Maxima Suppression. We will implement that in our next session.\n\n\nAnd using that as the base, we will try the yolo model for object detection from a real time webcam video and we will check the performance. Later we will use it for object recognition from the pre-saved video file.\n\n\nThen we will proceed with part 2 of the course in which we will attempt to train a darknet YOLO model. A model which can detect coronavirus from an electron microscope image or video output.\n\n\nBefore we proceed with the implementation, we will discuss the pros and cons of using a pre-trained dataset model and a custom dataset trained model. Also about the free GPU offered by google colab and its features.\n\n\nIn the next session we will start with phase 1 of our custom model in which we will do the preparation steps to implement custom model. We will at first download the darknet source from github and prepare it. We will then download the weight files required for both testing and training. And then we will edit the required configurations files to make it ready for our custom coronavirus detector.\n\n\nIn the second phase for our custom model, we will start collecting the required data to train the model. We will collect coronavirus images from the internet as much as we could and organize them into folder. Then we will label or annotate the coronavirus object inside these images using an opensource annotation tool called labelImg. Then we will split the gathered dataset, 80% for training and 20% for testing. And finally will edit the prepare the files with the location of training and testing datasets.\n\n\nNow that we have all our files ready, in our third  phase, we will zip and upload them into google drive. After that we will create a google colab notebook and configure the colab runtime to use the fast, powerful, yet free GPU service provided by google. Then we will mount our google drive to our colab runtime and unzip the darknet zip we uploaded.\n\n\nSometimes files edited in non unix environments may be having problems when compiling the darknet. We have to convert the encoding from dos to unix as our next step. Then we will complile the darknet framework source code and proceed with testing the darknet framework with a sample image in our fourth phase.\n\n\nThe free GPU based runtime provided by google colab is volatile. It will get reset every 12 hours. So we need to save our weights periodically during training to our google drive which is a permanent storage. So in our phase five, we will link a backup folder in google drive to the colab runtime.\n\n\nFinally in our phase 6, we are ready to proceed with training our custom coronavirus model. We will keep on monitoring the loss for every iteration or epoch as we call it in nerual network terms. Our model will automatically save the weights every 100th epoch securely to our google drive backup folder.\n\n\nWe can see a continues decrease in the loss values as we go through the epoch. And after many number of iterations, our model will come into a convergence or flatline state in which there is no further improvement in loss. at that time we will obtain a final weight\n\n\nLater we will use that weight to do prediction for an image that contains coronavirus in it. We can see that our model clearly detects objects. We will even try this with a video file also.\n\n\nWe cannot claim that its a fully fledged flawless production ready coronavirus detection model. There is still room for improvement. But anyway, by building this custom model, we came all the way through the steps and process of making a custom yolo model which will be a great and valuable experience for you.\n\n\nAnd then later in a quick session, we will also discuss few other case studies in which we can implement a custom trained YOLO model, the changes we may  need to make for training those models etc.\nThat's all about the topics which are currently included in this quick course. The code, images and weights used in this course has been uploaded and shared in a folder. I will include the link to download them in the last session or the resource section of this course. You are free to use the code in your projects with no questions asked.\n\n\nAlso after completing this course, you will be provided with a course completion certificate which will add value to your portfolio.\n\n\nSo that's all for now, see you soon in the class room. Happy learning and have a great time.",

      "description": "I started out wanting to learn AI Object Detection in Computer Vision...\n... I used to check a lot of GitHub repos, they were very vague and required for me to be competent in software development/programming and understand all of the jargon –\nNow even though I have a masters degree in electronic engineering (M.Eng). It was still challenging for me to figure out. I had a lot of questions like...\n...What to do to get my code working?\nDo I have the right hardware\nWindows or Linux – If linux, do I use Ubuntu, Red Hat, CentOS, ROS\nIf Ubuntu, what version 16.04, 18.04, What kernel do I need?\nIf I am training, what format does my dataset need to be in?\nDo I use Python or C++\nIf python What dependencies do I need?\nWhich frameworks do I use? PyTorch, TensorFlow 1.0 or 2.0\nWhat commands do I type to infer or train a convolutional neural network\nHow big my dataset needs to be?\nHow do I run on GPU, and does my GPU support the framework?\nHow to train YOLOv4\nHow create cross platform apps using Yolov4 and PyQt\nI was unsure of what to do. Sometimes I would look at the instructions and because the instructions were so vague, I would skip to the next repo and the next, until I found one that resonates with me or one that had a clear set of instructions that I could understand and follow, or had a video tutorial on it. And video tutorials on this particular topic are very scarce.\nThe other problem was, I would follow the instructions, but I would run in trivial issues, like not having the correct dependencies or I did not have the correct hardware or OS etc. When things don’t work. This would beat me down and make me loose confidence of whether or not this repository would work. Now I had 2 options, I could either spend tons of hours searching the web to debug the issue or move on to the next repo which also may or may not work.\nThen, I thought, if me with a masters degree in electronic engineering had all these issues with getting started in AI, surely other people would be having this same issue as me. People such as:\nnon-programmers/non computer science ,\nHobbyists, Students, researcher, employees.\nPeople starting out in AI....\nThe YOLOv4 Object Detection Course\nWhen YOLOv4 was released in April 2020, my team and I worked effortlessly to create a course in which will help you implement YOLOv4 with ease. We created this Nano course in which you will learn the basics and get started with YOLOv4. This is all about getting object detection working with YOLOv4 in your windows 10 PC.\nYou will learn how to install all the dependencies, including Python, CUDA and OpenCV. Once you’ve managed to compile it successfully, we go on to execute YOLOv4 on images and videos. Then to ensure that you understand whats going on, we delve deeper into the darknet python script and show you how to also run YOLOv4 on a webcam.\nWithin this nano-course, we shall also create our first weapon against COVID-19 which is our social distancing monitoring app. Which essentially monitors the physical distance between people to ensure that they’re keeping safe distancing from each other. It also displays the number of people at risk at any given time\nThe YOLOv4  Course provides you with a gentle introduction to the world of computer vision with YOLOv4, first by learning how to install darknet, building libraries for YOLOv4 all the way to implementing YOLOv4 on images and videos in real-time.\nFrom here you will even solve current and relevant real-world problems by building your own social-distancing monitoring app.\nRequirements\nPlease ensure that you have the following:\nBasic understanding of Computer Vision\nPython Programming Skills\nMid to high range PC/ Laptop\nWindows 10\nCUDA-enabled GPU - Important*\nForward Thinking\nImagine, if a week from now, once you have completed this course, that you are able to implement and implement your own Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) with YOLOv4 object detection pre-trained model. Imagine all the applications you could do with these skills!\nYou could be take your new found expertise and be:\nSolving real world problems,\nFreelancing AI projects,\nGetting that job/opportunity in AI,\nTackling your research guns blazing!\nSaving time, money, &\nWishing you had done this course sooner.\nThe world is your oyster... Ask yourself...What cool things would you do once you have skills in AI?\nSo what are you waiting for?",

      "description": "Machine Learning, python, statistics, data science,  machine learning python, python data science, machine learning a-z, data scientist, r, python for data science |\n\n\nHello there,\nWelcome to the “ Machine Learning Project: Heart Attack Prediction Analysis ” course.\nMachine Learning & Data Science - Boost your Machine Learning skills with a real hands-on heart attack prediction project\n\n\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information about whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that.\nA machine learning course teaches you the techniques and concepts behind the predictive text, virtual assistants, and artificial intelligence. You can develop the foundational skills you need to advance to building neural networks and creating more complex functions through the Python and R programming languages. Machine learning training helps you stay ahead of new trends, technologies, and applications in this field.\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\nData science application is an in-demand skill in many industries worldwide — including finance, transportation, education, manufacturing, human resources, and banking.

For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\n\n\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\n\n\nDoes machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it. An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systems.\n\n\nWhat is the best language for machine learning?\nPython is the most used language in machine learning. Engineers writing machine learning systems often use Jupyter Notebooks and Python together. Jupyter Notebooks is a web application that allows experimentation by creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and more. Machine learning involves trial and error to see which hyperparameters and feature engineering choices work best. It's useful to have a development environment such as Python so that you don't need to compile and package code before running it each time. Python is not the only language choice for machine learning. Tensorflow is a popular framework for developing neural networks and offers a C++ API. There is a machine learning framework for C# called ML. NET. Scala or Java are sometimes used with Apache Spark to build machine learning systems that ingest massive data sets. You may find yourself using many different languages in machine learning, but Python is a good place to start.\n\n\nWhat are the different types of machine learning?\nMachine learning is generally divided between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. In supervised machine learning, we train machine learning models on labeled data. For example, an algorithm meant to detect spam might ingest thousands of email addresses labeled 'spam' or 'not spam.' That trained model could then identify new spam emails even from data it's never seen. In unsupervised learning, a machine learning model looks for patterns in unstructured data. One type of unsupervised learning is clustering. In this example, a model could identify similar movies by studying their scripts or cast, then group the movies together into genres. This unsupervised model was not trained to know which genre a movie belongs to. Rather, it learned the genres by studying the attributes of the movies themselves. There are many techniques available within these two types of machine learning, for example deep learning, reinforcement learning, and more.\n\n\nIs machine learning a good career?\nMachine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most popular computer science careers today. Constantly growing and evolving, you can apply machine learning to a variety of industries, from shipping and fulfillment to medical sciences. Machine learning engineers work to create artificial intelligence that can better identify patterns and solve problems. The machine learning discipline frequently deals with cutting-edge, disruptive technologies. However, because it has become a popular career choice, it can also be competitive. Aspiring machine learning engineers can differentiate themselves from the competition through certifications, boot camps, code repository submissions, and hands-on experience.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between machine learning and artifical intelligence?\nMachine learning is a smaller subset of the broader spectrum of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence describes any \"intelligent machine\" that can derive information and make decisions, machine learning describes a method by which it can do so. Through machine learning, applications can derive knowledge without the user explicitly giving out the information. This is one of the first and early steps toward \"true artificial intelligence\" and is extremely useful for numerous practical applications. In machine learning applications, an AI is fed sets of information. It learns from these sets of information about what to expect and what to predict. But it still has limitations. A machine learning engineer must ensure that the AI is fed the right information and can use its logic to analyze that information correctly.\n\n\nWhat skills should a machine learning engineer know?\nA machine learning engineer will need to be an extremely competent programmer with in-depth knowledge of computer science, mathematics, data science, and artificial intelligence theory. Machine learning engineers must be able to dig deep into complex applications and their programming. As with other disciplines, there are entry-level machine learning engineers and machine learning engineers with high-level expertise. Python and R are two of the most popular languages within the machine learning field.\n\n\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\n\n\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\n\n\nWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?\nPython is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quickly.\n\n\nHow long does it take to become a data scientist?\nThis answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.\n\n\nHow can I learn data science on my own?\nIt is possible to learn data science on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting by learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Oak Academy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.\n\n\nDoes data science require coding?\nThe jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skill set.\n\n\nWhat skills should a data scientist know?\nA data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings, data scientists require knowledge of visualizations. Data visualizations allow them to share complex data in an accessible manner.\n\n\nIs data science a good career?\nThe demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. Data science is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds. If this sounds like a great work environment, then it might be a promising career for you.\n\n\nWith my up-to-date course, you will have a chance to keep yourself up-to-date and equip yourself with a range of Python programming skills.

      "description": "If reinforcement learning is to serve as a viable path to artificial general intelligence, it must learn to cope with environments with sparse or totally absent rewards. Most real life systems provided rewards that only occur after many time steps, leaving the agent with little information to build a successful policy on. Curiosity based reinforcement learning solves this problem by giving the agent an innate sense of curiosity about its world, enabling it to explore and learn successful policies for navigating the world.\n\n\nIn this advanced course on deep reinforcement learning, motivated students will learn how to implement cutting edge artificial intelligence research papers from scratch. This is a fast paced course for those that are experienced in coding up actor critic agents on their own. We'll code up two papers in this course, using the popular PyTorch framework.\n\n\nThe first paper covers asynchronous methods for deep reinforcement learning; also known as the popular asynchronous advantage actor critic algorithm (A3C). Here students will discover a new framework for learning that doesn't require a GPU. We will learn how to implement multithreading in Python and use that to train multiple actor critic agents in parallel. We will go beyond the basic implementation from the paper and implement a recent improvement to reinforcement learning known as generalized advantage estimation. We will test our agents in the Pong environment from the Open AI Gym's Atari library, and achieve nearly world class performance in just a few hours.\n\n\nFrom there, we move on to the heart of the course: learning in environments with sparse or totally absent rewards. This new paradigm leverages the agent's curiosity about the environment as an intrinsic reward that motivates the agent to explore and learn generalizable skills. We'll implement the intrinsic curiosity module (ICM), which is a bolt-on module for any deep reinforcement learning algorithm. We will train and test our agent in an maze like environment that only yields rewards when the agent reaches the objective. A clear performance gain over the vanilla A3C algorithm will be demonstrated, conclusively showing the power of curiosity driven deep reinforcement learning.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind this is a fast paced course for motivated and advanced students. There will be only a very brief review of the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning and actor critic methods, and from there we will jump right into reading and implementing papers.\n\n\nThe beauty of both the ICM and asynchronous methods is that these paradigms can be applied to nearly any other reinforcement learning algorithm. Both are highly adaptable and can be plugged in with little modification to algorithms like proximal policy optimization, soft actor critic, or deep Q learning.\n\n\nStudents will learn how to:\nImplement deep reinforcement learning papers\nLeverage multi core CPUs with parallel processing in Python\nCode the A3C algorithm from scratch\nCode the ICM from first principles\nCode generalized advantage estimation\nModify the Open AI Gym Atari Library\nWrite extensible modular code\nThis course is launching with the PyTorch implementation, with a Tensorflow 2 version coming.\n\n\nI'll see you on the inside.",

however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis You will want to know either Python or R and SQL SQL is a query language designed for relational databases Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases Those are the three most-used programming languages Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up\nHow long does it take to become a data scientist?\nThis answer, of course, varies The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn It will also depend on your starting place If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field\nHow can I learn data science on my own?\nIt is possible to learn data science projects on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available Start by determining what interests you about data science If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated\nDoes data science require coding?\nThe jury is still out on this one Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skillset\nWhat skills should a data scientist know?\nA data scientist requires many skills They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science Familiarity with machine learning is also important Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point Finally, to communicate findings\nIs data science a good career?\nThe demand for data scientists is growing We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers The jobs also generally pay well This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you First and foremost, you must think analytically Data science from scratch is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks\nPython vs R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools When deciding between Python and R in data science , you need to think about your specific needs On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object To generate an object in Python you need a class You can think of a class as a template You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications You can use Python to create desktop applications Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning is being applied to virtually every field today That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions\nDoes machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systems\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nWe have prepared this course in the simplest way for

      "description": "Become a Top Performing Data Analyst – Take This Advanced Data Science Course in SPSS!\nWithin a few days only you can master some of the most complex data analysis techniques available in the SPSS program. Even if you are not a professional mathematician or statistician, you will understood these techniques perfectly and will be able to apply them in practical, real life situations.\nThese methods are used every day by data scientists and data miners to make accurate predictions using their raw data. If you want to be a high skilled analyst, you must know them!\nWithout further ado, let’s see what you are going to learn…\nStepwise regression analysis, a technique that helps you select the best subset of predictors for a regression analysis, when you have a big number of predictors. This way you can create regression models that are both parsimonious and effective.\nNonlinear regression analysis. After finishing this course, you will be able to fit any nonlinear regression model using SPSS.\nK nearest neighbor, a very popular predictive technique used mostly for classification purposes. So you will learn how to predict the values of a categorical variable with this method.\nDecision trees. We will approach both binary (CART) and non-binary (CHAID) trees. For each of these two types we will consider two cases: the case of response dependent variables (regression trees) and the case of categorical response variables (classification trees).\nNeural networks. Artificial neural networks are hot now, since they are a suitable predictive tool in many situations. In SPSS we can train two types of neural network: the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function (RBF) network. We are going to study both of them in detail.\nTwo-step cluster analysis, an effective grouping procedure that allows us to identify homogeneous groups in our population. It is useful in very many fields like marketing research, medicine (gene research, for example), biology, computer science, social science etc.\nSurvival analysis. If you have to estimate one of the following: the probable time until a certain event happens, what percentage of your population will suffer the event or which particular circumstances influence the probability that the event happens, than you need to apply on of the survival analysis method studied here: Kaplan-Meier or Cox regression.\nFor each analysis technique, a short theoretical introduction is provided, in order to familiarize the reader with the fundamental notions and concepts related to that technique. Afterwards, the analysis is executed on a real-life data set and the output is thoroughly explained.\nMoreover, for some techniques (KNN, decision trees, neural networks) you will also learn:\nHow to validate your model on an independent data set, using the validation set approach or the cross-validation\nHow to save the model and use it for make predictions on new data that may be available in the future.\nJoin right away and start building sophisticated, in-demand data analysis skills in SPSS!",

Have you ever wondered how specific theories greatly inspire a particular invention?. The same goes with Genetic Algorithms. All of us would have heard of the famous view of Charles Darwin, “Survival of the fittest”, which extends to Evolution by Natural Selection. Inspired by Darwin’s theory, the Genetic Algorithm is a part of Evolutionary Algorithms, specifically to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover, and selection. The Genetic Algorithm can be easily applied to different applications, including Machine Learning, Data Science, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning.\nThis course will teach you to implement genetic algorithm-based optimization in the MATLAB environment, focusing on using the Global Optimization Toolbox. Various kinds of optimization problems are solved in this course.  At the end of this course, you will implement and utilize genetic algorithms to solve your optimization problems. The complete MATLAB programs included in the class are also available for download. This course is designed most straightforwardly to utilize your time wisely. Take advantage of learning and understanding the fast-growing field of evolutionary computation.\nHappy learning.",

There are several practical applications that have already been built using these techniques, such as: self-driving cars, development of new medicines, diagnosis of diseases, automatic generation of news, facial recognition, product recommendation, forecast of stock prices, and many others! The technique used to solve these problems is artificial neural networks, which aims to simulate how the human brain works. They are considered to be the most advanced techniques in the Machine Learning area.\nOne of the most used libraries to implement this type of application is Google TensorFlow, which supports advanced architectures of artificial neural networks. There is also a repository called TensorFlow Hub which contains pre-trained neural networks for solving many kinds of problems, mainly in the area of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. The advantage is that you do not need to train a neural network from scratch! Google itself provides hundreds of ready-to-use models, so you just need to load and use them in your own projects. Another advantage is that few lines of code are needed to get the results!\nIn this course you will have a practical overview of some of the main TensorFlow Hub models that can be applied to the development of Deep Learning projects! At the end, you will have all the necessary tools to use TensorFlow Hub to build complex solutions that can be applied to business problems. See below the projects that you are going to implement:\n\nClassification of five species of flowers\nDetection of over 80 different objects\nCreating new images using style transfer\nUse of GAN (generative adversarial network) to complete missing parts of images\nRecognition of actions in videos\nText polarity classification (positive and negative)\nUse of a question and answer (Q&A) dataset to find similar document\nAudio classification\nAll implementations will be done step by step using Google Colab online, so you do not need to worry about installing and configuring the tools on your own machine!

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Deep Learning with TensorFlow course by Uplatz.\n\n\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source machine learning / deep learning platform. It has a comprehensive ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community resources that lets AI/ML engineers, scientists, analysts build and deploy ML-powered deep learning applications. The name TensorFlow is derived from the operations which neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays or tensors. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is a set of algorithms that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain.\nTensorFlow is a machine learning framework that Google created and used to design, build, and train deep learning models. You can use the TensorFlow library do to numerical computations, which in itself doesn’t seem all too special, but these computations are done with data flow graphs. In these graphs, nodes represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the data, which usually are multidimensional data arrays or tensors, that are communicated between these edges.\nIn simple words, TensorFlow is an open-source and most popular deep learning library for research and production. TensorFlow in Python is a symbolic math library that uses dataflow and differentiable programming to perform various tasks focused on training and inference of deep neural networks. TensorFlow manages to combine a comprehensive and flexible set of technical features with great ease of use.\nThere have been some remarkable developments lately in the world of artificial intelligence, from much publicized progress with self-driving cars to machines now composing imitations or being really good at video games. Central to these advances are a number of tools around to help derive deep learning and other machine learning models, with Torch, Caffe, and Theano amongst those at the fore. However, since Google Brain went open source in November 2015 with their own framework, TensorFlow, the popularity of this software library has skyrocketed to be the most popular deep learning framework.\nTensorFlow enables you to build dataflow graphs and structures to define how data moves through a graph by taking inputs as a multi-dimensional array called Tensor. It allows you to construct a flowchart of operations that can be performed on these inputs, which goes at one end and comes at the other end as output.\nTop organizations such as Google, IBM, Netflix, Disney, Twitter, Micron, all use TensorFlow.\n\n\nUplatz provides this extensive course on TensorFlow. This TensorFlow course covers TensorFlow basics, components, pipelines to advanced topics like linear regression, classifier, create, train and evaluate a neural network like CNN, RNN, auto encoders etc. with TensorFlow examples.\nThe TensorFlow training is designed in such a way that you'll be able to easily implement deep learning project on TensorFlow in an easy and efficient way. In this TensorFlow course you will learn the fundamentals of neural networks and how to build deep learning models using TensorFlow. This TensorFlow training provides a practical approach to deep learning for software engineers. You'll get hands-on experience building your own state-of-the-art image classifiers and other deep learning models. You'll also use your TensorFlow models in the real world on mobile devices, in the cloud, and in browsers. Finally, you'll use advanced techniques and algorithms to work with large datasets. You will acquire skills necessary to start creating your own AI applications and models.\nYou’ll master deep learning concepts and models using TensorFlow frameworks and implement deep learning algorithms, preparing you for a career as Deep Learning Engineer. Learn how to build a neural network and how to train, evaluate and optimize it with TensorFlow.\nTensorFlow is completely based on Python. This course also provides a sound introduction to Python programming concepts, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas so that you can acquire those skills in this course itself before moving on to learn the TensorFlow concepts. The aim of this TensorFlow tutorial is to describe all TensorFlow objects and method.\nThis TensorFlow course also includes a comprehensive description of TensorBoard visualization tool. You will gain an understanding of the mechanics of this tool by using it to solve a general numerical problem, quite outside of what machine learning usually involves, before introducing its uses in deep learning with a simple neural network implementation.\n\n\nTensorFlow Architecture\nTensorFlow architecture works in three parts:\nPreprocessing the data\nBuild the model\nTrain and estimate the model\nIt is called TensorFlow because it takes input as a multi-dimensional array, also known as tensors. You can construct a sort of flowchart of operations (called a Graph) that you want to perform on that input. The input goes in at one end, and then it flows through this system of multiple operations and comes out the other end as output.\nThis is why it is called TensorFlow because the tensor goes in it flows through a list of operations, and then it comes out the other side.\n\n\nTensorFlow - Course Syllabus",

Learn To Build & Deploy Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Auto Ml, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (Nlp) Web Applications Projects With Python (Flask, Django, Heroku, AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM Watson, Streamlit Cloud).\n\n\nWe have been able to process such a voluminous amount of data. We are able to analyze and draw insights from this data owing to these advanced computational systems.\nHowever, despite all these advancements, data remains a vast ocean that is growing every second. While the huge abundance of data can prove useful for the industries, the problem lies in the ability to use this data.\nAs mentioned above, data is fuel but it is a raw fuel that needs to be converted into useful fuel for the industries. In order to make this raw fuel useful, industries require Data Scientists. Therefore, knowledge of data science is a must if you wish to use this data to help companies make powerful decisions.\nAccording to Glassdoor, the average salary for a Data Scientist is $117,345/yr. This is above the national average of $44,564. Therefore, a Data Scientist makes 163% more than the national average salary.\nThis makes Data Science a highly lucrative career choice. It is mainly due to the dearth in Data Scientists resulting in a huge income bubble.\nSince Data Science requires a person to be proficient and knowledgeable in several fields like Statistics, Mathematics and Computer Science, the learning curve is quite steep. Therefore, the value of a Data Scientist is very high in the market.\nA Data Scientist enjoys the position of prestige in the company. The company relies on his expertise to make data-driven decisions and enable them to navigate in the right direction.\nFurthermore, the role of a Data Scientist depends on the specialization of his employer company. For example – A commercial industry will require a data scientist to analyze their sales.\nA health-care company will require data scientists to help them analyze genomic sequences. The salary of a Data Scientist depends on his role and type of work he has to perform. It also depends on the size of the company which is based on the amount of data they utilize.\nStill, the pay scale of Data Scientist is way above other IT and management sectors. However, the salary observed by Data Scientists is proportional to the amount of work that they must put in. Data Science needs hard work and requires a person to be thorough with his/her skills.\n\n\nIn This Course, We Are Going To Work On 100 Real World Projects Listed Below:\n\n\nProject-1: Pan Card Tempering Detector App -Deploy On Heroku\nProject-2: Dog breed prediction Flask App\nProject-3: Image Watermarking App -Deploy On Heroku\nProject-4: Traffic sign classification\nProject-5: Text Extraction From Images Application\nProject-6: Plant Disease Prediction Streamlit App\nProject-7: Vehicle Detection And Counting Flask App\nProject-8: Create A Face Swapping Flask App\nProject-9: Bird Species Prediction Flask App\nProject-10: Intel Image Classification Flask App\n\n\nProject-11: Language Translator App Using IBM Cloud Service -Deploy On Heroku\nProject-12: Predict Views On Advertisement Using IBM Watson -Deploy On Heroku\nProject-13: Laptop Price Predictor -Deploy On Heroku\nProject-14: WhatsApp Text Analyzer -Deploy On Heroku\nProject-15: Course Recommendation System -Deploy On Heroku\nProject-16: IPL Match Win Predictor -Deploy On Heroku\nProject-17: Body Fat Estimator App -Deploy On Microsoft Azure\nProject-18: Campus Placement Predictor App -Deploy On Microsoft Azure\nProject-19: Car Acceptability Predictor -Deploy On Google Cloud\nProject-20: Book Genre Classification App -Deploy On Amazon Web Services\n\n\nProject 21 : DNA classification for finding E.Coli -

But before everything, the introduction of python is discussed. Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages and if we specifically look from the perspective of Data Science, Machine learning and deep learning, there is no other choice then “python” as a programming language.\nFirst of all, there is a crash course on python for those who are not very good with python and then there is an exercise for python that is supposed to be solved by you but if you feel any difficulty in solving the exercise, the solution is also provided.\nThen we moved on towards the Data Science and we start from data parsing using Scrapy then the data visualizations by using several libraries of python and finally we end up learning different data preprocessing techniques. And in the end, there is a complete project that we’ll do together.\nAfter that, we’ll be learning a few classical and a few advanced machine learning algorithms. Some of them will be implemented from scratch and the others will be implemented by using the builtin libraries of python. At the end of every algorithm, there will be a mini-project.\nFinally, Deep learning will be discussed, the basic structure of an artificial neural network and it’s the implementation in TensorFlow followed by a complete deep learning-based project. And in the end, some hyperparameter tuning techniques will be discussed that’ll improve the performance of the model.\nAbout The Instructor:\nBelow is an introduction to Mr. Sajjad Mustafa, the instructor of this course.\nHe an expert in Web Programming, Data Science, and Machine Learning. He has been working on different topics including the above-mentioned ones for almost 3 years and has been teaching on these projects for more than a year. He has attained mastery over understanding the requirements and making a way to the most unique and proper solutions to the given task.\nHe is well acquainted with and has deep knowledge of Python, Ruby, JavaScript.

      "description": "Web scraping is simply automatically opening up any website and grabbing the data you find important on that website. It's fundamental to the internet, search engines, Data Science, automation, machine learning, and much more.\nOpening websites and extracting data are only part of what makes web scraping great. It's the parsing of the data that's where the value is.\nThis project will cover:\nBasic web scraping with Python\nWeb scraping with Selenium\nSync vs Async\nAsynchronous Web scraping with Asyncio\nBut why asynchronous code? What is it? How does it benefit us?\nAsynchrounous code is a way to execute multiple functions basically at once. It's not actually at the exact same time but it's close. (They actually run concurrently). This means that we can do more things in less time and, when it comes to mining or scraping data, this time saving is absolutely significant.\n\n\nImagine for a moment you're recreating google's search engine. You'd have to scrape trillions (if not more) web pages on a regular interval to help with the search results. Of course you're not going to be scraping all of the trillions of pages at once but the idea is that scraping event 1,000 pages would take a very long time doing it synchronously (like using Python requests and/or just selenium).\n\n\nIf you've done a lot of web scraping before but never used Python's aysncio, this course will help you better understand the fundamentals and bring your scraping game to another level.\n\n\nLet's get started!",

RAPIDS is an open-source project originally developed by NVIDIA.\nData science and machine learning represent the largest computational sectors in the world, where modest improvements in the accuracy of analytical models can translate into billions of impact on the bottom line. Data scientists are constantly striving to train, evaluate, iterate, and optimize models to achieve highly accurate results and exceptional performance. With NVIDIA's powerful RAPIDS platform, what used to take days can now be accomplished in a matter of minutes, making the construction and deployment of high-value models easier and more agile. In data science, additional computational power means faster and more effective insights. RAPIDS harnesses the power of NVIDIA CUDA to accelerate the entire data science model training workflow, running it on graphics processing units (GPUs).\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to take your machine learning applications to the next level! Check out some of the topics that will be covered below:\n\nUtilizing the cuDF, cuPy, and cuML libraries instead of Pandas, Numpy, and scikit-learn; ensuring that data is processed and machine learning algorithms are executed with high performance on the GPU.\nComparing the performance of classic Python libraries with RAPIDS. In some experiments conducted during the classes, we achieved acceleration rates exceeding 900x. This indicates that with certain databases and algorithms, RAPIDS can be 900 times faster!\nCreating a complete, step-by-step machine learning project using RAPIDS, from data loading to predictions.\nUsing DASK for task parallelism on multiple GPUs or CPUs; integrated with RAPIDS for superior performance.\nThroughout the course, we will use the Python programming language and the online Google Colab. This way, you don't need to have a local GPU to follow the classes, as we will use the free hardware provided by Google.",

I recently finished a PhD at Cambridge University (Tropical Ecology and Conservation).\nI have several years of experience in analyzing real-life data from different sources using data science-related techniques and producing publications for international peer-reviewed journals.\nOver the course of my research, I realized almost all the Python data science courses and books out there do not account for the multidimensional nature of the topic and use data science interchangeably with machine learning.\nThis gives students an incomplete knowledge of the subject. My course, on the other hand, will give you a robust grounding in all aspects of data science within the PyTorch, H2O, Tensorflow and Keras framework.\nUnlike other Python courses and books, you will actually learn to use PyTorch, H20, Tensorflow and Keras on real data!  Most of the other resources I encountered showed how to use PyTorch on in-built datasets which have limited use.\nDISCOVER 7 COMPLETE SECTIONS ADDRESSING EVERY ASPECT OF IMPORTANT DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORKS:\n• A full introduction to Python Data Science and powerful Python driven framework for data science, Anaconda\n• Getting started with Jupyter notebooks for implementing data science techniques in Python\n• A comprehensive presentation about PyTorch, H2o, Tensorflow and Keras installation and a brief introduction to the other Python data science packages\n• A brief introduction to the working of important data science packages such as Pandas and Numpy\n• The basics of the PyTorch, H2o, Tensorflow and Keras syntax\n• The basics of working with imagery data in Python\n• The theory behind neural network concepts such as artificial neural networks, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN)\n• You’ll even discover how to create artificial neural networks and deep learning structures with PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow (on real data)\nBUT,  WAIT! THIS ISN'T JUST ANY OTHER DATA SCIENCE COURSE:\nYou’ll start by absorbing the most valuable PyTorch, Tensorflow and Keras basics and techniques.\nI use easy-to-understand, hands-on methods to simplify and address even the most difficult concepts.\nMy course will help you implement the methods using real data obtained from different sources. Many courses use made-up data that does not empower students to implement Python-based data science in real -life.\nAfter taking this course, you’ll easily use packages like Numpy, Pandas, and PIL to work with real data in Python along with gaining fluency in the most important of deep learning architectures. I will even introduce you to deep learning models such as Convolution Neural network (CNN) !!\nThe underlying motivation for the course is to ensure you can apply Python-based data science on real data into practice today, start analyzing data for your own projects whatever your skill level, and impress your potential employers with actual examples of your data science abilities.\nIt is a practical, hands-on course, i.e. we will spend some time dealing with some of the theoretical concepts related to data science. However, the majority of the course will focus on implementing different techniques on real data and interpret the results. Some of the problems we will solve include identifying credit card fraud and classifying the images of different fruits.\nAfter each video, you will learn a new concept or technique which you may apply to your own projects!\nJOIN THE COURSE NOW!",

These are our first steps in our Deep Learning journey. After then we take a little trip to Machine Learning Python history. Then we will arrive at our next stop. Machine Learning in Python Programming. Here we learn the machine learning concepts, machine learning a-z workflow, models and algorithms, and what is neural network concept. After then we arrive at our next stop. Artificial Neural network. And now our journey becomes an adventure. In this adventure we'll enter the Keras world then we exit the Tensorflow world. Then we'll try to understand the Convolutional Neural Network concept. But our journey won't be over. Then we will arrive at Recurrent Neural Network and LTSM. We'll take a look at them. After a while, we'll trip to the Transfer Learning concept. And then we arrive at our final destination. Projects in Python Bootcamp. Our play garden. Here we'll make some interesting machine learning models with the information we've learned along our journey.\nIn this course, we will start from the very beginning and go all the way to the end of \"Deep Learning\" with examples.\nThe Logic of Machine Learning such as Machine Learning models and algorithms, Gathering data, Data pre-processing, Training and testing the model etc.\nBefore we start this course, we will learn which environments we can be used for developing deep learning projects.\nDuring the course you will learn:\nFundamental stuff of Python and its library Numpy\nWhat is the Artificial Intelligence (Ai), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning\nHistory of Machine Learning\nTuring Machine and Turing Test\nThe Logic of Machine Learning such as\nUnderstanding the machine learning models\nMachine Learning models and algorithms\nGathering data\nData pre-processing\nChoosing the right algorithm and model\nTraining and testing the model\nEvaluation\nArtificial Neural Network with these topics\nWhat is ANN\nAnatomy of NN\nTensor Operations\nThe Engine of NN\nKeras\nTensorflow\nConvolutional Neural Network\nRecurrent Neural Network and LTSM\nTransfer Learning\nReinforcement Learning\nFinally, we will make four different projects to reinforce what we have learned.\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming paradigm where a software application is developed by modeling real world objects into software modules called classes. Consider a simple point of sale system that keeps record of products purchased from whole-sale dealers and the products sold to the customer. An object-oriented language would implement these requirements by creating a Product class, a Customer class, a Dealer class and an Order class. All of these classes would interact together to deliver the required functionality where each class would be concerned with storing its own data and performing its own functions. This is the basic idea of object-oriented programming or also called OOP.\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nPython vs. R: what is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R, you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping. The concept of combining data with functionality in an object is called encapsulation, a core concept in the object-oriented programming paradigm.\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popular.\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are popular choices for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile development.\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\nDoes machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it. An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systems.\nWhat is the best language for machine learning?\nPython is the most used language in machine learning. Engineers writing machine learning systems often use Jupyter Notebooks and Python together. Jupyter Notebooks is a web application that allows experimentation by creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and more. Machine learning involves trial and error to see which hyperparameters and feature engineering choices work best. It's useful to have a development environment such as Python so that you don't need to compile and package code before running it each time. Python is not the only language choice for machine learning. Tensorflow is a popular framework for developing neural networks and offers a C++ API. There is a machine learning framework for C# called ML .NET. Scala or Java are sometimes used with Apache Spark to build machine learning systems that ingest massive data sets. You may find yourself using many different languages in machine learning, but Python is a good place to start.\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\nWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?\nPython is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quickly.\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributed to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping. The concept of combining data with functionality in an object is called encapsulation, a core concept in the object-oriented programming paradigm.\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

      "description": "In this course, you will step into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and learn both fundamental and advanced end-to-end optimization methods. You’ll begin with the SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) approach, where you’ll discover how to properly prepare your data and create customized datasets using tokenizers and data collators through practical examples. During the SFT process, you’ll learn the key techniques for making large models lighter and more efficient with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and quantization, and explore step by step how to integrate them into your projects.\n\n\nAfter solidifying the basics of SFT, we will move on to DPO (Direct Preference Optimization). DPO allows you to obtain user-focused results by directly reflecting user feedback in the model. You’ll learn how to format your data for this method, how to design a reward mechanism, and how to share models trained on popular platforms such as Hugging Face. Additionally, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how data collators work in DPO processes, learning practical techniques for preparing and transforming datasets in various scenarios.\n\n\nThe most significant phase of the course is GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization), which has been gaining popularity for producing strong results. With GRPO, you will learn methods to optimize model behavior not only at the individual level but also within communities or across different user groups. This makes it more systematic and effective for large language models to serve diverse audiences or purposes. In this course, you’ll learn the fundamental principles of GRPO, and then solidify your knowledge by applying this technique with real-world datasets.\n\n\nThroughout the training, we will cover key topics—LoRA, quantization, SFT, DPO, and especially GRPO—together, supporting each topic with project-oriented applications. By the end of this course, you will be fully equipped to manage every stage with confidence, from end-to-end data preparation to fine-tuning and group-based policy optimization. Developing modern and competitive LLM solutions that focus on both performance and user satisfaction in your own projects will become much easier.",

Python for beginners has the second largest number of job postings relative to all other languages. So it will earn you a lot of money and will bring a great change in your resume.\n\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\n\n\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in data science , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\n\n\n\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go.

      "description": "Hello, welcome to the Amazing world of Computer Vision.\nComputer Vision is an AI based, that is, Artificial Intelligence based technology that allows computers to understand and label images. Its now used in Convenience stores, Driver-less Car Testing, Security Access Mechanisms, Policing and Investigations Surveillance, Daily Medical Diagnosis monitoring health of crops and live stock and so on and so forth..Even to analyze data coming from outer space stars, planets etc also we use Computer Vision.\nA common example will be face detection and recognition and unlocking mechanism that you use in your mobile phone. We use that daily. That is also a big application of Computer Vision. And today, top technology companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook etc are investing millions and millions of Dollars into Computer Vision based research and product development.\nToday, we are inundated with data of all kinds, but the plethora of photo and video data available provides the data set required to make facial recognition technology work. Facial recognition systems analyze the visual data and millions of images and videos created by high-quality Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras installed in our cities for security, smartphones, social media, and other online activity. Machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities in the software map distinguishable facial features mathematically, look for patterns in the visual data, and compare new images and videos to other data stored in facial recognition databases to determine identity.\nA Facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image. There are multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database. It is also described as a Bio-metric Artificial Intelligence based application that can uniquely identify a person by analyzing patterns based on the person's facial textures and shape.\nOne of the major advantages of facial recognition technology is safety and security. Law enforcement agencies use the technology to uncover criminals or to find missing children or seniors.\nAirports are increasingly adding facial recognition technology to security checkpoints; the U.S. Department of Homeland Security predicts that it will be used on 97 percent of travelers by 2023. When people know they are being watched, they are less likely to commit crimes so the possibility of facial recognition technology being used could deter crime.\nFacial recognition  can add conveniences. In addition to helping you tag photos in Facebook or your cloud storage via Apple and Google, you will start to be able to check-out at stores without pulling out money or credit cards—your face will be scanned. At the A.I. Bar, facial recognition technology is used to add patrons who approach the bar to a running queue to get served their drinks more efficiently.\nAlong with all it benefits Computer vision Industry is $20 Billion industry which will be one of the most important job markets in the years to come.\nAs the fastest growing language in popularity, Python is well suited to leverage the power of existing computer vision libraries to learn from all this image and video data.\nSo.. Learning and mastering this Face Recognition Python technology is surely up-market and it will make you proficient in competing with the swiftly changing Image Processing technology arena.\nIn this course we'll teach you everything you how create a Face Recognition System which can be automated so it can add images to its data set with help of user whenever new faces are detected .\nHere are the major topics that we are going to cover in this course.\nSession 1: Introduction\nIntroduction and requirements of the course.\nSession 2: Basics of Computer Vision And OpenCv\nStudents will have a basic understanding of computer vision and students will be able to Image Analysis and Manipulation using OpenCv.\n\n\nSession 3: Introduction to Understanding Face Recognition using face_recognition library\nStudents will understand how face recognition works and how to implement various functions of face_recognition Library and will learn how to compare two faces using Euclidean Distance.\n\n\nSession 4: Project: Automated Multiple Face Detection\nStudents will be able to understand and implement Automated Multiple Face detection AI\n\n\nSession 5:Future Scope and Face Recognition Market\nStudents will understand various applications of face detection and will learn about trends in this market\n\n\nAt the end of the course you will be able to\nCreate Automated Multiple Face Detection System\nLearn Basics of Open CV\nUse Google Collab\nUnderstand how face recognition works\nUnderstand What is computer vision and how it works\n\n\nSo without wasting much time, lets dive in to this magical world.

      "description": "Comprehensive Linear Modeling with R provides a wide overview of numerous contemporary linear and non-linear modeling approaches for the analysis of research data. These include basic, conditional and simultaneous inference techniques; analysis of variance (ANOVA); linear regression; survival analysis; generalized linear models (GLMs); parametric and non-parametric smoothers and generalized additive models (GAMs); longitudinal and mixed-effects, split-plot and other nested model designs. The course showcases the use of R Commander in performing these tasks. R Commander is a popular GUI-based \"front-end\" to the broad range of embedded statistical functionality in R software. R Commander is an 'SPSS-like' GUI that enables the implementation of a large variety of statistical and graphical techniques using both menus and scripts. Please note that the R Commander GUI is written in the RGtk2 R-specific visual language (based on GTK+) which is known to have problems running on a Mac computer.\nThe course progresses through dozens of statistical techniques by first explaining the concepts and then demonstrating the use of each with concrete examples based on actual studies and research data. Beginning with a quick overview of different graphical plotting techniques, the course then reviews basic approaches to establish inference and conditional inference, followed by a review of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The course then progresses through linear regression and a section on validating linear models. Then generalized linear modeling (GLM) is explained and demonstrated with numerous examples. Also included are sections explaining and demonstrating linear and non-linear models for survival analysis, smoothers and generalized additive models (GAMs), longitudinal models with and without generalized estimating equations (GEE), mixed-effects, split-plot, and nested designs. Also included are detailed examples and explanations of validating linear models using various graphical displays, as well as comparing alternative models to choose the 'best' model. The course concludes with a section on the special considerations and techniques for establishing simultaneous inference in the linear modeling domain.\nThe rather long course aims for complete coverage of linear (and some non-linear) modeling approaches using R and is suitable for beginning, intermediate and advanced R users who seek to refine these skills. These candidates would include graduate students and/or quantitative and/or data-analytic professionals who perform linear (and non-linear) modeling as part of their professional duties.",

It's required to understand probability and statistics, which form the foundation of data science.\nThe \"data\" in data science is represented using matrices and vectors, which are the central objects of study in this course.\nIf you want to do machine learning beyond just copying library code from blogs and tutorials, you must know linear algebra.\nIn a normal STEM college program, linear algebra is split into multiple semester-long courses.\nLuckily, I've refined these teachings into just the essentials, so that you can learn everything you need to know on the scale of hours instead of semesters.\nThis course will cover systems of linear equations, matrix operations (dot product, inverse, transpose, determinant, trace), low-rank approximations, positive-definiteness and negative-definiteness, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It will even include machine learning-focused material you wouldn't normally see in a regular college course, such as how these concepts apply to GPT-4, and fine-tuning modern neural networks like diffusion models (for generative AI art) and LLMs (Large Language Models) using LoRA. We will even demonstrate many of the concepts in this course using the Python programming language (don't worry, you don't need to know Python for this course). In other words, instead of the dry old college version of linear algebra, this course takes just the most practical and impactful topics, and provides you with skills directly applicable to machine learning and data science, so you can start applying them today.\nAre you ready?\nLet's go!\n\n\nSuggested prerequisites:\nFirm understanding of high school math (functions, algebra, trigonometry)",

Includes codes of data visualization.\nBecause data can mean an endless number of things, it’s important to choose the right visualization tools for the job. Whether you’re interested in learning Tableau, D3.js, After Effects, or Python, OAK Academy has a course for you.\nStatistics alone can fall flat. That’s why data visualization is so important to communicate the meaning behind data sets. Good visualizations can magically transform complex data analysis into appealing and easily understood representations that in turn inform smarter, more calculated business moves.

Better data science practices are allowing corporations to cut unnecessary costs, automate computing, and analyze markets. Essentially, data science is the key to getting ahead in a competitive global climate.\nThis course has suitable for everybody who interested in data visualisation concept.\nFirst of all, in this course, we will learn some fundamentals of pyhton, and object oriented programming ( OOP ). These are our first steps in our Data Visualisation journey. After then we take our journey to the Data Science world. Here we will take a look at data literacy and data science concepts. Then we will arrive at our next stop. Numpy library. Here we learn what is numpy and how we can use it. After then we arrive at our next stop. Pandas library. And now our journey becomes an adventure. In this adventure we'll enter the Matplotlib world then we exit the Seaborn world. Then we'll try to understand how we can visualize our data, data viz. But our journey won’t be over. Then we will arrive our final destination. Geographical drawing or best known as Geoplotlib in tableau data visualization.\nLearn python and how to use it to python data analysis and visualization, present data. Includes tons of code data vizualisation.\nWhether you work in machine learning or finance, or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed upon the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that has resulted in a strict level of code standardization.

In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing a variety of different tools for programmers suited for many different tasks.\nIn this course, you will learn data analysis and visualization in detail.\nAlso during the course, you will learn:\nFundamental stuff of pyhton and OOP, Overview of Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab.\nWhat is the Data Science and Data Literacy\nFundamental stuff of Numpy and Pandas library in data analysis.\nWhat is Data Visualization\nPython data analysis and visualization\nPython data analysis\nData visualization\nAdvanced excel for data analysis\nThe Logic of Matplotlib\nWhat is Matplotlib\nUsing Matplotlib\nPyplot – Pylab - Matplotlib - Excel\nFigure, Subplot, Multiplot, Axes,\nFigure Customization\nPlot Customization\nGrid, Spines, Ticks\nBasic Plots in Matplotlib\nOverview of Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab\nSeaborn library with these topics\nWhat is Seaborn\nControlling Figure Aesthetics\nColor Palettes\nBasic Plots in Seaborn\nMulti-Plots in Seaborn\nRegression Plots and Squarify\nGeoplotlib with these topics\nWhat is Geoplotlib\nTile Providers and Custom Layers\nAnd of course, we enhanced all of it lots of examples with different concept and level. I bet you will like it.\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\n\nWhat is data visualization?\nData visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. It is a storytelling tool that provides a way to communicate the meaning behind a data set. Simply put, data visualization helps users — the individuals or teams who generate the data, and in many cases, their audience — make sense of data and make the best data-driven decisions. Good visualizations can magically transform complex data analysis into appealing and easily understood representations that, in turn, inform smarter, more calculated business moves. Using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.\n\nWhat are the most common data visualization tools?\nThere are a variety of popular data visualization tools used by professionals in a variety of settings and at all levels. Some of the most widely utilized platforms include Microsoft Excel, Tableau, Python, and R; Udemy offers courses that can get you up to speed on all of these platforms. It’s important to note that dozens of data visualization tools are free and/or open-source, which means that the software’s original source code is freely available and can be distributed by anyone. Some tools, such as Power BI and Tableau, are free but not open-source, offering a free license but limited functionality. In addition, there are also modules or packages for open-source programming languages such as Matplotlib for Python and D3.jf, Plotly, and Chart.js for JavaScript. Lastly, there are niche tools such as Leaflet and OpenLayers for interactive mapping.\n\nWhat careers use data visualization?\nWhile there are specific careers that require data visualization skills, such as data scientist, data engineer, and business intelligence analyst, many industries require these skills to succeed and drive profit. In today’s data-driven world, it’s wise for professionals from all walks of life to have basic data visualization skills. For example, in the financial services sector, data visualization skills are critical when it comes to understanding finance data. Today’s journalists can also make great use of data visualization tools for quickly processing raw data, interpreting statistics, and improving their storytelling capabilities. Across all business sectors, more and more companies are figuring out how important it is to be able to converse with data and the role it plays in their success.\n\nWhat are the most common types of data visualization?\nThere are many ways to interpret data and tell a story visually. Some of the most common examples include charts (area, bar, and pie), tables (highlight and text), graphs (bullet and wedge stack), and maps (dot distribution and heat), as well as dashboards, histograms, and other infographics. You can create all of these using software such as Excel and Tableau. Selecting the correct visualization depends on the type of data you need to interpret: categorical, which describes categories or groups, or numerical, representing numbers. Udemy offers a variety of courses that teach you how to create impactful data visualizations and drive action with data-driven decisions.\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popular.\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile development.\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.\nWhat is data analysis?\nData analysis is the process of studying or manipulating a dataset to gain some sort of insight. Usually, the insight can be leveraged to inform a decision or action. It includes everything from simple math operations to complex statistical calculations. Most people conduct data analysis on a daily basis. For example, you may sort your credit card charges by the highest amount to uncover the three most expensive costs in the previous month. Or, you may calculate the average number of points your favorite athlete scored in a game to predict their performance in a future game.\nWhat skills do I need to be a data analyst?\nTo be a data analyst, you’ll need technical skills to analyze data and report insights successfully. Technical skills may include data analysis, statistical knowledge, data storytelling, communication, and problem-solving. Business intuition and strategic thinking are also useful for data analysts that often partner with business stakeholders. Data analysis involves taking a business question or need and turning it into a data question. Then you'll transform and analyze the data to extract an answer to that question. Data storytelling includes both graphing and communication skills, which means that you'll need to create graphs and charts that help communicate your data and findings visually. You also need to communicate clearly in multiple formats, which may include strong writing, speaking, explaining, and listening skills. Problem-solving skills are useful because they help you do things like create innovative approaches to overcome challenges and resolve issues with data gaps.\nWhat jobs use data analysis?\nData analysts are in every industry, and their job titles can vary. Typical sectors include (but are not limited to) retail, healthcare, banking and finance, transportation, education, construction, and technology. Types of jobs that require knowledge of data analytics include Data Scientists, Business Intelligence Analyst, Data Engineer, Quantitative Analyst, Data Analytics Consultant, Operations Analyst, Marketing Analyst, Project Manager, IT Systems Analyst, and Transportation Logistics Specialist. Data Scientist roles typically earn higher salaries. Specific data scientist jobs include Machine Learning Engineer, Machine Learning Scientist, Applications Architect, Enterprise Architect, Data Architect, Infrastructure Architect, Data Engineer, and Statistician.\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\nWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?\nPython is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quickly.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

Do you want to use neural networks for classifying images, predicting prices, and classifying samples in several categories?\nKeras is the most powerful library for building neural networks models in Python. In this course we review the central techniques in Keras, with many real life examples. We focus on the practical computational implementations, and we avoid using any math.\nThe student is required to be familiar with Python, and machine learning; Some general knowledge on statistics and probability is recommended, but not strictly necessary.\nAmong the many examples presented here, we use neural networks to tag images belonging to the River Thames, or the street; to classify edible and poisonous mushrooms, to predict the sales of several video games for multiple regions, to identify bolts and nuts in images, etc.\nWe use most of our examples on Windows, but we show how to set up an AWS machine, and run our examples there. In terms of the course curriculum, we cover most of what Keras can actually do: such as the Sequential model, the model API, Convolutional neural nets, LSTM nets, etc. We also show how to actually bypass Keras, and build the models directly in Theano/Tensorflow syntax (although this is quite complex!)\nAfter taking this course, you should feel comfortable building neural nets for time sequences, images classification, pure classification and/or regression.

It operates on text files that you pass to it.\nThe awk program is a data-mining tool. You can use it to extract particular columns, rows, or fields (known as \"tokens\") of information out of a file, in much the same way as you can select specific pieces of text out of a line\nawk is a standard feature of Unix operating systems (any Linux system or Mac OS X). It is a powerful tool for extracting data from files and text streams, and for performing various kinds of text processing.\nThe course will teach you how to use the awk programming language.

By doing our projects, you will master artificial intelligence concepts as well as learn these famous datasets. After completing the course, you will be able to easily produce solutions to the problems that you may encounter in real life.\nIn our Machine Learning Projects we will use Scikit-Learn Python library. In our Deep Learning Projects we will use Tensorflow and Keras libraries.\n\n\nThe course is composed of 12 Artificial Intelligence Projects  - Machine Learning Projects and Deep Learning Projects:\n– Project #1: House Price Prediction using Machine Learning\nIn this project we will build a artificial intelligence model that predicts house prices using sklearn multiple linear regression algortihm.\n\n\n– Project #2: Salary Calculation using Machine Learning\nIt is a tedious work to calculate each employee’s salary according to employee’s experience level. In this project we are going to build a machine learning model for exact calculation of employee salaries. Since most of salary values are non-linear, a simple linear function can not be used for this calculation process. Generally most of the companies have polynomial salary values for their employees. Therefore we will use polynomial linear regression algorithm for solution here.\n\n\n– Project #3: Handwritten Digit Recognition using Multiple Machine Learning Models\nIn this Project, we will implement a software that recognizes and makes sense of the objects in the photograph by using multiple Machine Learning Models together. Thanks to this project, you will see how you can combine machine learning models and combine several models to solve complex problems. You will have solved a problem that can be used in daily life (recognition of a handwritten text by a computer) using Artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\n– Project #4: Advanced Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning\nIn this project, we will use a new and advanced segmentation library developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The customer data in our Customer Segmentation project, which is included in the entry and intermediate level projects, was simple and the K-Means clustering algorithm was sufficient for segmentation. But life is not that simple! When you have complex customer data, if you do clustering with K-Means, you may get erroneous results! Since the customer data in this project is complex data (both numeric and categorical) just like in real life, here we will use a special unsupervised learning algorithm instead of a standard model and divide our 2000 customers into groups with the latest artificial intelligence algorithms.\n\n\n– Project #5: IMDB Sentiment Analysis Using NLP (Natural Language Processing)\nWith this Project, we will develop sentiment analysis software using the NLP concept. In this study, we will use the data set obtained from the Kaggle platform, a platform belonging to Google. Thanks to our artificial intelligence software that we will develop in this project, we will be able to automatically extract positive or negative comments from the English IMDB movie reviews that come with this data set. With this project, you will learn the concept of NLP in a very short time without drowning in theory.\n\n\n– Project #6: Predicting Diabetes using Artificial Neural Networks\nIn this project we are goint to predict whether or not a patient has diabets. We are going to use a well known dataset from Kaggle: Pima Indians Diabetes Database. In this dataset we have some medical test results and statistical information of 768 patients. We will have two different Artificial Neural Network solutions for this project:\nWe will build the simplest ANN model using only 1 neuron\nWe will build another model using 2 hidden layers and a total of 25 neurons\n\n\n– Project #7: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network and Artificial Neural Network Algorithms (Deep Learning)\nWe will make a project that automatically recognizes and classifies thousands of different image files using deep learning and artificial neural network algorithms. We will use Tensorflow and Keras libraries to achieve this.\n\n\n– Project #8: San Francisco Crime Geographical Clustering using Machine Learning\nIn this project, we will perform geographic clustering using Geolocation information (Latitude & Longitude) using a data set created by the SFPD (San Francisco Police Department), which includes crimes committed in the city of San Francisco between 2003-2015. We will also learn to determine the optimal number of clusters (hyperparameter K-value) for this data set using the Elbow method. Then, we will display the geographic coordinates in our clustering results on a Python-based geographic map system. Finally, we will learn how to export this map we created to an HTML file.\n\n\n– Project #9: Image Classification (ImageNet Library) using Transfer Learning - Keras InceptionResNetV2 (Deep Learning)\nTransfer learning uses \"knowledge gained in solving a problem\" and applies it to a different but related problem. In Transfer Learning, we use a model that has been previously trained on a dataset and includes weights and biases that represent the properties of the dataset it was trained on. In this project, we will use the InceptionResNetV2 model, which has a pre-trained 164-layer advanced architecture and is pre-trained with an ImageNet dataset containing more than 1 million images.\n\n\n– Project #10: Military Aircraft (Satellite) Imagery Classification using Deep Learning (Custom Datasets)\nIn this project, we will classify military aircraft images obtained from satellites (F-22 Raptor, Boeing B-52, A-10 Thunderbolt, .. etc.) using Deep Learning algorithms. In this project you will learn to create your own dataset and you will learn to use these customized datasets on pre-trained models.\n\n\n– Project #11: Sound Signal Processing for Deep Learning using Python (Custom Datasets) (Part - 1/2)\nIn order to perform Sound Recognition and Classification with Python, the audio files must be in a format that can be used in Deep Learning algorithms. This project is essentially a pre-request project of our next project in our course, “Project#12 - Sound Classification using Deep Learning” Project. In this project we will process sound signals using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) algorithms and prepare audio for deep learning use. In this project you will learn how to prepare and process your own custom audio dataset for Deep Learning Training and Test operations.\n\n\n– Project #12: Sound Classification using Deep Learning (Part - 2/2)\nWe will build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Architecture with three Hidden Layers and 500 neurons in total (125-250-125) using Tensorflow and Keras libraries. We will use the pre-processed sound signals from previous project which has a dataset with a total size of 5.8 GB audio.\n\n\nEach project will be implemented by Python using Jupyter Notebook. Python source code of each project is included in relevant Udemy course section. You can download source codes for all projects...",

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\nWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\nYou can divide your learning process into 3 parts:\nStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\nUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\nProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\nUnderstanding of  models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\nWhy use R for Machine Learning?\nUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\n1. It’s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it’s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\n2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.\n3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.\n4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it’s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\n5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier – and of course, it’ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you’re looking for jobs in data science.\nWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\nPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\nDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.",

You will implement proprietary solutions (like ChatGPT) and modern open-source models like Llama and Phi. Through practical, real-world projects, you'll develop innovative applications, including a custom virtual assistant and a chatbot that interacts with documents and videos. We'll explore advanced techniques such as RAG and agents, and use tools like Streamlit to create intuitive interfaces. You'll learn how to use these technologies for free in Google Colab and also how to run projects locally.\nIn the introduction, you’ll be introduced to the theory of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their fundamental concepts. Additionally, we’ll explore the Hugging Face ecosystem, which offers modern solutions for Natural Language Processing (NLP). You'll learn to implement LLMs using both the Hugging Face pipeline and the LangChain library, understanding the advantages of each approach.\nThe second part is focused on mastering LangChain. You'll learn to access open-source models, like Meta's Llama and Microsoft’s Phi, as well as proprietary LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT. We'll explain model quantization to enhance performance and scalability. Key LangChain components, such as chains, templates, and tools, will be presented, along with how to use them to develop robust NLP solutions. Prompt engineering techniques will be covered to help you achieve more accurate results. The concept of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) will be explored, including information storage and retrieval processes. You’ll learn to implement vector stores and understand the importance of embeddings and how to use them effectively. We’ll also demonstrate how to use RAG to interact with PDF documents and web pages. Additionally, you'll have the opportunity to explore integrating agents and tools, like using LLMs to perform web searches and retrieve recent information. Solutions will be implemented locally, enabling access to open-source models even without an internet connection.\nIn the project development phase, you’ll learn to create a custom chatbot with an interface and memory for Q&A. You’ll also learn to develop interactive applications using Streamlit, making it easy to build intuitive interfaces.

The classical data imbalance problem is recognized as one of the major problems in the field of data mining and machine learning. Imbalanced learning focuses on how an intelligent system can learn when it is provided with unbalanced data.\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data available. This has caused knowledge discovery to garner attention in recent years. However, many real-world datasets are imbalanced. Learning from unbalanced data poses major challenges and is recognized as needing significant attention.\nThe problem with unbalanced data is the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severely skewed class distributions. Models trained on imbalanced datasets strongly favor the majority class and largely ignore the minority class. Several approaches introduced to date present both data-based and algorithmic solutions.\nThe specific goals of this course are:\nHelp the students understand the underline causes of unbalanced data problem.\nGo over the major state-of-the-art methods and techniques that you can use to deal with imbalanced learning.\nExplain the advantages and drawback of different approaches and methods .\nDiscuss the major assessment metrics for imbalanced learning to help you correctly evaluate the effectiveness of your solution.",

These realistic situations are much better than dummy examples, because they force the student to better think the problem, pre-process the data in a better way, and evaluate the performance of the prediction in different ways.\nThe datasets used here are from different sources such as Kaggle, US Data.gov, CrowdFlower, etc. And each lecture shows how to preprocess the data, model it using an appropriate technique, and compute how well each technique is working on that specific problem. Certain lectures contain also multiple techniques, and we discuss which technique is outperforming the other. Naturally, all the code is shared here, and you can contact me if you have any questions. Every lecture can also be downloaded, so you can enjoy them while travelling.\nThe student should already be familiar with Python and some data science techniques. In each lecture, we do discuss some technical details on each method, but we do not invest much time in explaining the underlying mathematical principles behind each method\nSome of the techniques presented here are:\nPure image processing using OpencCV\nConvolutional neural networks using Keras-Theano\nLogistic and naive bayes classifiers\nAdaboost, Support Vector Machines for regression and classification, Random Forests\nReal time video processing, Multilayer Perceptrons, Deep Neural Networks,etc.\nLinear regression\nPenalized estimators\nClustering\nPrincipal components\nThe modules/libraries used here are:\nScikit-learn\nKeras-theano\nPandas\nOpenCV\nSome of the real examples used here:\nPredicting the GDP based on socio-economic variables\nDetecting human parts and gestures in images\nTracking objects in real time video\nMachine learning on speech recognition\nDetecting spam in SMS messages\nSentiment analysis using Twitter data\nCounting objects in pictures and retrieving their position\nForecasting London property prices\nPredicting whether people earn more than a 50K threshold based on US Census data\nPredicting the nuclear output of US based reactors\nPredicting the house prices for some US counties\nAnd much more...\nThe motivation for this course is that many students willing to learn data science/machine learning are usually suck with dummy datasets that are not challenging enough.

If you are new to AI and ML space and would like to know where exactly NLP fits in the bigger picture, I would like to suggest the course \"Applied ML: The Big Picture\"\n\n\nBut once you've arrived here with the interest in NLP, I'd like to say you've taken the right step of knowing more about this interesting and challenging field. The language we speak is rich in information across several dimensions and to even realize these dimensions is a research exercise in itself. For this reason, NLP data is one of the most exciting data one can work with, while developing ML models.\n\n\nEmbeddings are just techniques that attempt to decipher some of these dimensions and put them into numerical format. It's the first and most important step before getting into advanced NLP algorithms and tasks such as machine translation, chatbot development etc.\n\n\nThis course provides the learner the foundational concepts along with two coding exercises, with attached jupyter notebooks, to provide a practical experience on the purpose and usefulness of text embeddings. Hopefully this inspires and prepares the learner to explore more topics in the interesting field of NLP.",

      "description": "Welcome to Deep Learning Fundamentals.\nThis course covers the basic theory and Python practice of artificial neural networks. This course is designed for beginners who are interested in deep learning. Having knowledge of undergraduate level mathematics is preferable, but not a must.\nArtificial intelligence is a technology that makes machines imitate intelligent human behavior and human cognitive functions. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. It enables systems to learn from data automatically, that is, learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a type of machine learning. It uses artificial neural networks to solve complex problems.\nOne reason why deep learning has drawn much attention is that it overcomes the limitations of traditional machine learning. The first limitation is that traditional machine learning cannot handle high dimensional data. Thus, the performance of the traditional machine learning model tends to level off as the data amount increases. The second is that, when we use traditional machine learning techniques, we need to extract features manually. Therefore, when we analyze image data or movie data, traditional machine learning techniques are not suitable because such data contains a great number of features.\nDeep learning can overcome these limitations of traditional machine learning. An artificial neural network is one of the algorithms of artificial intelligence, and usually, it takes a form of a deep learning model. It simulates the network neurons that make up the human brain. The structure of an artificial neural network enables a deep learning model to solve complex problems that traditional machine learning algorithms can hardly handle.\nThis course has some Python tutorials for developing deep learning models. And this course uses a library named Keras, which enables us to develop deep learning models efficiently. Basic-level Python knowledge is preferable, but Python beginners are also welcome.\n\n\nThis course consists of three modules.\n1. Artificial Neural Networks\n2. Convolutional Neural Networks\n3. Recurrent Neural Networks.\n\n\nThe first module is the basic of artificial neural network.\nThe second module covers convolutional neural network that is a type of network effective for handling image and movie data.\nThe third module covers recurrent neural network that is effective for time-series analysis and analyzing text data.\n\n\nAfter completing this course, you will have a fundamental knowledge of deep learning.\nI’m looking forward to seeing you in this course!",

      "description": "Instructor very knowledgeable about the material, and explains it clearly and to the point. Also, gives very good practical examples. - Diana\nAs usual, Mike provides a well made course to teach you about SciKit. The lessons are very short so you are able to absorb the information, and the follow up labs help anchor what you learned. I will be going over this course again because the information is a bit advanced, but I already got a great understanding and feel for SciKit after my first go through of the course. It is recommended you do take the 3 previous courses before you start this one because they build on each other. Mike West is a top instructor on the subject of python and data and his courses are worth the time and spent. - Joseph\nSo far, so good. The quick lectures throw out a lot of information, so I typically watch them again later. Good course thus far. - Ted\nWelcome to SciKit-Learn in Python for Machine Learning Engineers\nThis is the fourth course in the series designed to prepare you for a real world job in the machine learning space. I'd highly recommend you take the courses serially.\nPeople love building models and many think that machine learning engineers sit around and build models all day. They don't. Take the courses in order to understand what machine learning engineers really do.\nThank you!!\nIn this course we are going to learn SciKit-Learn using a lab integrated approach. Programming is something you must do to master it. You can't read about Python and expect to learn it.\nIf you take this course from start to finish you'll know the core foundations of a machine learning library in Python called SciKit-Learn, you'll understand the very basics of model building and lastly, you'll apply what you’ve learned by building many traditional machine learning models in SciKit-Learn.\nThis course is centered around building traditional machine learning models in SciKit-Learn\nThis course is an applied course on machine learning. Here' are a few items you'll learn:\nSciKit-Learn basics from A-Z\nLab integrated. Please don't just watch. Learning is an interactive event.  Go over every lab in detail.\nReal world Interviews Questions\nBuild a basic model build in SciKit-Learn. We call these traditional models to distinguish them from deep learning models.\nLearn the vernacular of building machine learning models.\n\n\nIf you're new to programming or machine learning you might ask, why would I want to learn SciKit-Learn? Python has become the gold standard for building machine learning models in the applied space and SciKit-Learn has become the gold standard for building traditional models in Python. The term \"applied\" simply means the real world.\nMachine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The key part of that definition is “without being explicitly programmed.”\nIf you're interested in working as a machine learning engineer, data engineer or data scientist then you'll have to know Python. The good news is that Python is a high level language. That means it was designed with ease of learning in mind. It's very user friendly and has a lot of applications outside of the ones we are interested in.\nIn SciKit-Learn in Python for Machine Learning Engineers we are going to start with the basics. You'll learn the basic terminology, how to score models and everything in between.\nAs you learn SciKit-Learn you'll be completing labs that will build on what you've learned in the previous lesson so please don't skip any.\n*Five Reasons to take this Course.*\n1) You Want to be a Machine Learning Engineer\nIt's one of the most sought-after careers in the world. The growth potential career wise is second to none. You want the freedom to move anywhere you'd like. You want to be compensated for your efforts. You want to be able to work remotely. The list of benefits goes on. Without a solid understanding of Python, you'll have a hard time of securing a position as a machine learning engineer.\n2) The Google Certified Data Engineer\nGoogle is always ahead of the game. If you were to look back at a timeline of their accomplishments in the data space you might believe they have a crystal ball. They've been a decade ahead of everyone.  Now, they are the first and the only cloud vendor to have a data engineering certification. With their track record I'll go with Google.  You can't become a data engineer without learning Python.\n3) The Growth of Data is Insane\nNinety percent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years. Business around the world generate approximately 450 billion transactions a day. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5 exabytes a day. That number doubles every month.  Almost all real-world machine learning is supervised. That means you point your machine learning models at clean tabular data. We need clean data to build our SciKit-Learn models with.\n4) Machine Learning in Plain English\nMachine learning is one of the hottest careers on the planet and understanding the basics is required to attaining a job as a data engineer.  Google expects data engineers and their machine learning engineers to be able to build machine learning models. In this course, you'll learn enough Python to be able to build a deep learning model.\n5) You want to be ahead of the Curve\nThe data engineer and machine learning engineer roles are fairly new.  While you’re learning, building your skills and becoming certified you are also the first to be part of this burgeoning field.  You know that the first to be certified means the first to be hired and first to receive the top compensation package.\nThanks for interest in SciKit-Learn in Python for Machine Learning Engineers\nSee you in the course!!",

      "description": "Natural Language Processing is used in many applications to provide capabilities that were previously not possible. It involves analyzing text to obtain the intent and meaning, which can then be used to support an application. Using NLP within an application requires a combination of standard Java techniques and often specialized libraries frequently based on models that have been trained. If you're interested to learn the powerful Natural Language Processing techniques with Java, then go for this Learning Path.\nPackt’s Video Learning Paths are a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that each video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.\nThe highlights of this Learning Path are:\nPerform tokenization based on specific text processing needs\nExtract the relationship between elements of text\nThis Learning Path covers the essence of NLP using Java. This Learning Path will commence by walking you through basic NLP tasks including data acquisition, data cleaning, finding parts of text, and determining the end of sentences. These serve as the basis for other NLP tasks such as classifying text and determining the relationship between text elements. This will be followed by the use of tokenization techniques. Tokenization is used for almost all NLP tasks. You’ll learn how text can be split to reveal information such as names, dates, and even the grammatical structure of a sentence. These types of activity can lead to insights into the relationships between text elements and embedded meaning in a document.\nYou'll then start by building on the basic NLP tasks of data normalization, tokenization, and SBD to perform more specialized NLP tasks. You’ll be able to do more than simply find a word in the text. You'll also identify specific elements such as a person’s name or a location from the text. Finally, you'll learn to split a sentence into basic grammatical units is another task that enables you to extract meaning and relationships from text.\nTowards the end of this Learning Path, you will be ready to take on more advanced NLP tasks  with Natural Language Processing techniques using Java.\nMeet Your Experts:\nWe have combined the best works of the following esteemed authors to ensure that your learning journey is smooth:\nKamesh Balasubramanian is the founder and CEO of Wirecog, LLC. He is the inventor of Wireframe Cognition (Wirecog), an award-winning, patented technology that allows machines to understand wireframe designs and produce source code from them. Kamesh has over 20 years' software development experience and has implemented numerous solutions in the advertising, entertainment, media, publishing, hospitality, videogame, legal, and government sectors. He is an award-winning, professional member of the Association for Computing Machinery and an InfyMaker Award winner. He was recognized as a Maker of Change at the 2016 World Maker Faire in New York and, upon request, has demonstrated Wirecog at MIT.\nBen Tranter is a developer with nearly six years’ experience.

      "description": "Automated machine learning (AutoML) represents a fundamental shift in the way organizations of all sizes approach machine learning and data science. Applying traditional machine learning methods to real-world business problems is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and challenging. It requires experts in several disciplines, including data scientists – some of the most sought-after professionals in the job market right now.\nAutomated machine learning changes that, making it easier to build and use machine learning models in the real world by running systematic processes on raw data and selecting models that pull the most relevant information from the data – what is often referred to as “the signal in the noise.” Automated machine learning incorporates machine learning best practices from top-ranked data scientists to make data science more accessible across the organization.\n“Data science is the transformation of data using mathematics and statistics into valuable insights, decisions, and products”\nAs data science evolves and gains new “instruments” over time, the core business goal remains focused on finding useful patterns and yielding valuable insights from data. Today, data science is employed across a broad range of industries and aids in various analytical problems. For example, in marketing, exploring customer age, gender, location, and behavior allows for making highly targeted campaigns, evaluating how much customers are prone to make a purchase or leave. In banking, finding outlying client actions aids in detecting fraud. In healthcare, analyzing patients’ medical records can show the probability of having diseases, etc.\nThe data science landscape encompasses multiple interconnected fields that leverage different techniques and tools.\nThere’s a difference between data mining and very popular machine learning. Still, machine learning is about creating algorithms to extract valuable insights, it’s heavily focused on continuous use in dynamically changing environments and emphasizes adjustments, retraining, and updating of algorithms based on previous experiences. The goal of machine learning is to constantly adapt to new data and discover new patterns or rules in it. Sometimes it can be realized without human guidance and explicit reprogramming.\nMachine learning is the most dynamically developing field of data science today due to a number of recent theoretical and technological breakthroughs. They led to natural language processing, image recognition, or even the generation of new images, music, and texts by machines. Machine learning remains the main “instrument” of building artificial intelligence.\nMachine Learning Workflow\nGenerally, the workflow follows these simple steps:\nCollect data. Use your digital infrastructure and other sources to gather as many useful records as possible and unite them into a dataset.\nPrepare data. Prepare your data to be processed in the best possible way. Data preprocessing and cleaning procedures can be quite sophisticated, but usually, they aim at filling the missing values and correcting other flaws in data, like different representations of the same values in a column (e.g. December 14, 2016 and 12.14.2016 won’t be treated the same by the algorithm).\nSplit data. Separate subsets of data to train a model and further evaluate how it performs against new data.\nTrain a model. Use a subset of historic data to let the algorithm recognize the patterns in it.\nTest and validate a model. Evaluate the performance of a model using testing and validation subsets of historic data and understand how accurate the prediction is.\nDeploy a model. Embed the tested model into your decision-making framework as a part of an analytics solution or let users leverage its capabilities (e.g. better target your product recommendations).\nIterate. Collect new data after using the model to incrementally improve it.",

I had always intended to expand the series (there's a lot to cover!) but kept getting pulled in other directions.\nToday, I am happy to announce that the Bayesian Machine Learning series is finally back on track!\nIn the first course, a lot of students asked, \"but where is the 'machine learning'?\", since they thought of machine learning from the typical supervised/unsupervised parametric model paradigm. The A/B Testing course was never meant to look at such models, but that is exactly what this course is for.\nIf you've studied machine learning before, then you know that linear regression is the first model everyone learns about. We will approach Bayesian Machine Learning the same way.\nBayesian Linear Regression has many nice properties (easy transition from non-Bayesian Linear Regression, closed-form solutions, etc.). It is best and most efficient \"first step\" into the world of Bayesian Machine Learning.\nAlso, let's not forget that Linear Regression (including the Bayesian variety) is simply very practical in the real-world. Bayesian Machine Learning can get very mathematical, so it's easy to lose sight of the big picture - the real-world applications. By exposing yourself to Bayesian ideas slowly, you won't be overwhelmed by the math. You'll always keep the application in mind.\nIt should be stated however: Bayesian Machine Learning really is very mathematical. If you're looking for a scikit-learn-like experience, Bayesian Machine Learning is definitely too high-level for you. Most of the \"work\" involves algebraic manipulation. At the same time, if you can tough it out to the end, you will find the results really satisfying, and you will be awed by its elegance.\nSidenote: If you made it through my Linear Regression and A/B Testing courses, then you'll do just fine.\nSuggested Prerequisites:\nPython coding: if/else, loops, lists, dicts, sets\nNumpy and Pandas coding: matrix and vector operations, loading a CSV file\nBasic math: calculus, linear algebra, probability\nLinear regression\nBayesian Machine Learning: A/B Testing in Python (know about conjugate priors)",

Leverage machine learning to improve your apps\nPrediction Models Masterclass\n\nBy the end of this course you will have 3 complete mobile machine learning models and apps. We will build a simple weather prediction project, stock market prediction project, and text-response project.\nFor each we will build a basic version in PyCharm, save the trained model, export the trained model to Android Studio, and build an app around model.\n\nNo experience? No problem\n\n\n\nWe'll give you all necessary information to succeed from newbie to pro. We will install PyCharm 2017.2.3 and explore the interface. I will show you every step of the way. You will learn crucial Python 3.6.2 language fundamentals. Even if you have coding knowledge, going back to the basics is the key to success as a programmer. We will build and run Python projects. I teach through practical examples, follow-alongs, and over-the-shoulder tutorials. You won't need to go anywhere else.\nThen we will install Android Studio 3 and explore the interface.

      "description": "Welcome to my course on Machine Learning and Data Analysis, a course that will teach you how to use advanced algorithms to solve real problems with data. I am Emanuele, a mechanical engineer with a PhD in advanced algorithms, and I will be your instructor for this course.\nThis course consists of four main parts:\nPart 1: Overview on Fourier Analysis and Wavelets. You will learn the basics of these two powerful mathematical tools for analyzing signals and images in different domains.\nPart 2: Data Analysis with Fourier Series, Transforms and Wavelets. You will learn how to apply these methods to process and explore data efficiently and effectively, both in time and frequency domains.\nPart 3: Machine Learning Methods. You will learn how to use techniques that enable computers to learn from data and make intelligent predictions or decisions, such as linear regression, curve fitting, least squares, gradient descent, Singular Value Decomposition (and more).\nPart 4: Dynamical Systems. You will learn how to model and understand complex and nonlinear phenomena that change over time, using mathematical equations. We will also apply machine learning techniques to dynamical systems, such as the SINDy algorithm.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\nUnderstand the principles and applications of Fourier analysis and wavelets\nUse Fourier series and transforms to analyze data in various domains\nApply machine learning methods to different problems\nExtract features from data using wavelets\nUnderstand the importance of sparsity of natural data, as well as the revolutionary concept of compressed sensing, with realistic examples.\nDiscover the governing equations of a dynamical system from time series data (SINDy algorithm).\nI hope you enjoy this course and find it useful for your personal and professional goals.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLet's provide some more details about the main parts of this course:\nPart 1 constitutes a preliminary introduction to Fourier and Wavelet Analysis. Special focus will be put on understanding the most relevant concepts related to these fundamental topics.\n\n\nIn part 2, the Fourier series and the Fourier Transform are introduced. Although the most important mathematical formulae are shown, the focus is not on the mathematics. One of the key points of this part is to show one possible application of the Fourier Transform: the spectral derivative. Then, we introduce the concept of Wavelets more in detail by showing some applications of Multiresolution Analysis.\nThis is exemplified with Matlab, without using rigorous mathematical formulae. The student can follow and get the intuition even if they have no access to Matlab.\nAnother important achievement of this part is to convey a simple but thorough explanation of the well-known computational FFT method.\nThere are also some extras on the Inverse Wavelet Transform and the Uncertainty principle (here we see more mathematics, but this is an extra, if you want to skip it, just do it).\n\n\nIn part 3, some machine learning techniques are introduced: the methods of curve-fitting, gradient descent, linear regression, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), feature extraction, classification, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The objective in this part is to show some practical applications and cast light on their usefulness.\nWe will also focus on sparsity and compressed sensing, which are related concepts in signal processing. Sparsity means that a signal can be represented by a few non-zero coefficients in some domain, such as frequency or wavelet. Compressed sensing means that a signal can be reconstructed from fewer measurements than the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem requires, by exploiting its sparsity and using optimization techniques. These concepts are useful for reducing the dimensionality and complexity of data in machine learning applications, such as image processing or radar imaging.\n\n\nPart 4 is a self-contained introduction to dynamical models. The models contained in this part are the prey-predator model, the model of epidemics, the logistic model of population growth.\nThe student will learn how to implement these models using free and open-source software called Scilab (quite similar to Matlab).\nRelated to Part 4, there is an application of machine learning technique called SINDy, which is an acronym for Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics. It is a machine learning algorithm that can discover the governing equations of a dynamical system from time series data. The main idea is to assume that the system can be described by a sparse set of nonlinear functions, and then use a sparsity-promoting regression technique to find the coefficients of these functions that best fit the data. This way, SINDy can recover interpretable and parsimonious models of complex systems.\n\n\nNote: For some of the lectures of the course, I was inspired by S.L. Brunton and J. N. Kutz's book titled \"Data-Driven Science and Engineering\". This book is an excellent source of information to dig deeper on most (although not all) of the topics discussed in the course.",

Python for beginners has the second largest number of job postings relative to all other languages. So it will earn you a lot of money and will bring a great change in your resume.\n\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\n\n\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in data science , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines.

      "description": "This is the R course for beginners with no coding experience. It is based on the latest research in online learning theory and my personal experience with dozens of online courses. I created this course as the course I wish I would have had when I first started learning R.\nWe will code together and focus on the 20% of code responsible for 80% of the work. At the end of sections, you will have a 'Make It Stick' challenge to apply what you have just learned with a different dataset (based on principles in the book 'Make It Stick').\nThis course is different from other beginner courses in R in a couple significant ways:\nProject-based learning with real-world scenarios: All lessons are based on common questions facing data practioners.\nContent focus: The course outline and lectures are based on everyday workflows of data practioners rather than a bottom-up approach to R programming. Practically, this means we won't spend much time learning about R and core principles of programming; we will immediately start with how you will use it.\nCurrent (& continually updated) code: I work in R everyday and make sure you are learning the best and most efficient ways to accomplish the most common and important tasks. For example, the rowwise function in the dplyr package enables you to perform calculations across columns by rows. A single line of code can now accomplish what was previously far more challenging.\nKeeping it real: I keep the video rolling when I make an error. You can learn a lot from mistakes. R was my first programming language and I quit twice because of too many errors, too much time to learn it, and frustration with online courses that left out important steps or assumed knowledge that simply wasn't there. I try really hard to explain what we're doing while we're doing it and then giving you an opportunity to do it on your own with a different (but related) dataset.\n\nIn this course, you will learn to:\nLoad data from different sources (files, databases)\nStructure data for analysis using the tidyverse packages\nQuickly explore and visualize data trends\nConduct feature engineering for deeper analysis\nAnalyze survey data\nSelect the right visualization for your data\nCreate professional visualizations\nCreate and automate reports using RMarkdown",

      "description": "Welcome to the Complete Deep Learning Course 2021 With 7+ Real Projects\n\nThis course will guide you through how to use Google's TensorFlow framework to create artificial neural networks for deep learning! This course aims to give you an easy to understand guide to the complexities of Google's TensorFlow framework in a way that is easy to understand. Other courses and tutorials have tended to stay away from pure tensorflow and instead use abstractions that give the user less control. Here we present a course that finally serves as a complete guide to using the TensorFlow framework as intended, while showing you the latest techniques available in deep learning!\nThis course is designed to balance theory and practical implementation, with complete google colab and Jupiter notebook guides of code and easy to reference slides and notes. We also have plenty of exercises to test your new skills along the way!\nThis course covers a variety of topics, including\nDeep Learning.\nGoogle Colab\nAnaconda\nJupiter Notebook\nActivation Function.\nKeras.\nPandas.\nSeaborn.\nFeature scaling.\nMatplotlib.\nscikit-learn\nSigmoid Function.\nTanh Function.\nReLU Function.\nLeaky Relu Function.\nExponential Linear Unit Function.\nSwish function.\nCorpora.\nNLTK.\nTensorFlow 2.0\nTokenization.\nSpacy.\nPoS tagging.\nNER.\nStemming and lemmatization.\nSemantics and topic modelling.\nSentiment analysis techniques.\nLexicon-based methods.\nRule-based methods.\nStatistical methods.\nMachine learning methods.\nBernoulli RBMs.\nIntroduction to RBMs (Restricted Boltzman Machine).\nIntroduction to BMs (Boltzman Machine).\nLearning data representations with RBMs.\nMultilayer neural networks.\nLatent vector.\nLoading data.\nAnalysing data.\nTraining model.\nCompiling model.\nVisualizing data and model.\nImplementing multilayer neural networks\nImproving the model performance by removing outliers.\nBuilding a Keras deep neural network model\nNeural Network Basics.\nTensorFlow Basics.\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN).\nDensely Connected Networks.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN).\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNN).\nAutoEncoders.\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN).\nDeep Convolutional Generative adversarial network (DCGAN).\nNatural Language Processing (NLP).\nImage Processing.\nSentiment Analysis.\nRestricted Boltzman Machine.\nReinforcement Learning.\nThere are many Deep Learning Frameworks out there, so why use TensorFlow?\nTensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.\n\nIt is used by major companies all over the world, including Airbnb, Ebay, Dropbox, Snapchat, Twitter, Uber, SAP, Qualcomm, IBM, Intel, and of course, Google!\n\n\nMoreover, the course is packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life examples. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get some hands-on practice building your own models. There are five big projects on healthcare problems and one small project to practice. These projects are listed below:\nConcrete Quality Prediction Using Deep Neural Networks.\nCIFAR-10.\nClassifying clothing images.\n20 newsgroups.\nHandwritten Digit.\nDenoising autoencoders (DAEs).\nMovie Reviews Sentiment Analysis Using Recurrent Neural Networks.\nPredicting Stock Price\nIris Flower.\n\n\nBecome a machine learning, and deep learning guru today!

      "description": "About the course\nWelcome to the course Deep Learning in Practice III on Face Recognition. I am Anis Koubaa, and I will be your instructor in this course.\nThis course is the third course in the series Deep Learning in Practice. It provides a fast and easy-to-follow introduction to face recognition with deep learning using MTCNN for face extraction and FaceNet for face recognition. My two previous courses deal with object classification and transfer learning with Tensorflow and Keras.\nIn this course, you will learn the whole loop of face recognition systems, which starts by extracting the face from an image and localizing the face in an image by its bounding box; then, we process the extracted face through a convolutional neural network, called FaceNet in our case, to create a fingerprint of the face, which we call face embedding. The face embedding can be stored in a database so that they are compared with other face embeddings to identify the person of interest.\nIn this course, you will have a step-by-step introduction to this whole loop, and I will show you how you can develop a Python application that performs the abovementioned operations. Exciting, right?\n\n\nWhy is the course important?\nThis course is essential due to the importance of face recognition systems in real-world applications. These fast-growing systems are used in several applications, such as surveillance systems, face access systems, and biometric identification.\nIn this course, you will be introduced to face recognition systems both from a theoretical and practical perspective, allowing you to develop your own projects using face recognition in Python.\nThe course's motivation is a lack of resources to get quickly started with the topic. So taking this course will save you tons of time looking for scattered references over the Internet and will get you much quicker into the field.\n\n\nWhat's worth?\nThis course provides fast yet comprehensive coverage of face recognition systems that would let you go from Zero to Hero.\nI first start with presenting the fundamental concepts of face recognition systems and how deep learning models for face embedding are trained and produced.\nThen, I provide a hands-on introduction to face recognition using MTCCN for face extraction and FaceNet for face recognition, all with Python programming language. Tensorflow and Keras APIs will be used to load the FaceNet model. I provide a Jupiter notebook that you will use as a guide in the lecture to follow and write the code to apply as you learn.\nAt the end of this course, I guarantee that you will understand the whole loop of face recognition systems, and you will be able to develop your application and integrate it into your project.\n\n\nPre-requisites\nTo benefit from this course most, you just need to know about Python programming.\nHaving a basic understanding of deep learning and TensorFlow would be a plus, but it is not mandatory.\nIn any case, you may refer to my two courses: Deep Learning in Practice I and II, for a basic practical introduction to deep learning.\n\n\nWelcome to the course, and I wish you a pleasant learning experience.\nLet's get started.\n\n\nAbout me\nI am Anis Koubaa, and I am working as a Full Professor in Computer Science and Leader of the Robotics and Internet-of-Things Lab at Prince Sultan University\nI am the author of two best-seller courses on Deep Learning and Robot Operating System (ROS),\nand this course is the third course in the series Deep Learning in Practice, which deals with face recognition systems.\nThe series of deep learning in practice intends to present advanced deep learning topics very easily to beginner users who would like to get started with hands-on projects in deep learning in a minimum amount of time.\nThe two previous courses dealt with object classification and transfer learning projects.",

      "description": "LinkedIn is a social network focused on professional experience in order to generate connections and relationships between professionals from different areas. Professionals can provide profissional skills and search for jobs by connecting with people around the world. For example, if you would like to work with Data Science you can connect with companies and people who work in this field, increasing your chances of getting a job. On the other hand, companies are able to search for candidates according to the curriculum and skills provided by users. In 2017, LinkedIn established itself as the largest business platform and an important strategic tool for both professionals and companies.\nIt is important that professionals know how to use the data of this social network in their favor. LinkedIn provides some datasets related to your profile, in which it is possible to apply Data Science and Analysis techniques to extract important and interesting insights about our network of connections. We can answer questions like this: What are the main positions of the people who are connected to us? Which companies are sending invitations to our profile? What is the location of our contacts? Is our LinkedIn network made up of people and companies related to our job? Are the companies I want to work for sending invitations to my profile? These and other questions can be answered during this course, so you can analyze if your network is in line with what you want professionally. Below you can see the main topics that will be implemented step by step:\n\n\nExtract data from your LinkedIn profile using the LinkedIn API and .csv files. If you do not have LinkedIn, you will be able to follow the course using the data about my profile\nExtract and analyze connections between users, invitations and text messages\nGenerate fake data to mask real information\nExplore and visualize data related to your contacts' companies and job titles\nUse Levenshtein distance, n-gram similarity and Jaccard distance to measure similarity between strings\nCluster contacts based on similarity between positions, as well as generate HTML views to improve data presentation\nUse location APIs to extract latitude and longitude of contacts to capture the city and country they live\nView the location of contacts dynamically with Google Earth and the Basemap library\nCluster contacts using k-means algorithm\nApply natural language processing techniques to analyze your LinkedIn text messages\nGenerate word cloud to view the most frequent terms\nExtract named entities from your text messages\nCreate a sentiment classifier to extract the polarity from LinkedIn messages\nDuring the course, we will use the Python programming language and Google Colab, so you do not need to spend time installing the stuff on your own machine. You will be able to follow the course with a browser and an Internet connection! This is the best course if this is your first contact with social media data analysis!",

Fundamentally, the course pivots over four axis:\n\nPandas and Matplotlib for working with data\nKeras for Deep Learning,\nScikit-learn for machine learning\nStatsmodels for statistics\nThis course explores the fundamental concepts in these big four topics, and provides the student with an overview of the problems that can be solved nowadays.\nI only focus on the computational and practical implications of these techniques, and it is assumed that the student is partially familiar with Statistics-ML-Data Science - or is willing to complement the techniques presented here with theoretical material. Python programming experience will be absolutely necessary, as we only explain how to define Classes in Python (as we will use them along the course)\nThe teaching strategy is to briefly explain the theory behind these techniques, show how these techniques work in very simple problems, and finally present the student with some real examples. I believe that these real examples add an enormous value to the student, as it helps understand why these techniques are so used nowadays (because they solve real problems!)\nSome examples that we will attack here will be: Forecasting the GDP of the United States, forecasting London new houses prices, identifying squares and triangles in pictures, predicting the value of vehicles using online data, detecting spam on SMS data, and many more!\nIn a nutshell, this course explains how to:\nDefine classes for storing data in a better way\nPlotting data\nMerging, pivoting, subsetting, and grouping data via Pandas\nUsing linear regression via Statsmodels\nWorking with time series/forecasting in Statsmodels\nSeveral unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as clustering\nSeveral supervised techniques such as random forests, classification trees, Naive Bayes classifiers, etc\nDefine Deep Learning architectures using Keras\nDesign different neural networks such as recurrent neural networks, multi-layer perceptrons,etc.\nClassify Audio/sounds in a similar way that Alexa, Siri and Cortana do using machine learning\nThe student needs to be familiar with statistics, Python and some machine learning concepts",

      "description": "In this course, we present the concept of machine learning and the classification of different methods of learning such as Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. We also present reinforcement learning. We offer popular techniques and implement them in Python. We begin with the Decision Tree method. We present this simply with all the required mathematical tools such as entropy. We implement them in Python and explain how the accuracy can be improved. We offer the classification problem with a suitable real-life scenario. Linear Regression is taught using simple real-life examples. We present the L2 Error estimation and explain how we can minimize the error using gradient optimization. This is implemented using the Python library. We also offer the Logistic Regression method with an example and implement in Python. The Nearest Neighbourhood approach is explained with examples and implemented in Python. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a popular supervised learning model that you can use for classification or regression. This approach works well with high-dimensional spaces (many features in the feature vector) and can be used with small data sets effectively. When trained on a data set, the algorithm can easily classify new observations efficiently. We also present a few more methods. The Bayesian model of classification is used for large finite datasets. It is a method of assigning class labels using a direct acyclic graph. The graph comprises one parent node and multiple children nodes. And each child node is assumed to be independent and separate from the parent. As the model for supervised learning in ML helps construct the classifiers in a simple and straightforward way, it works great with very small data sets. This model draws on common data assumptions, such as each attribute is independent. Yet having such simplification, this algorithm can easily be implemented on complex problems.",

This is based on prediction of defaulters in bank credit based on the data provided by the bank using past analysis. The result of this project will be that we will be able to forecast what are the chances of a person with certain credentials that will be a defaulter or a successful player.\n\n\nPart 2: This is the second part of the CREDIT RISK PREDICTION Project where we create a complete project on Kaggle Community Platform regarding prediction of Credit Failure of customers based on their credentials. We use data cleaning, data plotting and utilised Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression with best parameters possible for getting the best prediction accuracy. All these algorithms are mathematical implementations and we have utilised them with optimal parameters.\n\n\nWhom is This Course for?\nAspiring machine learning students want to learn on machine learning projects but struggle hard to find interesting ideas and how to build the project. How should students build Machine learning projects, find data science or machine learning project ideas that motivate you, when deciding on a machine project to get started. You can decide the domain and dataset based on your interest. Size of the dataset and complexity of the dataset. If you are a fresher or a beginner, We recommend you get started with ML projects that focus on data cleaning and then move on to analytics, machine learning, and deep learning\n\n\nThanks & Regard\nJitendra",

      "description": "Machine learning has inserted itself into the fiber of our everyday lives – even without us noticing. Machine learning algorithms have been powering the world around us, and this includes product recommendations at Walmart, fraud detection at various top-notch financial institutions, surge pricing at Uber, as well as content used by LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter on users’ feeds, and these are just a few examples, grounded directly in the daily lives we live.\nThis being said, it goes without saying that the future is already here – and machine learning plays a significant role in the way our contemporary imagination visualises it. Mark Cuban, for instance, has said: “Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning — whatever you’re doing if you don’t understand it — learn it. Because otherwise you’re going to be a dinosaur within 3 years.”\nMachine learning makes a mockery of anything that can be called “important” – both at a financial as well as a global scale. If you are looking to take your career to another level, Machine Learning can do that for you. If you are looking to involve yourself in something that will make you part of something that is global as well as contemporary relevance, Machine Learning can do that for you as well.\nMachine learning covers significant ground in various verticals – including image recognition, medicine, cyber security, facial recognition, and more. As an increasing amount of businesses are realising that business intelligence is profoundly impacted by machine learning, and thus are choosing to invest in it.\nNetflix, to take just one example, announced a prize worth $1 million to the first person who could sharpen its ML algorithm by increasing its accuracy by 10%. This is sureshot evidence that even a slight enhancement in ML algorithms is immensely profitable for the companies that use them, and thus, so are the people behind them. And with ML, you can be one of them!\nThe best machine learning engineers these days are paid as much as immensely popular sports personalities! And that’s no exaggeration! According to Glassdoor, the average machine learning engineer salary is 8 lakhs per annum – and that’s just at the starting of one’s career! An experienced machine learning engineer takes home anywhere between 15 to 23 lakhs per annum.",

      "description": "Are you interested in understanding machine learning concepts and building real-time projects with R, but don’t know where to start? Then, this is the perfect course for you!\nThe aim of machine learning is to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, and find useful information from data. In addition to this, through incorporation with data analysis, machine learning can be used to perform predictive analysis. With machine learning, the analysis of business operations and processes is not limited to human scale thinking; machine scale analysis enables businesses to capture hidden values in big data.\n\nMachine learning has similarities to the human reasoning process. Unlike traditional analysis, the generated model cannot evolve as data is accumulated. Machine learning can learn from the data that is processed and analyzed. In other words, the more data that is processed, the more it can learn.\nR, as a dialect of GNU-S, is a powerful statistical language that can be used to manipulate and analyze data. Additionally, R provides many machine learning packages and visualization functions, which enable users to analyze data on the fly. Most importantly, R is open source and free.\nUsing R greatly simplifies machine learning. All you need to know is how each algorithm can solve your problem, and then you can simply use a written package to quickly generate prediction models on data with a few command lines.\nBy taking this course, you will gain a detailed and practical knowledge of R and machine learning concepts to build complex machine learning models.\n\nWhat details do you cover in this course?\n\nWe start off with basic R operations, reading data into R, manipulating data, forming simple statistics for visualizing data. We will then walk through the processes of transforming, analyzing, and visualizing the RMS Titanic data. You will also learn how to perform descriptive statistics.\nThis course will teach you to use regression models. We will then see how to fit data in tree-based classifier, Naive Bayes classifier, and so on.\nWe then move on to introducing powerful classification networks, neural networks, and support vector machines. During this journey, we will introduce the power of ensemble learners to produce better classification and regression results.\nWe will see how to apply the clustering technique to segment customers and further compare differences between each clustering method.\nWe will discover associated terms and underline frequent patterns from transaction data.\nWe will go through the process of compressing and restoring images, using the dimension reduction approach and R Hadoop, starting from setting up the environment to actual big data processing and machine learning on big data.\nBy the end of this course, we will build our own project in the e-commerce domain.\nThis course will take you from the very basics of R to creating insightful machine learning models with R.\nWe have combined the best of the following Packt products:\nR Machine Learning Solutions by Yu-Wei, Chiu (David Chiu)\nMachine Learning with R Cookbook by Yu-Wei, Chiu (David Chiu)\nR Machine Learning By Example  by Raghav Bali and Dipanjan Sarkar\n\n\nTestimonials:\nThe source content have been received well by the audience. Here is a one of the reviews:\n\"good product, I enjoyed it\"\n\n- Ertugrul Bayindir\n\n\nMeet your expert instructors:\n\nYu-Wei, Chiu (David Chiu) is the founder of LargitData a startup company that mainly focuses on providing big data and machine learning products. He has previously worked for Trend Micro as a software engineer, where he was responsible for building big data platforms for business intelligence and customer relationship management systems.\nDipanjan Sarkar is an IT engineer at Intel, the world's largest silicon company, where he works on analytics, business intelligence, and application development. His areas of specialization includes software engineering, data science, machine learning, and text analytics.\nRaghav Bali has a master's degree (gold medalist) in IT from the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore. He is an IT engineer at Intel, the world's largest silicon company, where he works on analytics, business intelligence, and application development.\n\n\nMeet your managing editor:\n\nThis course has been planned and designed for you by me, Tanmayee Patil. I'm here to help you be successful every step of the way, and get maximum value out of your course purchase.

In addition to that, you will also learn how to find and download credit card dataset from Kaggle, Once, everything is ready, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section The project will be consisted of three main parts, the first part is the data analysis and visualization where you will explore the dataset from multiple angles, in the second part, you will learn step by step on how to build credit card fraud detection model using logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest, meanwhile, in the third part, you will learn how to evaluate the model’s performance. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will conduct testing on the fraud detection model to make sure it produces accurate results and functions as it should.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build a credit card fraud detection model? Well, here is my answer. In the past couple of years, we have witnessed a significant increase in the number of people conducting online transactions and, consequently, the risk of credit card fraud has surged. As technology advances, so do the techniques employed by fraudsters. Building a credit card fraud detection model becomes imperative to safeguard financial transactions, protect users from unauthorized activities, and maintain the integrity of online payment systems. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data-driven insights, we can proactively identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. Last but not least, knowing how to build a complex fraud detection model can potentially open a lot of opportunities in the future.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of fraud detection model\nLearn how credit card fraud detection models work.

Are you interested in data science but intimidated from learning by the need to learn a programming language?\nI can teach you how to solve real data science business problems that clients have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to solve. I'm not going to turn you into a data scientist; no 2 hour, or even 40 hour online course is able to do that. But this course can teach you skills that you can use to add value and solve business problems from day 1.\nThis course is different than most for several reasons:\n1. We start with problem solving instead of coding. I feel like starting to code before solving problems is misguided; many students are turned off by hours of work to try to write a couple of meaningless lines rather than solving real problems. The key value add data scientists make is solving problems, not writing something in a language a computer understands.\n2. The examples are based on real client work. This is not like other classes that use Kaggle data sets for who survived the Titanic, or guessing what type of flower it is based on petal measurements. Those are interesting, but not useful for people wanting to sell more products, or optimize the performance of their teams. These examples are based on real client problems that companies spent big money to hire consultants (me) to solve.\n3. Visual workflows. KNIME uses a visual workflow similar to what you'll see in Alteryx or Azure Machine Learning Studio and I genuinely think it is the future of data science. It is a better way of visualizing the problem as your are exploring data, cleaning data, and ultimately modeling. It is also something that makes your process far easier to explain to non-data scientists making it easier to work with other parts of your business.\nSummary: This course covers the full gamut of the machine learning workflow, from data and business understanding, through exploration, cleaning, modeling, and ultimately evaluation of the model. We then discuss the practical aspects of what you can change, and how you can change it, to drive impact in the business.",

Most of the other courses heavily focus on \"Programming\" deep learning applications as fast as possible, without giving detailed explanations on the underlying mathematical foundations that the field of deep learning was built upon. And this is exactly the gap that my course is designed to cover. It is designed to be used hand in hand with other programming courses, not to replace them.\nSince this series is heavily mathematical, I will refer many many times during my explanations to sections from my own college level linear algebra course. In general, being quite familiar with linear algebra is a real prerequisite for this course.\n\n\nPlease have a look at the course syllables, and remember : This is only part (I) of the deep learning series!",
