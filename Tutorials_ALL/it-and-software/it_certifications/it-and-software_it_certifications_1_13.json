This course is entirely practice-based, designed to help you learn Scrum through hands-on experience. The questions are structured in two formats: a series of tests that fully simulate the actual PSM1 exam in terms of question count and time limits, and an additional section containing the rest of my question collection to ensure you have access to everything. Even if some questions seem similar, don’t be fooled—a small detail can change the correct answer.\n\n\nThe exam simulation tests will help you build confidence and get familiar with the real exam format. However, if you're a beginner, it can feel overwhelming, so I recommend answering as many as you can and taking breaks when needed. As you get used to the questions, it will become easier, and you'll be able to complete full exam simulations. Many have passed the certification just by consistently taking tests—at first, it may feel tough, but with practice, you’ll improve and truly understand Scrum.\n\n\nThis course contains only tests—no theory—except for explanations on trickier questions. If something seems unclear, I encourage you to check the Scrum Guide. By passing these tests, you’ll be fully prepared to pass the PSM1 exam without any additional study.",

The reason for this is that many terms in the field of Security can be used in relation to each other in different subjects.\nFor example, Virtualization is mentioned in many places.\nAlthough the basic meaning is the same, usage types can gain different meanings on different platforms.\nLectures are short and for exam purposes.\nIf you wish, you can improve yourself by using the topics covered in the lessons.\nBecause at the end of the course, you will see all the topics used in the field of Cloud technologies.\nAll you have to do is research the subject on the internet and keep learning.\nSample questions were given at the end of each chapter throughout the course.\nThese questions are often similar to those found in the CompTIA Cloud + exam earlier.\nThere is no such thing as always the same question will appear in the exam.\nHowever, the questions to be asked on a certain subject are also close to each other.\nThis is for the course.\nCompTIA updates its exams every 3 years.\nThe CV0-003 exam has been updated in 2021.\n\n\nBasically, in the CompTIA Essentials +( CLO-002) exam;\n1. Architecture and Design\n2. Virtualization technologies\n3. Application\n4. Operations and Incident Response\n5. Governance, Risk and Compliance\nQuestions are asked from the fields.

Cloud+ requires a comprehensive understanding of cloud infrastructure, virtualisation, security, and troubleshooting. Another contrast between the Cloud+ and Cloud Essentials+ certifications is shelf-life. Once you earn your Cloud Essentials certification, you have it for life. You don't need to recertify. You may ultimately want to add to that certification, but the certification will be on your resume whether you make on it or not.\n\n\nDoes cloud essentials expire?\nThe CompTIA Cloud Essentials+ certification does not need to be renewed.\n\n\nHow many questions are on the cloud essentials exam?\nWhat is this certification about? For a detailed description of the certification and its objectives, I recommend visiting the CompTIA website.

These practice exams have helped me a lot, especially the explanations for the answers!\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSample Question + Solution:\nYou work as a DevOps engineer tasked with creating a permanent X server configuration file. Which command will generate a temporary config file based on detected hardware?\n\nA) sudo xorg . conf --generate\n\nB) sudo Xorg --save-config\n\nC) sudo systemctl restart xorg\n\nD) sudo Xorg -configure\n\n\nCorrect Answer: D\nExplanation:\nXorg -configure generates a new temporary xorg . conf . new file based on detected hardware and drivers. The file is created in the current directory and must be moved to /etc/X11/xorg.conf for permanent use. Other commands listed are either invalid or unrelated to generating config files\n\n\nA) Incorrect — This command is not valid. xorg.conf is a configuration file, not an executable or utility. You cannot run it with --generate. To generate an Xorg configuration file, the correct command is Xorg -configure.\n\n\nB) Incorrect — This is not a valid Xorg option. Xorg does not support a --save-config flag. To generate a configuration based on hardware detection, you must use Xorg -configure.\n\n\nC) Incorrect — This command attempts to restart a service named xorg, which typically does not exist as a systemd service. Even if it did, restarting the X server does not generate a configuration file — it merely restarts the graphical session.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWhy LPIC-1 (102-500)?\nThe LPIC-1 certification proves your ability to perform maintenance tasks, assist users, and configure basic networking — crucial skills for Linux professionals.

It also relates to other departments.\nAs you follow the course, you will hear the same terms in different lessons. The reason for this is that many terms in the field of Security can be used in relation to each other in different subjects.\nFor example, Virtualization is mentioned in many places.\nAlthough the basic meaning is the same, usage types can gain different meanings on different platforms.\nLectures are short and for exam purposes.\nIf you wish, you can improve yourself by using the topics covered in the lessons.\nBecause at the end of the course, you will see all the topics used in the field of Cloud technologies.\nAll you have to do is research the subject on the internet and keep learning.\nSample questions were given at the end of each chapter throughout the course.\nThese questions are often similar to those found in the CompTIA Cloud + exam earlier.\nThere is no such thing as always the same question will appear in the exam.\nHowever, the questions to be asked on a certain subject are also close to each other.\nThis is for the course.\nCompTIA updates its exams every 3 years.\nThe CV0-003 exam has been updated in 2021.\n\n\nBasically, in the CompTIA Essentials +( CLO-002) exam;\n1. Architecture and Design\n2. Virtualization technologies\n3. Application\n4. Operations and Incident Response\n5. Governance, Risk and Compliance\nQuestions are asked from the fields. During the course, topics related to these areas are explained.\n\n\nWhat Skills Will You Learn?\nCloud Concepts: Cloud principles, cloud networking concepts and storage techniques, and cloud design aspects\nBusiness Principles of Cloud Environments: Appropriate cloud assessments like feasibility studies, benchmarking or gap analysis, key business aspects of cloud vendor relation adoption and cloud migration approaches\nManagement and Technical Operations: Aspects of operating within the cloud, such as data management or optimization and the role of DevOps in cloud environments, like API integration or provisioning\nGovernance, Risk, Compliance and Security for the Cloud: Risk management and response concepts related to cloud services and the importance and impacts of compliance in the cloud, such as regulatory concerns or international standards\n\n\nIn this course you will learn;\n- Basic information about cloud technologies\n- Pass the CompTIA Essentials+ certification exam with confidence\n- Understanding computer security, its functions and components\n- Performing basic security configurations\n- Become an effective security technician in a business environment\n- Network topologies\n- Threat analysis\nNo prior knowledge required!\n\n\nFAQs about Comptia Cloud Essentials+\n\nWhat is the difference between cloud and cloud essentials?\nCompTIA Cloud+ delves into more technical aspects and covers a broader range of cloud related topics compared to Cloud Essentials. Cloud+ requires a comprehensive understanding of cloud infrastructure, virtualisation, security, and troubleshooting. Another contrast between the Cloud+ and Cloud Essentials+ certifications is shelf-life. Once you earn your Cloud Essentials certification, you have it for life. You don't need to recertify. You may ultimately want to add to that certification, but the certification will be on your resume whether you make on it or not.\n\n\nDoes cloud essentials expire?\nThe CompTIA Cloud Essentials+ certification does not need to be renewed.\n\n\nHow many questions are on the cloud essentials exam?\nWhat is this certification about? For a detailed description of the certification and its objectives, I recommend visiting the CompTIA website. The exam consists of 75 questions, and you have 60 minutes to complete it (less than a minute per each).\n\nWhat is the passing score for cloud essentials?\nOur exam prep will get you ready for the four key areas of the exam: Cloud Concepts, Business Principles of Cloud Environments, Management and Technical Operations, and Governance, Risk, Compliance, and Security for Cloud. A passing score for the Cloud+ Essentials exam is 720 (on a scale of 100-900).\n\nIs CompTIA Cloud+ certification worth IT?\nCompTIA's Cloud+ is great for IT professionals in a wide range of disciplines. Obviously it's a good choice for those working in the cloud, but networking and systems administrators will also benefit from having it on their resume.\n\n\nWhy do you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: quality of teaching.\n\n\nWhen you sign up, you will feel the expertise of our experienced instructors.\n\n\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produceed as high quality video and audio to provide you with the best learning experience.\n\n\nYou'll be,\n● see clearly\n● Clear hearing\n● Proceeding in the lesson without being distracted\n\n\nYou will also receive:\n● Lifetime Access to the Course\n● Quick and Easy Support in the Q&A section\n● Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready to Download\n\n\n\n\nDive now into “CompTIA Cloud Essentials+ (CLO-002) Certification Exam Prep Lab” course.\nCompTIA Cloud Essentials+ | Cloud Concepts, Cloud Security, Cloud Management and more to pass the Cloud Essentials+ exam\n\n\nWe offer full support by answering any questions.\nSee you at the course!",

And for troubleshooting to be efficient, it has to be systematic and logical and not by random trial and error attempts.\nIn this course, I will demonstrate troubleshooting of IP Services on Cisco Devices. You can use this course to learn how to troubleshoot Cisco Routers in real production and to help you to prepare for the CCNP TSHOOT exam and the Troubleshooting section of the CCIE lab exam. If you are already have CCNA level knowledge and/or experience, or you are in the middle of your CCNA studies, then you can use this course as a start for learning advanced troubleshooting.\n\nIn this course you will learn how to troubleshoot the following IP services:\nDHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)\nNAT (Network Address Translation)\nNTP (Network Time Protocol)\nHSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol )\nThis course uses multiple explaining ways in addition to videos. At the beginning of the course there is an article for summarized troubleshooting steps that is available for download as a PDF and which I recommend to be read before watching the videos. And for each lab, initial configuration will be available for download in order for students to practice the labs and challenge themselves if they can solve the tickets before watching the videos or even after. In addition, there will be a practice test for the student to check what he has learned. Some tickets have multiple possible solutions. Therefore, restrictions have been set so that there should be only one valid solution.\nLet us start the course together and begin the troubleshooting journey. Happy troubleshooting !",

      "description": "Are you preparing for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Associate 2025 (1Z0-1085-25)?\nThis course is designed to help you effectively prepare for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Associate 2025 (1Z0-1085-25) certification exam. Through a comprehensive collection of updated, Spanish-translated questions and answers, this course will reinforce your understanding of OCI's core concepts and assess your readiness for the official exam.\n\n\nIn this course, you’ll find 80 carefully structured practice questions, aligned with the topic areas defined by Oracle for their training program, covering key topics such as:\nIntroduction to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM)\nNetworking\nCompute Services\nStorage\nSecurity\nGovernance and Administration\n\n\nEach question is crafted with accuracy and reflects the essence of the real exam, providing a reliable mirror of what to expect on exam day.\n\n\nEvery question comes with detailed explanations, covering both correct and incorrect options. These explanations are supported by diagrams and reference links to ensure a deep understanding of all areas assessed in the OCI Foundations Associate 2025 (1Z0-1085-25).\nThink of this course as the final step in your study journey, empowering you to approach your OCI certification with complete confidence. You're on a safe and expert-guided path.\n\n\nAll our questions are 100% original!\n\n\nYou will get (2) full-length practice exams with 40 high-quality questions each, designed to fully prepare you for the OCI Foundations Associate 2025 certification.\n\n\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nIn Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Block Volume service, which feature allows you to increase the size of a block volume without downtime?\na) Online Resizing\nb) Dynamic Volume Resizing\nc) Volume Bursting\nd) Volume Elasticity\n\n\nCorrect Answer: a) Online Resizing\n\n\nExplanation:\nCorrect Option:\nThe Online Resizing feature allows you to increase the size of a Block Volume or Boot Volume without stopping the instance or detaching the volume—i.e., with zero downtime. This can be done from the OCI Console, CLI, or API. After resizing, the OS must rescan and extend the partition to recognize the new size.\n\n\nIncorrect Options:\nb) \"Dynamic Volume Resizing\" is not an official OCI feature.\nc) \"Volume Bursting\" refers to temporary performance increase, not storage size.\nd) \"Volume Elasticity\" is not a term used by Oracle for this feature.\n\n\n\n\nInstructor\nMy name is Gerald Then. I’m a Software and Infrastructure Architect based in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nWith years of experience as a web and mobile developer, I’ve also worked extensively across cloud platforms including Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and in the field of AI.

But because most NGFWs were not designed with this performance in mind, some solutions will simply be unable to meet these demands of tomorrow without an enormous price tag—and in many cases, not even then.\n· Overall management complexity: Automation and orchestration at scale is difficult in diverse, hybrid IT environments without simple, centralized management.\n\n\nThe Opportunity\nThe era of hyperscale has arrived, from high-velocity e-retail, to the requirements of research organizations sharing large files among distributed sites rapidly, and for mobile network operators for the move from 4G to 5G networks and delivery of broadband internet on wireless devices—everyone needs hyperscale security.

This is because these topics or commands are confusing by their nature, or because the way that they are typically explained to the students. Therefore, the idea of this course came in my mind, which intend to clarify those confusing topics or commands.\nIn this course you will learn about the following topics:\nHow to understand the network command: How is it related to subnet ID and  mask configured on the interface? Do we have to configure this command with that parameters, or we can use other ones?\nThe OSPF process ID is locally significant: What does that mean? Has the process ID to be the same on routers to form adjacency? Can we configure different process IDs on the same router and why?\nUnderstanding the longest match rule: what is that rule? How is the best path selected and by what order? Are Administrative Distances and Metrics the only factors when selecting the best path?\nUnderstanding the VTP Client Mode: What does propagation in that mode mean? Can a Client switch override the VLAN configuration of a Server Switch? Why have we to be careful when using VTP? and how to properly move a switch from branch to another?\nAdvanced Configuration of Static Routing: which explains Load Balancing using Static Routing, Floating Static Routes with IP SLA, Getting Help from HSRP and Verifying the Configuration, Static Routing using DHCP, and Configuring Permanent Static Routes. This part is challenging and has a lot of information!.\nRouting trobleshooting Lab.\nNetwork Attacks Using Features of the IP Protocol: including the IP smurfing attack.\nYou do not have to watch the videos in any particular order.  You can go directly and watch the videos related to topics or commands that you feel that they confusing or not clear. At the end of the course, there will be a practice test that you can use to find if these topics or commands are clear or still confuse you. You can attempt this practice test after watching the videos as a final check or even before to decide which topics or section you have to watch\nAs a bonus, I have added a lab that will help you to understand how to troubleshoot routing protocols, specifically OSPF and EIGRP.\nI hope that that you will find this course useful, and that it will clarify confusing topics or commands for you, so that you can fully understand the CCNA curriculum, and be ready for your CCNP studies!.",

Your success is our priority.\n\n\n\n\nSample Question with Detailed Explanations\nQuestion:\nYou need to configure an Azure Virtual Desktop environment to ensure high availability of session host VMs. What should you do?\nAnswer Options:\nUse Availability Zones\nExplanation: Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region that ensure your VMs are spread across multiple data centers, providing high availability and fault tolerance.\nUse Availability Sets\nExplanation: Availability Sets ensure that VMs are distributed across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches within a data center, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.\nUse Managed Disks\nExplanation: Managed Disks provide higher reliability and availability, but they are not specifically designed to ensure the high availability of session host VMs.\nEnable Autoscaling\nExplanation: Autoscaling helps manage the number of VMs based on demand but does not directly ensure high availability.\nImplement Azure Site Recovery\nExplanation: Azure Site Recovery is designed for disaster recovery, not for high availability within a single region.\nConfigure Load Balancer\nExplanation: A Load Balancer distributes network traffic across multiple VMs but does not ensure high availability by itself.\nCorrect Answer:\nUse Availability Zones\nUse Availability Sets\nOverall Explanation:\nTo ensure high availability of Azure Virtual Desktop session host VMs, it's crucial to leverage both Availability Zones and Availability Sets. Availability Zones provide redundancy across multiple data centers, while Availability Sets protect against failures within a data center by distributing VMs across multiple hardware components. Combining these strategies ensures a robust and highly available virtual desktop infrastructure.\nDomain: High Availability and Resiliency\n\n\n\n\nBy now, we hope you're convinced that our course is the best resource to help you ace the AZ-140 exam. Our extensive and original question bank, detailed explanations, and supportive instructors will guide you every step of the way.\nPrepare with confidence and join the ranks of successful Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop professionals.

      "description": "*** part of the full course: MTA - Networking Fundamentals (Teaching and Learning) ***\n\n\nMTA or Microsoft Technology Associate is an entry-level certification that provides the fundamentals of a certain technology based on Microsoft products. The MTA: Networking fundamentals (exam 98-366) is one of these certifications that will provide essential networking knowledge and skills to you. This certification can be your first step in networking and towards other advanced Microsoft certifications such as MCSA and MCSE. It can be considered as the Microsoft version of Network+ or Cisco ICND1/CCENT.\nIn this course you will start the first steps of learning about networking. You will learn about what is a computer network, and what are local area networks or LANs, since those are the most basic form of a network you will encounter in real world. After that we have to understand network addresses in order to assign them to devices in our network, and thus enable communication between those devices.  But before that, we have to understand numbering systems, such as binary and hexadecimal, since network addresses such as IPv4, IPv6, and MAC are implemented using these  numbering systems.\nNow as you have understood the concepts of network addressing, it is time to practice with them, and we will use Cisco packet Tracer for that purpose. Afterwards, you have to understand how to map between different types of addresses using ARP, or the Address Resolution Protocol, and why this mapping is needed. Also ICMP or the Internet Control Message Protocol  will be explained to demonstrate how communication in computer networks works. And again will we practice both ARP and ICMP using Packet Tracer in order to understand the concepts, and start establishing our hands on expertise.\nFurthermore, Network Media Types will be explained, starting with wired network media and its different types, followed by brief but focused explanation of the wireless network media.\nFinally, network topologies including Token ring, FDDI, and Ethernet will be explained. To understand Ethernet in practice, the explanation of how both hubs and switches work was included.\nI hope that you will join me in this course and start your journey of leaning computer networking. Happy learning!",

      "description": "Dave Rush presents a Practical Subnetting guide for everyone from beginning students to seasoned network professionals though foundational concepts through subnetting Class A, B and C IP network addresses. Each section comes with downloadable, follow-along slides that can be used to review well after you complete the course. Each section will also have an end-of-section quiz and there is a practice exam at the end of the course to test all of the covered topics. (Note - we're furiously writing the quizzes and practice test as quickly as possible. They should be added by mid-April, 2025).\n\n\nThe course opens with a basic overview of IP address notations. From there, we present binary and base-2 number systems, using base-10 concepts to review how binary notation works. We illustrate how there is only one combination of 1s and 0s to represent any number. Students will easily be able to convert back and forth between binary and decimal numbers.\n\n\nNext, we introduce the concept of Classful IP addressing. This was how the first Internet addresses were distributed to users, organizations and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Classful addressing is a fundamental and critical concept to understanding subnetting. With Classful addressing comes the concept of a subnet mask, network address classes and the skill to quickly identify a class of address, its subnet mask and which octets are used in the network address and which are used in host/node addresses.\n\n\nWe continue our exploration of Classful addressing to review special IP addresses. We present the uses of special IP addresses and what makes them so special.\n\n\nWith these concepts secure, we're ready to delve into the seemingly mysterious and arcane world of subnetting. Using the step-by-step approach, we learn the reasons for subnetting and a simple, four-step process. By provide extensive demonstrations and explanations, student gain confidence and competence in moving from a Classful IP addressing world to a Classless IP address on in which single network address assignments can be broken up into smaller, manageable sub-networks. These networks lend themselves to organizing network hosts, improving network traffic efficiency, making network management an easier task and provides other benefits.\n\n\nThe key to understanding subnetting, in this course, is that we approach the topic from a practical perspective. We learn the four-step subnetting process and as we apply the steps, we learn the technical underpinnings of the process.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, students can confidently and competently create multiple sub-networks from a single network, connect the subnets to routers and apply appropriate ranges of host addresses on each subnet.",
      "target_audience": [
        "This course is ideally suited to students preparing for CompTIA Network+ and Cisco CCNA students who want a greater understanding of calculating and implement subnets. It is also an excellent research for working network professionals who want to sharpen their subnetting skills and to view the process from a non-traditional approach and perspective."

Skip any difficult questions and come back to them later.\n\n\nRead the questions carefully: Read each question carefully and understand what it’s asking. Make sure you are answering the question that’s being asked and not just giving a general response.\n\n\nStay calm and confident: Finally, stay calm and confident during the exam.

      "description": "Are you preparing to be Datadog Fundamentals certified? Taking the practice tests here will help you in two ways:\nTest the coverage of your knowledge - Most Datadog users master the features that they use in their day-to-day work but are less familiar with functionalities that they need less frequently. You can use the practice test to test how much you already know and which topics you need to learn more about. Each question in the practice tests includes an explanation and/or points to the relevant Datadog documentation for you to review.\nFamiliarize you with the question patterns - Getting certified through a multiple choice test is a skill on top of your Datadog product knowledge. You can use the practice test to help anticipate how questions are phrased and how wrong choices are presented to distract you from the correct answer. The questions are designed to mimic the tone and style of the official Datadog certification to simulate the testing experience.\nNote: This is a practice tests course only so there will be no lectures. Although there are no lectures, you can master Datadog concepts by reviewing the explanation on each question.\nThis course contains multiple practice tests with 90 questions each. Each practice test should be taken in under 2 hours.\nThe practice test only contains multiple choice type of question similar to the real Datadog certification. There's one correct response and two or more incorrect responses. You need to select the response that best answers the question posed. There are no deductions for choosing incorrect answers.\nThe practice tests will test your knowledge on the following topics:\nGeneral computing knowledge\nUnderstanding configuration file types and modification\nUnderstanding hardware and operating system concepts\nInterpreting small programs and shell commands\nNetworking for sending and receiving monitoring data\nNote: The real Datadog certification may test you on YAML formatting, basic Python coding, etc. which may seem unrelated to Datadog. They are related because the Datadog Agent uses YAML for configuration; and custom integrations and custom metric submission are written in Python. The practice tests here will also test you on these type of questions.\nConfiguring the Datadog Agent for development\nInstalling the Agent and its integrations in different infrastructure types\nUsing API keys and application keys\nKnowing the hostnames, ports, and IP addresses used by the Agent\nUnderstanding the Agent's auto-discovery capabilities\nCollecting data for monitoring\nCollecting data through Datadog crawlers and Agent integrations\nCollecting data through DogStatsD and rest API\nApplying best practices for tagging data\nUnderstanding metrics or timeseries data in Datadog\nVisualizing and utilizing data\nReading the host map, dashboards, and other default views\nCreating custom dashboards\nQuerying with metrics and tags\nAlerting with monitors\nTroubleshooting Datadog monitoring\nUsing Agent commands for troubleshooting\nReading Agent log files for troubleshooting\nInvestigating Agent configuration files",

      "description": "Welcome to the KN Learning Security and Encryption training. Security and encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.\nFor technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.\nHistorically, various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography. Early encryption techniques were often utilized in military messaging. Since then, new techniques have emerged and become commonplace in all areas of modern computing. Modern encryption schemes utilize the concepts of public-key and symmetric-key. Modern encryption techniques ensure security because modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption.\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a system of communication where only the communicating users can read the messages. In principle, it prevents potential eavesdroppers – including telecom providers, Internet providers, and even the provider of the communication service – from being able to access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation.\nEnd-to-end encryption is intended to prevent data being read or secretly modified, other than by the true sender and recipient(s). The messages are encrypted by the sender but the third party does not have a means to decrypt them, and stores them encrypted. The recipients retrieve the encrypted data and decrypt it themselves. On this training you will learn the basics of encryption and how to apply encryption concepts.",
