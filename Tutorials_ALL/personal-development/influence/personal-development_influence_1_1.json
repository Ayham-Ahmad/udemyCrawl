      "description": "Ever noticed that some people turn heads as soon as they step into a business meeting, enter a bar, or climb onto a stage?\nIn the movie business, it's called having “star quality.”\nAnd while that quality is pretty hard to define, we all know it whenever we see someone who radiates what I call a “1000-watt presence.”\nThey have that rare ability to elicit admiring glances from onlookers, entice friendly smiles from strangers, and arouse intense engagement from whoever they're speaking with.\nIf they're a public speaker, their charisma makes audiences sit up and listen.\nBut not only do they have a commanding presence. For some reason, people also instinctively feel they “click” with them.\nThe good news is that radiating this sort of mystifying presence is built on a foundation of unshakable confidence, which is something anyone can learn -- with the right teacher.\n“Alexa is engaging, has a lot of presence when she speaks, and is so confident that it makes you want to be like her…” — Paulo Knabben, Udemy student\nIf you believe right now you could never express such a dazzling persona, this course will prove that you’re mistaken.\nHi, I’m Alexa Fischer and I’ve appeared on hit TV shows like Lie to Me, NCIS, CSI, Numb3rs, Bones as well as a whole bunch of television commercials, so I know a bit about what star quality really means. But my greatest endeavor has been to help people rise above their fears and illusory obstacles to achieve their deepest desires.\nMy background also means I know a lot about why some people end up becoming wallflowers while others shine brilliantly in the company of strangers and acquaintances alike.\nSo, what’s the secret of a 1000-watt presence?\nThe core components of this star quality, I’ve discovered over the years, are releasing your fears, connecting to your inner power, and polishing your presence, so you can show up for life’s opportunities (in person, on stage, and even in front of the lens) with authenticity and ease.\nIn this course, I’ll be breaking down the habits of 1000-watt individuals and showing you how to embed their characteristics so deeply into your being that your own presence sparkles naturally.\nI’ll show you how to use your body, voice, and your mindset to make an instant impression on others.\nI’ll also give you the tools to maintain a powerful connection with others that will last a lifetime.\nDon’t believe it’s possible? I’m here to tell you that it is.\nI’ve taught executives, teams, and companies of all sizes how to connect more fully to themselves and each other. From Trader Joe’s and SONY, to Dress For Success and the National Charity League, to an appearance on The Today Show – I’ve empowered thousands of individuals and teams to land new clients, focus their vision and articulate their goals, engage more meaningfully with customers, and communicate better with each other.\nI’ve seen students go from hesitation to awesomeness in a matter of weeks.\nI can do the same for you too — whether you’re an aspiring instructor, a person wanting to stand out in business, or just someone looking for more dates.\n“Just amazing…” — Ahmed Hanafy, Udemy student\n“Inspiring…” — Cheryl Loudon, Udemy student\n“You very soon become immersed in her performance…” — Anton Knapic, Udemy student\n“Lots to think about…” — Dan Halbert, Udemy student\n\"The world needs more people like her…” — Nicolas Ordonez, Udemy student\n“Awesome…” — Pawan Verma, Udemy student\n“Really feeling like I can add some value to this world…” — Paula Doherty, Udemy student\nNow, I know there are lots of “gurus” out there teaching confidence. What makes this program unique is a step-by-step approach to help you identify and release all the blocks that have been holding you back in the past.\nYou’ll learn how to:\nIdentify the habitual way you think, move, and speak (and how to improve!)\nBuild unshakeable confidence with energy psychology techniques\nEnjoy the art of casual conversation, so you can build amazing relationships\nBe an incredible salesperson, easily and authentically\nDeliver amazing presentations that influence audiences\nBe Comfortable on Camera, since video is everywhere....\nJoin now and dive into over 4.5 hours of on-demand video with a 30-day money-back guarantee. There's no risk and sooooooooo much reward. Join thousands of other students NOW.\nSee you in class!\n“I’ve been a medical analyst on TV for almost a year… this course should have been the first thing I did to prepare. It just made me so much better…” —  Asuppiah Suppiah, Udemy student\n“Alexa's energy makes you want to take on the world…” — Jason Turri, Udemy student\n“I feel like my best friend is encouraging me to be the most brilliant I can be…” — Padma Wangmo, Udemy student\n“The energy that Alexa gives out is amazing and addictive…” Jenny Sullivan, Udemy student",

This is already the best public speaking course I've ever taken. I'm very excited to continue!\" Christine Arella\n\n“If you only have time/money for one public speaking class, this needs to be it! TJ Walker, a proven media and public speaking expert have way over-delivered in his Complete Public Speaking Masterclass For Every Occasion. I like how there's a comprehensive curriculum, but you can just hop around to the sections that apply to you. Not EVERY section is going to apply, but with 550 videos (the max on Udemy) you can't go wrong buying this course. Each section is also in easy-to-watch chunks.” Stephanie Mojica, Udemy student\n\"If you like TJ Walker's style, this is the perfect course, extremely comprehensive, covering many different subjects and speaking situations.\" Sven Hendrix\n\n\"I took this course to help me make my work presentations more interesting. I was stunned at how much content was available! There are lessons and helpful hints on every conceivable public speaking situation. It was like having a personal coach. TJ, the instructor, is very personable and interesting and each topic is mercifully short, even though there are a lot. I was able to spend a few minutes a day at lunch or during a break and I could complete a module. I was able to start putting the course material to work immediately and already felt my presentations were more engaging after the first lecture. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who is giving presentations, even if it's just meetings in your office.\" Lisa Heller\n\"Brilliant!!! I have gained a wealth of applicable knowledge and insights from TJ, just got through the first part of this course and will be studying through several times over and continuing on! It’s incredibly important to me that as an aspiring life &motivational coach, I’m coming across as conversational to my audience as if they are someone I’m coaching personally~ sharing messages that are relevant, engaging, and to the point without rambling lol! I’m grateful for what a ginormous gift it is having access to this level of coaching from TJ!!! Highly recommend!\" Jennifer LaGuardia\n\"Hello guys, don't go any further than this. I think this course is a masterpiece. TJ is a very experienced instructor, and he has a way of explaining things, that for me, is incomparable to other so-called public speaking experts on this platform. Thanks, TJ for this amazing course. Highly recommended.\" Udemy Student Stefano Buiaroni\n\n\"TJ is very easy to listen to. I find myself smiling and laughing quite often. I love his energy and he seems to be extremely competent. This course is unbelievably comprehensive. I have never seen a course even attempting what he is trying to do with this course.\" Udemy Student Daniel Nelson\n\"This is by far the best public speaking course I have ever attended. TJ Walker knows the subject. Explanations are clear and understandable. Lots of tips from a professional public speaker who has many years of experience. Also, the teacher is very engaging - if I had no other responsibilities, I guess I would have watched the course all night long. Highly recommend!\" Udemy student Diana\n\"Best public speaking Course ever Without any doubt this course is the best course about public speaking on the internet I said that as a professional public speaking trainer and coach with more than 300 seminars and years of experience I hope all people join this course and enjoy! Thank you TJ for your Great Course\" Payam Bahrampoor\n\n\"I'm absolutely blown away. The author is very clearly not just a theoretician but a great speaker himself. I'm often finding myself smiling to the screen and it's a real pleasure to go through this course which is just packed with invaluable and precise information.\" Aleksander Majewski\n\"This is one the best public speaking resource you'll probably ever find. I cannot imagine anything as comprehensive as taking this 30-hour course.\"  Jake Senn\n\n\"TJ Walker has been teaching public speaking to top-level professionals for decades. He's polished, engaging, and obviously passionate and super-knowledgeable about the subject. I don't think you'll find more comprehensive, better expertise and video coaching for public speaking anywhere on the planet!\" Mike Ososki\n\"My friend recommended this course to me and yeah, he was right, truly by far the best public speaking course on the internet. I like how he was straight to the point in every lesson and did not waste my time with unwanted information. Totally worth it! I recommend it to everybody.\" Madamin Davari\n\"The best and most complete general class lecture tutorial for any occasion\" E. Hasani\n\"Very well-designed program with no-nonsense advice. I really like the strategic focus on what we want our audience to do from our presentations. And delivering messages that motivate them to do what we want them to do. Tj is a world-class expert on this topic.\" Mohammad Waheedi\n\"This masterclass is the best thing I came across when it comes to public speaking. It has everything I need. I`m a corporate trainer and had trouble recording an e-course using a teleprompter. The part about reading a teleprompter alone is worth the 200 $. Another great tool I picked up from TJ is the use of a cheat sheet. I now have a cheat sheet per hour of training I deliver and I`m always on point. TJ is a true professional and my favorite trainer on Udemy by far.\" Pantea Sebastian\n\"The course is stimulating and thought-provoking. Some of the solutions are simple, yet incredibly effective, particularly the video recording of presentations and watching it back! Would recommend it to anyone who wants to build on their experience of public speaking. Many thanks!\" Carol Dobbins\n\"Awesome course. Highly recommended it to everyone who wants to be a public speaker or lecturer. TJ Walker explains everything very simple and understandable. He covers all important aspects of public speaking and provides students with multitudes of mindsets, techniques, and methods. By taking this course, you do not need to study any other course on public speaking. Thank you so much, TJ Walker.\" Sajed M\n\n\"I think that is the most comprehensive course I have ever seen. Good job man\" Arsalan mashayekhi\n\"I can’t believe this course is only $199. I think its value is over $1000.\" Nicholas Taylor-D’Ambrosio\n\"Great ideas so far on how to improve speaking in public - such a simple thing can prevent you from progressing in business and public life. We all have to speak to be heard and TJ makes it seem so easy. Practice makes perfect - I look forward to seeing what else is recommended in this course.\" Cordelia Carlsson\n\"I think this course is confronting all the important aspects of public speaking. I feel relatively comfortable with my public speaking ability already and yet this course has already got me thinking about aspects I have not thought about to help me improve my ability.\" Adam Stevens\n\"Exactly what I have been looking for - great advice from clearly an expert pro. I have been getting by on intuition I think and seem to be hitting lots of marks - but learned so many more and I am excited to use them - thank you x\" Tanya Marguerite Grant\n\n\"This course is really comprehensive. TJ puts lots of energy into it. He is really competent and expert. I really appreciate him for making such a comprehensive and excellent course.\" Mohammad Saleh Gholami\n\"This truly is a master class. He covers everything that could possibly be covered, in my opinion. Take the classes, do the exercises, make the videos, and you will improve. Like Nike says, 'Just Do It! Like TJ says, you have to practice. He reiterates it, constantly, in this course because it is an issue. Just watching the course doesn't help. You have to act on them, and practice. Watch your practice, critique, and do it again. TJ has so much valid information, I know that I will be back to review and digest more of it. Great job, TJ.\" Teresa Trimm\n\"Excellent Course; covers everything efficiently and effectively!\" Mubashir Sheikh\n\"TJ's suggestions are direct and real-world. I've been putting them to use immediately, e.g. - practicing in front of a camera, reducing presentations to a few bullet points, and asking audience members for feedback... This course is ideal.\" Peter Laskowich\n\"Thank you TJ for the course. The best course ever. I was a public speaking trainer do recommend this course to everyone. It is fluent and practical. Don't miss this course.\" Hamed Ali Abdollahi\n\"Perfect and beyond expectations! Thanks, TJ Walker!\" Saghar Vahidi\n\"All that you need to conquer the barrier of public speaking is included in this comprehensive course. The course is full of examples, tips, and tricks. At first, the general points of public speaking are declared and then detailed instructions and examples of speeches are prepared for most of the occasions needed in life from childhood to all the job times, weddings and etc. This is one of the strengths of the course and its main distinctions to many other courses. the instructor is so energetic and the course is designed in small pieces so that you don't get bored due to the short time of videos.\" Zohreh Sadat Haghayeghi\n\"Okay, I am just halfway through this course and I usually wait till the end before giving a review, but this is already the best course on public speaking I've seen so far. T. J. knows exactly what he is talking about, even the parts I don't care that much about are interesting to watch, just because he is doing what he's teaching. Great course. Recommended.\" Peter Schmuttermaier\n\"It couldn't be any better, I found many useful tips which are applicable. As a teacher, the course is helping me. What's more, It covers every area of public speaking. It's more than what I wanted. Thanks TJ\" Shamseddin Khojasteh Nia\n\"So far so VERY good. TJ is an excellent teacher giving great tips on the very first video. It's not all about Me, Me, Me. It is all about YOU, the person reading this. Even if you think you know it all, you will learn something important in this course. I'm sure I'm only at the very tip of the iceberg.\" Brian Maddison\n\"TJ Walker really knows his stuff. This course is so interesting and engaging that I want to watch all the lessons asap. I'm learning something new in every lesson. Also, TJ is walking his talk and talking his walk. {:-)\" Rohi Shetty\n\"Awesome course, all in one. I feel so confident about public speaking after taking this course. Very well designed and content delivery was very effective.\" Imran Afzal\n\"I prefer Mr. Walker's approach to communication: rational and down-to-earth. I really liked the trick he used - candidly recording his trainees so that later he could show them that they are actually capable of talking in a relaxed and natural way.\" Biljana Vasev\n\n\nPlease Note: This is a public speaking class where the instructor teaches public speaking by, well, speaking. If you are looking for a course with lots of graphics, music, special effects, slides, and razz ma taz, don't take this course.\n\n\nGain the insights and confidence you need to succeed by enrolling today!\n\nThis course is also designed to help people with skills in the following areas: Selling with stories, Virtual Sales presentations, Pitching Yourself, Virtual interviewing, Remote selling and conducting consumer sales training masterclasses.\nThis Public Speaking course is ideal for anyone searching for more info on the following: public speaking - presentation - speaking confidently - public speaking for beginners - kids - first steps into public speaking - speech.
