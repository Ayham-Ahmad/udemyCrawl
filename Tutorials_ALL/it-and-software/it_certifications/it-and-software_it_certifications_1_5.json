Actually it is the one and only advanced course between all MikroTik courses and it requires as a pre-requisite the MTCNA course as well as MTCRE course.\nAs being a complex course, I have decided to design this course in which I explain all topics of the MTCINE track. In this course, I will explain and do LABS about the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Multiple Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) which are both considered very advanced topics and implemented inside the networks of the Internet Service Provider (ISP).\nSo in this course, I will cover the following topics:\n• What is Autonomous System (AS)\n• What is Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)?\n• Path Vector algorithm\n• BGP Transport and packet types\n• iBGP and eBGP\n• Stub network scenarios and private AS removal\n• Non-stub scenarios\n• iBGP and eBGP multi-hop and loopback usage\n• Route distribution and routing filters\n• BGP best path selection algorithm\n• BGP prefix attributes and their usage\n• BGP route reflectors and confederations\n• MPLS basics\n• Static label mapping\n• Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)\n• Penultimate-hop-popping\n• MPLS traceroute differences\n• LDP based VPLS tunnels\n• Bridge split horizon\n• BGP based VPLS\n• BGP based layer3 tunnels (L3VPN)\n• What is traffic engineering and how it works\n• RSVP, static path, dynamic path (CSPF)\n• Bandwidth allocation and bandwidth limitation differences and settings\n\n\nAll my courses will be based on LABS, so I advice you to run GNS3 with MikroTik CHR image to be able to follow this course because in some LABS you require to run 7 MikroTik Routers in 1 LAB.\nFinally, if you want to master the topics of the MTCINE track, I advise you to enroll in my course and I will help you with your mission.",

The company was also growing (from 100 to 1,600 in three years) and planning expansion into other countries.\nSolution\nBabylon had migrated its user-facing applications to a Kubernetes platform in 2018, so the infrastructure team turned to Kubeflow, a toolkit for machine learning on Kubernetes. “We tried to create a Kubernetes core server, we deployed Kubeflow, and we orchestrated the whole experiment, which ended up being a really good success,” says AI Infrastructure Lead Jérémie Vallée. The team began building a self-service AI training platform on top of Kubernetes.\nImpact\nInstead of waiting hours or days to be able to compute, teams can get access instantaneously. Clinical validations used to take 10 hours; now they are done in under 20 minutes. The portability of the cloud native platform has also enabled Babylon to expand into other countries\n\n\nWhat is Kubernetes?\nThis page is an overview of Kubernetes.\nKubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.\nThe name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.\nGoing back in time\nTraditional deployment era: Early on, organizations ran applications on physical servers. There was no way to define resource boundaries for applications in a physical server, and this caused resource allocation issues. For example, if multiple applications run on a physical server, there can be instances where one application would take up most of the resources, and as a result, the other applications would underperform. A solution for this would be to run each application on a different physical server. But this did not scale as resources were underutilized, and it was expensive for organizations to maintain many physical servers.\nVirtualized deployment era: As a solution, virtualization was introduced. It allows you to run multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on a single physical server's CPU. Virtualization allows applications to be isolated between VMs and provides a level of security as the information of one application cannot be freely accessed by another application.\nVirtualization allows better utilization of resources in a physical server and allows better scalability because an application can be added or updated easily, reduces hardware costs, and much more. With virtualization you can present a set of physical resources as a cluster of disposable virtual machines.\nEach VM is a full machine running all the components, including its own operating system, on top of the virtualized hardware.\nContainer deployment era: Containers are similar to VMs, but they have relaxed isolation properties to share the Operating System (OS) among the applications. Therefore, containers are considered lightweight. Similar to a VM, a container has its own filesystem, CPU, memory, process space, and more. As they are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure, they are portable across clouds and OS distributions.\nContainers have become popular because they provide extra benefits, such as:\nAgile application creation and deployment: increased ease and efficiency of container image creation compared to VM image use.\nContinuous development, integration, and deployment: provides for reliable and frequent container image build and deployment with quick and easy rollbacks (due to image immutability).\nDev and Ops separation of concerns: create application container images at build/release time rather than deployment time, thereby decoupling applications from infrastructure.\nObservability not only surfaces OS-level information and metrics, but also application health and other signals.\nEnvironmental consistency across development, testing, and production: Runs the same on a laptop as it does in the cloud.\nCloud and OS distribution portability: Runs on Ubuntu, RHEL, CoreOS, on-premises, on major public clouds, and anywhere else.\nApplication-centric management: Raises the level of abstraction from running an OS on virtual hardware to running an application on an OS using logical resources.\nLoosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated micro-services: applications are broken into smaller, independent pieces and can be deployed and managed dynamically – not a monolithic stack running on one big single-purpose machine.\nResource isolation: predictable application performance.\nResource utilization: high efficiency and density.\nWhy you need Kubernetes and what it can do\nContainers are a good way to bundle and run your applications. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime. For example, if a container goes down, another container needs to start. Wouldn't it be easier if this behavior was handled by a system?\nThat's how Kubernetes comes to the rescue! Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more. For example, Kubernetes can easily manage a canary deployment for your system.\nKubernetes provides you with:\nService discovery and load balancing Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes is able to load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable.\nStorage orchestration Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, public cloud providers, and more.\nAutomated rollouts and rollbacks You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers using Kubernetes, and it can change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. For example, you can automate Kubernetes to create new containers for your deployment, remove existing containers and adopt all their resources to the new container.\nAutomatic bin packing You provide Kubernetes with a cluster of nodes that it can use to run containerized tasks. You tell Kubernetes how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs. Kubernetes can fit containers onto your nodes to make the best use of your resources.\nSelf-healing Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.\nSecret and configuration management Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. You can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images, and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.\n\n\n\n\n====================\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2021 Architect Professional | 1Z0-997-21 exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-days money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\nI hope that by now you're convinced!...\nHappy learning and best of luck for your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2021 Architect Professional | 1Z0-997-21 exam!\nWhat you’ll learn\nGuaranteed chance to pass the exam if you score 90%+ on each practice exam\nTwo full set [Practice Exams] OCI 2021 Architect 1Z0-997-21\nOne set to cover (NEW for 2020) Manage infrastructure using OCI CLI, APIs and SDKs\nOne set to cover (NEW for 2020) Conduct Monitoring, observability and alerting in OCI\nAce your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2021 Architect Professional | 1Z0-997-21 exam\nPractice with high quality practice exams alongside detailed explanation to learn concepts",

      "description": "Massive update December 2022\n\n\nThis Excel course is 2 courses in 1.\nIt contains all the study and training material for Candidates for the following certification exams\nMO-210 (Microsoft Excel 365) as well as for\nMO-200 (Excel 2019).\n\n\nMore than 1.000.000 students have trusted TEST4U for their successful exam preparation since 2003.\nAmong them have been MOS World Champions! This is how efficient this way of learning is!\n\n\nJust take a look at these stories below:\n*******************************\n“It's simple to use, has a lot of different tasks, good looking interface and was of great help while I was preparing for the MOS 2018 World Championship.”\nTarik D.\n\n\n“It was a great course. I loved how they had a mix of video lecture and hands-on practice. I really appreciate that they let me go back and review the course as much as I needed and they provided me with 5 hours of Test4U practice time which gave me a sense of what to expect on the exam. I took both the Associate and Expert exams on the same day and did awesome on both (976 for Associate and 972 for Expert)! Thank you Udemy for providing this training!”\nAngie K S.\n*******************************\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS COURSE?\n\n\n- Do you wish you too could pass the Microsoft Office Specialist Exam MO-210 or MO-200 fast and easy?\n- Do you hate spending too much time on the same, boring, basic staff?\n- Do you wish you had an experienced, responsive team to support and guide you every step of the way, with premium resources and 20+ years of expertise?\n\n\nWell, then you are in the right place, at the right time! This course will guide you all the way from the beginning to make you achieve the desired industry associate level of skills to pass the MO-210 or MO-200 exams.\nIn fact, we have designed this course in such a way, so that by the time you finish the practice tests and assignments, we believe that you will be 100% ready to take the MO-210 or MO-200 exams and achieve an excellent passing score!\n\n\n\n\nWHY TRUST US?\n\n\nThat’s because we have been teaching IT skills and have been preparing students to take such exams for more than 20 years. Our strategy delivers optimum passing results and this is why students keep returning to purchase more courses and pass more exams with flying colors!\n\n\nOur proven method of teaching will:\nKeep your interest rate high\nKeep you engaged at all times\nGuide you all the way\nMake you experiment and learn by doing\nAbove all, our method of teaching will make you ready to pass your MO-210 or MO-200 exams.\n\n\nThis is not just our saying! Read what our students have said about our way of teaching!\n*******************************\n“What I enjoyed when getting involved with this course is the fact that it is not just video-watching. You need to get your hands dirty and actually solve exercises, which is the only way to gain a new skill. Let’s be honest, learning how to use an Office suite is nothing like learning about history of arts, so practice needs to be on the table. For anyone who is interested in learning instead of wasting a few Euro, this is the course to choose.”\nOliver B.\n\n\n“This course serves a double cause: First it helps you get the certificate with minimum effort since the questions are almost the same. Practicing on the extra software makes you ready. Secondly, the course actually teaches you how to use excel in an engaging way. Although I enrolled because I wanted to pass the exam, I realized that the second cause was far more important.”\nMeghan\n*******************************\n\n\n\n\nHOW IS THIS COURSE DIFFERENT?\n\n\nWhen you start learning by the way that we have been teaching all these years, you’ll discover the great power that comes with the learning by doing approach.\nApart from lectures, assignments and video-solutions, we have included in this course Practice Exams that familiarize you with the exam interface and recreate real exam conditions. This is how a double purpose is served:\nYou will learn how to properly use Excel as well as\nPrepare adequately for your Certification exam.\nThere is even more.\nBy joining this course, you have access to 300+ Performance based exam simulation questions for Windows or Mac. These are Live-in-the-app questions which let you interact with the installed applications to get your hands dirty and make you learn by doing.\nSoon you will feel confident enough that you have done all the practice that is necessary, so as to be and feel prepared for your MO-210 or MO-200 exams.\n\n\nThe skills you will have gained by this course:\nAre practical and will follow you even if you use another Microsoft Office version\nAre hard-to-forget and can be put immediately to work\nWill get you to pass the exam, without even realizing you are being tested\nWill shape the way you use technology\n\n\nYOU ONLY NEED THIS COURSE IF...\nHere’s the bottom line.\nYou need this course because it’s a pity to waste all the exam fee money and have to take it all over again. Get there adequately prepared and pass it the first time.\nYou also need this course because the new Microsoft Office Specialist certification exam is rather hard and you need all the help you can have.\nBut most importantly, you need this course because it will not only help you pass the certification exams, but also give you the great advantage of actually gaining new skills and improving the way you have been using technology so far.\nEnroll today and benefit from Udemy’s no-questions-asked, 30-day, money-back guarantee.\nMore than 1.000.000 students have trusted the TEST4U way of learning since 2003. Be the next one.\n\n\n*******************************\n“The course gives good overview of what you need to know and how to apply it in and beyond the course. I purchased the whole series (MO100, 200, 300, 101, 201 and 500) and passed all of them including the MO-400. Teacher explains in a very easy and controlled way how to solve the questions and how to perform an action.”\nRob V.\n*******************************\n\n\n\n\nTHE COURSE AT A GLANCE\nIn this course you will find:\n52 lessons explaining certain interesting subjects of the MO-210 and MO-200 syllabi, accompanied by\n52 lesson files to help you reproduce everything that you watch\n2 lessons explaining the examination process and the structure of the multi-project question\n127 assignments properly categorized\n127 distinct exercise files for each of the above assignments\n127 solution videos for every assignment\n2 practice exams which contain 80+ exam-like tasks!!!\n300+ Performance based exam simulation questions\n\n\nTHE COURSE IN DETAIL\n52 lessons explaining certain interesting subjects of the MO-210 and MO-200 syllabi, accompanied by 52 lesson files to help you reproduce everything that you watch\nStarting from scratch, we explain everything that is necessary for you to gain the skills needed and go ace the MOS exam. To help you practice on what you see, we give you access to the same files that we have used during our video-making, so that you can practice at your own pace.\n\n\n2 lessons explaining the examination process and the structure of the multi-project question\nPreparing for exam participation is not just knowing the syllabus.

We will then configure individual VLANs for each department, along with creating a new native VLAN for network maintenance. Then we will configure inter-VLAN routing by learning how to configure sub-interfaces (a type of virtual port) so we can use the dot1q protocol to create a trunk port.\nAs we learn about VLAN architectures, we will also learn what a Native VLAN actually is, and how it differs from the Default VLAN which is already configured on all layer-2 switches.\nBonus lesson! We learn about Dynamic Host Control Protocol by building a DHCP server on the command line! After configuring and testing our VLANs, we will follow up by configuring a DHCP server to further test the integrity of our VLAN configurations by supplying our various devices with IP addresses leased from the DHCP server over the various VLANs. If we have done our work correctly, we should be able to supply IP addresses via inter-VLAN routing through our router's sub-interfaces over the trunk port we configured.",

It focuses beyond the Scrum guide and into topics that are referenced in the Scrum guide but not elaborated on. User stories, value, prioritization, release management and estimation are each discussed\nIt not only dives into the theory but also gives specific focus to some of the more widely used techniques / practices in Scrum today, giving the student a more practical grounding, moving away from the question of “what is Scum?” onto the question of “how do we use Scrum?”\nWe also designed two practices tests which not only help you in your revision but the format and difficulty give you a preview into the types of questions that you will need to answer in your Scrum Master certification\nAnd beyond this, we have added a section focusing on the background to Scrum. Focusing on agile project management with topics like Agile, Lean and Waterfall, to help you with context on Scrum and how it evolved.\nAnd finally, we are continually adding more clips and webinars covering practical topics like “what to do on Day one of a new Scrum team?” and many more.

      "description": "* Updated for the 2024 CISSP curriculum and 2023 exam registration process *\nWelcome, I am Thor Pedersen, and I am here to help you pass your CISSP certification.\nWith over 700,000 enrollments from 201 countries, my CISSP, CISM, and Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) courses are both the “Best Selling” and “Highest Rated” here on Udemy.\nIn this course I will cover how to approach practice tests, how to deconstruct practice questions, time management, how to make your own CISSP study plan, and finally you get 125 HARD CISSP questions in a full CISSP practice test.\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam questions does.\n\n\nGetting your CISSP certification now is a very smart career move.\n1. The CISSP certification is the gold standard for IT Security certifications.\n2. There are more than 82,000 job openings for CISSPs in the US.\n3. The average CISSP salary in the US is over USD147,000 a year.\n\n\nWhat our other students are saying about my CISSP courses:\nI passed the CISSP with the ISC Book and Thor's lectures and practice questions. Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of the test you will get an explanation for each question and explaining to why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does.\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions\nAsset Security – 13 questions\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions\n\nI recommend students to do 1,500-3,000 easy/mid CISSP practice questions and 1,000-1,500 HARD CISSP practice questions before the exam.\nI only know of 3 hard CISSP practice sets: my own hard questions, Boson questions, and SNT. Wentz Wu also has hard questions on his CISSP blog, but not as full practice tests.\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it. This is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right and answering from an IT Security manager's point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.\nOn hard questions, you will score lower. It is normal to score 80%+ on easy/mid questions and 50-60% on hard questions.\nThe point of all questions is to find the gaps in your knowledge, learn how to deconstruct questions, and argue WHY the answer you chose is the RIGHT answer in this scenario, making you ready for exam day.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nYou'll Also Get:\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days no questions asked, money back guarantee.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

My advanced Java course contains an over 31 hours of content and is worth checking out before investing in this this course (as it is, in my opinion, better value for money).\n\nSample reviews:\n\"Excellent course on Java Lambdas and Streams. Doctor Sean Kennedy clearly explained all concepts and techniques using great amount of examples. The assignments reflected what we learned in the course. Thank you Doctor Sean Kennedy!\" [Jing H]\n\"This course provides hands-on knowledge on how to work with functional programming in java.

Very talented lecturer.\" [Luka K]\n\"Sean described lambdas and streams ,covered all the topics in detailed level.\" [Kalpana M]\n\"Very good course, learnt many new things.

A.\n\"Fantastic course, very engaging and delivered in an easy to understand manner.\" - Gary W.\n\"Excellent Course, the concepts are explained in a clear & concise manner making it easy to understand.\" - Bv\n\"Content explained clearly and punctually. Recommended\" - Daniel M.\n\n\nThis course is a systematic approach to explaining in both notes format and code examples, lambda expressions and streams in Java. All the code samples are included (on my GitHub repo).\nTopics include:\nLambdas:\nFunctional Interfaces\nLambdas and their relationship to Functional Interfaces\nLambdas in code using a custom Functional Interface\nLambdas in code using the pre-defined API Functional Interfaces:\nPredicate/BiPredicate\nSupplier\nConsumer/BiConsumer\nFunction/BiFunction\nUnaryOperator and BinaryOperator\nfinal and \"effectively final\"\nMethod References:\nbound\nunbound\nstatic\nconstructor\ncontext and it's effect in understanding method references\nAssignment to reinforce the content\nStreams:\nPipelines\nLaziness\nCreating streams\nTerminal operations:\nreduce()\ncollect()\nCollectors.toMap()\nCollectors.groupingBy()\nCollectors.partitioningBy()\nIntermediate operations:\nfilter(), distinct(), limit()\nmap(), flatMap(), sorted()\nPrimitive streams:\nCreating\nAPI\nFunctional Interfaces\nMapping between primitive streams\nMapping between primitive streams and Object streams and vice versa\nOptionals\nParallel streams\nAssignment to reinforce the content\nThis course is geared towards Java Certification i.e. the Predicate lambda sections would suit Java 8 OCA (1Z0-808). The remaining lambda sections and the streams sections would suit any version of Java OCP. This course explains the concepts through small, simple, targeted code examples.\nNote that, my other 2 courses, namely \"Java 8 OCA (1Z0-808) Certification - Master the Fundamentals\" and \"Java 21, Java 17, Java 11, Java 8 (advanced) and Spring Boot\" have both been selected for the Udemy Business portfolio (only the top 3% of courses qualify).\n\nFor those who don't know me, I am a lecturer since 2002 and have taught the Java OCA and OCP syllabii since 2013 on behalf of a highly regarded software company. On completion of the courses with me, graduates then face the company's own internal Java Certification exam (similar in style to Oracle's). I have no visibility into the questions they will face. It is a 3 hour long intensive exam. The company are delighted with the pass rate (100% since year 1). I love teaching and this course has all my experience in explaining lambdas and streams in Java.",

      "description": "So now that you have studied hard, read so many online articles took so many prep tests, even took a UDEMY Course to pass the Scrum Master Certification, heck even passed it. Some had challenging exams, while some are easy peasy lemon squeezy :)\nSo now what? Is the real-world different then what you have been taught? The question you keep asking yourself: \"Do I just simply apply what I learned theoretically in the real world? Is it that easy?\"\nAsk any Scrum Master(Like me) and ask how different it is at a job than what they teach you in the class? My guess is most of Scrum Master's will say.. \"Hmm... Not quite the same and definitely not that easy\".\nWith the Training you definitely get the basics, you understand the concept, you know keywords, key terminology, but we all know in the real world, no matter what job you are in it's always different.\nWe all adapt, we start to learn from our experience, and we learn every day something new and you'd wish \"Man... I wish someone would have shared with me some real-world experience\".\nI am trying to be that someone, who would like to share some real-world experience and how I faced it and you will most likely face it as well. Because I was not able to find that someone or guru or any discussion forum to give you an inside on what does a Scrum Master does in each Scrum Ceremonies and what kind of reality he/she faces as a Scrum Master or maybe I didn't' simply search well in Google.\nImportantly, with all due respect, I am not going to try and make this a 3-4 hour long course. It will simply get boring and exhausting.\nI will keep it short, precise, and hopefully to the point. Based on the student's genuine feedback, will improvise this course.\nWhat you’ll learn\nIn this course, you will be learning What does a Scrum Master Really does in the Scrum Ceremonies. I am sharing the Real-world Experience I faced and how I tackled it successfully & some unsuccessfully.\nWill try to paint a real picture so it helps the To-Be Scrum Master a sense of confidence and also helping some new and experienced Scrum Master try some of the ways I have tackled being a good servant leader.\nWhat are some of the \"To-DOs\" and \"Not To-DOs\" as a Scrum Master in the Scrum Ceremonies?\nWhat to do before each Scrum Ceremonies, During each Scrum Ceremonies, and After Scrum Ceremonies. Ceremonies I will cover are:\nDaily Stand-Up\nIteration Planning\nBacklog Refinement/Grooming\nRetrospectives\nOther Important Meetings, apart from Scrum Ceremonies which you will need to participate in and maybe even facilitate. Examples: DEMO Meeting, Scrum of Scrum, Team's Code Review Sessions, etc\nWhat you will Get? Apart from the real experience knowledge, below is what should help you get started the first day or be a better Scrum Master:\nCapacity Template(Hourly tracking and Story Point Tracking Template) - Excel Format\nRetrospective Agenda - Word Format\nEach Scrum Ceremonies Task Checklist- Word Format\nEach Scrum Ceremonies Meeting Agenda Points - Word Format\nAre there any course requirements or prerequisites?\nThere is no formal prerequisite for this course.\nA good understanding of the Agile process\nGood understanding of Scrum Process\nSome SAFe Process Familiarity\nEmpathy - I personally believe to be a successful Scrum Master, Empathy is a key.\nWho this course is for:\nProspective Scrum Master\nCurrent Scrum Master\nAny team members (Dev, QA, Product Owner) who wants to be a Scrum Master\nAnyone interested in knowing what does a Scrum Master really does in each Scrum Ceremonies and how he/she faces some situation with the team.\nAnd if you think you have not learned anything new and/or are not satisfied with the course, I offer 30 Day Money-Back Guarantee.",

This course is MCSA and job focused it provides the TOOL you need to get serious about configuring Microsoft Servers & Clients on a virtual network when a real network is not available to you.\n\n*As a new course - Some Issues and Details of recent Updates - Addressed below.*\n\n**Just Added* Before we can do Microsoft Server & Microsoft Active directory domain services configurations. We need both a virtual network and to understand IP Addressing. I added an IP addressing Bonus section to this course. This is the actual material and Project that I created and use in one of my courses. Andrew\n\n1. Although approved by Udemy any audio problems are being reviewed and corrected by re-recording some videos as needed to improve sound quality.\n2. Regarding specs for the virtual or host machines. If you have a recent dual core or greater computer from the last few years you can run virtualization. The question is how many virtual machines you can run at the same time 4, 8, 12? This can be optimized but at some point you will run out of resources. You need a 64 bit machine to run windows server 2102 and later. When you download the ISO Image from Microsoft click on description and that will give you the requirements for the virtual machine. Keep in mind these aren't written in stone. I often run virtual machines with less than what is listed as min. I always start with 1 GB ram and 25 GB dynamically allocatable hard drive for a virtual machine. Then adjust RAM as needed the HD is ok. I demonstrate how to do this during the course. If you have any doubts you can google your processors to see if it can be used for virtualization. Of course almost all modern machines can.\n3. Regarding WSUS and the SCCM. For logical reasons this is an internal virtual network it is isolated from the host machine. This means the virtual machines on this network cannot reach the outside world. The only purpose of the shared folder created in this course is to pass files, from the host machine to the virtual machines and vise versa. Clearly the shared folder is not intended to \"drive\" updates to the clients. Only to allow the virtual machines access to the host machine via shared folder. For example if you want to download FTP and Python to a virtual machine, download it from the internet to the shared folder on the host machine this will put FTP and Python in the shared folders on the virtual machines.\n4. Be sure what you are getting. This is a complete course to build a virtual internal network, no information is lacking for this purpose however this is not a Microsoft configuration course, this is a course to Build an adaptable virtual network in virtual box to do the Microsoft configurations on, it is not a complete course on virtual box. There are many ways to build a virtual network in VIrtual Box and I have seen them all submitted by my students this is the best and easiest way to get started. I designed this so my students can do their Microsoft course work on this virtual network at home. It has been tested successful many times for over a year. However you will need to go to Youtube, Microsoft webpage or another Udemy course for specific Microsoft server configuration details. This course shows you step by step in detail how to build a adaptable virtual network in Virtual Box that supports multiple servers and clients to do the Microsoft configurations on.\n5. The Value of this course is different to different people. Setting up a virtual network and configuring multiple servers and clients on a network is great for the MCSA exams. Although its certainly possible you can become a \"Paper Cert\" with little actual configuration experience. However its impossible to land a decent job with little actual experience. This course is for those that plan to earn a MCSA and then look for a job or for those already MCSA certified but lack the experience to pass the interviews. You can build this virtual network on your computer. Practice DNS, DHCP, AD/DS configs over and over on a network using multiple virtual machines all working together and ACE an interview. This is the next best thing to real job experience and certainly valuable. If you are primarily a Cisco Route and Switch Engineer and you just want to know a little overview about the Microsoft world this is not a valuable course for you. This course is job focused it provides the tool you need to get serious about configuring Microsoft Servers & Clients on a virtual network when a real network is not available to you. It takes much of the hardwork out of figuring out virtualization and lets you focus your time doing the Microsoft Configurations. That's very valuable to those looking for Certification and Employment as an MCSA.\n\nMaintenance of this course is ongoing coming soon as a bonus I plan to add:\nAD/DS server, DNS server, DHCP server configuration to the virtual network\nand a Introduction to Powershell section.\nDisclaimer:\nNote: Like everything in Networking hands on is the key. It is intended that you build this virtual network hence the title. I will help you as needed in the shell. Everything is demonstrated step by step. So work along and have some fun.\n\nI am a University instructor, I teach Microsoft MCSA courses as well as other Tech courses. I have spent 100s of hours developing and documenting this system to create a virtual lab in virtual box so my students can practice MCSA configurations for certifications. From my experience, this is the Best, Easiest way to build an adaptable Virtual Network in Virtual box.\nWhat do I mean by an adaptable network? Your will learn to add and remove servers and clients from the virtual network very easily such that you can practice the required Microsoft configurations for both certifications and employment.\nIn just under 3 hours, you will gain all the knowledge and ability required to build a great lab in virtual box to practice for the Microsoft MCSA and MCSE exams.\nAny student that wants to practice Microsoft Server and Client configurations on the free virtual box software should take this course because this takes the hard work out of using virtual box and configuring the network and allows you to focus on the Microsoft configurations to pass the exams, land a great job or improve your skills at work.\nI provide support in the discussion area to get your network working and adaptable. All I ask is that you follow my proven simple and effective method, watch all the videos and build the network according to the plans. After you become an expert, you may choose to add to or modify this method to suit your needs.\n*Note on host machine\nSome old processors do not officially support virtualization. Some examples of processors that do not support virtualization are: older Pentium 4s, Celerons, and AMD Athlons. Thus, you will not be able to activate processor virtualization effectively for a computer that does not have a processor with virtualization capabilities.\nFor the most part, any newer processor with more than one core should be capable of running virtualization software. Some examples of processors that should support virtualization are: Core 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad, Intel Core i3, i5, i7, AMD Athlon X2, AMD Athlon X4, and AMD Phenom X4.",

These;\nCompTIA A+ 220-1001 (Core 1)\nCompTIA A+ 220-1002 (Core 2)\n\n\nCompTIA A+ 220-1001 (Core 1).\nCompTIA published the CompTIA A+ exam on January 15, 2019.\nComptTIA updates its exams usually every 3 years.\n\n\nBasically, in the CompTIA A+ 220-1001 (Core 1) exam;\nCompTIA A+ 220-1001 covers mobile devices, network technology, hardware, virtualization, and cloud computing and network troubleshooting.\n1.

Getting a CompTIA A+ certificate can lead to a successful IT career. CompTIA created this certificate for people seeking employment as a help desk, support, service center, or networking technician. The CompTIA A+ certification exam covers PC and laptop hardware, software installation, the configuration of computer and mobile operating systems, basic networking, troubleshooting, and security skills. Many enterprises require a CompTIA A+ certificate for their entry-level information technology jobs. Passing the CompTIA A+ certification exam can also serve as a springboard toward other technology certificates and career advancements.\nDo I need CompTIA A+ for Network+?\nGetting the CompTIA A+ certification is not a requirement to get a Network+ certification. Each certification covers a separate area of computer technology. The A+ certification will test your knowledge of PC hardware, mobile device hardware, operating systems, security, cloud computing, and troubleshooting hardware and network connectivity. It consists of two tests. You can acquire the Network+ plus certification by passing one test. This test validates a student's knowledge of wired and wireless networks and their understanding of topics like unified communications and virtualization. While having both the CompTIA A+ certification and the Network+ certification will give an IT technician more opportunities when looking for a job, neither certification is a prerequisite for the other.\nWhy Should I Get CompTIA A+ Certified?\nCompTIA A+ will either help you get your start in IT or help you get promoted in your current job. It is the industry standard for establishing a career in IT and is the preferred qualifying credential for technical support and IT operational roles.\nIT pros with CompTIA A+ have jobs like IT support specialist, IT field service technician, desktop support analyst, and help desk tier 2 support. And, companies like Intel, Dell, Ricoh, Nissan, Blue Cross, and Blue Shield, and HP all look for CompTIA A+ certification when hiring.\nHow hard is the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe difficulty of the test will depend in large part on your interest and experience in the subject. If you are taking the CompTIA A+ exam because you have already been building and fixing computers for a while and have a working knowledge of operating systems, especially Windows, you should have no problem passing the test. The exam consists of two tests. Each has 90 questions, which consist of multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. For each test, you get an hour and a half.\nHow many questions are on the CompTIA A+ exam and what is a passing score?\nThe CompTIA A+ exam consists of two tests of 90 questions each. The problems include multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. The first exam covers hardware, networking technology, mobile devices, cloud computing, virtualization, and networking troubleshooting. The second exam tests the knowledge of software troubleshooting, installing operating systems, configuring operating systems, and security. The passing score for the first exam, 220-1001, is 675 out of a scale of 100-900. For the second exam, 220-1002, a passing score is 700 out of a scale of 100-900. This means that to pass the first test, you need to answer at least 69 out of 90 questions correctly. Whereas for the second test, you need to have 70 correct out of 90.\nIs CompTIA A+ worth it?\nMany entry-level IT jobs require A+ certification. It proves to the business you are applying to that you have basic IT knowledge. They want to know that you can do the work and don't need basic training. If you have no experience in the industry, having a CompTIA A+ certificate can get you an entry-level job. After that, you can specialize, add other certifications, and advance in your career. The CompTIA A+ certificate has been the first step in a successful career for many IT professionals.\nWhat's next after the CompTIA A+?\nFor many IT professionals, the CompTIA A+ is the first of many certifications earned over the course of their careers. Since the A+ certification is fairly general, you may choose to move into an IT specialization, like networking, cybersecurity, or cloud computing. CompTIA offers more advanced certifications in these fields, as do many other reputable organizations. Take a look at this IT certification roadmap to inspire your next career goal.\nWhat are the objectives of the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe test objectives are to ensure that an aspiring IT professional has the basic knowledge for an entry-level information technology job. CompTIA A+ applicants should be able to assemble components based on customer requirements. The exam tests applicants on their ability to install, configure and maintain PCs, mobile devices, and software. They should know the basics of networking and security forensics. CompTIA A+ applicants should have basic troubleshooting skills to diagnose, resolve, and document common hardware and software issues. They should know how to provide essential customer support. They should also understand the basics of scripting, virtualization, desktop imaging, and deployment.\nWhat jobs can I get with CompTIA A+?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification is the industry standard for a career in IT and is the preferred credential for technical support and IT operational roles. One job a person with an A+ certificate may choose is IT support specialist. An IT support specialist is responsible for installing and configuring computer hardware and software, monitoring and maintaining computer networks, and providing technical support across a company. Another role someone with A+ certification may choose is help desk technician. A help desk technician diagnoses and supports hardware and software issues across a company. Other job titles that require A+ certification include service desk analyst, technical support specialist, field service technician, network engineer, data support technician, desktop support administrator, help desk technician, and system support specialist.\nWhich should you choose CompTIA A+ or CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)?\nCompTIA offers two separate entry-level certifications, the CompTIA A+, and the CompTIA IT Fundamentals, or ITF+. They’re slightly different. The CompTIA A+ is billed as a certification that will test you on the knowledge needed to land an entry-level IT job. The ITF+, on the other hand, is designed for students and professionals who want to see if IT is a right career fit for them. The ITF+ exam is also used by non-IT professionals who want a broad introduction to the field. If you’re still on the fence about whether you’d like a job in IT, getting the ITF+ can be a good way to test the waters. If you know you want to commit to IT work and are ready to gain job-ready skills, the A+ certification is probably a better path.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: quality of teaching.\nLondon-based OAK Academy is an online education company.

Get feedback and suggestions: By taking a mock exam you can get feedback and suggestions on how to improve your understanding and knowledge of scrum concepts.\n\n\n\n\nTesting has been found to be a powerful learning tool!\nLearn better in multiple ways : Instead of just reading and watching videos, which involves visual and auditory learning, sharpen your gained knowledge with mock exams.\nAccording to an experimental psychology study by David R Shanks and Rosalind Potts (University College London) : “The benefit of doing mistakes during learning showed that when people initially make an incorrect guess and then are given the correct answer, they are more likely to remember the correct information than if they didn't guess wrong in a first place.”\n\nLet's work together !\nLudovic\n\n\nLegal Disclaimer\n\nThese UNOFFICIAL practice tests are not endorsed by, nor in partnership, nor affiliated with Scrum . org.\n\nThe statements made and opinions expressed herein belong exclusively to the creator of this course and are not shared by or represent the viewpoint of Scrum . org.

At home we use WLAN, at work, in the restaurant, in the shop, in a mall, in the aiport etc.\nEven though that this technology is everywhere, it has some requirement for the designer to design a good WLAN network. Meaning that not anyone can just deploy a good WLAN network without having issues in the service. For this reason, I have decided to create this particual course which is a course that helps Sales Managers and Project Managers to design a good Wireless LAN network to their customers.\nBy end of this course, you will have a full understanding of all topics needed to be able to design a professional WLAN network to your customers.

These templates give you a head start in building repeatable, compliant processes tailored to your organization. You’ll also experience AI-driven role plays that simulate conversations with stakeholders, helping you practice how to explain PCI DSS controls, justify risk-based decisions, and respond to real-world compliance challenges. Together, these tools ensure you not only understand the standard but can also apply it effectively in practice.\nFinally, the course concludes with a comprehensive test to reinforce your learning, measure progress, and prepare you for real assessment scenarios. Upon completion, you’ll earn a certificate of accomplishment that can be shared with your employer or on LinkedIn to showcase your expertise to peers, other employers, and potential clients.

      "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most life changing technologies of our time, revolutionizing industries and reshaping the way we live and work. Rooted in the concept of developing machines with the ability to mimic human intelligence, AI has unlocked tremendous potential across various sectors, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment.\nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by covering fundamental problem-solving strategies, agent-based analysis, constraint satisfaction problems, search algorithms, and knowledge representation.\nBasic Problem Solving Strategies: The course starts by introducing students to various problem-solving approaches commonly used in AI. These strategies include techniques like divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and backtracking. To help students grasp these concepts, toy problems (simple, illustrative examples) are used as initial learning tools.\nAgent-Based Analysis: In AI, an agent is an entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve certain goals. The course delves into the concept of agents and their characteristics, such as rationality and autonomy. Students learn how agents can interact with the environment and adapt their behaviour based on feedback and observations.\nConstraint Satisfaction Problems: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a class of problems where the goal is to find a solution that satisfies a set of constraints. The course explores how to model real-world problems as CSPs and how to use various algorithms, like backtracking and constraint propagation, to efficiently find solutions.\nSearch Space and Searching Algorithms: One of the fundamental aspects of AI is searching through a vast space of possible solutions to find the best one. The course explains the concept of a search space, which represents all possible states of a problem and how to traverse it systematically. Students learn about uninformed search algorithms like breadth-first search and depth-first search, as well as informed search algorithms like A* search and heuristic-based techniques.\nKnowledge Representation: Representing knowledge is crucial for AI systems to reason and make decisions. The course delves into two main types of knowledge representation: propositional logic and predicate logic.\nPropositional Logic: This part of the course teaches students how to represent knowledge using propositions, which are simple statements that can be either true or false. They learn about logical connectives (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) and how to build complex expressions to represent relationships and rules.\nPredicate Logic: Predicate logic extends propositional logic by introducing variables and quantifiers. Students learn how to express relationships and properties involving multiple entities and make use of quantifiers like \"for all\" and \"there exists\" to reason about sets of objects.\nInference and Reasoning: Once knowledge is represented, students are introduced to the process of inference, which involves deriving new information from existing knowledge using logical rules and deduction techniques. They learn how to apply inference mechanisms to reach conclusions based on the given knowledge base.\n\n\nOverall, this course provides a solid foundation in problem-solving, search algorithms, and knowledge representation essential for understanding various AI techniques and applications. By the end of the course, students should be able to apply these concepts to model and solve real-world problems using AI techniques.",

However, simply watching the videos is not enough. You need to experiment with the code you see in the videos. The more you experiment with it the better you become.\nDepending on the two factors I mentioned above, students spend from one week to three months to complete the course, most spending one month.\nI don't know anything about programming. Will I still be able to learn Python?\nThis course assumes you have no previous knowledge of programming. Whenever a programming term is mentioned (e.g. a variable) the meaning of the term is explained thoroughly so you not only understand how to use that particular term in Python, you also understand what that term means in programming.\nWill I get support if I get stuck?\nYes.

This course features four practice exams (with 45, 45, 30, and 45 questions respectively) meticulously designed to mirror the actual certification content and ensure your success. As a Generative AI Leader, you'll possess business-level knowledge of Google Cloud's gen AI products and services, enabling you to influence innovative and responsible AI adoption within your organization.\nOur practice exams are precisely weighted to reflect the official Google Cloud Generative AI Leader exam guide, covering all critical sections:\nFundamentals of Gen AI (~30% of the exam): Explore core gen AI concepts (like large language models, prompt engineering, and diffusion models), the machine learning lifecycle, how to choose appropriate foundation models for business use cases, and the business implications of various data types in gen AI.\nGoogle Cloud's Gen AI Offerings (~35% of the exam): Understand Google's AI-first approach and enterprise-ready AI platform. Familiarize yourself with prebuilt offerings like the Gemini app and Gemini for Google Workspace, and developer tools such as Vertex AI Platform, including Model Garden and Vertex AI Search.\nTechniques to Improve Gen AI Model Output (~20% of the exam): Learn to address common foundation model limitations like hallucinations and the knowledge cutoff. Master prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) and understand grounding techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nBusiness Strategies for a Successful Gen AI Solution (~15% of the exam): Grasp the steps to integrate gen AI into an organization, the importance of Google's Secure AI Framework (SAIF), and crucial responsible AI principles including privacy, fairness, and accountability.\nPay special attention to questions marked with an asterisk (*) in exams #1, #2, and #3, as these are styled to reflect questions encountered in the real certification exam. Your expertise as a Generative AI Leader lies in strategic leadership and influence, not deep technical implementation, though a strong conceptual understanding is vital. We recommend aiming for an 80% benchmark on these practice exams. By combining this targeted practice with study of Google's official learning path, you'll be thoroughly prepared to pass your certification and confidently lead impactful gen AI initiatives.",

      "description": "What is unique about this course?\n\n\nYou will not only learn Terraform from scratch, or Terraform with GCP but also you will have a good opportunity to have free one more course in your bucket!\n\n\nReasons why you should start learning GCP\n\n\nAs we know that Terraform is a tool for developing, changing and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. What is more, Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Also, Terraform is the first multi-cloud immutable infrastructure tool that was introduced to the world by HashiCorp and written in Go.\nDevOps is about culture and practices that aim at uniting development processes.\nAnother reason why you should learn Terraform is that, Terraform is a tool and has become more popular because it has a simple syntax that allows easy modularity and works against multi-cloud. One Important reason people consider Terraform is to manage their infrastructure as code.\nIn fact, Infrastructure as code is also a key and foundation for DevOps practices such as version control, code review, continuous integration, and continuous deployment. If you try to search “infrastructure-as-code” on Google, you will come up with a list of tools, and anybody will get confused to see so many options. But Terraform is one tool to consider because of its excellent features and exceptional reasons (that we have listed further in this article) when compared to other similar tools.\n\n\nStart your Journey!\n\n\nLearning Terraform with GCP is amazing journey especially if you are learning and working with Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I created most practical comprehensive course - Terraform For Beginners using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\nThis course has 10+ Hours of insanely great video content with lots-of hands-on Lab (Most Practical Course). I am all exited to help you on your journey towards Terraform using Google Cloud Platform.\n\n\nCannot wait you to see in my first lecture!\n\n\nSincerely,\nOtabek",

We hope that you feel this exam challenges you, teaches you, and prepares you to pass the MS-900. If this is your first course on MS-900, take a moment to relax. This could be the first step to a new high-paying job and an AMAZING career.\nWhat Is The MS-900 Focused On?\nThe MS-900 or as it’s also known, the Microsoft 365 Fundamentals, like all tests, there is a bit of freedom on Microsoft's part to exam an array of subjects. That means knowing the majority of MS-900 content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they’ve observed the average person and what is required. You can always push past that to succeed with the MS-900 but it may take some extra work.\nRome Wasn’t Built In A Day\nRemember that incredible things take time. And just like ancient monuments took years of effort, certification is not easy. It is not always quick either. If you have questions, don’t forget to leave a comment and reach out.\nRemember That Certification Is Quite Rewarding\nIt can be hard to keep your focus on studying but remember that the best jobs in the world are only a few tests away. Whether you enter Cyber Security or do entry level tech work, certification is a clear, learnable, and rewarding path to careers that pay a LOT of money. They offer better work-life balance and you’ll get in with some of the major leaders in the business world. So don’t give up, it is worth it, and all this work will pay off!\nThis exam is designed for candidates looking to demonstrate foundational knowledge on the considerations and benefits of adopting cloud services in general and the Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud model. This exam also covers knowledge of available options and benefits gained by implementing Microsoft 365 cloud service offerings.\nThis exam can be taken as a precursor to cloud computing and technologies exams, such as Office 365, Microsoft Intune, Azure Information Protection (AIP), and Windows 10.\nHere is the exam outline:\nUnderstand cloud concepts (15-20%)\nUnderstand core Microsoft 365 services and concepts (30-35%)\nUnderstand security, compliance, privacy, and trust in Microsoft 365 (25-30%)\nUnderstand Microsoft 365 pricing and support (25-30%)",

      "description": "The Complete LPI Security Essentials Exam Study Guide is the perfect course for individuals who are looking to protect their digital lives. With our increasing dependence on technology, we desperately need to be aware of all the many potential security threats that can harm our digital identities, computing systems, networks, and services. This course will guide you through your preparations for taking the LPI Security Essentials certification exam. But it will also provide a comprehensive understanding of the main security threats that individuals face and teach the best practices to prevent and mitigate them.\nBy the end of the course, you'll have the knowledge and confidence to protect yourself and your digital assets from potential security breaches. This certification will be your guide to digital self-defense, and this course will get you there.\nThe course includes:\nMore than two hours of videos\nMore than 75 review questions\nFocused, fast, and complete coverage of the exam objectives\nWhat students are saying about this course:\n\"I passed the LPI Security Essentials certification exam today with a score of 710 out of 800! Big thanks to David Clinton for his Udemy course! It is a great refresher for cybersecurity professionals!\"\n\"A great introduction to not just Linux security, but general security concepts that every IT worker should know. Just passed the exam with a score of 710. An excellent resource to help focus my attention to the important weak areas I needed to revise before passing the exam. Many thanks!\"\n\"Excellent course. Just passed the exam with a score of 670 out of 800. If you want to pass the certificate, I recommend this course.\"\n\"Great course. Covered a little more than I was expecting.\"\nBy the way, it's true that \"LPI\" stands for \"Linux Professional Institute\", but this certification is actually platform-neutral and is not specific to Linux. Everything you learn here will apply just as much to Windows, macOS, Android, and IPhones as to Linux. While the LPI's historical origins have been Linux-based, they're now leveraging their considerable experience with highly successful certification programs in new areas.\nIn case you're wondering, the LPI Security Essentials certification isn't in the exact same market as the Comptia Security+ cert. That one is focused on IT professionals looking to advance their careers in the security sector. The LPI Security Essentials is primarily aimed at individual users who want to secure their own devices and online interactions. But that doesn't mean there isn't some overlap between the two certs. In fact, learning through the LPI Security Essentials objectives will be an excellent first step towards taking on the Comptia Security+ challenge. And it's also a great way to see if you've got the interest and determination to push yourself that far.\nSo protect yourself AND take the first formal steps towards a new career. Why not?",

We have prepared this course by collaborating with our students who have attempted the real PMP Exam.\nThe course tests your preparation in all the 10 knowledge areas across the 5 Process groups of Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling and Closing.\nThese exams are timed to train you to solve the exam on the specified time and to test your speed in clearing exam questions.\nThe pass score for each test is 80%, to obtain the maximum benefit from the tests, we advise you to retake them until you get 80% or above, so as to be able to pinpoint the gaps in your knowledge and increase your probability to pass the real exam.\nThe approach that you should follow to reinforce your learning & improve on your OFIs (opportunity for improvement):\n1. Prepare a document that captures all the questions in which you were unable to get a correct answer. Do capture the knowledge area, process group & the topic.\n2. Keep making a list of your OFIs for all the practice tests - read through the explanations for each question properly.\n3. At the end have a glance at this document to find the topics / areas in which you really need to work hard. We have found this practice of taking note of the OFIs to have helped each individual.\n\n\nHow is our Practice Test different from the rest?\nJust 3 reasons:\n1.) We know the psychological hindrance in attempting 200 questions in 4 hour duration in the 1st go. So we designed this practice test in the staircase model of 50-50-100-100-200 so that our students gradually overcome this barrier.\n2.) Each of the explanations in the question is not just an answer to that specific question but rather a conceptual detailing to help our students understand the topic in general.\n3.) The practice tests have been reviewed and confirmed by several of our students who have attempted & cleared the real PMP Exam - so we bet & assure that this is the format & the type you are going to encounter in the real PMP exam as well.\n\n\nMost important topics / tips to cover for the exam include:\na.) Change Management Process\nb.) The knowledge about the 33 Project Documents\nc.) Unique tools & techniques used in each of the 49 Processes\nd.) Scenario based questions specifically asking \"What should the Project Manager do next?\"\ne.) Difference between Conduct Procurement & Close Project Process - a common question in the exam\nf.) Purpose & work expected from the Project Manager in Stakeholder Management vs Communication Management.\ng.) Difference between various Procurement Documents\nh.) What are the documents / outputs that make up the various baselines - Scope, Schedule & Cost?\n...and much more that the practice exam is based upon.\nPlus our team would help you on your queries.

I had been preparing for more than a year for this exam and postponed it a few times because I felt that I was not ready. In the end, it was worth it.\nMy section level scores are below.\nData Design: 91%\nDiscovery: 100%\nAutomation: 100%\nJourney Builder: 100%\nConceptual Design: 100%\nContact Builder: 100%\nAccount Configuration: 57%\nReporting: 100%\nEmail Build: 100%\nMarketing Cloud Connect: 100%\nIf you want this under your belt, you need some solid experience with Salesforce Marketing Cloud. You have to understand various concepts within marketing cloud in depth and have to learn about many builders and studios within Marketing Cloud. My recent project experiences helped me a lot with this exam.\n\n\nYOU WILL FIND MANY TESTS AVAILABLE IN MARKET BUT AFTER THROGH RESEARCH I CAN SAY THIS IS THE  TEST WHICH WILL PROVIDE YOU CLEAR AND BEST EXPLANATION\n\n\nThe Salesforce Marketing Cloud Consultant program is designed for consultants who have hands-on experience implementing Marketing Cloud Email Studio, Journey Builder, Automation Studio, Content Builder, Contact Builder, and Marketing Cloud Connect in a customer-facing role. In this course, I will fully prepare you for what it is like to take the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Consultant exam. These questions have been written and answered by multiple Salesforce Marketing Cloud professionals. The correct response, as well as an explanation of the answer is provided, in order to ensure your absolute understanding of the content, rather than merely rote learning the answers to the questions.\n\n\nIn order to culminate this exam, I have followed the official Exam Guide from Salesforce to ensure the 10 Knowledge areas and corresponding weightings are assessed so that you can approach the Marketing Cloud Certification Exam with confidence that all areas have been covered. By purchasing this course, you immensely improve your odds of passing with the first attempt in order to avoid costly re-schedule fees, as well as being confident that you will understand rather than memorise the content. After completing the exam, you will receive your total final score and the correct answers and explanations so you can pinpoint the areas in which you need to improve and study further.\n\n\nThere are three practice exams included-\nStudy first - Its obvious, but pls do not skip this step there are no short cuts to success. You should first study all the topics and only then take the practice test.\nFirst Test Attempt: When you feel confident that you have at least a basic understanding of all the Certification Topics, attempt the test. Make a list of the topics where you experienced difficulties. Be sure to read the detailed explanations when provided!\nGet Stronger with Second test: Re-read the list of your weak points by re-taking the tests as many times as you want and review topics as needed.\nFinal Test: Hurray you are ready!\nThese practice test questions are all composed of the best questions. The tests are a representation of what you can expect on the real exam. Try the final exam only when you feel very confident with the material or you are near the day of the actual exam. This will give you an accurate projection of the score you will get in the real exam!",

      "description": "Juniper is Awesome! This is what you will think once you understand what Junos Operating system has to offer.\nThe Entire Course is Split into several parts and this is part-1a of the course where we take a Deep Dive into fundamentals of Static-Routing, Aggregate Routing, Generated Route, Martian Routes ( Nothing to Do with Movie) and what Not.\nI love teaching and I have a Passion towards it. I Have made it as hands on as possible instead of Slide shows showing outputs and then dealing everything about it.\nGoal of this course is to make engineer as practical as possible and ease his/her way to implement/troubleshoot thing thinking at fundamental level.\nThis is the Part-1a of the Course. Course Covers the official Curriculum / Blue Print from Juniper Networks Certification Portal.\nIdentify the concepts, operation and functionality of various protocol-independent routing components\n\nJunos Architecture\nA Detailed View at Routing-Table (Inet/inet.3/mpls/inet.6)\nStatic Routing / Aggregate Routing / Generated Route / Martian Address Space\nAudience\nNetwork Engineers who has knowledge on Basic TCP/IP\nEngineers who would like to see additional concepts and knobs at a specialist level certification of JNCIS-SP/ENT\nMaterials :\nAll the Demonstrations are covered over a virtual platform\nThis is done to demonstrate the power of Junos now at a virtual level , thanks to VMX / VSRX and also give a push to someone who wants to learn Junos and still think that he needs hardware for the same\nHow Long would it take to complete this Course ?\nThis course should take no greater than 3 Hours to complete.\nThis includes in-depth analysis of all the concepts and different knobs that Junos has to offer.\nWhy Take this Course ?\n- To get help in certification track of Famous Jncis-SP/ENT tracks\n\n- To understand more about Juniper Networks\n- To advance your configurational and troubleshooting expertise\nCourse Structure\n-> Course-Summary and Intro\n-> What is Part-1a of this course\n-> Architectural view of Junos\n-> Routing-Tables\n-> Next-Hop categories\n-> Static Routes\n-> Static Routes at Global/Routing-Instance/logical-system Level\n-> Next-Hop / Qualified Next-Hops\n-> Aggregate Routes and their Implementations\n-> Generated Route and their implementations\n-> Martian Routes and Tweaking Martian-Route Space\nEquipment and Lab Demonstrations\n-> All the Labs are Build on VMware workstation12 using VSRX/CISCO IOL / VMX\n-> Initial setups were build on VSRX and then the later labs were executed on VMX setup using Logical systems\n\nThis is purely done keeping one thing in mind as i have re-iterated earlier, the goal of this course is to make it as practical as possible along with exploring the user-friendly options where students who enrol for this course can take a better advantage by setting up their own systems without worrying about hardware. I have also made sure that this entire course can run on a single VMX Instance of Junos which consume a 2GB ram and 2vcpu\nI hope you enjoy this course as much as I did developing it.\nCheers",

For example, they will say “(choose the three best answers)”. However, there are also a few questions asking you to \"(choose all that apply)\". It is therefore important to read all the questions carefully.\nThese practical tests are prepared to allow you to acquire a good level of knowledge of the Product Owner inviting you to resort to an often expensive official course.\nMost of the questions in these practice sets are situation based as this will make you understand the concept which can be applied in the actual exam.\n100% money-back guarantee : There is no risk in subscribing to this course as the platform guarantees that you can claim a refund without any justification within 30 days.\n\n\nDisclaimer :\nAll questions have been designed based on real life scenarios, experience and the latest version of the Scrum guide as well as the Scrum skills expected on the PSPO II exam.

      "description": "C++ is one of the most popular programming languages and can be used for a variety of things, including mobile applications, game development, and enterprise software. Knowing C++ opens a lot of doors for you as a Programmer.\nC++  is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or \"C with Classes\". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.\nC++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).\nC++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.\n\nIn 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on \"C with Classes\", the predecessor to C++.[17] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his Ph.D. thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.\n\nWelcome to the Certified Professional in C++ Programming - Practice Test the only course you need to test your skill of coding with C++.\nThe course includes 2 Practice Test builds your programming knowledge while making real-world C++ projects.\nIn this course, you’ll be exposed to fundamental programming concepts using C++ and to help you practice and test your knowledge using quizzes.\n\nHere's a detailed look at what you'll get:\n\nmethods\nvariables\narrays\nif statements\nloops\nClasses and Objects\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\nand much much more!\n\n\nWhat will you need to succeed in this Exam?\n\nBasic C knowledge is required!\nC++ basic knowledge is required though - you don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set (though there are refresher sections in this course!)\nWhat does this course offer you?\n\nThis course consists of 3 practice tests.\nThe practice test consists of 20 questions, timed at 30 minutes\nThe questions are multiple-choice.\nEvery question is associated with a knowledge area.\nThe answers are randomized every time you take a test.\nOnce the test was taken, you will get an instant result report with categories of strength to weakness.\nYou can retake the tests over and over again as and when it suits you.\n\n\nI'd be very happy to welcome you to the course!",

In order to understand core architect technologies, This course will lead you through a series of sections, modules, and demos to prepare you for taking, and ultimately passing, the Microsoft Azure AZ-305 exam.\nThis course curriculum is as follows:\nDesign monitoring (10-15%)\nDesign identity and security (25-30%)\nDesign data storage (15-20%)\nDesign business continuity (10-15%)\nDesign infrastructure (25-30%)\nThe Lectures will educate you on the fundamental terms and principles of the Azure platform and demos will enable you with a hands-on experience using scenarios to empower you in the real world. This course goes through all of the requirements of the Microsoft exam AZ-305: Microsoft Azure Architect Design. Multiple videos are devoted to each sub-objective, and we cover the topic thoroughly. If you are already an expert at many Azure topics, you can easily skip the sections that you already know and focus on the ones you have not yet had much exposure too. This is the benefit of having the complete course\nWelcome to this course! We’re happy you’re joining us!  I'm quite confident that this is the most complete training course targeted specifically at the exam.\nNote: If you took the AZ-300 course, there will be some overlap. There is a lot to repeat around subjects covered in AZ-300 to make sure you have the basis on core technologies that align with the curriculum. Where possible, I try to make the distinction but you will find that we need to cover core infrastructure topics again before moving onto design elements. Feel free to ignore these videos if you took my AZ-300 course, or watch them again for a good refresh before taking your AZ-301 exam. I continue to update this course based on design examples so you can try to take your hands on knowledge & think about it from an architecture perspective.",

These practice tests cover a lot of ground on in-depth aspects of Data Quality processes such as Profiling, Standardization, Matching, Consolidation, Exception Management and various aspects of configuring the appropriate Data Quality transformations and build the transformations for complex real-time requirements. Additionally, all the other important areas like human tasks, debugging, Reference Data Management, Scorecards, Analyst activities, deployment activities, execute Data Quality mappings, integrating the mappings/rules/mapplets into Informatica Power Center.\nIs this an online video-based course?\nNo. This is a practice test with questions and multiple-choice answers.\nWill it be an interactive session?\nYes, you will be able to send a note to the trainer/instructor and communicate as well. If you are taking this course, there are options to see the questions asked by you and also by other participants. This will not only help you to get the questions clarified but also you will know the different perspectives of the subject based on the questions asked by other participants.\nWill I get any material apart from the questions and answers?\nWe will support you with your questions, doubts, and help you with any related Informatica corporation documentation and other curated Data Quality specific products content to learn and understand the content/topics with more clarity.\nDo these tests cover any real-time scenarios / live project scenarios?\nYes, all the content and questions in this course are from real-time project implementations. Everything will be practical and on real-time project implementation.\nWill this help me to clear the IDQ certification?\nWe encourage you to learn all the topics and prepare for success. All the questions and answers provided here have helped multiple other participants to clear the interviews and IDQ certification without any help. We do help you with any clarifications required.\nPlease note, these questions are not copy and paste from the actual certification test, these questions are prepared based on the test topics covered in the certification test\nPlease note, launch the practice test using chrome browser. In other browsers, the question and answers may not fit the window and you may have to scroll the page up and down to see the questions and answers.\nSample Questions\nQuestion 1. A customer file has 5 million records and 500 records are duplicates, the customer data has to be analyzed based on CustomerName, DateofBirth and SSN. Filter Exact Match option is enabled in Match transformation, how the mapping performance will be impacted?\nA) Enabling Filter Exact Match option helps improve performance by removing duplicate records out of the matching process. However, there is additional logic (internally added) to remove the duplicate records that adds little overhead to internal mapping logic, hence its not recommended to enable Filter Exact Match option for this scenario.\nB) It is recommended to use the Filter Exact Match option and allow the 500 duplicate records go through the matching process, as every row of data goes through the matching process irrespective of selecting Filter Exact Match option.\nC) Filter Exact Match option can only be used in Dual Source matching, and in this scenario, the option is disabled by default.\nD) It is recommended to group the similar records and send the grouped data to the Match Process instead of using Filter Exact Match option, similar records will be created on the same cluster, which will be (similar records) consolidated and removed by Consolidator transformation.\nCorrect Answer: A.\nFor this scenario, it's not recommended to enable the Filter Exact Match option.\nFilter Exact Match can be configured in clustered output match type only. When Filter Exact Match is enabled it Improves the performance of the Match Transformation by eliminating the identical records from the matching process. The identical records are directly written to the clustered output.\nIf you have a source dataset with a large number of identical records enabling Filter Exact Match will improve performance by removing identical records out of the matching process.\nBased on the source data and the number of exact matches in the dataset, it has to be checked if Match Mapping can be executed with or without enabling the Filter Exact Match option.\nIf the data set has a lot of exact matches, there is a lot of overhead to process these exact matches, and Match mapping can be very resource-intensive, to Improve the Match performance in this scenario we can enable the Filter Exact Match Option.\nQuestion 2. Using Data Quality for Excel, 80 records should be processed as one batch, select all the correct answers.\nA) Set Maximum Occurrences to unbounded to allow the web service to process multiple records in one batch.\nB) In the DQ for excel settings, increase the Batch size to 80\nC) In the Data Integration Service, under the Application tab, select the web service which is configured in DQ for excel and update the Maximum Concurrent Requests to 80\nD) Users cannot configure the batch size, the records will be processed as per the default batch size of 1 record. Updating the Maximum Concurrent Requests to 80 in the web services 80 records can be processed in parallel.\nCorrect Answer: A,B\nDQ for excel helps non-Informatica users to use the data quality rules created in IDQ and validate data in excel. DQ for excel helps users to reuse the data quality rules and perform data validation from their PC and check how the source data will get transformed into the target data objects.\nIn IDQ, developer has created a mapplet that will standardize data based on the reference data and parse address or customer names. Developers can save the mapplet as web service and give the web service ( after deploying the web service to application). Users can use the DQ for excel and create a new service(Add) using the web service url and validate the data in excel.\nUsers can create a batch of 100 records and validate the data using DQ for Excel. The web service Maximum Occurrences should be configured to unbounded to allow the web service to process multiple records in one batch.\nQuestion 3. Data has to be extracted from various sources and compared against the master data for each load, the existing process is delaying the load process due to the source data comparison with master data for every load. The customer is insisting to follow the same load approach and asked your recommendation.\nSelect the best approach\nA) Use Identity Match with Persistent RecordID which uses Universal ID which allows users to store matching keys to make the subsequent matching process efficient. It will significantly improve the performance when source data is matched against master data regularly and the speed of the match operation is critical\nB) Standardize the data and perform dual-source matching, as data is standardized by removing the noise words, and validating against the reference tables, the match process will be efficient and load time will be considerably less as compared to performing the match without standardization\nC) Reading the data from two pipelines and performing a dual-source is not recommended, when time is a constraint. Use Union transformation to combined the data from both the sources and perform single source Field matching and in consolidation transformation use row-based strategy with modal exact option to prioritize the data from the master source.\nD) All the other approaches mentioned will not reduce the load window, as the match process is a complex process. Instead of using match transformation use Comparison transformation to compare strings between source data and master data and based on the score generated to create an ETL process to load as per your requirement.\nCorrect Answer: A\nUse Identity Match with Persistent RecordID which uses Universal ID which allows users to store matching keys to make the subsequent matching process efficient. It will significantly improve the performance when source data is matched against master data regularly and the speed of the match operation is critical",

      "description": "How people are hired, who gets promoted, who gets the new job, who gets a raise, all those decisions are being made all the time in your company was traditionally being based on gut feeling. But in today's age, leaders prefer to make data-driven decisions - instead of solely relying on gut or their personal experience.\nAs a HR Analyst, you will be collecting, cleaning and making sense of the data you have about your people and putting it in a form it can be used for business decisions. We live in a talent constrained economy, so there's a huge demand for information about what is creating engagement, why are people leaving, what we can do to improve productivity, and so forth.\nWHY BUSINESSES WANT TO HIRE HR ANALYTICS SKILLS?\nAllows for data-driven decision making 88%\nDrive/improve business performance 76%\nImprove current programs and processes 71%\nSolve important business problems 59%\nEnhance respect for human resources 53%\nBuild productive executive relationships 24%\nIncrease funding for human capital 12%\nWHY YOU SHOULD INVEST IN LEARNING HR ANALYTICS SKILLS?\nDemand is high - but there is shortage of people who has the skill.\nWHY THIS COURSE?\nDeveloped with strong engagement from employers and HR analytics professionals, this innovative course provides you with an ability to identify people related business problems, and understand how analytics can be applied to develop solutions for these problems. Based on the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) model, the course prepares you for a future of data driven and evidence-based decision making.\nThe teaching approach is non-technical with learning through doing; focused on teaching you to be able to understand and apply statistics and data science to solve problems and draw causal inferences in an organisational context. The instructor of this course has been teaching analytics for post-graduate students of business analytics and human resource management at a UK-based University. So the instructor has the knowledge of what is required for the HR-Analyst role and where the beginning students get frequently stuck - and that gets reflected throughout the course.\nWHAT THIS COURSE IS NOT?\nYou will study how statistics and data science can be applied in HR. This course, however, shall neither cover the theory and practice of strategic Human Resource Management (HRM) nor theory of statistics because we believe in real-world practice of HR Analytics - you do not need a theoretical understanding of statistics. In short: Whatever you need to get started as a HR Analyst is there in the course. Things which you don't need (or are rather optional) are not there. That being said, there is no harm in learning the concepts of statistics in-depth. Knowledge is power after all: more the merrier. However, it is very important for you to have an in-depth understanding of the business or organisation and basics of HRM theory from academic books.\nThis is not the best possible course - and neither it can replace the rigours of an University education. The objective of this course is to help you get started.\nWHAT HR-ANALYTICS CAN'T DO?\nRemember: HR-ANALYTICS is a tool and no tool will give you quality data or make good decisions for you. That is still on you. So before you rush out and make your company invest in an analytics project - make sure you've worked with the IT department and your own internal team to validate the quality of the data you have and you have a good data dictionary so that you know what it means. All of those issues of quality and data definition are still on you. The tools will help you manipulate and visualize and understand the data. But taking care of the data quality and making decisions based on that is still your wisdom.\nBe transparent with their employees about what data they're collecting and what they're going to do with it and what they're not going to do with it. And those are rules that you have to create and live by and hold yourself accountable.\nBe Ethical. Consider issues related to the Privacy, Security, Fairness, and Purpose of the data and the analytics project.\nSetting the expectations right:\nYou do not need to be good at maths or statistics or coding - although having a knowledge is an advantage. However, this course is meant assuming that the students do not have any background in advanced statistics and maths. We will cover few concepts in the most easiest way possible - as we go along. Plus we will be using drag-and-drop software to learn analytics - so coding experiences or knowledge is not required either.\nContrary to the popular belief, analytics is not a magic-solution for answering all business questions.\nYour organisation might not have the data you need to address its' business questions. You might require to collect the data all by yourself (e.g. by conducting surveys on employees).\nPeople Analytics is new. Some stakeholders might not understand or appreciate what you do.\nMake sure you do not breach the code of ethics. In other words, your data-processing and handling practises should be compliant with country-/organisation-specific data privacy regulatory bodies like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR for European Union). If unsure of the compliances for your region or organisation, cross-check this with your manager, local librarian, university, legal advisor, and similar reliable sources.\nThis course is a technical course with the aim to increase your Analytics acumen, but alone it will not lead to success. Business acumen— and an understanding of how to leverage people to drive improved outcomes is vital for success - but beyond the scope of this course. Students should refer to soft skill development courses for that.\nWhile HR analytics is a promising field, there are certain barriers you might need to tackle at the work place:\nData-collection issues\nData-integration issues\nLack of skills\nLack of management support\nLack of funding\nNo systematic process",

Then we'll take a look at the 6 principal clauses of the SELECT statement: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY.\nThen we'll start creating tables, but find that we can't get very far without understanding data types. We'll then look at string, date and number types and functions, together with looking at functions converting between them.\nWe'll revisit the SELECT statement and go into more detail. We'll create tables and JOIN them together. Once you have finished this session, you should be secure in your knowledge of the 6 principal clauses of the SELECT statement, the most important part of Oracle SQL.\nWe'll then looking for missing data, and find out how to delete and update data. We'll look at the difference between implicit and explicit transactions, and various constraints, including primary and foreign keys.\nWe'll start off by saving our queries in views. Then we'll combine tables, not by adding additional columns using JOINS, but adding additional rows such Oracle SQL set operators such as UNION, INTERSECT and MERGE.\nWe'll add totals to our SELECT queries. We'll then look at subqueries, and how you can add them into the FROM, SELECT and WHERE clauses, and also into the WITH clause. We'll also look at Oracle SQL self-joins, which are useful when you have hierarchies.\nFinally, TIME ZONE and INTERVAL data types and functions. We'll then have a look at SEQUENCEs and INDEXes, together with how these are shown in the Data Dictionary. We'll then create new users, and assign privileges and roles to them, and we'll finish with the last few requirements for the exam.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even install Oracle Database and Oracle SQL Developer on your computer for free!\nOnce finished, you will know what how to manipulate numbers, strings and dates, and create database and tables, create tables, insert data and create analyses, and have an appreciation of how they can all be used in Oracle SQL.",

      "description": "|| Unofficial Course ||\nMSP (Managing Successful Programmes) is a best-practice framework developed by AXELOS for managing complex, large-scale change in organisations through programme management. The MSP certification path validates your understanding and ability to apply this framework to align projects with strategic goals, deliver transformational change, and realize measurable benefits.\nThis comprehensive course is designed to equip professionals with a deep understanding of Managing Successful Programmes (MSP)—a globally recognized framework for managing complex change and delivering strategic outcomes. Whether you're new to programme management or looking to formalize and enhance your existing knowledge, this course provides the structured guidance and practical insight needed to manage programmes effectively in today’s dynamic environments.\nYou’ll begin by exploring the fundamentals of programme management, including how programmes differ from projects and portfolios, and how MSP provides a framework to align change initiatives with organizational strategy. You’ll gain a solid understanding of the purpose, structure, and evolution of MSP, as well as its relationship with other methodologies such as PRINCE2, Agile, and ITIL.\nCentral to MSP are its guiding principles, which underpin all successful programmes. You’ll learn how these principles promote strategic alignment, stakeholder engagement, and continuous learning throughout the programme lifecycle. The course also emphasizes the critical role of vision, leadership, and effective communication in driving programme success.\nA core focus of this course is MSP’s governance themes, which provide the framework for maintaining structure, direction, and control. You’ll delve into the programme’s organizational structure, key roles and responsibilities, benefits management, planning and control processes, and effective handling of risk, issues, quality, configuration, and change. You’ll also explore how the blueprint and design components align programme delivery with strategic intent.\nThe course further examines the MSP Transformational Flow—the lifecycle model that guides programmes from initial conception through to final delivery and closure. You’ll learn how to identify and define a programme, plan and design for strategic outcomes, deliver capability through projects and tranches, realize intended benefits, and close the programme in a controlled and value-driven manner.\nFinally, the course highlights how to integrate MSP with broader corporate strategy and tailor the framework to suit specific organizational contexts, scales, and complexities.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll not only understand the theoretical underpinnings of MSP but also gain practical tools and confidence to apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.\nThank you",

I will pass through all topics that a MikroTik switch can do so you will have a deep understanding of configuring a MikroTik switching environement.\nIn this course, I am going to focus on the MikroTik CRS3xx series switch which is the best ever switch that MikroTik has already done. I will be using real equipment during the course because it is not possible to emulate a switching environment in an emulation software like GNS3.\nAdditionally, this course will prepare you to be ready for the MikroTik switching MTCSWE exam which is one of the most difficult exam that is provided by MikroTik.\nTo be able to repeat the LABS, I advise you to have at least 2 x CRS300 series switches and 1 MikroTik router (HAP lite).

      "description": "This course will jump right into bank feeds and how to use them.\nMost QuickBooks courses will spend a lot of time talking about how a full-service accounting system works using QuickBooks. We do recommend spending time learning the full accounting process, and we do have a course that does this.\nHowever, many small businesses want to get right down to data input as fast as possible, and others already have a good understanding of the system and want to focus specifically on bank feeds.\nThis course will do just that.\nFor example, some small businesses may be perfectly happy using a cash basis system and will, therefore, not need some of the functions used in a full accounting cycle. Businesses that use a cash basis model can structure their data input to be much more heavily dependent on the bank and bank feed data.\nWe will discuss types of businesses that fit well into a cash basis model as we work through the practice problems. We will also discuss some problem areas many businesses have and how to set up a system that works.\nThis course will work through a practice problem and will provide test data that learners can use in their system to follow along if they choose.\nOne obstacle to learning bank feeds is access to a clean QuickBooks file to practice with. Here are some options you can use along with this course:\nIntuit (the owner of QuickBooks) provides a free test drive available to anybody. You can find it by searching in your favorite browser (QuickBooks Test Drive).\nIntuit often provides (almost always) a 30 day discount period. You can use the 30 days to practice by starting the 30-day trial, practicing with the data we provide in the course, and then canceling after the 30 days.\nIntuit also provides discounts or a free version for students and educators.\nCheck with your accountant or CPA firm, and they may be able to provide a discount on QuickBooks Online",

      "description": "Important note: The complete course has been re-recorded, so that all audio problems have been removed, also in this second version of the course, new lessons have been added that will help you in your further learning.\nImportant note 2:  What you must know, before you buy this course, is that in my courses and lessons I use a lot of PowerPoint slides in which I explain in detail each service individually. The only reason is that after a detailed study of the theoretical part, it is easier for the student to follow the practical part. Many people do not like this type of teaching, but as an instructor, I want to do everything to teach and prepare the person who trusts me and buys my course as well as possible for an exam or some other business opportunity. If you don't have patience and only want the practical part, then don't buy my course, or if you only want to watch the practical part, then skip the theory. Basically, all my courses contain a large number of practical exercises.\nWelcome to the new course in which we will introduce you to all the necessary resources that will help you prepare for the challenging Microsoft Azure security technologies course, better known as AZ-500.\nIn combination with the official Microsoft Learn and with the help of this course, you will not only familiarize yourself with the necessary things needed to pass the exam itself, but also prepare yourself for further progress and real life opportunities. Also, in this course you can get acquainted with certain services that are better known in other areas of Azure, i.e. certain services that we met while studying and preparing for other exams or certificates. In this course you will learn to create, manage, work with Azure networking resources. Security is an extremely important topic in understanding the Azure cloud, and in this course we start from the very beginning.  It doesn't matter if you are a beginner, or if it is just one of a series of courses that will help you gain the necessary knowledge to obtain a certificate, I will try my best to explain in detail everything that is needed for a given area, as in all my courses, followed by a practical presentation of what is discussed in the theoretical part. Many consider this unnecessary, but you will see for yourself that for a successful passing it is good to know both, the theoretical and practical part. If you think that one of the two parts is too much for you, feel free to skip it and continue with the part that you think is more suitable for you. The choice is exclusively yours, and it is up to me, as the creator of this course, to offer both solutions. Thanks for your understanding and it's time to start the course.",

Nine out of 10 employers agree that certifications are critical in finding the right person for the job. Plus, IT-certified individuals are more likely to be promoted than those without IT certifications.\n\n\nWhat is the CompTIA A+ certification?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification can be considered an entry-level certificate for IT professionals. Getting a CompTIA A+ certificate can lead to a successful IT career. CompTIA created this certificate for people seeking employment as a help desk, support, service center, or networking technician. The CompTIA A+ certification exam covers PC and laptop hardware, software installation, the configuration of computer and mobile operating systems, basic networking, troubleshooting, and security skills. Many enterprises require a CompTIA A+ certificate for their entry-level information technology jobs. Passing the CompTIA A+ certification exam can also serve as a springboard towards other technology certificates and career advancements.\nDo I need CompTIA A+ for Network+?\nGetting the CompTIA A+ certification is not a requirement to get a Network+ certification. Each certification covers a separate area of computer technology. The A+ certification will test your knowledge of PC hardware, mobile device hardware, operating systems, security, cloud computing, and troubleshooting hardware and network connectivity. It consists of two tests. You can acquire the Network+ plus certification by passing one test. This test validates a student's knowledge of wired and wireless networks and their understanding of topics like unified communications and virtualization. While having both the CompTIA A+ certification and the Network+ certification will give an IT technician more opportunities when looking for a job, neither certification is a prerequisite of the other.\nWhy Should I Get CompTIA A+ Certified?\nCompTIA A+ will either help you get your start in IT or help you get promoted in your current job. It is the industry standard for establishing a career in IT and is the preferred qualifying credential for technical support and IT operational roles.\nIT pros with CompTIA A+ have jobs like IT support specialist, IT field service technician, desktop support analyst and help desk tier 2 support. And, companies like Intel, Dell, Ricoh, Nissan, Blue Cross and Blue Shield and HP all look for CompTIA A+ certification when hiring.\nHow hard is the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe difficulty of the test will depend in large part on your interest and experience in the subject. If you are taking the CompTIA A+ exam because you have already been building and fixing computers for a while and have a working knowledge of operating systems, especially Windows, you should have no problem passing the test. The exam consists of two tests. Each has 90 questions, which consist of multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. For each test, you get an hour and a half.\nHow many questions are on the CompTIA A+ exam and what is a passing score?\nThe CompTIA A+ exam consists of two tests of 90 questions each. The problems include multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. The first exam covers hardware, networking technology, mobile devices, cloud computing, virtualization, and networking troubleshooting. The second exam tests the knowledge of software troubleshooting, installing operating systems, configuring operating systems, and security. The passing score for the first exam, 220-1001, is 675 out of a scale of 100-900. For the second exam, 220-1002, a passing score is 700 out of a scale of 100-900. This means that to pass the first test, you need to answer at least 69 out of 90 questions correctly. Whereas for the second test, you need to have 70 correct out of 90.\nIs CompTIA A+ worth it?\nMany entry-level IT jobs require an A+ certification. It proves to the business you are applying to that you have basic IT knowledge. They want to know that you can do the work and don't need basic training. If you have no experience in the industry, having a CompTIA A+ certificate can get you an entry-level job. After that, you can specialize, add other certifications, and advance in your career. The CompTIA A+ certificate has been the first step in a successful career for many IT professionals.\nWhat's next after the CompTIA A+?\nFor many IT professionals, the CompTIA A+ is the first of many certifications earned over the course of their careers. Since the A+ certification is fairly general, you may choose to move into an IT specialization, like networking, cybersecurity, or cloud computing. CompTIA offers more advanced certifications in these fields, as do many other reputable organizations. Take a look at this IT certification roadmap to inspire your next career goal.\nWhat are the objectives of the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe test objectives are to ensure that an aspiring IT professional has the basic knowledge for an entry-level information technology job. CompTIA A+ applicants should be able to assemble components based on customer requirements. The exam tests applicants on their ability to install, configure and maintain PCs, mobile devices, and software. They should know the basics of networking and security forensics. CompTIA A+ applicants should have basic troubleshooting skills to diagnose, resolve, and document common hardware and software issues. They should know how to provide essential customer support. They should also understand the basics of scripting, virtualization, desktop imaging, and deployment.\nWhat jobs can I get with CompTIA A+?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification is the industry standard for a career in IT and is the preferred credential for technical support and IT operational roles. One job a person with an A+ certificate may choose is IT support specialist. An IT support specialist is responsible for installing and configuring computer hardware and software, monitoring and maintaining computer networks, and providing technical support across a company. Another role someone with A+ certification may choose is help desk technician. A help desk technician diagnoses and supports hardware and software issues across a company. Other job titles that require A+ certification include service desk analyst, technical support specialist, field service technician, network engineer, data support technician, desktop support administrator, help desk technician, and system support specialist.\nWhich should you choose CompTIA A+ or CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)?\nCompTIA offers two separate entry-level certifications, the CompTIA A+, and the CompTIA IT Fundamentals, or ITF+. They’re slightly different. The CompTIA A+ is billed as a certification that will test you on the knowledge needed to land an entry-level IT job. The ITF+, on the other hand, is designed for students and professionals who want to see if IT is a right career fit for them. The ITF+ exam is also used by non-IT professionals who want a broad introduction to the field. If you’re still on the fence about whether you’d like a job in IT, getting the ITF+ can be a good way to test the waters. If you know you want to commit to IT work and are ready to gain job-ready skills, the A+ certification is probably a better path.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: quality of teaching.\nLondon-based OAK Academy is an online education company.

Getting a CompTIA A+ certificate can lead to a successful IT career. CompTIA created this certificate for people seeking employment as a help desk, support, service center, or networking technician. The CompTIA A+ certification exam covers PC and laptop hardware, software installation, the configuration of computer and mobile operating systems, basic networking, troubleshooting, and security skills. Many enterprises require a CompTIA A+ certificate for their entry-level information technology jobs. Passing the CompTIA A+ certification exam can also serve as a springboard towards other technology certificates and career advancements.\nDo I need CompTIA A+ for Network+?\nGetting the CompTIA A+ certification is not a requirement to get a Network+ certification. Each certification covers a separate area of computer technology. The A+ certification will test your knowledge of PC hardware, mobile device hardware, operating systems, security, cloud computing, and troubleshooting hardware and network connectivity. It consists of two tests. You can acquire the Network+ plus certification by passing one test. This test validates a student's knowledge of wired and wireless networks and their understanding of topics like unified communications and virtualization. While having both the CompTIA A+ certification and the Network+ certification will give an IT technician more opportunities when looking for a job, neither certification is a prerequisite of the other.\nHow hard is the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe difficulty of the test will depend in large part on your interest and experience in the subject. If you are taking the CompTIA A+ exam because you have already been building and fixing computers for a while and have a working knowledge of operating systems, especially Windows, you should have no problem passing the test. The exam consists of two tests. Each has 90 questions, which consist of multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. For each test, you get an hour and a half.\nHow many questions are on the CompTIA A+ exam and what is a passing score?\nThe CompTIA A+ exam consists of two tests of 90 questions each. The problems include multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. The first exam covers hardware, networking technology, mobile devices, cloud computing, virtualization, and networking troubleshooting. The second exam tests the knowledge of software troubleshooting, installing operating systems, configuring operating systems, and security. The passing score for the first exam, 220-1001, is 675 out of a scale of 100-900. For the second exam, 220-1002, a passing score is 700 out of a scale of 100-900. This means that to pass the first test, you need to answer at least 69 out of 90 questions correctly. Whereas for the second test, you need to have 70 correct out of 90.\nIs CompTIA A+ worth it?\nMany entry-level IT jobs require an A+ certification. It proves to the business you are applying to that you have basic IT knowledge. They want to know that you can do the work and don't need basic training. If you have no experience in the industry, having a CompTIA A+ certificate can get you an entry-level job. After that, you can specialize, add other certifications, and advance in your career. The CompTIA A+ certificate has been the first step in a successful career for many IT professionals.\nWhat are the objectives of the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe test objectives are to ensure that an aspiring IT professional has the basic knowledge for an entry-level information technology job. CompTIA A+ applicants should be able to assemble components based on customer requirements. The exam tests applicants on their ability to install, configure and maintain PCs, mobile devices, and software. They should know the basics of networking and security forensics. CompTIA A+ applicants should have basic troubleshooting skills to diagnose, resolve, and document common hardware and software issues. They should know how to provide essential customer support. They should also understand the basics of scripting, virtualization, desktop imaging, and deployment.\nWhat jobs can I get with CompTIA A+?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification is the industry standard for a career in IT and is the preferred credential for technical support and IT operational roles. One job a person with an A+ certificate may choose is IT support specialist. An IT support specialist is responsible for installing and configuring computer hardware and software, monitoring and maintaining computer networks, and providing technical support across a company. Another role someone with A+ certification may choose is help desk technician. A help desk technician diagnoses and supports hardware and software issues across a company. Other job titles that require A+ certification include service desk analyst, technical support specialist, field service technician, network engineer, data support technician, desktop support administrator, help desk technician, and system support specialist.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: quality of teaching.\n\n\nLondon-based OAK Academy is an online education company.

      "description": "The VMware Spring Certified Professional 2025 (2V0-72.22) exam is a rigorous and detailed assessment designed to test the knowledge and skills of Java, Spring Framework, and Spring Boot developers. Despite their practical experience, many candidates find the exam challenging due to its focus on the intricate workings of the framework and its various components.\nTo succeed in this exam, it is crucial to build a solid foundation through comprehensive study, including educational courses, books, and articles. Once you have gained sufficient knowledge, mock exams serve as an effective tool to test your understanding and readiness for the actual exam.\n\nRecognizing the need for high-quality preparatory materials, we have developed this course to provide a robust and challenging study aid. This course was born out of personal experience, having identified a gap in the availability of challenging mock questions during my own preparation for the certification.\n\nOur course offers 900+ unique questions, each accompanied by detailed explanations. These explanations not only clarify the correct answer but also provide additional context and references for further reading, enhancing your understanding of each topic. The questions are designed to mirror the difficulty level of the actual exam, if not to exceed it, to ensure thorough preparation.\n\nThe Spring Professional Develop (2V0-72.22) exam, leading to the Spring Certified Professional 2025 certification, consists of 60 items. The passing score is 300/500, calculated using a scaled method. Candidates are allocated 130 minutes to complete the exam, providing ample time for non-native English speakers.\nBy enrolling in this course, you are investing in a comprehensive and detailed preparation tool that aims to equip you with the knowledge and confidence to succeed in your Spring Certified Professional 2025 certification journey.\n\n\nVMware exam information\n- Number of Questions: 60\n- Passing score: 300 using a scaled method (~76%)\n- Duration: 130 Minutes\n- Questions Type: Multiple Choice, Multiple Selection\n- Cost: $250 USD\n\n\nTopics included\nSpring Core:\nThis section covers the introduction to Spring Framework, Java configuration including defining and accessing Spring Beans, handling multiple configuration files and dependencies, understanding Bean Scopes, properties and profiles, annotation-based configuration and component scanning, Spring Bean lifecycle, and Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP).\nData Management:\nThis section introduces Spring JDBC, including using and configuring Spring’s JdbcTemplate, executing queries, and handling data access exceptions. It also covers transaction management with Spring, and implementing a Spring JPA application using Spring Boot and creating Spring Data Repositories for JPA.\nSpring MVC:\nThis section explains how to create a Spring MVC application using Spring Boot, describes the basic request processing lifecycle for REST requests, and how to create a simple RESTful controller to handle GET requests. It also covers creating controllers to support the REST endpoints for various verbs and utilizing RestTemplate to invoke RESTful services.\nTesting:\nThis section covers writing tests using JUnit 5, writing integration tests using Spring, configuring tests using Spring Profiles, extending Spring tests to work with databases, and advanced testing with Spring Boot and MockMVC.\nSecurity:\nThis section explains basic security concepts, using Spring Security to configure Authentication and Authorization, and defining method-level security.\nSpring Boot:\nThis section introduces Spring Boot features, describes Spring Boot dependency management, Spring Boot properties and autoconfiguration, and Spring Boot Actuator, including configuring Actuator endpoints, securing Actuator HTTP endpoints, defining custom metrics, and defining custom health indicators.\n\n\nExamples\nQuestion 1: Which of the following annotations can be used on top of a field in Spring, in order for the field to be a candidate for dependency injection? (select multiple)\n@Autowired\n@Bean\n@Resource\n@Inject\n\n\n## Answer\nCorrect answers: @Autowired, @Resource, @Inject\nExplanation:\n@Autowired:\nCorrect, @Autowired annotation in Spring is used for automatic dependency injection, making the annotated field a candidate for injection.\n@Bean:\nIncorrect, @Bean annotation is used to declare a Spring Bean at the method level, not for field-level dependency injection.\n@Resource:\nCorrect, @Resource annotation, similar to @Autowired, can be used for field-level dependency injection in Spring. However, unlike @Autowired, @Resource follows the JSR-250 standard and performs injection by name rather than type.\n@Inject:\nCorrect, @Inject annotation, part of the JSR-330 standard, can also be used for dependency injection in Spring, making it a valid choice for field-level injection.\n\n\nQuestion 2: In which of these transaction isolation levels can non-repeatable reads occur? (select multiple)\nRepeatable Reads\nRead Uncommitted\nSerializable\nRead Committed\n\n## Answer\nCorrect answers: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed\nExplanation:\nRepeatable Reads:\nIncorrect, this isolation level prevents non-repeatable reads by ensuring that if a transaction reads a row, it can read that row again and get the same values.\nRead Uncommitted:\nCorrect, this is the lowest isolation level and allows non-repeatable reads, as it permits reading uncommitted changes made by other transactions.\nSerializable:\nIncorrect, this is the highest isolation level and prevents non-repeatable reads by ensuring a transaction can be completed only if no other transactions are modifying data that it has read.\nRead Committed:\nCorrect, this isolation level allows non-repeatable reads because it only guarantees that any data read is committed at the moment it is read; however, it can change before the end of the transaction if other transactions commit changes.\n\n\n\n\nExam Step\nOnce you've mastered the course content and are scoring highly on the mock exams, you're ready for the real exam. This is more than a test - it's a stepping stone to advancing your career. So, don't wait! Book your exam at VMware and take a leap forward in your professional journey.

      "description": "In this practical hands-on course, you will learn the real-world crucial skills for network engineering DHCP over WAN, with a bonus section on hardening your network against a Man-in-the-Middle attack.\nWe will begin by building two network WAN and configure a DHCP server to supply addresses to all user devices. During this time, we will also explore DHCP's many features and requirements for operation. Then as a bonus we will simulate a realistic cyberattack in the form of a Man-in-the-Middle attack against one of our networks by using a rogue DHCP server. Then, we follow up with a detailed lesson on how to detect and how to prevent those kinds of attacks!\nTo ensure the deepest learning possible we will configure everything on the command-line (one command at a time), and then learn a variety of DHCP-specific show commands useful for verifying our configurations and for troubleshooting, and these commands will also help you on your exams.\nLike all of my courses here on Udemy, we will use Packet-Tracer as our simulated network environment (available free from Cisco). By the way, this course also includes a FREE copy of my book On the Command Line which is available FREE only here on Udemy. The book includes 100 of the most popular commands and configurations critical to reaching your CCNA goals, all listed line-by-line with diagrams and real screen shots. Hardcopy and e-reader versions are also available from Amazon.\nIn this online course we are going to learn the basics of DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol). To do this we will use a network device as the actual server, and the reason is so that you learn how to build the server from scratch. In other words, configure it yourself on the command line as opposed to using a server device that uses a GUI. Why do this? Because a GUI is easy, and because the CCNA exam track calls for command line ability. Of course, this takes more time and effort, but it is well worth it. There are some special rules to follow. But I promise that after you complete this course you will be able to build DHCP servers easily and with total confidence.\nIn this course we will cover:\nHow to configure a Dynamic Host Control Protocol server on a network device, such as a router or switch.\nHow to relay that data over non-contiguous networks using the Relay command.\nHow to detect a Man-in-the-Middle cyberattack that uses DHCP.\nHow to harden a network device against DHCP attacks.\nAs usual, this course includes free PDF handouts to help with your learning.",

      "description": "Important note:  What you must know, before you buy this course, is that in my courses and lessons I use a lot of PowerPoint slides in which I explain in detail each service individually. The only reason is that after a detailed study of the theoretical part, it is easier for the student to follow the practical part. Many people do not like this type of teaching, but as an instructor, I want to do everything to teach and prepare the person who trusts me and buys my course as well as possible for an exam or some other business opportunity. If you don't have patience and only want the practical part, then don't buy my course, or if you only want to watch the practical part, then skip the theory. Basically, all my courses contain a large number of practical exercises.\nDuring the courses and lectures that I had the opportunity to design and prepare for filming, I often had the opportunity to see that the concept of a container was not clear to the students. Also, in the courses that you have had the opportunity to see and learn so far, we have said a lot about the very concept of containers, and in most of the courses you will also get to know the actual work in Azure. In addition, in the questions I receive, students often ask me if I can create a course dedicated exclusively to containers and services in Azure. Well, the time has come when I can say that, after much planning, I managed to design a course in which we will exclusively talk about containers.\nIn the beginning, we will learn what Docker is and how to work with Docker, then we will get to know Kubernetes, and the third part of the course is designed as an addition and logical continuation of the two mentioned, so we will get to know the services in Azure that contain work with containers. And not only that, when we move on to work with containers in Azure, we will get to know other services that are intertwined with all of these mentioned. If before this course you did not have, or had partial knowledge about containers, after this course you will be able to work with Docker, Kubernetes and the most important container services in the Azure cloud. Now it's time to get started and familiarize yourself with the basics, while we will deal with some more complex things later. Also, as you are used to in all courses up to now, first there will be a theoretical part in which we will say all the most important things about that lesson, followed by a demonstration. If you are familiar with the work from some of the mentioned parts of the course, feel free to skip it and go to the part you need. Let's go.",

      "description": "Telecom Engineering is fast becoming the must have certificates for any IT professional working with corporate Enterprises. Most of the mayor banks and financial institutions rely on Avaya Software.\nIn a virtual call centre model, the call centre operator (business) pays a monthly or annual fee to a vendor that hosts the call centre telephony and data equipment in their own facility, cloud-based. In this model, the operator does not own, operate or host the equipment on which the call centre runs. Agents connect to the vendor's equipment through traditional PSTN telephone lines, or over voice over IP. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at the vendor's data centre, rather than at the call centre operator's premises. The vendor's telephony equipment (at times data servers) then connects the calls to the call centre operator's agents.\nVirtual call centre technology allows people to work from home or any other location instead of in a traditional, centralised, call centre location, which increasingly allows people 'on the go' or with physical or other disabilities to work from desired locations - i.e. not leaving their house. The only required equipment is Internet access and a workstation.[17] The companies are preferring Virtual Call Centre services due to cost advantage. Companies can start their call centre business immediately without installing the basic infrastructure like Dialer, ACD and IVRS.\nVirtual call centres became increasingly used after the COVID-19 pandemic restricted businesses from operating with large groups of people working in close proximity\nIn this course we will start with a broad overview of the Contact Center Telecom platform, the history, the evolution and then deep dive into the individual elements of the Avaya Contact Center platform. You will explore Customer Service, Cloud Contact Center, Architecture, Contact Center Features, Omnichannel Contact Center, Omnichannel Agents and Supervisor, Automation, Artificial Intelligence, etc.\nI am an Avaya Certified Expert, Developer and Systems Administrator living in the USA with over 20 years experience in IT. This course is cheaper than most other courses because I am not doing this as a full time job, rather because I love teaching Telecom and Contact Center. So join me in becoming A Telecom Expert today!",

      "description": "Becoming a Service Mapping Certified Implementation Specialist (CIS) is a really daunting task.\n\n\nBefore even qualifying to take the exam, there are two training courses required:\nService Mapping Fundamentals\nService Mapping Advanced\nAfter completing both Service Mapping courses, you are then faced with the task of studying for the exam. Speaking from personal experience, the exam itself is formidable. Moreover, I found it to be even more challenging considering the amount of information that was required to even have a chance of passing.\nService Mapping isn't the only area that is covered on this exam - you must also have expert-level familiarity with the entire ITOM product suite, familiarity with ITSM processes, and other topics such as Regular Expression and command line interface across multiple operating systems.\nTaking all of this and the lack of accurate practice tests available into consideration, I decided to create my own course. Getting certified for this product area you are probably already working on everyday should be difficult, otherwise it would hold no merit, but it shouldn't be that difficult.\nThe purpose of these practice tests is to provide exam candidates with relevant questions and accurate answers to make preparing to take the CIS - Service Mapping exam a less exhausting process. This course means a lot to me, so I am constantly adding additional questions to this exam and striving to improve those that I have already provided.\nMy primary objective is to help others pass without wasting time or money.

The simulated timed tests are great for getting ready for the real test and I liked the way I could review questions I got wrong, skipped, correct etc for each try so I could quickly identify my weaker topics. All questions have great explanations in the test reviews which is great when you are trying to understand a concept or where your thinking went wrong. I would recommend this to anyone prepping for PO certification. Ludovic is also on hand to answer any questions and is very supportive and helpful. He goes above and beyond and has a genuine interest in his students and wants to help them to pass their exam. I passed assessment on first take!

Yes, you heard it right.\nI have created the module in such a way that you can complete the course in 8 days only provided you spend an hour daily.\nStep by Step instructions and help from the instructor will help you to ACE the course\n\n\nWhat is Scrum?\nScrum is a framework in which people can deal with complex problems while delivering valuable products. Scrum is straightforward to understand but very difficult to master. Scrum has been used for managing work on complex products since the early 1990s. Many people think that Scrum is a methodology. It is not. Scrum is a framework.\nThe Scrum Master role\nThe Scrum Master helps everybody to understand Scrum values, rules, and theory. It is the person coaching the Scrum Team on how to use the Scrum framework.\nMany people new to Agile and Scrum aspire to become Scrum Masters. A Scrum certification can help show what you have the understanding needed.\nDo I need to be a Scrum Master?\nYou can be an aspiring Business Analyst, Project Manager, Product Owner, or Developer. You don't need to be a Scrum Master or have the desire to become one. A Scrum certification will just certify your Scrum know-how.\nDiscovering Scrum changed my life, and I'm on a mission to help people discover how to leverage the simplicity of the Scrum framework to navigate this complex and rapidly changing world with more confidence, less stress, and greater resilience.\n\n\nWho can give PSM  certification exam?\nThe Professional Scrum Master level I PSM I assessment is available to anyone who wishes to validate his or her depth of knowledge of the Scrum framework and its application. Those who pass the assessment will receive the industry recognized PSM I Certification to demonstrate their fundamental level of Scrum mastery.\n\n\nWhat is the advantage of CSM courses from scrum alliance?\nWhether you want to serve as a Scrum Master, are adopting Scrum, or just need the tools to be more agile, Scrum Alliance Certified ScrumMaster CSM course is the right place to start. You’ll gain a solid understanding of Scrum and learn practical ways to apply it on your team and throughout your organization.\nYou’ll learn the Scrum framework and gain an understanding of team accountabilities, events, and artifacts as well as how to guide your team to apply Scrum.\nCSM training gives you hands-on skills that you can immediately apply in the real world and expand your career opportunities. Once you complete the course, you will have everything you need to take and pass the CSM exam.\nAll these topics are covered in this Udemy course. Please note this Course is not affiliated to Scrum Alliance.\n\n\nWhat is Agile Project Management?\nAgile project management is an iterative approach to delivering a project throughout its life cycle. Iterative or agile life cycles are composed of several iterations or incremental steps towards the completion of a project. Iterative approaches are frequently used in software development projects to promote velocity and adaptability since the benefit of iteration is that you can adjust as you go along rather than following a linear path.\n\n\nWho can be a Product Owner?\nA product owner is a role on a Scrum team that is responsible for the project's outcome.
