      "description": "MODULE 1: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nWelcome to Ryan's Method: Etsy Print on Demand!\n\n\nIn this module you will be introduced to the Etsy ecosystem from the seller perspective.\n\n\nWe'll get your Etsy seller account opened, & get your Etsy shop opened. We will also create your first product listing, which is required to sell on Etsy.\n\n\nMODULE 2: BUILD YOUR SHOP\n\n\nNext we'll focus on building out your Etsy shop. This means customizing it to look AMAZING so that when customers see it, it has the look & feel of a professional, top-tier shop.\n\n\nWe will set up your shop policies for things like shipping, returns, & exchange policies.\n\n\nMODULE 3: PRINT ON DEMAND PRODUCTION PARTNER\n\n\nIt's now time to be introduced to our production partners.\n\n\nThese are the companies that integrate with our Etsy seller account so that we can list print on demand products for sale (without owning them ourselves).\n\n\nWhat's great about them is that using them is FREE! So in this module I'll walk you through how we can integrate them together with our Etsy account so that we can push new products & have our sales automatically detected & fulfilled.\n\n\nThis allows us to focus on scaling our business, and gives us the ability to offer a wide variety of products in our shops.\n\n\nMODULE 4: ETSY SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)\n\n\nSEO, or search engine optimization is critical to the success of our Etsy business.\n\n\nIn this module we focus on learning the \"do's & dont's\" of Etsy SEO and then we apply it to our product listings moving forward.\n\n\nThis is how we communicate to Etsy's search algorithm what relevant keywords to associate our products with, when customers perform a keyword search on Etsy (with the hopes that we increase our organic visibility as much as possible).\n\n\nThis means optimizing our Title, Tags, Description, & taking advantage of things like Etsy's free shipping guarantee.\n\n\nMODULE 5: INCREASE SALES w/ OPTIMIZATIONS\n\n\nI consider this module to be the \"bread and butter\" of my Etsy print on demand course.\n\n\nIn this module you'll learn all of the optimizations that will truly set you apart from your competition on Etsy, & make you stand out as a true top-tier Etsy seller.\n\n\nMost people that sell on Etsy aren't even aware of half of the things you'll learn here, and if you take advantage of them & apply them to your Etsy listings, you will be very successful selling on the platform.\n\n\nI took a lot of pride in compiling each and every one of the strategies you'll learn here, and even if you're already selling on Etsy, this section makes enrolling in the course worth it.\n\n\nMODULE 6: ADVERTISING\n\n\nNow we'll take a look at both Etsy Ads & Etsy Offsite Ads.\n\n\nYou'll learn how they work, along with my recommended approach for handling both on-site & off-site ads.\n\n\nI'll also share a story of when Etsy spent hundreds of dollars to advertise my listing at no cost to me! It's a pretty crazy story where tons of sales were made in a short span of time.\n\n\nMODULE 7: SHOP MANAGER\n\n\nShop Manager is the back-end of your Etsy shop.\n\n\nThis module will show you around & have you feeling comfortable in each section:\n\n\nDashboard / Orders / Messages / Stats / Analytics / Finances\n\n\nIt also includes tutorials for making managing your listings easier, including how to make bulk edits to them as well as how to organize them into sections, which can help potential customers locate what they're looking for on your shop's front end.\n\n\nMODULE 8: ETSY SELLER TOOLS\n\n\nIn this module I share my favorite Etsy seller tools.\n\n\nPaid tools are not required to be successful, but the ones listing here can certainly help. You'll see exactly how I use them to increase my Etsy sales.\n\n\nMODULE 9: ETSY SHOP REVIEWS\n\n\nThis module includes organic reviews of 30 Etsy print on demand shops.\n\n\nWe take a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly! And of course, focus on what changes can be made to increase sales moving forward.",

      "description": "Start and build a scalable automated income with Etsy's Marketplace lucrative dropshipping model that is available worldwide. Unique Etsy item policies present a very lucrative and non-competitive market with over 96.3 million active buyers who purchased goods through the Etsy ecosystem (2021 data). No ad spend is needed as Etsy promotes your items organically eliminating a lot of upfront risks, while the majority of dropshippers stay away from the platform due to the nature of unique items that can be sold on the Marketplace. This in itself presents an essential opportunity for both expert & beginner dropshipper looking to expand their eCommerce portfolio, achieve greater profit margins, and do it the right way without getting suspended.\nAnd a little bit about myself - my name is Andrey. I quit my full-time job at an advertising agency in October 2020 as a Paid Search Lead, as I was able to finally crack the dropshipping code as a result of dropshipping on Facebook Marketplace and Etsy, and now I want you to do the very same with me in this course.

If you are struggling to achieve your goals on Amazon FBA, this course has the tools to keep you moving on the right track. A few years ago, I bought the most expensive course on the market (around $5000), but received less value than this amazing course for a few bucks. Sumner does an excellent job of breaking the content down for everyone to understand. Thank you Sumner :).” - Ardie L\n\n\"Very great course that gives a lot of information about running an Etsy shop and how to properly advertise it. One course covers everything what is needed. Now I have a lot of homework to do after a course to improve my store. Thank you for this great course!\" - Dace H\n\n\"This course has more information about Pinterest than a course i paid $900.00 for.\" - Melissa M\n\n\n“Do yourself a favor and buy this course if you are interested in Amazon FBA. Sadly, I must say that I purchased this course when it was on sale, but it would definitely be worth the full price as this course is amazing. I will admit that I was one of those idiots that purchased expensive courses for learning Amazon FBA. Other than a few courses on Udemy I also purchased a course at $400 and purchased a mentorship at $1,350 and then purchased another course on Amazon and Ranking that was $5,000. The funny thing is, is that I keep coming back to this course to learn. This course far surpasses the value of the other courses I had purchased and it was not even 1/4th the price.” - Eric N\n\n\"Loving this course! Ali is so clear at explaining how Etsy works and all the details that come along with being a shop owner. Thank you Sumner and Ali!\" - Dmitriy S\n\n\"I like courses that are systematic and go from A-Z rather than jumping around. Ali & Sumner update their course to reflect changes with Pinterest so they aren't selling outdated materials. They readily answer posted questions. They truly want to help you learn how to use Pinterest to its fullest for your business. Excellent teachers, personable and easy to learn from. Highly recommend this course if you want to learn how to do Pinterest right!\" - Elizabeth C\n\n\nWhether you are a complete beginner OR you've tried an e-commerce business before and failed, this course has everything you need to succeed.\n\n\n30 DAY MONEY-BACK PROMISE: If this course doesn’t deliver results, Udemy will refund your entire purchase amount within 30 days.\n\n\nYou have nothing to lose and so much to gain!\n\n\nEnroll now.",

I am not a special guy, a normal one just  like you. IF I CAN MAKE THIS YOU ALSO CAN DO IT. I start my journey in 2011. I face a lot of problems at first then after a lot of research and after losing a ton of my valuable time I get the exact method What to do and what to not on ebay. Then I leave my day job and go fulltime ebay dropshipper .\n\nHere is my Growth Story:\nIn 2011 I make a small amount of money then I start to grow. In 2011 I research a lot, even 10-12 hours a day for profitable products. In 2012 I bought a course which cost $300 and from the course I learn only what to sell and what not just this part. After this course I saw that my income grows and ROI (Return Of Investment) Grow by 20-30%.This is my starting point. After it I grow myself day by day. But the journey was too much pathetic, very much time consuming. After making a lot of money in 2015 I decide to provide the exact guidance to those who wants to make money online with a small investment from his pocket money.\nIf you are lazy and want to work online from your home then ebay dropship is the right option for you.\nDid you know that in 2015 buyer spent over 18 billion dollar just on ebay shopping! Currently they have 160 million active buyer who shopping on Ebay around the Globe! This results a million dollar transactions in every day and millions of product sell in every month. Just think about that if you sell here your products worldwide then how much opportunity you get? And you not even Start  then How much Opportunity you miss!\nI frankly speak that this is NOT a course of get rich quick Scheme.

You often need to buy hundreds to thousands of units of stock for your first orders - and then, there are more common problems:\n\n\nWhat happens if the product doesn't sell as well as you expect?\nWhat if your \"foolproof\" product research has an unforeseen flaw?\nWhat if a new competitor comes along and ruins your opportunity?\n\n\n\n\nBut don't worry - in this course, I'm going to teach you the Amazon Seller path to deal with all these problems.\n\n\nEven better - I will also train you straight away for your first step of this zero-risk, zero-budget method!\n\n\n\n\nSounds too good to be true? Keep reading!\n\n\n\n\nWith the right amount of experience and preparedness - both mental and financial - you have high chances to earn thousands every month and change your life around.\n\n\nBut how can you get that experience and preparedness without buying stock and selling it yourself right now?\n\n\nIs there a \"catch\"? A \"trap\"?\n\n\nNo - there is no trap.\n\n\nThe method I will show you is to practice being a seller - do everything that a seller does, but without any of the risks and costs.\n\n\nEven better, with this method, you will be making an income out of it!\n\n\nHow does that sound - you learn how to become a successful Amazon seller while getting paid!\n\n\nWant to know more?\n\n\nWant to start your new path to the high-figure, independent income dream life you have without any of the risks?\n\n\nThen join the course now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill unsure?\n\n\nAs per Udemy policy, you are guaranteed a 100% refund within 30 days.\n\n\nJust try the course out - in case you're not happy with the course, you can always get your money back, no charge. Just like the method you will learn, this course is 100% risk-free too!\n\n\nDon't wait - join now!",

This site is loaded with an incredible variety of low cost and quality products. How do you explore this ocean safely and not get eaten by the sharks?\nChatter abounded for years on the internet how this Chinese source (Alibaba) and others like it, could not be trusted: stories of resellers getting stuck with cheap and inferior products, not receiving products, not getting what they ordered, not being able to return bad products and the list goes on, were everywhere.\nAre these stories true?\nWhile the chatter continues to this day, many of the Power Sellers on eBay, Amazon and Etsy are sourcing from Alibaba and similar sites and making millions. Do they know something that others don't know? Yes they do, and I'm going to teach you what that is!\nIn this course I will show you how to:\nSafely source products from Alibaba and AliExpress\nWhat products to buy and what not to buy\nHow to identify trustworthy suppliers\nHow to brand yourself so you get higher search rankings\nHow to go inside eBay and Amazon to determine the most searched and best selling products so you can zero in on what works\nThe only way to safely pay for products\nWhat products to sell and not to sell and why\nHow to find good products\nHow to evaluate products\nHow to buy samples\nWhat price range to stay in and why\nHow to prevent excessive freight charges\nHow to find trending and new products and why these are key to your success\nDid you know that most of the Power Sellers on eBay and Amazon source many and sometimes all of their products from Alibaba. When you walk into any big box store and look at the product labels, what do you see?\nMade in China\nIf most products are made there, why aren't you sourcing directly from China?\nThere is no better home business opportunity and no better time than now, to take advantage of this system. Even if you just want to make some extra money or cash while working from home, this system is for you.",

      "description": "Before talking about AdSense Arbitrage, let's first get to know Arbitrage as a concept on its own...\nArbitrage in summary is buying and selling at the same time but in two different markets.\nAdSense Arbitrage relies on purchasing \"visitors\" by doing ads from a particular platform and selling the same traffic to other advertisers at a higher price.\nMarketers often rely on buying ads from the Facebook platform, converting visitors to their site and profiting from these visitors via Google Adsense. The difference between one marketer and another is the profit margin, there are those who come out with losses and there are those who triple their money.\nWhy Adsense Arbitrage?\nAdsense Arbitrage is an online course that walks you through the process of creating a website and generating $500 per month in passive income.\nThe Adsense Arbitrage course is easy to follow and doesn't require any coding skills or any previous knowledge about creating websites.\nYou'll be taught how to set up Google AdSense advertisements on your site with NO technical skills needed, making it easier for you to generate traffic to your website.\nYou are guided through the process of building blog posts, linking them together with category pages, and adding SEO techniques that will help search engines find your site easily - all without talking about keywords or any other keyword \"hype.\" You are also taught how to create landing pages that turn your visitors into loyal readers and increase your AdSense earnings.\nThis course offers detailed instructions on customizing your website's font styles, colors, and other elements to enhance user experience and engagement. It provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how PPC ads can influence search engine rankings, offering strategies for creating high-quality content and effectively monitoring your PPC campaign's success. You will also learn how to leverage YouTube videos to boost your earnings potential.\nMoreover, this course explores various marketing tactics such as promotions and coupons to maximize your AdSense revenue.\nWhat is AdSense Arbitrage?\nIf you understand how investments usually work, you know it takes some capital to start with, which will hopefully give you decent returns after a certain time and course of action being met.\nLikewise, this is how AdSense arbitrage works. You, the publisher with intent to make good ROI ー1) invest X amount to derive traffic for your website; 2) have AdSense ads placed on that very website/web page; 3) compel visitors to click those ads to earn via AdSense.\nIn clear ad tech language, AdSense arbitrage (traffic arbitrage) means getting traffic using paid means, and converting that traffic into paid clicks by running AdSense ads. The catch is to earn higher revenue through AdSense ads than the initial expense made on buying the website traffic.\nUser Testimonials and Social Proof\n\"This course was a game-changer for me. I never thought I could make money online until I tried AdSense Arbitrage following Ashraf's guide!\" - John D.\n\"Clear, concise, and full of practical tips. I started seeing results within the first month!\" - Emma W.\nA Single Powerful CTA\nEnroll now and start your journey to mastering AdSense Arbitrage today!\nFAQ Section\nQ: Do I need any prior knowledge to take this course?\nA: No prior knowledge or coding skills are required. This course is designed for complete beginners.\nQ: How long will it take to see results?\nA: Results can vary, but many students start seeing results within the first month of applying the strategies taught in the course.\nQ: Is there a money-back guarantee?\nA: Yes, Udemy offers a 30-day money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the course.\nWhat You Will Learn\nWhat is AdSense Arbitrage\nWhat do you need to start working with AdSense Arbitrage\nBest hosting options\nBest AdSense Arbitrage THEME\nBest AdSense Arbitrage Plugins\nHow to find a successful article\nHow to make a Facebook ad to get visits to your article\nHow to test an article\nHow to scale and make more profit\nWho Is This Course For\nAnyone interested in making money online\nBeginners with no prior experience in creating websites or using AdSense\nEntrepreneurs looking to expand their online income streams\nMarketers seeking to understand and leverage AdSense arbitrage\nRequirements\nA computer with internet access\nBasic understanding of the internet and web browsing\nWillingness to learn and implement the strategies taught\nAbout the Instructor\nMoney Makers Academy\nMoney Makers Academy is dedicated to providing top-quality education in various fields of technology and business.

      "description": "If you’re looking to make money online, or even if you just want to increase the profits of your existing business; creating an eCommerce store is an excellent strategy. Scratch that: this is 100% the best way to make money online and that goes for hobbyists, entrepreneurs, bloggers and small businesses alike.\n\nBold claim? Sure is! But read on to find out why we can be confident in making it.\n\nSo just what is eCommerce? Of course, the term refers to online commerce: i.e. selling products online.\nBut while eCommerce could mean selling an eBook from a landing page, it is most often used to refer more exclusively to online shops that sell multiple products and that have a particular layout and set-up. The most popular example of an eCommerce store is undoubtedly Amazon. This acts just like a high street store and allows you to browse products at your leisure and add them to a shopping cart. The only difference is that you can do all this from the comfort of your home and once you check out, the products are the simply delivered to you wherever you are.\n\nIt’s a familiar concept, but what makes it so important?\n\nWhy eCommerce is the Future\n\n\n#1 eCommerce is Growing\nThe first thing you need to recognize is that eCommerce is growing. In the early days, people were uncertain about spending money online and found that it was daunting handing over their card details and trusting in a supplier that they couldn’t meet face to face.\n\nBut now look at companies like Amazon and eBay. These are household names around the world and everyone from the young and tech savvy to the elderly are now happy to shop with them. These companies have helped many people to put aside any concerns they might have had regarding eCommerce and to trust in buying online.\n\nAnd eCommerce is growing as well doing massive business.\n\nFor proof, you need look no further than stats from ‘Cyber Monday’. Cyber Monday is a national holiday of sorts where online retailers are anticipated to lower their prices. It follows Black Friday but these days it tends to do nearly as much business – and it’s growing rapidly.\n\nFor example, in 2014 Cyber Monday created a total of $2.59 billion sales online. That’s no small number but in 2015 this was increased to $3.19 billion. That’s a huge increase. $2.28 billion of these were on desktop (versus $2.04 billion last year) while $838 million were through mobile devices (versus $548 million).\n\nAcross all devices, Cyber Monday increased by 21%!\n\nSeeing as Amazon is probably the best known online retailer, how is its growth going? Well, the company sold a total of $107.01 billion worth of products in 2015. The company employees 230,800 and there are 304 million active Amazon customer accounts. The brand is worth $47.73 billion and this is only expected to continue to grow as well.\n\nThe story is the same across the board. People are becoming more and more familiar with eCommerce and high-street stores are struggling. This is undoubtedly the future of selling and it’s easy to see why.\n\n#2 It’s Convenient\nSo what is it that has led to such growth in eCommerce? Well, the simple fact of the matter is that online sales benefit everyone. The only reason online sales haven’t already dwarfed physical sales is probably the fact that some people still don’t trust shopping online or aren’t sure how to go about it. Over time this concern will be eroded more and more – while tools like PayPal will make it easier and safer than ever before.\n\nWhen you sell products online, it means that you don’t have to employ staff and you don’t have to rent the same amount of physical space. You’ll need somewhere to store your products (unless you’re drop shipping) but other than that, your only costs will be hosting, shipping and web design.\n\nLower overheads mean more profit for you but they also mean lower prices for customers. Customers now have the ability to order products online conveniently but on top of that, they’ll be getting them for a much lower price.\nThere’s also greater versatility in terms of what you can sell. With an eCommerce store you can sell physical products which will require some up-front investment. But\n\nThere’s also a lot less up-front cost. If you wanted to set up a high-street store, then you would need to be willing to spend a large amount of money to rent the physical space, to invest in the stock and to manage staff etc.\n\nHowever, if you are setting up an online store then all you’re going to need is some inventory to sell (perhaps not if you are going to be selling digital products or acting as an affiliate) and a website. It takes just a few clicks to set up an eCommerce store and that means you can have one up and running in minutes for a negligible cost.\n\n#3 It’s the Best Way to Monetize a Website\nThe last two examples explain why businesses should launch their own eCommerce stores and why you might consider launching an eCommerce store as your business. But you should also sit up and take notice if you run a blog or website already and you’re just looking for a way to monetize it.\n\nWhy? Because it’s actually one of the most effective methods there is of making money from an eCommerce website.\n\nUntil now, you likely have been relying on one of several methods to make money online. Perhaps you’re making ads from advertising on your website (Google AdSense for example) or maybe you’re making money by selling an affiliate product.\n\nIn either of those scenarios, it’s important to recognize that you have placed yourself at the bottom of the ‘foodchain’. In other words, you’re being paid by those advertisers and product creators in order to send business their way. The fact that they’re happy to continue paying you, means that they’re making more money that that from you. In other words, they’re earning more from your visitors than you are! You’re getting a small share of their profit but they’re taking home the lion’s share. And in fact, you’re essentially doing their work for them!\n\nAnd that’s why you’ll typically earn about 1-50 cents per click on an advert. Meaning in turn that you’re going to need hundreds of thousands of visitors to your site a day to make any reasonable money. Compare this with selling your own products and making $20-50 each time. Of course, it’s much easier to get someone to click on an advert than it is to get them to buy something – but not as much easier as you think if you have decent products and you’re running your store well. The bottom line? You can make a living from a website with just a few hundred daily visitors instead.\n\nIf you have an eCommerce website, then the buck stops with you. Now you’re making the maximum profit from your customers because you’re selling something to them and keeping the difference. What’s more, is that you’re keeping your visitors on your eCommerce website and engaged with your brand. You’re not sending them away, you’re keeping them right where you want them and making a real difference to the way they see you.\n\nFinally, selling eCommerce products is better than selling digital products or affiliate products because it’s something that anyone can appreciate. Only a very specific type of person buys eBooks about making money online. Phone cases and clothes though? That has a much broader appeal!\n\nTry putting an eCommerce website on your existing website and just see what a difference it makes to your profits. And the potential for growth is MASSIVE.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\nSo with all that in mind then, it’s definitely worth learning how to create an eCommerce store so that you can start maximizing your online earnings. And potentially, so that you can turn your small website into your very own global brand selling products that get you really excited!\n\nThat’s where this course comes in. Here, you will learn:\nHow to run an eCommerce website and create an effective business model\nHow to set up your own eCommerce website with one of several eCommerce platforms\nHow to find, create or buy products you can sell online\nHow to build an eCommerce website and social media presence to promote your store\nHow to stock and design your eCommerce website to maximize sales\nHow to price your products\nHow to choose products that will sell well\nHow to use apps, plugins and more to get even more sales\nAnd much more!\nIn short, you’ll learn how to create an eCommerce business or add eCommerce to your existing model in simple, easy steps. From there, you’ll then be shown multiple ways you can increase your profits and turn that business into a huge success.\nLearn the Blueprint for WooCommerce, Shopify, AliBaba, Amazon, and eBay.\nAre you ready?

We will afterwards learn how to import products from China and create high-converting descriptions for them. You will learn how to edit products, import them into your Shopify store, and much more!\nIn the second part of this course, we will then focus on finding products that are selling right now using some techniques to ensure that they are actually selling.

You will be an expert in identifying and importing products that sell, setting up your own high-converting online stores, and more importantly, you will know exactly how to market your products so you can generate sales.\nWhile other courses leave you confused and only cover some parts of the Shopify drop shipping model, this is an A-to-Z guide for creating your own profitable Shopify store!\nNow, I want my students to always feel comfortable when they make a purchase. That is why I offer you a 30 day money back guarantee!\nSo, with this in mind, there’s no risk involved but plenty of rewards.\nIT’S TIME TO TAKE ACTION.

      "description": "If you’re reading this, you’ve probably passed the point of setting up your e-commerce site, and now you’re looking to improve your sales.\n\"I'm a team of one -- These strategies won't work for just me...\"\nWhen Facebook came to see the entire online marketing team that I was running at Vail Resorts, they were shocked to see that all of the team was just me. I'm familiar with the marketing team of one. These tactics and strategies can be used in an individual and team environment.\nChances are you’ve made a few sales, but you want to take it to the next level -- I'm talking big sales numbers...$1 million + sales numbers. Want to get your store to that level?\n\"But I don't have money to invest in my business!\"\nI had the same theory of thought. Then I found a coach and applied what I learned and it paid off within the first 30 days. You don't need to raise money. 90% of the business I run and consult started with less than $1000 to grow their business.\nThis course is not going to give you a bunch of theory and ideas. It’s filled with actionable e-commerce marketing strategies supported by case studies. Many of the strategies are followed by an action item to help you implement the steps we’ve talked about.\n\"This won't work for my ecommerce store!\"\nMy partners and I have 6 different ecommerce stores we use every single one of these strategies on every month. They range from beauty products, to outdoor gear to digital products to health products. These are not niche specific strategies. They work for all niches (digital and physical products).\nIn this course I’m going to cover:\nHow just tweaking a few on-site elements can increase your profitability by 14%\nHow to attract the right people to your site instead of just plain non-converting visitors\nHow to spy your competition have them to give you their customers\nHow to maintain a killer customer service plan that keeps your business thriving\nHow to optimize your site from top to bottom to gain hidden sales\nThis course is split into 3 key areas:\nThe 1st section discusses how to increase targeted traffic to your site using marketing, advertising, and social media strategies. Some of the topics include:\nHow To Use Your Blog To Build Authority and Leads\nFacebook & The E-Commerce Marketing Funnel\nHow to Set Up a Profitable Google AdWords Campaign\nSpy On Your Competitors To Get A Competitive Edge\nWhat Metrics Should You Track?\nThe 2nd section covers ways to improve your visitors’ experience once they’re on your website. It discusses conversion optimization, how and what to test on your site, product listings, website navigation, and much more. Some of the killer content we're going to discuss include:\nWhat’s Your Homepage Value Proposition\nDo Your Visitors Trust You? How To Increase Confidence with Trust Elements\nNavigation Layout (Under and Over 50 Products)\nTest Your Website Non-Stop to get Non-Stop Results\nFocus on Your Bestsellers FIRST Product\nThe 3rd section talks about what happens after the customer purchases, including customer support, email marketing, shipping, and retargeting. You'll learn some of the following techniques that made our companies millions including:\nRetargeting to Convert the People Who Didn't Buy\nUse Email Remarketing to Convert Interested Potential Customers Into Buyers\nCreate the Best Customer Service Plan\nShip Products Quick & Gain Customers Attention\nLet Your Customers Sell For You With Product Reviews\n******\nDISCOVER: How To Maximize Your E-commerce Store’s Profitability\nThe most profitable e-commerce stores are doing something different. They have a strategy. Several strategies actually. And they know how to implement them and maximize their marketing ROI at every stage.\nWant to boost your e-commerce store sales but not sure how? If you’ve recently started your e-commerce store or maybe just hit a wall, this course is your guide. Learn what it takes to make your store the next 'BIG THING' on the web.\nOur goal is for you to succeed! You can get these strategies for thousands of dollars with consultants but our goal isn’t to get rich.\nOur goal is to make this information accessible to anyone with an e-commerce store. Why? Because we know that if just ONE strategy works, it will have been the cheapest investment you’ve ever made with the BIGGEST return.",

My FBA business is coming along nicely after a slow start I am making great sales and building profitability. Soon I will be able to go full time\" Dean Kleb\nThere are two main ways to sell on Amazon:  You can either create your own brand new listings, or you can leverage existing successful listings.  Both methods have pros and cons (like everything!).  This course focuses on leveraging existing successful listings.\nYou will learn everything you need to know, from setting up and verifying your Amazon account, to identifying and sourcing the best products to sell.\nYou will also learn how to win the Buy Box:  This is where 80% of sales on Amazon come from!\nNo need for a big budget, because you will learn how to do this starting with a small budget and gradually scale up from there.\nThe only thing you need to bring to this course is a desire to succeed and the motivation to keep going. Selling on Amazon FBA is not a 'get-rich-quick' scheme. In fact, there is no such thing.  However, the rewards can be very big for those who really want them.",

I don’t like to think of myself as a “marketing guru” as many experts call themselves. Then only thing that I have been privileged with, is to work for about 10 years in the advertising industry and test out dozens of ideas in tens of markets and see what works and what doesn’t.\nHOW DOES THIS INTEREST ME? You might ask.\nWell it’s simple…instead of you spending thousands of dollars if not more on advertising to learn from your own mistakes, you will skip all the headaches I had and my years of trial and error. Consider this course your head-ache pill that you take before even feeling any pain.\nAnd just to make sure…\nDo you think I never had failed campaigns? Of course I had.\nHere are some other failures as well…\nMichael Jordan lost over 300 games in his career.\nDyson had 5,000 failed prototypes before making a vacuum.\nEdison failed 10,000 times before creating the light bulb.\nEXPERIENCE IS FAILURE.\n\nBut since we live in this information age, everything is now accessible and you can skip parts if not all of the trial phase by learning from someone who has been there done that.\nI’m not saying, you will be a world class writer after taking this copywriting course, but if you follow the rules and guidelines I laid out for you I guarantee you will be a damn good copywriter.\nBetter than most copywriters I’ve seen at top 5 ad agencies anyway…\nSO HERE IS WHAT THIS COURSE WILL DO FOR YOU\n·Help you understand most of the online money making methods\n·Encourage you to start a new venture\n·Give you new ideas to monetize your existing business\n·Be an informative and entertaining experience\nDON’T BELIEVE ME?\nFine….\nIf in 30 days you don’t get all and more of the results I said, feel free to ask for a 100% refund.\nIt’s totally within Udemy’s refund policy. And I will ask it for you, that’s how sure I am of the quality and value of this course.\nBUT considering I have 5000+ students so far with 45 reviews with an average of 5 stars I think my word means more than an empty promise to you.\nWHAT THIS COURSE IS BASED ON\n·8+ years of advertising experience\n·Over $100.000 in yearly revenue from some of those strategies\n·At least $5.000 invested in each of those strategies\nTO SUMMARIZE\nWhat this course will do for you?\n·-help you understand how some online money making strategies work\n·-not waste $$$ of your own time\n·-monetize better your own website\nWhat this course won’t do for you?\n·-make you an overnight millionare\nBesides following the lectures, taking notes, you have to PRACTICE. And you won’t have to do it alone.\nYou can ask me anything in the discussions section.\nI offer constant support along the way.\nI answer all questions within the same day to all my courses (Facebook, Twitter, Copywriting). (Weekends as well…yes I am a workaholic).\nSo whenever you feel stuck, want feedback or just need a push in the right direction feel free to reach out.\nALSO, I MADE IT EASY FOR YOU\nI put a lot of effort in creating video animations so you will find this easy to follow and remember because of the fun and relevant visuals.\nAlso you have additional resources in case you want to become even better at some of the topics covered.\nPrint ready snapshots of the lectures that you can easily look at without having to scroll through the full videos.\nAnd quizzes that you can take and solidify your understanding of the principles and concepts of copywriting.\nSeriously NOW? What are you waiting for?\nThis is a no risk shot at making more money promoting what you love!\nSo either click TAKE THIS COURSE at the top right of this page or continue to accept standard results. It’s Your Choice.\nSincerely (and hopefully not too blunt),\nDoru Catana\nPS: I really care about the quality of my courses and put a lot of work in research, formatting and also design (that’s why I publish one every few months) but what I do care even more about is getting people across the finish line and getting them to take action. So if you really want to get better at copywriting, I honestly encourage you to take this course.",

      "description": "With the ever evolving dynamics of the Amazon marketplace, it's getting more and more competitive and challenging to sell profitably, therefore, going for more obscure and \"unpopular\" product research methods will increase your odds for success as a new seller. In 2025, doing product research the old way, low reviews/ low competition is a recepie for failure. Why you may ask? Because thousands of new sellers, like yourself, have their eyes on the exact same niches because they all use Helium 10 or Jungle Scout and they all input the same criteria, so the all pretty much see the same results.  This is probably the most important course on FBA you will ever take as I will introduce to you a process called \"Product Selection Funnel\" which you can use to run all your product ideas through and tip the scale to your favor. You will also learn 4 advanced product selection approaches that I have used for either my own 7-figure a year FBA business or clients' FBA businesses:\n1) High Volume/Low Price Products\n2) Low-Mid Volume/High Price Product\n3) High Volume/High Price Product\n4) Seasonal Products (all-year-round)\nAs always, my courses are based on tons of real world examples and this course is no exception. In addition, I'd like to emphasize that there are no hard rules or guarantees that the product you pick will succeed. Many factors come into play, a successful product is like a cocktail of competitive advantages, rather than criteria. A good foundation for your success cocktail is high demand, high profit margins, unique selling point (design, price, product count etc.)\nLove,\nJordan Minh",

      "description": "The 1Mby1M Methodology is based on case studies. In this course, Sramana Mitra shares the tribal knowledge of tech entrepreneurs by giving students the rare seat at the table with the entrepreneurs, investors and thought leaders who provide the most instructive perspectives on how to build a thriving business. Through these conversations, students gain access to case studies exploring the alleys of entrepreneurship. Sramana’s synthesis of key learnings and incisive analysis add great depth to each discussion.\nIn the post Covid world, e-commerce is growing at a furious pace and it will continue to grow. Today, small merchants no longer open shops on main streets and downtowns. They start e-commerce sites.\nThis trend is here to stay.\nIn this course, I want to discuss some of the best practices, talk to a lot of e-commerce entrepreneurs about what’s working and what’s to be replicated, explore some of the trends, and address the common errors.\nFirst, basic startup methodology needs to be learned. I’ve offered numerous courses on Udemy in which this is addressed categorically. Please don’t look for repeats of those in this course.\nFor example, e-commerce is a very popular category for solo entrepreneurs. You should look in my Solo Entrepreneur course for specifics on that topic. Bootstrapping with a Paycheck is used extensively by e-commerce entrepreneurs. I have a separate course on that topic. Two-sided e-commerce marketplaces have become a very big trend. I cover that elsewhere in a separate course, not in this one.\nIn this course, we look at how new merchants can start e-commerce ventures. Also, we look at how e-commerce merchants already doing business can grow into larger businesses.\nOn the latter, I want you to be familiar with my Web 3.0 framework. I really believe that impressive businesses can be built by thinking of e-commerce not as a pure store, but as an integrated web experience. I have covered this topic here in some depth.\nOn customer acquisition, you will find some overview points but not instructions on how to run Facebook advertising. There are many other places you can learn that, and yes, you do need to learn that to run a successful e-commerce business. The same applies for Google SEO and PPC campaigns. You need to know how to run those.\nThe notion of Channels is simple: you have to start somewhere. You can start on Shopify, or Amazon, or eBay, or Etsy, or elsewhere. But, you will soon discover that e-commerce today is a multi-channel game. As such, you’d need to understand how to operate on multiple channels simultaneously. That creates complexities such as inventory management, order tracking, etc. There are software systems to manage those issues.\nLet’s get going.\nThe 1Mby1M courses are all heavily based on interview-based case studies on Innovation, Business Models, Go To Market Strategies, Validation Principles, and various other nuances of an entrepreneur's journey. We offer extensive opportunities for entrepreneurs to learn the lessons from the trenches from successful entrepreneurs who have done it before and Investors who support their ambition.",

      "description": "★ JOIN MORE THAN 9,000 STUDENTS WHO HAVE LEARNED HOW TO CREATE AND RUN A PROFESSIONAL DROPSHIPPING STORE USING WOOCOMMERCE\n\n\nHave you been thinking to start your dropshipping or eCommerce store, but you didn't know where to start? Are you tired of a regular 9 to 5 job and you have a burning desire to start your own business? If the answer is yes, that means you came to the right place because I'm here to help you!\n\n\nI've been there, and I know how frustrating it can be. I remember when I started my first WooCommerce website, and I didn't know anything. It took me three years of trial and error until I was satisfied with the way my eCommerce stores look. During this time I tested different hosting providers, premium themes, search engine optimization techniques, and website optimization methods. Now I know, what works the best and I'm confident that I can teach you how to create a professional WooCommerce store.\n\n\n★★★★★\nStudent review by Ewelina Kuczmanska, “Amazing! Finally what I was looking for! Great Teacher :) Highly recommended!”\n\n\n★★★★★\nStudent review by Anthony Guttadauro, “Very easy to follow with no-nonsense fluff. Straight to the point. I learned a lot!”\n\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are a complete beginner or someone who has some prior knowledge of this subject. I will teach you everything I know, and you will learn valuable information that will help you to create a professional online store.\n\n\nI will start this WooCommerce course by explaining what is dropshipping and how it works. I understand that not everyone is on the same level, and at first, it can be a little bit confusing.\n\n\nIn later sections, I will teach you about the technical part of creating an eCommerce store. You will learn what is a domain name and hosting. I will show you how to set up your hosting plan, how to install WordPress and WooCommerce. Once you finish this part of the course, you will have enough knowledge to create your website from scratch.\n\n\nDid you know that WooCommerce runs on the WordPress platform?\n\n\nI will explain to you everything about these two platforms. You will learn how WordPress works, what are the most important settings, and how to install all needed plugins. I will teach you how to choose the right theme for your website and how to install it.\n\n\nIn WooCommerce section you will learn everything you need to know about this platform. I will show you how to set up payment gateways so your customers could pay by credit card or PayPal. Also, you will learn how to add shipping zones which will allow you to offer a free shipping method, or charge a flat rate for shipping.\n\n\nI will teach you how to add products manually to your website. It includes both simple and variable product types. I will explain to you how these types are different and how to use them. Also, I will show you how to optimize your products for Google search, which will help you to bring organic traffic to your WooCommerce store.\n\n\nIn this course for the demonstration, I will be using Flatsome theme. It is a highly customizable premium theme I use it on multiple websites. Two eCommerce stores could use the same theme and look completely different. I will show you how to work with it so you could easily create your brand identity.\n\n\nIf you will decide to create a dropshipping store and you will have some more money to invest you should get an Alidropship plugin. It will help you to import products and fulfill orders automatically. You will save tons of time, and you will get a cashback from Aliexpress, which is up to 12%. I will explain to you everything about this plugin, and I will show you how it works.\n\n\nLater I will teach you how to add your website to Google Search Console so you will be able to track any issues related to SEO, check backlinks to your website and more. I will show you how to add Google Analytics to your WooCommerce store you will be able to track visits, traffic sources, sales, and all other Analytics information.\n\n\nIf you are planning to run Facebook ads, I will teach you how to add a Facebook pixel to your website. Once you have done this, you will be able to run the conversion and retargeting ads.\n\n\nAfter finishing this course, you will know how to create a professional-looking WooCommerce store not just for yourself but for others as well.

      "description": "What is this course about? This course is a primer for using Stripe with PHP. It creates examples of using the Stripe provided Javascript based checkout forms for accepting bank cards. Then it covers the PHP processing of the charge of those cards. You use the Stripe dashboard to follow the charges to a payment to your account.\nVisual Step by Step eBooks Included! Often following along by video is not convenient. So every video in this course includes a page by a PDF eBook you can also use. The eBooks are full sized visuals you see in the videos.\nWho might find this course useful? This course is for those who are new to Stripe and prefer not to use documentation to learn. Keep in mind that Stripe provides many examples and documentation a competent PHP programmer could follow. So if you are that type of person, consider looking at that option before enrolling in this course. However if you want a laid back deep dive into the basics, this could be helpful to intermediate and higher level skilled developers.\nAre you ready to take this course? Students for this course are new to intermediate in their PHP, Javascript, JQuery, CSS and HTML skills. You are familiar with these technologies and have had some experience. This course will stay on the light side of their use but at the same time provide production quality solutions you can use in simple applications.\nWhy take this course? Ecommerce is an essential skill for all web developers using PHP. Often the hurdle of where to start is high for newcomers to eCommerce. Stripe is a well known platform and is being add into PHP sites everyday.

This means you can open up your own Amazon store, and sell well known everyday items to buyers all around the country!\nWhy Does Amazon Drop Shipping Work?\nPeople go straight to Amazon when they are ready to buy something. Amazon is the world's largest online retailer.\nPeople are just too busy or just don't know how to shop around online to find the best prices. So what do they do like everyone else? Go to Amazon!\nSell Anywhere Around The World!\nSince your \"store front\" is on the computer you can sell from anywhere around the world. You do not need to handle inventory or get inventory from suppliers. You can do your business anywhere! That is the luxury of this business, you are your own boss!\nNo Prior Experience Needed\nI thought all this e-commerce was just a unknown area where people say they make tons of money and just sell a program. I had bought THOUSANDS of dollars in courses from my minimum wage job that took me several years to save to be able to afford. Then I found my niche in amazon dropshipping. By month 3, I had quit my job, yes, month 3. By month 7, I had made my first 6 figures profit. So, instead of you having to put in the years of work, instead of you having to account for the tens of thousands of lost dollars I have used for trial and error to see what works, and instead of you having to go through every single hardship I had to go through personally while working two jobs and going to school. I have created a step by step bulletproof program that over 470+ of my students have gone through to see the results they are able to see, even within the same week of joining the course.",

I was so excited I showed all my friends the sales receipt, some haters (you, George) didn't even believe that someone would buy the silly hip-hop designs I had made from commercial-free fonts online. Fast forward a year later, 2014, I just sold my 1,000th product on Redbubble, a purple t shirt with my FRESH logo on it. I was so happy, and even more happy my FRESH logo happened to be on this shirt.\nI had my art on a TON of sites. Out of all the sites, Redbubble got the most sales for my art. Over time, with my interest in SEO and writing good copy, I dialed in a Redbubble-specific strategy to sell more artwork. At the time I write this, I have over 11,000 sales, (Now 15k+) having sold at-least-something every day since Nov 2013.\n\nThis course shows you specific strategies to dominate Redbubble.\nI will introduce you to a formula of your success, and how to manipulate the variables, like views & conversions, through easy and targeted strategies. We will talk about your profile, collections, activity, titles, descriptions and tags, and more. We will discuss the good, better, and best ways to promote your art for free online. No spending money on ads. Just search engine traffic generating consistent sales.\nI look forward to sharing these strategies with you. I get great joy seeing others be as excited as I was when I started selling my art.

Either way it takes more than just creating a shop, adding a product or two, and then wait for the sales to pour in. In this definitive course on Etsy you will learn everything from how to create and open a shop, choosing the proper name for your shop, do's and don't, fast and easy shipping techniques, and what I've done to run a successful Etsy business for nearly a decade now.\nIf you happen to be crafty, artistic, a great baker, sell vintage items or like to build things with your own bare hands you can sell your creations in your very own online shop. Etsy has made it possible for creative people to run their own home based business based on their love and passion for arts, crafts, and baked goods. They also let you sell antique and vintage items as well. The best part is that they will handle all transactions saving you from the hassle.\nMy name is Mike Burke and I run a successful Etsy shop. My products are well loved by many from all around the world and now I am going to teach you everything I learned from A to Z! No stone will be left unturned as we will break down each aspect and detail of running an Etsy shop.\nWe will go through the registration process, naming your shop, creating your products, processing orders, protecting your business, shipping, legal issues, store policies, and all the way to growing your business for more revenue. I'll teach you an amazing tip about sharing your own personal story that can dramatically increase your sales. You will also learn tips for marketing and advertising so that your products and shop can be found even when you are starting out.\nMy approach to teaching is through video in a one to one format. When needed I will also show you live examples from the Etsy website and my own shop. Each lecture covers just one topic full of informative details as well as my own personal stories and experiences related to my own home based business and Etsy shop. I have well over 25 years of experience in front of and behind the camera. I speak clearly with passion and energy. The videos are well lit with broadcast quality sound. Average running time is 5 minutes however there are some 10 to 15 minute long videos as well. You will find printable documents included to help serve as a guide as you take this course and build your Etsy shop. Activity work sheets are also included, printable resource booklets for each section, and as a special thank you for taking my course you can download every lesson in an MP3 audio format. Finally, you will find that at the end of certain sections there will be a quiz. These quizzes are designed to test you on the most important information from each section and lecture.\nEtsy can change your life and give you an opportunity to be free from any boss for the rest of life. By the time you finish the last lecture in this course you will be ready to build your very own Etsy shop with ease or if you currently have a shop you will learn some new things you didn't know to help increase your revenue.

The course shows what is possible with the Microsoft .NET libraries, and what additional features are available by using the third party Saxonica .NET libraries.  You will learn how to create and understand XSD Schemas, and how to validate an XML file against a schema.\nThe programming languages covered as they relate to XML are C#, PowerShell, and T-SQL.  You will learn how to read and write XML, and how to navigate and find elements and values in the XML, and how to modify the XML (for example, adding new elements or new attributes).\n\nIn Microsoft SQL Server, you will learn 1) how to use XML columns, 2) how to format relational data as XML using the \"For XML\" clause, and 3) how to take an XML file and query it in SQL, then store it into relational tables.\nThe course includes the most popular tools used on Windows platforms, including Visual Studio, NotePad++, VSCode, and XMLNotePad.",

There are tips on how to write better and ensure your clients get what they want. There are even book suggestions and copywriting tools for those who want to go deeper.\n\nWho is This For?\nIf you've heard about freelance copywriting and want to give it a try, then this is for you. If you just want to learn just enough to get started and grow fast, then you're in the exact right place because all of my courses are designed to get you up and running as fast as humanly possible without wasting time on B.S. that doesn't lead to results.\n\nIf any of that sounds like what you need, scroll up and enroll in this course today!\n\nSee you inside!\n\nYour Instructor,\nLex DeVille",

      "description": "Create a winning business using Amazon FBA in 2023. Tap into almost 20 years of experience from an Amazon FBA expert and successful entrepreneur.\n\nThis Amazon FBA course will enable you to start a business and take your business to the next dimension and more importantly avoid the pitfalls that force 99% of Amazon FBA sellers to fail or never reach their potential.\nIf you haven't already heard about the need to understand Amazon A9, Register a trademark, A+ content, Amazon Launchpad, Amazon Review funnel, etc you are already getting bad advice and setting yourself up for failure. If you want to dominate your Amazon category, taking this course is your first step in the right direction. Isn't it time you learned from the best?\n\nWho is this Amazon FBA Course For?\n\nBeginners and New to Amazon? I’ll show you how to properly plan, structure, find products and suppliers, build brands, and create a massively scalable profitable Amazon. You cannot start a business from poor advice or people who haven't successfully created and ran a successful business.\n\nI'll show you how to quickly build a massively profitable Amazon business following a fine-tuned roadmap containing EVERYTHING you need to know!\n\nAlready Selling On Amazon? I'll show you step by step traffic, rankings, and sales overnight as well as implementing proven strategies to explode your long term sales.\nWhether you are a new amazon seller or an existing one, the complete information and worksheets in this Amazon FBA course will guide you step by step through the entire process. You will also have access to me personally to answer any questions or guide you through any problem you may experience.\n\nThis Amazon FBA course not only covers the basics such as supplier searches, inventory ordering, marketing and promotion, packaging and premium branding... list building, external traffic sources, etc, but it also provides you with the blueprints to grow and scale your business and take your brand to the next levels.\nThis Amazon FBA course is a process, it is not a get rich quick scheme. This blueprint will allow your business to grow across multiple amazon marketplaces and even into retail giants if you wish. What limits most Amazon FBA to low monthly sales and no business growth is how they start. Starting without access to the right mentor means your business will never scale and you will lose hundreds of thousands of potential sales.\n\nWho is Your Mentor and Why You Should Choose Me to Help Build Your Amazon FBA Business?\nMy name is Thomas O'Donoghue, my track record is proven and available for all to see. If you can name it I’ve done it. Over the last 20 years, I’ve founded, built, and sold multiple companies, brands, and products. I’ve even had competitors buy my product and business out. The products I’ve created and built, are not just successful on Amazon, but also sit in shops such as Walmart, Costco, etc. These products are successful because of the blueprint I follow. I leave nothing to chance and any product I create has massive potential and can and will go toe to toe with the best in their category. I have no doubt many of you have or will in the future buy products I’ve created. The methods and techniques I use to ensure the results.\n\nBuilt three 7-figure/year businesses in media and sport\nCreated multiple brands with 6-figure annual sales on Amazon\nSuccessfully scaled multiple businesses from Amazon to retail stores such as Costco, Walmart, and secured nationwide and international distribution agreements on all brands dramatically increasing sales and profit margins.\nI’ve purchased domains in excess of $5000 to tap into search traffic and created almost 50 trademarks\nWhat I Do Not Do or Encourage on this Amazon FBA Course\nWhat I do not do is waste time doing is dropshipping, affiliate programs, selling products for Ali Express, etc. I do not focus on selling one product, while that's ok for starting off only and learning, your plan needs to be better. I do not focus on the \"50 hottest selling products on Amazon\". Do you remember the Fidget Spinner? Do you have any idea of how many people invested life savings into buying these type products to sell on Amazon and lost everything? The failure rate is 90%+ for a very good reason. The only people making money here are suppliers.\n\nThese all quick get rich schemes which will never generate real profit for you and never create a business. I would never work on any project that cannot be scaled or that puts everything down to hope. Nor do I waste time thinking I cannot be a top category Amazon FBA seller. Perhaps I will enter a category as a newcomer, but my intention is always to dominate that category in 12 months and I’ll show you exactly how to do this with my proven step by step blueprint to success.\n\n\nMy Failures and What I Learned in the Process\nAside from reward I also know risk and failure. Of course, there have been many problems along the way and I’ve learned from each of them and grown. I’ve had businesses that never reached the goals I had set, partnerships that failed, and sales and distribution agreements that fell apart and products that never were brought to market where €250,000 had been invested not to mention time. I’ve learned not to rely on one avenue of revenue and to understand Amazon is just a sales channel, a great one, and invaluable for learning.\nYou can imagine that after 20 years in the business I’ve seen a lot. It is this very experience and understanding which allows me to steer you in the right direction. Added to that I’ve years teaching experience in entrepreneurship and have guided many many businesses to success with the same blueprint I’ll be showing you. I’ll help you use data to make decisions which dramatically will increase your chances of succeeding.\n\n\nOther Amazon FBA Courses\nI am an Amazon expert when it comes to finding opportunities, creating brands, finding suppliers, and generating Amazon sales. Of course, there are many Amazon FBA courses out there for creating Amazon FBA business. I would charge three times the price of the most expensive one out there because I know the value of my Amazon FBA course.\n\nHowever, you won’t hear them talking about processes and procedures, planning documents, management systems, trademark registration, Brand Identity, Amazon A+, Amazon EBC, Amazon Early Reviewer, Amazon A9b strategy, Amazon Startup program, Amazon Vine, etc. They have never been to the top levels of Amazon. What's more is that none of the above is difficult or costly, and I’ll bring you to step by step through it all. You’ll see a lack of experience shows by taking shortcuts, missing knowledge, talking about logos, cheat sheets and magic strategies, etc, and missing the big picture play. Did you know Amazon has its own internal search engine as such called A9 which requires its own SEO? Therefore product page optimization is crucial for sales velocity. Succeeding on Amazon is about understanding business and how Amazon functions at its core and applying the right strategy to succeed. Amazon is easy when the plan is right. Wrong plan, wrong result. By all means, search the contents of all Amazon FBA courses on this platform.\nWhy the gaps? This is because they have never in reality grown or scaled a business properly on Amazon. Sure some may have had 6 figure sales, but what were the expenses and why did the business not grow to 7 figures? My businesses constantly grow because that was the plan.\n\nIf the foundation of any house is not right, the building will fall, if the plan is not right, how do you move forward? The point here is simple, if you start on the wrong foot you will never grow your business to the full potential. Plan your business and product growth maps and your house will become an estate. The work effort will not change, but results will. The question is whether you want to spend time working on a process that will work or something that will limit your success.\n\nAmazon FBA Course - Platform for Business Success\nThe success of any business is not simply down to its execution, it's down to the quality of the plan and its execution and understanding when to take corrective action. It is a fact and not a view, that most businesses fail not on execution but on planning. Wasting hours executing a plan will not work if the plan is not based on a solid strategy, planning, techniques, and experience.\nMy blueprint will ensure you are properly set up to avail of every opportunity on Amazon, fighting for scrapes is simply not the way to build a business, simply because you received bad advice starting off. Worksheets, videos, lessons, and case studies are all provided to literally walk you through the process and ensure you get the right advice and take the right actions.\n\nWhy You Should Take this Amazon FBA Course in 2023\nIf you can relate to any of these three statements, then this Amazon FBA course is the only course you’ll ever need an opportunity to take the success you deserve.\nYou already sell on Amazon and want to increase profits or expand your business\nYou want to create your first business and grow sales and scale\nYou want to take your business onto the Amazon platform\nYou wish to generate a full-time employment position where you can work from anywhere\nYou wish to create a passive income using Amazon FBA\n\nThe blueprint I’m providing you will offer you the chance to make the right decision when starting your business and guarantee you the opportunity to create multiple revenue streams online and offline. You will set your Amazon FBA business up to dominate the marketplace, customers will love your business and you will have a following of screaming fans.\nYou will develop a rock-solid plan for your business, built with data and knowledge, and that the plan will succeed once it is executed. You will use tracking documents provided by this Amazon FBA course to identify goals, objectives, and tasks required to bring you to step by step through the process.\n\nWhat's Included in the Amazon FBA Course\nProven step-by-step blueprint to build a successful Amazon FBA Business\nLessons from a mentor with a proven track record\n10+ hours of video content\nQuestion and Answer opportunities with me personally\nDedicated action steps at the end of each phase\nTemplates to get you organized\nTemplates to evaluate options for suppliers, products, etc\nTemplates for planning goals, objectives and task management\nTemplates for process documenting\nReal-world case studies\nWinning product and sales optimization techniques\nYour blueprint to a successful Amazon business contains the roadmap to bring you step-by-step from start to finish. Isn't it time you took the next step?",

(Lecture 26)\n• Confusing terms like \"DDP\", \"freight forwarders\", \"duties\", \"tariffs\" and more DEMYSTIFIED. (Lectures 20 - 24)\n• Gain INSTANT negotiation leverage with this secret hack! (Lecture 13)\n• Amazon FBA shipping plan walkthrough tutorials. (Lectures 29 - 30)\n• Insider method for getting your product samples 100% FREE. (Lecture 15)\n• Spot FAKE Alibaba supplier like a pro! (Lecture 5)\n• Best FREE app for communicating with Alibaba suppliers (HINT: It's NOT Whatsapp). (Lecture 6)\n• Simple trick to communicate ANYTHING you want with ANY supplier in ANY language. (Lecture 9)\n• Partner with PREMIUM North American suppliers WITHOUT using Thomasnet. (Lecture 14)\n• Fully protect yourself before wiring THOUSANDS of dollars overseas. (Lecture 31)\n• Incredible tools &  tips to help you manage and expand your e-commerce business. (Lectures 33-35)\n• So much more!\n\n\nWhy do we (Sumner and Ali) have a single ounce of credibility to teach this topic?\n\n\nFirst of all we are actual Amazon Sellers who have successfully created, manufactured, and shipped HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars worth of profitable products from Alibaba to Amazon FBA over the past 3 years.\n\n\nSecondly, we’ve helped literally HUNDREDS of students cut costs, save HOURS of stress & headache, avoid countless COSTLY mistakes, and ultimately create, produce & ship premium products at rock bottom prices.\n\n\nDon’t take our word for it though!\n\n\nHere are just a few raving fans created by this very course…\n\n\n“I’m usually not big on leaving reviews but I honestly couldn't believe a class like this was on here! I was really close to purchasing one of those (probably overpriced) Amazon FBA courses but this class included everything I was still so unsure about in such a perfect and clear way! It's literally a step-by-step class that just doesn't leave anything unclear. So happy I watched this!” - Steff S\n\n\n“Hi Sumner! Thank you for sharing with us what you learned first hand over the years selling on Amazon. Your explanations were concise (which is good) but at the same time very detailed, and they helped me a lot to better understand the whole shipping process, which for me was a bit messy at the beginning. I really liked the fact that you always gave your advice about everything, because, for one like me who is new to all these kinds of things, starting with a concrete plan of action is definitely better than starting blind. Thank you for the material you provide us too! The \"purchase order agreement\" template and the “AMZ Escape Plan FBA Feild Guide” pdf will be very helpful! So great job man! Keep it up!” - Andrea S\n\n\n“Thank you Sumner! This was an excellent intro for me into this world of sourcing Chinese suppliers. My number one concern was picking the correct shipping methods... DDP, FOB, etc... and shipping options. This quick overview was great for someone like me that has rarely dared to source outside of a customs union. (I'm in the EU) I HIGHLY recommend this course for anyone thinking of either sourcing from china, or starting an FBA relationship. Thanx again!!” - Peter G\n\n\n“Sumner is a great teacher who lays down everything in simple terms so anyone that has no knowledge in international business can easily catch up on. Recommended for anyone who wants to learn about doing business internationally and does no limit to being an Amazon Seller.” - Mike W\n\n\n“Excellent Sumner. Thanks so much for the detailed information. Very helpful! I will be watching again probably a couple more times as I go through the process.”- Mary L\n\n\n“If other Amazon FBA teachers went in-depth like this, then new comers will make less mistakes.” - Kingsley K\n\n\n“Excellent step-by-step guide. Very clear instructions and very motivational!” - Maggie C\n\n\nBy the end of this course you are going to learn how to…\n\n\n• Find trusted suppliers fast (and free).\n• Produce the highest quality products ON THE PLANET for the best possible price (from scratch).\n• Fastest, safest & cheapest ways to ship your products from China (or other parts of the world) to Amazon FBA.\n• Confusing terms & important laws demystified & simplified.\n• So much more!\n\n\nBONUS: For students who enroll today you will ALSO receive exclusive access to the Supplier Templates Vault which includes...\n\n\n• Alibaba Supplier RFQ.\n• Supplier Agreement Template\n• Pre-Made Shipping Labels\n• Inventory Management Table\n• And more!\n\n\nLOVE IT OR YOUR MONEY BACK: If this course doesn't change your life Udemy will refund your ENTIRE purchase amount within 30 days. NO questions asked.\n\n\nPretty low investment for saving you potentially HOURS of time & stress and THOUSANDS of dollars, right?\n\n\nENROLL NOW and get every single thing that YOU NEED to create, produce, & ship the highest quality products on the planet at the lowest possible prices today!\n\n\nP.S.

The reality is most of us are not graphic designers, and if we were to create an e-commerce shop design, it would most likely look ugly. So how do you get around this roadblock? The secret is to find seems that have already been created for e-commerce sites that either fit your target market or it is close enough that you can customize it a little bit further. You'll learn which sites we recommend you going to find the e-commerce design that you're looking for.\nVideo #3: General Settings Overview\n\nNow that you have a good idea of where to get your e-commerce website design, it's time to look under the hood and go over the General settings of the WooCommerce plug-in. Well, there are a lot of settings, we will go over every single one of them step-by-step.\n\nVideo #4: Product Settings Overview\n\nNow that we have gone over the General settings, it's time to look at the product settings, which will allow you to add specific products to your e-commerce site.

They are simply variations or customization of the same product.\n\n\nVideo #7: Expansion\n\nOnce you have your site set up and the basics complete, it's time to expand. What we mean by this is how do you grow your options, perhaps, maybe you want to create your monthly subscription, or a membership site, or something that is beyond the core plug-in.Video\n#8: WooCommerce Automation\n\nNow it's time to make your life a lot easier by automating the cord plug-in. Let's say, for example, that every time someone purchases in your e-commerce store, you want to do something specific such as adding them to an email list, or a Google spreadsheet, or emailing them something specific. Regardless of what it is in this video, we are going to teach you how to automate it using a few third party services.",

      "description": "There is only one profession on earth where you can earn more than a doctor—using only your laptop— with less than six hours of training: dropshipping. Without the need to handle inventory, this business model is incredibly scalable, yet simple enough to be easily learned by beginners. This course will teach you everything you need to know to take a store to five figure days and beyond.\nMy name is David Hanlin, aka the Laptop Legend, and I'm an e-commerce expert who runs more than a half a dozen online stores generating up to $25,000+ a day. I've perfected a simple, step-by-step, repeatable method for creating profitable online stores from scratch, with no prior experience. Want proof? Feel free to look me up on TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube @thelaptoplegend. I post my profits there pretty much daily—unlike the rest of the gurus in this industry who make 98% of their money from selling courses.\nCreate A Life-Changing E-Commerce Business With AliExpress Dropshipping\nUnderstand the Necessary Mindset\nCreate a Brand, Logo, and Highly Converting Website\nResearch, Source, and Import Winning Products\nTest Products, Scale, and Retarget with Facebook Ads\nRecover Lost Sales With Text, Email, and Google Ads\nHire Valuable Employees To Your Team\nIncrease Your Margins With Affiliate Programs\nTravel The World For Free With Rewards From Business Expenses\nOvercome the Issues Nobody Else Warns You About\nGenerate Passive Income From Anywhere in the World With an Online Business\nThe dropshipping business model has been around for a few years now, and a lot of people claim that because of this, it's too competitive or \"saturated\" to make a profit. The reality is, the global e-commerce market sees over $25 trillion in sales annually, so there's more than enough business to go around. You just need to stand out above the competition.\nSince there are so many people in the dropshipping space, the amount of information is overwhelming, and it can be difficult to determine what is reliable. With my course, you will have the exact same system that has taken every single one of my stores to massive profitability. Like clockwork.\n\nCourse Content and Overview\nAll encompassing, this course is designed for you if you're brand new to dropshipping, if you've already tried it but haven't succeeded, and even if you've already seem some success but want to take it to the next level. It's filled to the brim with 99+ lectures including live walkthroughs, a plethora of helpful outside resources, downloadable files, and much more.\nWe start with the intro to dropshipping, discussing the mindset required to be successful, why it's such a great business model for new entrepreneurs, and the alternative option of print on demand.\nNext, we dive into the \"nitty gritty,\" or the backend setup of the store, including apps, logo, domains, email hosting, setting up an LLC, getting a business phone number and address, legal policies, shipping zones, and everything else necessary to get your website up and running.\nAfter that, I walk you through exactly how to design your website to convert customers at a high rate, covering website theme, menus, home page, stock photos, product page, and more.\nWe then dive into product research, and I explain what makes a winning product, where to find it, and how to import it directly into your store with the click of a button.\nThe following section goes into detail about every single one of the issues that I've encountered in my dropshipping journey and how to overcome them. Nobody else will even mention these issues—I will show you exactly how to overcome them.\nThen, it's on to ads—how to design a clean looking advertisement, how to set up the campaigns on Facebook, who to target, how to scale up and spend $1000s a day on a single ad set profitably, how to analyze the data, how to create custom and lookalike audiences, and more.\nCredit and outsourcing are discussed next, and then it's retargeting—autopilot Google ads, automatic retargeting flows for email and text messages that get an incredible return on ad spend (ROAS).\nLastly, we discuss the future. How to run a portfolio of stores, how to sell your stores for large payouts, and how to invest the money that you earn into other business ventures.",

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to the “Amazon FBA Course: How to Sell on Amazon with Tight Budget” course.\nSales Tactics in Amazon FBA, Amazon SEO (A9), Giveaway, Amazon PPC (Amazon Ads) campaign in details for Amazon Seller\n\nAmazon FBA is a great way to launch a successful business from home. Oak Academy features courses taught by entrepreneurs and business professionals alike that will show you how to set up and make money with your FBA account right away, even if your starting budget is small.\nAlthough I have no experience with Amazon FBA, I feel a lot more comfortable after taking this course. I am currently a paralegal that is searching for the freedom to live a less hectic lifestyle. I have just purchased a product that I am excited to test out and look forward to sharing the results.\nStarting an Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) account is a great way to eliminate some of the annoying logistics associated with running your own home business. Rather than source, package, and ship products yourself, Amazon takes care of the hassle by storing and then fulfilling your orders for you.\nWhat is Amazon FBA?\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a service Amazon offers its third-party sellers. Using FBA, sellers send their goods to one of Amazon’s fulfillment centers, and Amazon ships the items to the customer. Customers who buy FBA products usually get their items rather quickly. When an item sells, employees pick and pack the order and it leaves the warehouse shortly after the sale. Amazon’s shipping partners, including the USPS, work hard to ensure timely delivery. Even companies that don’t deliver on Sundays will ship FBA products seven days a week. It’s fairly simple to use FBA. Sellers must contact Amazon after they prepare their listings. They provide several details, including product information and the quantity they plan on sending. Amazon tells the seller where to send the shipment and they handle deal it from there.\nIs Shopify better than Amazon?\nSelling on Shopify using Amazon’s FBA service requires a different mindset than selling on Amazon with FBA. Other than in a few specialty categories, Amazon’s referral fees range between 8% and 17% of the sale amount. People who sell on Shopify try to avoid these fees, but there’s a reason why people gladly pay Amazon’s referral fees. Amazon attracts buyers from around the world to its platform, while Shopify sellers have to do their own marketing to sell their products. Shopify sellers also aim to build a brand without being subject to Amazon’s regulations. For example, Amazon does not allow its sellers to contact buyers. Many people feel that engaging customers is the best way to grow a business. Each of the platforms has its advantages, but people who want to list items without having to market them should definitely sell on Amazon.\nShould I Sell on Amazon or Ebay?\neBay and Amazon have distinct platforms. Deciding which one to use depends on your goals and what you're looking to sell. Amazon, in general, has a much higher sales volume than eBay. Many sellers choose Amazon because they feel they could earn more money there. While this is true in a lot of cases, some items do perform better on eBay. Amazon is the more restrictive of the two, so there are some products that you can only sell on eBay. For example, Amazon doesn’t allow used clothing sales. For many products, you need preauthorization before you sell them on Amazon. eBay has fewer guidelines for creating listings. If you only plan on selling a few pieces of each item, you might want to stick with eBay. Either way, both Amazon and eBay are great options for most sellers.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because sellers who use Amazon com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse. Not only does this take the packing and shipping burden off your shoulders, but it also means you can offer Prime shipping to those 200 million Amazon Prime members — who on average spend over 4 times as much as non-Prime shoppers.\nUsing FBA also means Amazon takes responsibility for any problems that arise during shipping, like late shipments, damaged items, or other issues. Your reputation as a seller doesn't take a hit.\nSo Wondering how to sell on Amazon? Do you already have a brand and products, but do you want to learn how to start an Amazon FBA business?\nIn this course, we explained the topics and tactics of selling on Amazon. We discussed the Amazon A9 Algorithm in all its details and explained the working logic of the system. We explained the Product Launch, Giveaway, and PPC Ads Campaign together on a sample product step by step. Many people have changed their jobs through our course and consultancy support and are still successful sellers on Amazon.\nTake your place in Amazon FBA Business.\nYou'll also get:\n● Lifetime Access to The Course\n● Fast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\n● Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now “How to Sell on Amazon with Tight Budget” course\nSales Tactics in Amazon FBA, Amazon SEO (A9), Giveaway, Amazon PPC (Amazon Ads) campaign in details for Amazon Seller\n\nAmazon fba\namazon fba course\nfba amazon\namazon fba private label\namazon fba wholesale\nAmazon fba product research\namazon fba canada\nfree amazon fba\namazon private label\nAmazon\nWe offer full support, answering any questions regarding Amazon FBA Course: How to Sell on Amazon with Tight Budget course\nSee you in the course!",

Well t-shirts are definitely one of the absolutely most popular ones. T-shirts are worn by newborns through old age, by males and females throughout the world. They are worn under clothing, as a fashion statement, and to replace pajamas.\n\nThere is one essential piece of clothing that everyone has in their closet no matter who they are. Whether a multimillionaire, a psychiatrist or a mechanic.\n\nEveryone owns at least one T-shirt T-shirts were made popular as everyday garments by returning GIs from World War II, but they gained extreme popularity in the Hollywood of the 1950s because actors like James Dean started wearing them on screen.\nFrom there, the popularity of the T-shirt exploded and over the next few decades, a T-shirt became a means of self-expression advertising a person’s favorite bands, political affiliations or product brands and the popularity of the T-shirt in its myriad of colors and designs shows absolutely no signs of slowing down.\nIf you’re still struggling to bring in the big bucks online, then please read on because this very moment could be the turning point of your life.\n\nI created this course because I wanted to help struggling marketers that wanted to learn T-Shirt marketing sell more shirts!\n\nWhich means using marketing and creation platforms such as Teespring and Sunfrog  can provide the perfect opportunities to make money in the T-shirt business online.

So you will always build the find a buyer. Regardless of the style or design and Teespring and/or Sunfrog can help you tap into this ever-growing and loyal marketplace.\nTeespring and Sunfrog  are online T-shirt creation and sales platforms that allow users to create and market T-shirts at no to very little cost.\nThe way they do this is by allowing users to create a T-shirt design and then market it to potential customers and once a given sales goal has been reached, for example, 500 T-shirts.\nThose T-shirts are then printed and shipped to the customer directly or they can be delivered to the user that created them so they can either ship them themselves or take them to a special event or gathering for delivery.\nIf, however, the 500 T-shirt sales goal is not reached, then the T-shirts are not printed or made thereby not costing the printing company or the user any money. The profit to be made from the sales and creation of the T-shirts comes from the percentage above cost, meaning that the user decides how much to charge for a T-shirt (the cost of creation will be calculated by the website) and anything after the cost of making the T-shirt is the profit for the user.\nSo if you think you have an eye for trends in fashion, or you can come up with an eye-catching design or slogan that people will want to buy, then you should try creating and selling T-shirts with Teespring or Sunfrog .\nAs these companies will allow you to get into the T-shirt business at no cost until you sell your product.

There are lot of features that many people over look or don't understand how to use.\nAfter covering the basics of how to read the charts and the plus and minus of each one, we move into case example on using charts in the real world and the thought process that I use when sourcing.\nIn the first example we show an example of how a very basic check of the charts would help to avoid a product sourcing error.\nThe next example show that sales rank is related to price and how high sales ranks are not always a bad thing.\nThe next example we look at is sourcing product out of season and how the charts can help us predict what the sales will be like when the product comes back into season.\nThe last example shows how to forecast sales of products that we might be sourcing wholesale or making large out of season purchases.  It shows also how to use the charts of similar products when you are bringing new products to market.\nThen the last thing we show is how to make it easier to access the charts when you are on a low budget and not using paid scanning apps.\nThis course show how to use charts for sourcing but more  importantly, it shows how to think like a full time FBA reseller like myself thinks and sources.",

The course consists of 29 videos that average around 10 minutes each. These videos are live screen shares of the exact processes I use to source products on a daily basis.\nThe videos are almost all based on sourcing from your computer, even though we may actually be getting product from retail stores. While the course does have some online arbitrage, it is generally using techniques that many sellers are not aware of. I won't be telling you to check Keepa 7 times a day or subscribe to a paid list.\nBy using the screen share method of teaching, it is like we are sitting down and working one on one through the different techniques. My goal is to teach you how a full time FBA seller is thinking when they have to find products.\nI have purposely left the normal \" beginner\" stuff out of the course as much as possible. I don't believe that it adds much value to the audience that I am trying to reach, so if you are wanting to learn how to list a product or open an Amazon account, this may not be the course for you.\nYou will learn how to think out of the box about sourcing and learn that there is better ways than scanning every item in a stores aisle.\nI don't expect you to do every single technique presented here, but by the time you have completed the course, you should expect to be able to build a list of replenishable items that you can count on for steady income.",

      "description": "MODULE 1: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nWelcome to Ryan's Method: Print on Demand Production Partners!\n\n\nIn this module you will be introduced to the POD ecosystem from the seller perspective.\n\n\nWe'll explain what production partners are & why they're critical in allowing sellers to focus on scaling their business, by outsourcing the tedious/repetitive work to companies that work on fulfillment for us.\n\n\nMODULE 2: PRINT ON DEMAND PRODUCTS\n\n\nThis module focuses on the various print on demand products that we're able to stock our shops with.\n\n\nThere's a very wide variety of potential products, but only you can decide what will be a good fit for your shop!\n\n\nSome of the more popular products that we'll specifically focus on include:\n\n\nSHIRTS / HOODIES\nHATS\nCOFFEE MUGS ☕\nJEWELRY\nSTICKERS\nALL-OVER PRINT PRODUCTS\n+ More!\n\n\nMODULE 3: PRINTFUL\n\n\nPartnering with a company like Printful is a necessity in most cases.\n\n\nThink about it: your alternative is either to leverage Printful & their technology + equipment to produce your orders - OR - do it all yourself.\n\n\nIf you're thinking long-term, you know the importance of scalability when it comes to any business model, and seldom do the words \"DIY\" & \"scalability\" belong together in the same sentence.\n\n\nWhat's cool about Printful's software is that:\n\n\nIt's very easy to setup\nIt gives sellers more control over their business than any Printful competitor that I've used to date\nIt's FREE!\n\n\nYou can integrate Printful with a bunch of major e-commerce platforms, and their engineers did such a great job that it can often be achieved in a mere few clicks.\n\n\nSome of the biggest ones include Amazon, Etsy, & Ebay + if you'd like to start your own website, you can use their Shopify, WooCommerce, Wix, Squarespace, integrations!\n\n\nMy personal preference is to leverage the web traffic of trusted names in e-commerce by selling on the large marketplaces:\n\n\nIf you haven't already, you should check it out! In this module I'll show you everything you need to know to succeed as a print on demand seller using Printful to fulfill orders.\n\n\nMODULE 4: PRINTIFY\n\n\nDid you know you can use more than 1 production partner at a time?\n\n\nThis opens the door to endless possibilities! For instance, you can pick between Printful, Printify, & any other production partner on a per-product basis based on things like fulfillment costs, color options, fulfillment times, & more!\n\n\nPrintify does have some edges at times over their top competitor (Printful): Printify products are often slightly less expensive than comparable Printful products.\n\n\nThat said, you do need to pay a monthly fee for \"Printify Premium\" in order to unlock the lowest prices possible.\n\n\nIn this module we dive into the analysis to figure out if it's worth upgrading.\n\n\nMODULE 5: GEARBUBBLE\n\n\nGearbubble offers two primary ways to make money selling print on demand products online.\n\n\nThe first is called Gearbubble Pro and refers to the side of their platform that is in direct competition with platforms like Shopify, where you can launch an entire website with shopping cart functionality, and you will most likely need to buy paid traffic in order to drive sales.\n\n\nThe second is their ecommerce platform integrations, where you can connect your Amazon, ebay, and Etsy stores via API to have them automatically fulfill your orders to your customers\n\n\nIn this module I'll be reviewing the latter, where we use their integrations to sell print on demand products on some of the worlds largest online marketplaces (Amazon, Etsy, Ebay), because I'm more a fan of appealing to customers where they already shop instead of attempting to coerce them into purchasing from our newly launched online store.\n\n\nMODULE 6: ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION PARTNERS\n\n\nEach year a number of additional print on demand production partners seemingly spring up overnight.\n\n\nThe truth is that many of these companies have existed for years (if not decades), but lacked the foresight of developing integrations that allowed for sellers like you & I to \"hook\" into using their service for automated fulfillment.\n\nAutomation = scalability = absolutely critical to our print on demand businesses long-term success.\n\n\nThat said, the companies we'll be looking at in this module all need to be on your radar for various reasons, but are lacking in one way or another when compared to the \"big 3\" (Printful/Printify/Gearbubble), hence placing them here in this module.",

      "description": "5 Years ago i was stuck in a 9 - 5 job, wondering what i was going to do with my life.\nI'd finished university and gone straight into full time work, it wasn't all bad but i was obsessed with the thought of having my own business.\nI got together with my now business partners (Sam & Ed) and we started brainstorming...\nOur first business venture was a giant fail, we'd spent our evenings and weekends working on a business that lost money in the first year.\nIt didn't work out but we had no regrets... We decided there and then that whatever it took we wouldn't stop until we were working for ourselves.\nSoon after this first failure we found the Amazon FBA (Private Label) business model.\nIt might sound cliche but it literally changed our lives, there is no doubt about that.\nWe wasted no time and within three months we'd launched our very own product (A Fruit Infuser Water Bottle).\nWithin weeks of launching we were making $100's a day! All whilst we were working our full time 9 - 5 jobs.\nYou see that's the beauty of the Amazon FBA business model, they do all the heavy lifting whilst you are off doing whatever you need to do.\nIt's really simple:\nStep 1) Find a profitable product with low levels of competition\n\nStep 2 Build a customer focused brand around that product\nStep 3) Find a trustworthy supplier and start building on the relationship\nStep 4) The product is sent directly to Amazon's warehouse fulfillment network (FBA stands for fulfilled by Amazon)\nStep 5) Launch the product\nStep 6) Reinvest the profit & grow your private label brand\nYou see, we did this whilst all of us were working full time jobs... With the right work ethic you can do it too.\nThis course will show you exactly how we did it and how we still do it today...\nIf you want your own freedom, your own private label business, you need to learn from somebody that's actually been through it...\nThat my friend is where we come in.\nWe've sold over $2,000,000 worth of products on the Amazon platform.\nThis course will take you through each step of the process.\nBut be warned....\nThis is not some get rich quick scheme.\nYou are going to have to be willing to put in the work.\nWe aren't interested in building short-term businesses by breaking the rules.\nWe are interested in building real businesses by sticking to the rules...\nIf you are looking for a course to help you break the rules and Amazon's terms of service... you are in the wrong place.\nHowever, if you are willing to be patient & put in the hard work we can certainly help you.\nThis course will teach you how to build a valuable long term asset without breaking the rules.\nIf this sounds like something you are interested in get enrolled so we can get to work.\nI'll look forward to seeing you on the inside.\n\nNick\neBusiness Boss\n\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not affiliated or associated with Amazon in anyway.

      "description": "Dear Student,\nMy Course ‘Build a Fitness | Nutrition Online Business Working from Home’ is designed specifically for wellness professionals who not only wants to learn the skill of becoming financially successful in the Online Space but also find the exact work that they were ‘meant’ to do in the huge $4.2 Trillion Wellness Industry (value as off 2017) that provides them with meaning, satisfaction and happiness.\n\n\nPART-1: PASSIONS AND PURPOSE\n\n\nStarting with the first module, I’ll use The P3 Model to help you identify what your ‘True’ passions are.\nHowever, working on your passion is NOT enough, what you need is a Unique Purpose. A Life Purpose your Mission Statement.\n\nOnce you manage to zero down on your Unique Purpose (with the help of assignments provided in this course) life will not be the same for you.\n\nYour ‘Life Purpose’ will be the reason you’ll get up in the morning looking forward to the day.\nYour Life Purpose will be your ‘Mission Statement’ that will drive you and enable you to work super hard every day.\nYour Life Purpose will give you meaning and satisfaction to your work. It’ll make you feel good, it’ll make you happy.\nIt’ll be your guiding compass that allows you to steer in the right direction every day.\nIt’ll allows you to say ‘No’ easily to people or activities that are not taking you towards your ‘Mission Statement’.\n\nNeedless to say, your mission statement needs to be super specific and clearly defined. It’s not enough to say I want to ‘Help People’\nThis course is also specifically designed to help you build certain ‘Key’ and ‘Unique’ Mindset Principles that’ll help you to think ‘out of the box’.\nDale Carnegie once said:\n“85% of your financial success is due to your personality and your ability to communicate, negotiate and lead. Shockingly, only 15% is due to technical knowledge.”\nYour personality is a collection of your mindset, your attitude and your habits. I do strongly believe that it is these things that determines to a large extend whether you’ll be successful in your endeavor(s) or not!\nModule titled: 11 Unique Mindset Principles for Extra-Ordinary Success will help you with this.\nThere are dozens of niches and sub niches (even micro-niches) in the $4.2 trillion Wellness Industry! The Module Titled: Profitable Niches and Online Business Models will help you clearly categorise various niches and different online business models that will help you identify the right ones for yourself!\nFurthermore, I will provide elaborate examples of 11 Ultra-Successful Wellness Experts/Businesses in different niches employing different business models to further aid in your understanding and ultimately help you find your main work that provides your with meaning and satisfaction.\n\n\nPART-2: PROFITS\nMarketing\nSales\nSelf-Management\n\nIn the Module Titled: Marketing, I’ll teach you strategies that will help you reach out to millions of ‘hungry for knowledge’ audience with ‘Zero’ marketing budget. I'll teach you the fundamentals, and how to start building your brand and market yourself and position yourself a professional coach even if you don't have a dime to spend!\nI’ll also teach you the basics of blogging. We'll cover topics like:\nTo create your blog or not?\nIf yes then,\nHow to choose a name for your online business,\nHow to select the right domain,\nFiguring out Hosting\n& much more.....\nI’ll also go on and include how I become a successful Quora writer with 10,000+ followers and more than 13 million views in a very short time!\nFinally, I’ll end the Marketing module by telling you the mistakes I made that costed me $5,000+ and how you can avoid it too!\n\n\nWe’ll then move on to Sales. Marketing is all about telling the world that you and your company exists and how awesome it is! And when these people land up on your website, based on your ‘Unique Selling Skills’ that I’ll teach you in this module titled: Sales, you’ll end up making them your customer (most of them)!\nHere I'll teach you everything about how to sell online! We'll dive deep into Email Marketing which I strongly feel is still the best form of selling.\nI'll give you the basics of creating a good copy and much more!\n\n\nLast but not the least, a very important Module titled: Self Management. You’ll be working from home, 95% of the time. It’s not easy to do so, when you are in your PJ’s:)!\nUnless you have a System in Place and obviously certain Key Habits, then executing on your dreams can be very very difficult.\nNo bosses, no traffic, no office rentals, more time with family, and immense flexibility to work whenever, and with whomever you want is a FANTASY for many! And I have been living it for many many years now!\nBut know this: There are certain rules and time management techniques and guidelines that if you stick with can make you super productive and live this kind of life!\n\n\nOnce again, Here’s what you’ll get with this course:\n-Over 6+ Hours of Amazing Content teaching you how to find your True Passion and your Unique Purpose that enables you to live a meaning and fulfilling life!\n-Help you learn 11 Key Unique Mindset Principles that will differentiate you from other ‘Wellness Coaches’\n-Help you identify the main sub and micro niches and the most popular online business models in the Wellness Industry\n-Help you reach out to millions of clients for Free and then use highly persuasive and effective sales technique (without sounding too sales-y). Also help you to write amazing sales copy that convinces your audience to take a leap of faith and sign up!\n-Help you create a ‘Work from Home’ time management and work system’ that allows you to focus completely on the work on hand and been productive!\n-Dozens of Assignments and Worksheets that will help you convert this information into actionable steps\n-A Master Manual (50,000+ words) that will help you read the complete course\n\n\nIf you are a Wellness Professional and are struggling to find your unique purpose and the exact work that you should be doing which is in sync with your personality, abilities and values then you have come to the right place.\nGive this course a try for 30-days and if it does not work out for you, you can ask for a full-refund.\nIn the end, let me say this: If you just imbibe one idea from this course that truly resonates with you and pays you handsomely in the long-term I would consider the time spend creating this course worth it:)\n\nAll the best,\nYour coach,\nAkash",

So, this is a cash flow business model. If you don't have money to invest in domain names, this business is NOT for you.\n\n\nWhy would you flip a domain?\nWhy would you do this? For the most part, the motivation is profit. Domains are incredibly valuable pieces of online real estate; in fact, the most expensive domain name ever sold, Cars (dot )com, sold for $872 million.\nIf you’re in the right place at the right time and choose a domain name with massive potential, you could turn a significant profit when you flip the domain.\nIf you flip domains regularly, there’s a chance you could even turn it into a full-time career.\n\n\nWhat kind of budget should you allot for domain flipping?\nHow much money do you need to start domain flipping? That’s hard to say. Domains sell for anywhere between a few dollars and hundreds of millions of dollars, and you can feasibly start with just one domain to flip. Accordingly, it’s possible to start domain flipping with $750.",

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to the “Amazon FBA Course: Product Listing and Selling on Amazon FBA” course.\nSales Tactics, Strategies for Amazon FBA, A9 Algorithm, Giveaway, Amazon PPC (Ads) campaign, Keyword analysis & more\n\nAmazon FBA is a great way to launch a successful business from home. Udemy features courses taught by entrepreneurs and business professionals alike that will show you how to set up and make money with your FBA account right away, even if your starting budget is small. amazon fba private label, amazon fba wholesale, Amazon fba product research, amazon fba canada, free amazon fba, amazon private label, sourcing Alibaba, amazon fba mastery, dropshipping, amazon dropshipping\n\nAlthough I have no experience with Amazon FBA, I feel a lot more comfortable after taking this course. I am currently a paralegal that is searching for the freedom to live a less hectic lifestyle. I have just purchased a product that I am excited to test out and look forward to sharing the results.\nStarting an Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) account is a great way to eliminate some of the annoying logistics associated with running your own home business. Rather than source, package, and ship products yourself, Amazon takes care of the hassle by storing and then fulfilling your orders for you.\n\n\nWhat is Amazon FBA?\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a service Amazon offers its third-party sellers. Using FBA, sellers send their goods to one of Amazon’s fulfillment centers, and Amazon ships the items to the customer. Customers who buy FBA products usually get their items rather quickly. When an item sells, employees pick and pack the order and it leaves the warehouse shortly after the sale. Amazon’s shipping partners, including the USPS, work hard to ensure timely delivery. Even companies that don’t deliver on Sundays will ship FBA products seven days a week. It’s fairly simple to use FBA. Sellers must contact Amazon after they prepare their listings. They provide several details, including product information and the quantity they plan on sending. Amazon tells the seller where to send the shipment and they handle deal it from there.\nIs Shopify better than Amazon?\nSelling on Shopify using Amazon’s FBA service requires a different mindset than selling on Amazon with FBA. Other than in a few specialty categories, Amazon’s referral fees range between 8% and 17% of the sale amount. People who sell on Shopify try to avoid these fees, but there’s a reason why people gladly pay Amazon’s referral fees. Amazon attracts buyers from around the world to its platform, while Shopify sellers have to do their own marketing to sell their products. Shopify sellers also aim to build a brand without being subject to Amazon’s regulations. For example, Amazon does not allow its sellers to contact buyers. Many people feel that engaging customers is the best way to grow a business. Each of the platforms has its advantages, but people who want to list items without having to market them should definitely sell on Amazon.\nShould I Sell on Amazon or Ebay?\neBay and Amazon have distinct platforms. Deciding which one to use depends on your goals and what you're looking to sell. Amazon, in general, has a much higher sales volume than eBay. Many sellers choose Amazon because they feel they could earn more money there. While this is true in a lot of cases, some items do perform better on eBay. Amazon is the more restrictive of the two, so there are some products that you can only sell on eBay. For example, Amazon doesn’t allow used clothing sales. For many products, you need preauthorization before you sell them on Amazon. eBay has fewer guidelines for creating listings. If you only plan on selling a few pieces of each item, you might want to stick with eBay. Either way, both Amazon and eBay are great options for most sellers.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because sellers who use Amazon com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse. Not only does this take the packing and shipping burden off your shoulders, but it also means you can offer Prime shipping to those 200 million Amazon Prime members — who on average spend over 4 times as much as non-Prime shoppers.\nUsing FBA also means Amazon takes responsibility for any problems that arise during shipping, like late shipments, damaged items, or other issues. Your reputation as a seller doesn't take a hit.\nSo Wondering how to sell on Amazon? Do you already have a brand and products, but do you want to learn how to start an Amazon FBA business?\nIn this course, we explained the topics and tactics of selling on Amazon. We discussed the Amazon A9 Algorithm in all its details and explained the working logic of the system. We explained the Product Launch, Giveaway and PPC Ads Campaign together on a sample product step by step. Many people have changed their jobs through our course and consultancy support and are still successful sellers on Amazon.\nIn this course, you will also learn what is product listing on Amazon, why product listing is so important, and what you should do for a good product listing. We will be doing the product listing sections together step by step and you will learn the subjects practically. I will tell you what is GTIN exemption, and how to apply for GTIN exemption. At the same time, you will learn how to prepare the product and box labels that you need to provide to your supplier and prepare before sending the products to Amazon while listing the products. You will learn to do detailed keyword analysis to prepare a good product list and to be on the first page of Amazon search results.\nMany people have changed their jobs through our course and consultancy support and are still successful sellers on Amazon.\nTake your place in Amazon FBA Business.\nYou'll also get:\n● Lifetime Access to The Course\n● Fast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\n● Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now “Amazon FBA Course: Product Listing and Selling on Amazon FBA” course\nSales Tactics, Strategies for Amazon FBA, A9 Algorithm, Giveaway, Amazon PPC (Ads) campaign, Keyword analysis & more\n\nAmazon fba\namazon fba course\nfba amazon\namazon fba private label\namazon fba wholesale\nAmazon fba product research\namazon fba canada\nfree amazon fba\namazon private label\nAmazon\namazon Dropshipping\ndropshipping\nWe offer full support, answering any questions regarding “Amazon FBA Course: Product Listing and Selling on Amazon FBA” course\nSee you in the course!",

Highly recommended.\" - Rosa Suen, Best-selling Author on Amazon Kindle\nAwesome and Very Useful Course\n\"This is the first course that I took at Udemy and Chris's course is so much information and practical that we can apply. Chris is very knowledgeable on this and the course is presented in a very systematic way so that we can follow easily. Thanks for your hard work and keep it up. I do hope that you can add more updates on kindle publishing as I think Amazon will also keep changing the system. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested to sell kindle books in Amazon.\" - Simon Ng\nFantastic Course for Kindle\n\"It is a very good course. I have gain some information which haven't found in any other course. I am writing my own ebook for kindle based on tips provided by this course. I can say it is fantastic and awesome. Thanks Chris.\" - Khurshid Md Anwar\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nWhat I am about to show you is not a \"magic bullet\" method, but a business. Just like every business, there's process and system to follow. This is very real, and if done correctly, it can help you generate a good passive income - even while you sleep!\nI've been on Amazon Kindle since 2011, making thousands of dollars selling ebooks - some of which became bestsellers! The e-book publishing business is NOT dead! It's not even close. It will stay around for quite some time!\n\"E-reading is certainly on the rise. The Pew Research Center reports that, as recently as 2010, hardly anyone in the US had an e-reader or tablet. Now half do. The proportion of the population who have read an ebook in the past year rose from 17 per cent in 2011 to 28 per cent just three years later. In the UK, figures from Nielsen, which monitors book sales, showed that one in four consumer titles bought in 2013 was an ebook, up from one in five a year earlier.\" - The Financial Times Limited 2014\nThis course is about making money online with e-book publishing, especially with Amazon Kindle and other publishing platforms! The course has close to 50 video lectures, interactive quizzes, and PDF guides, specifically designed to \"hold your hand\" throughout the program so that you can get the success you deserve!\nIf you are looking for ways to generate some passive income and turn your knowledge into cash, you've come to the right place!\n_____________________________________________________________\nExcellent Course\n\"The training course is excellent. I have learned a lot about Kindle eBook publishing. Instructor is also very co-operative and helping his students.\" - Mubashir Shakeel\n_____________________________________________________________\n\n\nUnlike other courses out there, I'll teach you how to publish on other platforms beyond Amazon Kindle. So we are not just going to focus on Kindle Publishing, but on Ebook Publishing as a business.\nCreating and publishing e-books is easy, but also this translates to a lot of competition - since a lot of people have already \"awaken\" to this opportunity.

        "This course is NOT for you if you are expecting INSTANT results (quick fix of a problem) – if you are expecting to get instant cash within a few days after you join the course, it is not going to happen. You may generate cash within 7 days after you join the course (especially if you implement what you have learned in the course), but Amazon takes up to 90 days until you receive your first payment. So the money you’ll make out of Kindle are not going to be deposited into your bank account right away. If you need cash right away, Kindle is not the solution for you.",
        "This course is NOT for you if you are not willing to do the work (you are not an action taker) – if you buy courses one after another just to avoid taking any action, this course is not for you. Kindle Cash is designed to give you the practical tools to make it all work. You’ll succeed only if you implement what you are going to learn in the course – not just by watching it.",
        "This course is NOT for you if you are not open to coaching and training – if you do not like to be told what to do, and do exactly the opposite of what somebody else is telling you – even if it is for your own good. You need to be willing to let go of old beliefs about making money on the Internet, and be willing try new things to change what does not work.",
        "You SHOULD join this course if you are working from home. Kindle Cash will help you get consistent income to finance other projects you may have (your website, your blog, hiring more people to do the work for you so you can spend more time with friends and family, etc.)",
        "You SHOULD join this course if you are a blogger, coach/consultant, affiliate marketer (Information Product Guru) – Kindle Cash will help you convert your knowledge into consistent income, especially if you already have some client base (subscribers). You can use Kindle to promote your services and other products. For example, if you create a Kindle book based on your niche, you can include links in the book that promote your services (as a back-end offer). If people like your Kindle books, they would want to learn more from you."

      "description": "LATEST: Course Updated Again for April 1st, 2023\n\n\n\"Finally! A Quick, Easy and Painless Way For\nYOU To Set Up Your OWN Passive\n\nMoneymaking Internet System... Without Becoming a Computer Geek, Buying Expensive Software, or Paying Outrageous Fees!!!\n\"You can start to Flip Websites For Profit - Right now, within the next hour.\nIt's been said that the Internet is the easiest thing that's hard to do and that the top 5% of Internet Marketers make MORE than the other 95% COMBINED.\nDoesn't that just TICK you off?\nI know it TICKED me off when I first heard that, but I did something about it. I searched to find out what the top 5% money-making 'gurus' were doing and I found out, to my amazement that one of the easiest, quickest and most profitable ways is to flip websites.\nTHIS COURSE HIGHLIGHTS THOSE FINER DETAILS THAT MOST ONLINE GURU'S FAIL TO MENTION\n\nIt's called Virtual Real Estate.  Buying, selling and renovating Internet-based 'properties', websites and now blogs.\nVirtual Real Estate is just like in the real world, except you don't need a real estate license and you can flip websites in hours with very little capital.\nAre you fascinated by website design, have you considered making websites and/or graphic design, your career?\nBut then you realized it would take a lot of money, a lot of school and a lot of time. What if there was a way to enter the world of website design without the need for expensive classes and countless hours staring at a computer screen.\nLearning someone else's way to do things and what if I told you that not only could you practice and learn practical web design and advertisement techniques but you could get paid in the process!\n\nIt's absolutely true! There is a way to practice your web design skills and make a profit without having to go to school right away if ever. I'm sure you heard about or seen one of those home renovation shows where someone buys a cheap house and does some remodeling and cleanup work and then sell the house for a profit .\nWell the same thing can be done with the website and the “flipping websites for big paydays” course is going to show you exactly how it can be done .\nYou will learn how to take a run down, and/or domain name and revitalize it by adding some new content, graphics, games, videos, and whatever other entertaining material you think a particular niche market demographic might find entertaining and once the website viewership has been built back up.\nYou've probably been considering the different types of online businesses out there . You know you have what it takes to make a living online, but you're just not sure which way to go  .\n\nYou can then sell the website to an entrepreneur or small business or even a corporation for a profit!\nAnd because the web is constantly expanding an original and unique domain names and websites with loyal viewership's are becoming harder and harder to find.\nThere will never be a shortage of available websites for you to flip for a profit.\nBy the end of this course you will have a solid foundation on which to build a online business buying and selling domains & websites.\nMy Guarantee:\n\nI'm so confident that you're going to love this course and find a tremendous amount of value in it, that I guarantee that if you're not 100% satisfied, that I'll give you a full refund within 30 days of your purchase.\nThis course could easily sell for hundreds of dollars. I personally know of gurus out there who are charging hundreds, even thousands of dollars for a fraction of the information contained in this Udemy Course.\nAs with all my courses:\nThe initial low price will increase shortly - the course is currently $ 145, but will next increase to $ 250\nYou have unlimited lifetime access at no extra costs ever !!!\nAll future additional lectures, bonuses, etc in this course are always free\nThere's an unconditional, never any questions asked full 30 day money back in full guarantee\nMy help is always available to you if you get stuck or have a question - my support is legendary in Udemy.\nPSS: Do you really want to be a \"Successful Domain/Website Flipper\" ? Do you really want to enjoy a lifestyle that you only dream about now?\nPSSS: It will take hard work. It will take perseverance. But if you can honestly answer “Yes\" then there is no reason why you can't start building your Online Virtual Real Estate Empire today.\nThis will be a truly interactive course with additional bonus routines added over the course of the first year, inspired by the feedback from students.\nClick the \"Take This Course\" button, on the top right because every hour you delay is costing you money...

      "description": "Want to start and scale a profitable business on Amazon without having to deal with inventory management and high initial investment? Look no further than this in-depth Amazon Dropshipping and Retail Arbitrage course!\nYou'll learn step-by-step how to use Amazon's high demand for products to your advantage and become a successful dropshipper. This is when you sell products on Amazon at a higher price and fulfill them from other suppliers at a lower cost, profiting from the difference. By acting as the \"middleman\", you can keep a portion of the profit without ever having to store inventory or make upfront purchases - you buy the products only after you make the sales!\nThe course covers everything from identifying profitable products to automating the entire process with powerful software tools. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced seller looking to scale your dropshipping business, this course will guide you at every stage of the process.\nBENEFITS OF AMAZON DROPSHIPPING AND RETAIL ARBITRAGE\nLow initial capital required\nNo inventory to store\nYou can change the products you sell at any moment\nYou can do it from any part of the world\nUSING AUTOMATION SOFTWARE HELP YOU\nFind and list profitable products in a few clicks\nMonitor suppliers products for pricing and availability changes\nIncrease your Buybox ownership by utilizing AI-powered repricing algorithms\nGet valuable insights for your products and orders\nSave time!\nGET UP AND RUNNING THE SAME DAY, EVEN IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER\nThis course walks you through every step of the process. If you are just starting, this is a great course to take because it explains every concept, every software, and every step of the process from scratch.\nWHO THIS COURSE IS FOR\nThis course is for dropshippers on Amazon. This is the process of selling products on Amazon, and then finding those same products elsewhere online for cheaper prices, and buy those products to ship to your Amazon buyers.\nBENEFITS OF AMAZON DROPSHIPPING AND FBM\nNo inventory to buy upfront\nYou can change the products you sell at any moment\nYou don't have to choose a niche, and can change niches easily\nCONTROL YOUR PROFIT IN AN AUTOMATED WAY\nWhen you post your products, you will tell the repricing software the profit you want for each sale, and it will work within the parameters you give it. You don't have to worry about any price changes on Amazon or your supplier side. Your repricing software will do this for you.\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN FULFILLED BY AMAZON AND FULFILLED BY MERCHANT\nThis course uses the Fulfilled By Merchant strategy. That means that the shipping and handling is your responsibility. While this is an extra burden, it gives you significant flexibility in how you run your business, and in this course we take advantage of this flexibility by using proven suppliers to fulfill your orders. That opens up the possibility of using price arbitrage.\nPRICE ARBITRAGE\nThe repricing software and other software in this course will find products that have a different price on Amazon and other suppliers. So you can sell for a higher price on Amazon, and fulfill the product at a lower price from other suppliers, and keep the difference.\nARBITRAGE EXAMPLE\nIf a product is $100 on Amazon, but $50 elsewhere, you can sell it on Amazon, but fulfill the product by buying it at the $50 price and shipping it to the buyer. You get to keep the $50 in price.\nSOFTWARE USED IN THE COURSE\nThis course uses software to automate your Amazon dropshipping process. The software isn't free, but all software shown in the course does have a free trial so you can see if it works for you.\nInvest in your future! Enroll today!",

Drosphipping on Etsy is a phenomenal opportunity if you do it correctly.\n\n\nThere's tons of customers already shopping on Etsy and there aren't as many Etsy sellers as you think...therefore there's a lot of opportunities for you and I to make money selling there!\n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the dropshipping business model, basically it allows you to list products ahead of time (without needing to spend any up front money on products, without needing a warehouse or store to hold inventory, and without ever taking any financial risk at all until you're guaranteed to profit).\n\n\nThe reason dropshipping on Etsy is such a great opportunity specifically is because once you list something, we can completely automate everything after that with software.\n\n\nThat means all you have to do is list products...and the rest is taken care of for you (from creating the actual product, to order fulfillment, to shipping, to inputting tracking information, etc...). You don't need to do any of that.\n\n\nSo, if you'd like to learn how to start a 100% automated Etsy Dropshipping business this Course is perfect for you. Enroll today.",

Since kids are so smart these days they can write code and use various languages such as Python, PHP, of course HTML, CSS, etc. to achieve the desired results.\nWhile creating a website these days is very easy, the challenge is to design a site that people actually want.

      "description": "\"My Private MasterPlan Takes Selling Physical Products On Amazon Into An Entirely Different Dimension!\"\nAlready Selling On Amazon? I'll show you how to boost your rankings traffic and sales literally OVERNIGHT.\nNot Selling on Amazon? I'll show you how to quickly build a massively profitable Amazon business following a fine-tuned roadmap containing EVERYTHING you need to know!\n\"Every last detail of building a huge physical product business on Amazon is covered... from product research... to supplier search and inventory ordering, marketing and promotion, packaging and premium branding... list building, external traffic sources and much much more...\"\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOver the past 9 years I've done dropshipping, Forex, MLM, Adsense, affiliate marketing, apps, selling Clickbank products (both as a vendor and affiliate) and that's just a start.\nYou name it. I've likely done it.\nI've had some big successes, such as:\nBuilding two 6-figure/year health businesses selling products on Amazon.\nOne 7-figure per year software business.\n3 successful apps, two in the health market, one in the gaming market.\nI even once bought a one word dictionary .com domain name for $32,000 in cash and sold it 15 days later for $125,000 (making almost $100K in profit for doing NO work whatsoever).\nOther good things have happened too.\nSo yes, some of my ventures have worked out well.\nThe journey, however, has not always been easy...\nI've also had my fair share of disasters, some of which have been truly COLOSSAL.\nFor instance:\nI wasted 2 years of my life (along with $150K cash) on a project that fell at the FINAL hurdle, when just before launching, Apple brought out an exact version of the app I was building, available for free and as default on iOS 7.\nand:\nA few years back, I bought a one word .com finance related domain name for $64,000, invested an additional $60K in development and SEO, spent 18 months getting onto the first page of Google US for the term 'credit cards', did so successfully, started making around $1000 in commissions per day...\n...and then BAM! Google's Penguin update hit the site literally 7 days after I got there, obliterating the rankings and causing the business to die overnight.\nOuch... (x 2)\nI've had other disasters too, but the above are particularly depressing examples!\nThe point of me telling you all this is that due to the successes I've had, along with the (frankly unwanted) opportunities to learn from my failures, I have been able to develop a complete understanding of the following when it comes to making money online:\nWhat NEVER works\nWhat SOMETIMES works\nWhat ALWAYS works\n...And most importantly, which online business types and markets are realistic to compete in, but are still scalable into 6, 7 or even 8 figure operations that would continue to be manageable working from home.\nOne of those business types is SELLING ON AMAZON.\n...and I'm here to help you take selling on Amazon into a WHOLE New Dimension.\nThere are many courses out there on building Amazon businesses... some cheap, some hugely expensive, but this is different.\nMy Amazon MasterPlan contains ALL the information you need.\nBut... why should it matter to you?\nWell, let me ask...\nAre you already selling on Amazon?\nor looking for a way to make a great living online?\nor do you want to add a bow to an existing online business?\nMaybe you have an eCommerce or dropshipping website?\nIf any of the above apply, my Amazon Masterplan MATTERS.\n\nNot only does it consist of EVERYTHING you need to know about how to make money selling physical products on Amazon...\n...it shows you how to capitalize on the exposure that Amazon can bring, enabling you to expand and build out into additional platforms quickly,\ncreating high value (and if you wish, sellable) brands, as well as multiple income streams ...in a very short period of time.\nAnd one thing I must add...\nThe great thing about Amazon is this:\nThe Traffic and Buyers Are ALREADY There.\nYou don't need to grind to get them...\nYou simply need to get in front of them.\nIn other words...\nX - You don't need to do traditional SEO\nX - You don't need to do link building\nX - You don't need to pay sky high costs for Google ads\n...and you don't need that whole list of other time consuming and frustrating stuff either.\nThere is, however, one important thing to remember....and this is relevant no matter what type of business you are in or want to pursue...\nThe success (or failure) of any business is usually down to one thing: EXECUTION\nTake it from me...Good ideas and effort are simply NOT enough.\nIn my view most people fail to make a living online, not because of lack of effort, but because they don't know how to execute their plan properly. (which mostly tends to be unstructured, if there is a plan at all).\nAnd even those who have done it all before and know how to run and scale a business, STILL need a structured plan in place in order for their execution to be efficient, seamless and successful.\nAnd that is exactly what this course is...\nIt is the private Masterplan originally for MY use, *remastered* for YOUR use...\n...with NOTHING left out.\nIt really is everything you need to know about making money on Amazon and beyond, condensed into detailed manuals and videos with, zero-fluff, direct to the point step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow.\nHowever, you genuinely have to be prepared...\nIt is BRUTALLY comprehensive and not for the faint hearted.\nIt is a full-on A – Z, militarily precise course.\nNo waffle. No filler. No BS.\nEven if you have no experience selling on Amazon, or indeed any experience doing anything at all online, that is A-ok.\n...Because this course is so step-by-step and uber-focused, all you need to have is the ability to follow very clear instructions.\nHere are 7 reasons why you should download this course today:\n1. You will get exclusive access to a complete PROVEN roadmap featuring fine-tuned instructions revealing how to make money selling physical products on Amazon with nothing left out.\n2. Every stage of selling on Amazon is covered... from product and niche research, marketing and promotion, supplier search and inventory ordering, packaging, premium branding, list building, external traffic sources and much more.\n3. If you already sell on Amazon, you can use this information to boost your rankings, traffic & sales overnight and expand into additional platforms to increase brand exposure and revenue.\n4.

      "description": "This course is part of our \"Psychology Driven Web Design\" collection.\nThis is a beginner level course as e-commerce psychology is concerned.\nPlease note that NO subtitles are available with this course.\n\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nWhile it is relatively easy today, thanks to Shopify, BigCommerce, 3DCart, WooCommerce, and other alternatives, to create an e-commerce store, operating a successful one is far from trivial, because you have to be able to predict, how the products you present in your shop will appeal to your online customers. There is no standard procedure you can follow and, therefore, factoring in idiosyncrasies of human psychology in each case is the only sure way to thrive in this field. Indeed, for any product or service you want to sell online, you must not only decide about price, options, and presentation but also be able to combine affective descriptions, salient images and multimedia to produce the kind of impact that interactions in real life can. Psychology is certainly the tool you must use to sell.\nBut of course, this doesn’t mean you need a degree in psychology to create an e-commerce website that converts. Most concepts in psychology are simple enough so that they can be used without having to study the intricacies of the theories behind them.\nRight after you start this course, you’ll find out why human beings are irrational, forgetful, and biased, why their decisions are error-prone, instinctive, and unconsciously conditioned, and why they react to situations emotionally, intuitively and subjectively. This will then inspire you to learn to take perceptual biases of your customers, their motivations, emotional states, and unconscious desires into consideration when creating your e-commerce websites.\n\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nIn this course, we will look at the conjunction of design, marketing, and psychology for creating effective e-commerce websites. We will discuss, among many other things, the online sales cycle; using the triune brain model in e-commerce; the psychology of trust; the psychology of choice; the psychology of decision making; the price and quality perception; the psychology of scarcity and urgency; the psychology of reciprocity and rewards; the influence of design; the effects of colors on sales; effective form design; behavioral conditioning; using the inconsistency of the self; storytelling in e-commerce; writing effective product descriptions; social validation and user-generated content; designing effective testimonial pages; psychographic segmentation of customers; personalization in e-commerce; …\n\n\nPREREQUISITES\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. If you have ever shopped online, you can follow all the lectures. No literacy in psychology is required as all necessary knowledge will be conveyed in laymen’s terms. However, you must be able to understand English without needing subtitles.\n\n\nTHE LEVEL OF STUDY\nThis course is for those who are at a beginner to intermediate level as e-commerce psychology is concerned.\nYou will receive a valuable certificate in “E-Commerce Psychology” that you can add to your CV when you finish this course.\n\n\nWHAT THIS COURSE IS NOT ABOUT\nThis course is NOT about learning web development using HTML / CSS / Scripting Languages. It is also NOT about encoding, implementing, or publishing an actual e-commerce website on some platform.\nThis is also NOT a psychology course. While a great number of topics are covered here that are usually taught within the curriculum of a psychology course, the emphasis is always on practical design implications of these and NOT on theoretical notions of cognition or behavior.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: MOST PARTS OF THIS COURSE ARE ALSO CONTAINED IN OUR COURSE “PSYCHOLOGY DRIVEN WEB DESIGN”. IF YOU HAVE TAKEN THAT COURSE ALREADY, WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU TAKE THIS COURSE.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: WE DO NOT OFFER SUBTITLES IN THIS COURSE.",

      "description": "Have YOU Ever Asked Yourself These Questions?\nWhich niche should I choose?\nWhat are the best products to DropShip?\nWhich products should I sell on my eCommerce store?\nHow do I find profitable niches?\n\nWhy do I always stuggle with how to find profitable niches?\nWhere do I begin to find products to DropShip?\nHow do I know if my chosen niche will be profitable?\nWhy do I find it so difficult to come up with Niche ideas?\nWhy is niche research so frustrating?\nI guarantee, this is THE most thorough, laser-focused and up-to-date course available ANYWHERE on the market on the subject of how to find a niche..\nThis course is for anybody who wants to learn how to easily discover profitable ecommerce and DropShipping niches and test if they will be profitable or not. I have included everything that I have learnt over the past five years which has helped me to earn a considerable amount of money online.\nWhen I began my ecommerce journey five years ago I struggled to find products to sell and my first two stores only made one sale between them, yes you did read that right, only ONE sale between two stores. This was even after I received advice from some well known ‘Gurus’ within the eCommerce/DropShipping field.\nIn fact one very well known person in the Ecommerce world even told me which niche to choose. The store was a complete disaster even though it looked amazing and had good traffic. Knowing what I know about niche research I can quite confidently say that I was advised to choose one of the worst niches possible. The niche had too many variables that you need to avoid and it lacked many criteria that it should have possessed. Now I do not make these mistakes anymore as I have researched what these variables and criteria are. More importantly YOU do not need to make these time consuming mistakes anymore as you have everything you need to choose a profitable niche in this course.\nWhy is there such a lack of useful information on what could undeniably be THE MOST important aspect of any ecommerce venture?\nI have spent thousands of dollars on ecommerce and dropshipping courses only to be let down by the lack of useful and relevant content on this extremely important subject.\nFrustrated and annoyed with the lack of niche information on the market I began a journey to learn as much as I could about how to find profitable niches. But not just any niches but niches that made big dollars for very little work.

      "description": "UPDATE 8th of MAY 2016: I have now sold over 340 units within 16 days since my launch on Amazon totalling over 10,000USD in sales.\nUpdate 3rd of October 2016: Sold over 2500 pieces with a monthly profit of 3500$/month. Total sales of over 40,000$ with this product only!\nUpdate 19th of October 2016: My product has sold over 3500 units and I am the Number 1 Bestseller in this very competitive category!!\nUpdate 7th of February 2018: I have now sold over 20,000 units profiting me over 100,000US$ since launching this product nearly 2 years ago. Sales is still strong and an evergreen in my assortment.\nUpdate 17th of February 2019: After selling this item (and others under this brand) for more than 3 years I have successfully sold this brand for a mid 6 figure completing this case study. Total profit for all items sold amounts to over 200,000$ & the amount I sold this brand for.\n\nSee all steps on how I did it within this course!\nMy name is Manuel and I have been importing from China for over 18 years while actually living in China for over 11 years now.\nThis course is unlike any other course that you can find anywhere online. It is THE only course that actually shows you a LIVE example on how to choose a product, contact suppliers in China, verify them, calculate margins and costs, place your order to the factory and private label your item on Amazon. Look over my shoulders on how I communicate with suppliers in China, check samples, list the product on Amazon, create a packaging, inspect the goods in China, ship it to Amazon USA and launch the product. See for yourself that the process works and look at my sales numbers. Find out how to get exclusivity agreements, sign purchase order contracts and get the best out of your product.\nThis is a step-by-step guide from the beginning to the end. See how I analyse suppliers feedback, test reports, which tools I use and how I make difficult decisions.\nWith my experience in working for a retailer for over 18 years and purchasing from China as a Product Manager based in Hong Kong for over 11 years you will learn how to safely procure a product in China and sell it successfully on Amazon.\nAgain, this is a REAL life study, investing my own money and documenting the entire case study with video, phone calls, pictures, templates and much much more. I reveal my actual product and supplier and show you the sales numbers on Amazon. No one else has ever done that. I am not afraid of competition or copycats revealing this as there are so many opportunities with other products and if I can do it so can you with this course.\nI run my own sourcing company in Hong Kong, teach people how to import from China, author several books sold on Amazon and sell my own products on Amazon. Many “gurus” out there will only give you examples and techniques that “might work” but none of them have actually worked and lived in China, importing/exporting over 200Million USD like I have.\nFollow me on this journey and become a successful importer and eCommerce Entrepreneur.",

By implementing these strategies, I was able to take a store from £19,000 in monthly revenue, to over £100,000 the next month, and then to over £150,000 the month after that! Without holding ANY inventory!\nThis Course is a run-down of 10 key things that you need to try out on your own store to take it to the next level. I also talk about one of the little-known sources of traffic that has an amazingly good conversion rate and is what I believe to be the Lowest Hanging Fruit for anyone who is already operating a profitable Shopify store.\nIn addition, I also outline the exact process I use for creating Lookalike Audiences, what Lookalike Audiences I create, and how I set them up in an Ad Set. This information on its own is incredibly valuable. I attribute the majority of my scaling to my Lookalike Audience scaling strategy. I pretty much outline the process right here!\nAbout Your Instructor:\nAdam is a Best Selling Udemy instructor with over 35,000 students enrolled in his various Entrepreneurship, Digital Marketing and E-Commerce courses. Many of his students now own their own successful online businesses, and some are even travelling the world while earning a healthy income from their ventures. To check out what some of Adam's students have achieved, head to the Bonus Material Section at the end of the course. There, you'll find a Free Preview Video showcasing just a handful of student results.\nAdam has run E-Commerce ventures since he was just 15 Years Old. With 8 Years under his belt, he's now 23 and loves Shopify. In 2016 he demonstrated his knowledge and ability in the E-Commerce field...\nFirstly, on eBay, he started with £0, and was able to turn over £8000 in 8 weeks, without having ANY inventory.\nMore notably, in September 2016 he launched a brand new website on Shopify. Within 3 weeks he had already turned over more than £1000 in a single day, and within 3 months had already received multiple 6-Figure valuations for the website. Less than 4 weeks in to 2017, this website finally hit 6-Figures in Gross Sales in GBP £. Since then, that specific website has turned over more than $1,000,000.\nA Word from Adam:\nIn this course I'll be showing you some of the main tips and strategies that have enabled me to grow my business to completely new heights. I will cover a range of different topics, from the obvious to the not-so-obvious and very-rarely revealed!

You’ll then follow the journey of goods through critical logistics stages including freight booking, export documentation, loading, and customs clearance in the country of origin.

It opens the door to many exciting career opportunities in a wide range of industries inside logistics and supply chain management, making you a valuable asset in today's global marketplace.\n\n\nIt's important to note that this course offers a broad comprehension of supply chain management, primarily concentrating on non-food products across diverse industries rather than focusing on any particular sector or FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods). Nevertheless, it's noteworthy that numerous principles discussed herein apply to FMCG. FMCG pertains to low-cost items with a short shelf life that are regularly consumed, such as food.",

These people will sell you the latest tips and tricks to get there as fast as possible and they might work 50% of the time. One of the key tasks is targeting the right keywords and we’ll bring you through how you can do this easily.\nHowever today I want to give you some tips that you can follow to get your website to number 1 on Google but you need to remember one thing. This is not an overnight process. In fact the path to this ranking can take anywhere from 6-18 months. Our goal here is to ensure that you can do the work now, forget about it, then watch your site traffic increase during that period dramatically.\nNo Jargon? Really?\nWell...I'll explain the jargon in the theory section but other than that, I'm going to not use those words. The only reason I want to explain them at all in the theory section is that when you research these topics, you'll need to somewhat understand the jargon to learn further.\nHowever, this guide is for those who just want to give their business a boost themselves and stay away from all the nerdy stuff.\nWhat Can I Expect?\nIf you follow along my guide here you'll be able to increase your ranking to the first page of Google over the next 6-8 months and also find out which keywords that you will need more help with. Yes I'll explain keywords too.",

One of them did it in their 1st year making $114,000 in profit! Now as an update since the launch of this course, literally hundreds and hundreds of students are making $500-1000 per month.

Shaine Warren is a real student on Udemy, message her! :)\nShaine writes: Made over $5,000 and Quit my 'Day Job' :)\nThis course has literally changed my life for the better. David does an awesome job teaching this system and makes it really easy to follow. Plus he is very active in the discussion board and always answers any questions you have.\nI started this course about 5 months ago and I am so glad I took action and followed what is taught. I have since made over $5,000 Net Profit... $3,000 of which has been made this month alone which is what led me to quit my manual labor warehouse 'day job' because I am now making way more on eBay.\nThis business model is by no means a get rich quick scheme. It does take some effort and work to build it up, but once you get it going there is no looking back :)\nWhether you're just looking to make some extra income or looking for an escape from a not so enjoyable day job, this course may be the solution you need. Just make sure you actually take action and follow the steps provided.\nI wish you all the best! :)",

Other than in a few specialty categories, Amazon’s referral fees range between 8% and 17% of the sale amount. People who sell on Shopify try to avoid these fees, but there’s a reason why people gladly pay Amazon’s referral fees. Amazon attracts buyers from around the world to its platform, while Shopify sellers have to do their own marketing to sell their products. Shopify sellers also aim to build a brand without being subject to Amazon’s regulations. For example, Amazon does not allow its sellers to contact buyers. Many people feel that engaging customers is the best way to grow a business. Each of the platforms has its advantages, but people who want to list items without having to market them should definitely sell on Amazon.\nShould I Sell on Amazon or eBay?\neBay and Amazon have distinct platforms. Deciding which one to use depends on your goals and what you're looking to sell. Amazon, in general, has a much higher sales volume than eBay. Many sellers choose Amazon because they feel they could earn more money there. While this is true in a lot of cases, some items do perform better on eBay. Amazon is the more restrictive of the two, so there are some products that you can only sell on eBay. For example, Amazon doesn’t allow used clothing sales. For many products, you need preauthorization before you sell them on Amazon. eBay has fewer guidelines for creating listings. If you only plan on selling a few pieces of each item, you might want to stick with eBay. Either way, both Amazon and eBay are great options for most sellers.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because sellers who use Amazon com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\n\nDropshipping is an order fulfillment option that allows eCommerce businesses to outsource procuring, storing, and shipping products to a third party. This order fulfillment method appeals to entrepreneurs seeking low overhead and low capital investments, but it can come at a cost.\nEcommerce is competitive. Dropshipping may appeal to entrepreneurs looking to sell generic products, but it can limit opportunities to build a brand or differentiate products. Thus, businesses that use dropshipping may wind up competing on price, leading to low margins.\nIf you are considering dropshipping for your eCommerce business, there are several factors you should review—including some variations and alternatives that offer similar benefits.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse. Not only does this take the packing and shipping burden off your shoulders, but it also means you can offer Prime shipping to those 200 million Amazon Prime members — who on average spend over 4 times as much as non-Prime shoppers.\nUsing FBA also means Amazon takes responsibility for any problems that arise during shipping, like late shipments, damaged items, or other issues. Your reputation as a seller doesn't take a hit.\nSo Wondering how to sell on Amazon? Do you already have a brand and products, but do you want to learn how to start an Amazon FBA business? You found a very good product but don't know how to supply it?\nIn this lesson, I explained what the supplier criteria are, how to find suppliers according to these criteria, how to analyze suppliers, how to contact suppliers, and what points we should pay attention to when getting a request order quote. I showed you how to find your own freight forwarder on the site I use. I explained the order purchase agreement you need to make before paying the supplier and what we will pay attention to in this agreement. Many people have changed their jobs through our course and consultancy support and are still successful sellers on Amazon.\nTake your place in Amazon FBA Business.\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now “Amazon FBA Course Source Alibaba to Amazon FBA, Dropshipping” course\nSource Alibaba | Find and Analyze Suppliers on Alibaba for Selling on Amazon FBA, Amazon Dropshipping, Amazon Wholesale\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\n\n\nSee you in the \"Amazon FBA Course Source Alibaba to Amazon FBA, Dropshipping\" course!",

Indeed, with the internet becoming an essential requirement of everyday life, businesses are learning to take advantage of the numerous benefits of ecommerce, the most notable of which include:\nGlobal market: A physical store will always be limited by a geographical area it can serve.\nAround-the-clock availability: Another great benefit of running an online business is that it is always open.\nReduced Costs: Ecommerce businesses benefit from significantly lower running costs.\nInventory Management: Ecommerce businesses can automate their inventory management by using electronic tools to accelerate ordering, delivery and payment procedures.\nWhile there are a variety of different platforms that you can use to set up your e-commerce site, Woocommerce is the number one option if you are utilizing WordPress.\nIf you've wanted to sell your products online for a long time, but you just haven't been able to do so because of the technical learning curve, then this is your solution.\nBy the end of this video course, you'll have the necessary knowledge to set up your ecommerce site from scratch on the WordPress platform.\n>>>ENROL TODAY<<<",

      "description": "Email Marketing Course For eCommerce By OXG Media\nThe Secrets Behind How To Increase Profitability In Your eCommerce Store OVERNIGHT Without Spending An Additional Dollar On FB, Google Or Tiktok\nDo These Things Sound Familiar?\n1. Your paid ads are generating the bulk of your e-commerce revenue and you are just sitting on 1000s (Thousands) of email addresses in your email list and doing nothing with it. You probably are even paying for email software that you are barely even using.\n\n\n2.  You don’t have an email backend to support your frontend paid ads acquisition marketing strategy, which makes it very dangerous as the prices of ads get higher overtime, squeezing your ROAS and that could mean the difference between you being profitable or in the red.\n\n\n3.  As the IOS stuff happens and frontend paid ads CPCs and CPMs increase with more competition, it's getting increasingly more difficult to even break even with the thin margins in eCommerce, especially if you are not selling high ticket products.\n\n\n4. You have spent so much on ads and acquisition trying to acquire customers, but neglect to extend that lifetime value (LTV) after the customer has bought from you the 1st time.\n\n\nLet me ask you this question...\n\n\nIf facebook or google stops your ad account today…right now, do you still have a business?\n\n\nWould you still be able to generate revenue?\n\n\nAre you too reliant on paid advertising?\n\n\nThe #1 Biggest Issue With Platforms Like FB, Google Getting More Expensive & Why This Affects You\nAs more businesses are forced online to advertise, the ‘Facebook’ channel, the ‘Google’ Channel, is going to be flooded with other competitors.\n\n\nCompetitors are ok, they are a sign that there is money in the market, but it also means that it gets increasingly harder to differentiate from other businesses.\n\n\nImagine paying for a click on google, and when the search results show up, the customer is presented with 60 different options all offering the same thing…\n\n\nWith so many other options out in the marketplace, that ‘click’ you are paying for becomes a commodity, as shoppers can click the backspace button, seek other alternatives and move on with life.\n\n\nWhat most eCommerce entrepreneurs don’t understand is that they are competing with other eCom businesses, you are not the only one in the space.\n\n\nCustomers have a limited $100 to spend and they will choose whether they are going to spend it with competitor A or with you.\n\n\nIf you are already spending so much money on ads, you should try to maximize every website visitor that comes to your store.\n\n\nImagine you had a conversion rate of 3% for example, that means for every 100 people who come to your site, 97 of them are saying NO to you.\n\n\nThat’s 97 people whom you are paying for who have come to your website, have not transacted with you, and left without giving you any money.\n\n\nIf you could just follow up with these people overtime...and in the next 1,3,6 months for example they would give you $25 for example...would that change the economics of your business?\n\n\nWhy You Are DOOMED In Today’s Age If You Are Not Consistently Doing Email Marketing\nIn the paid advertising channels like facebook, the billion dollar companies who are advertising in the same ad space as you are willing to go in the red to acquire a customer.\nWhich means they don’t need a 3-4x ROAS on their campaigns in order to survive.\nThey are more than willing to do a 0.2x ROAS, lose money, acquire the customer and wait for 6-12 months for that money to be recouped.\nAre you...ready for that?\nCan your business economics afford that?\n99% of businesses and SMBs cannot.\nThat is why most of them do not survive.\nThat is why most of them will never see the next stage of growth.\nSo how do you combat that?\nYou’d have to find more efficient ways to extract more LTV from your customers over a long period of time in order to stay profitable.\nEmail and retention based marketing strategies are the only way to extract more value from your customers, and you don’t even have to pay ad spend to get in front of the customer, unlike retargeting ads. ?\nWhen done well and consistently, email as a marketing channel can generate you an additional 30-50% of your entire store revenue.\nImagine doing $1m per month and $300k of that amount is generated purely with email marketing alone.\nOnce again --- keep in mind there is no ad spend here.\nYou build a solid and long term relationship with your customers here and you do it profitably.\nThe online businesses that will now survive are the ones who only do frontend acquisition, they only care about the 1st sale and 1st transaction, but they fail to realise the 1st purchase is only the start of the relationship, the real money is made on the backend.\nNow you understand why emails are so important.\nSelling Your Company And Looking For A Big Payday? You Need Email.\nLastly, email is the ONLY channel where you truly own the customer and the asset.\nIf you do a business like amazon FBA, you don’t own the customer. You’re building Amazon's business. Because you don’t own the customer list.\nBut if you run your own eCom store, you own the relationship with the customer 100%. You have their contact information, and it's in your email.\n\nIf you run FB, FB can shut down your ad account. If you have a youtube channel, google can ban you whenever they like.\nWhen you have an email list, this is something you own outright - 100%. It’s yours and nobody can ‘shut you down’. The CHANNEL and relationship to the customer is completely YOURS.\nThe email list is the ONLY asset that you truly own as a business owner.\nIf, at any point in time you were thinking about selling your company to an external investor, the investor is going to price and VALUE your business based on the size and health of your email list.\nWhy do so many companies like Twitter, worth a multi-billion valuation, when their net profit stinks?\n\nBecause they OWN the customer base.\nThey own the list.\nWhen an investor buys your company, they want to see how much $ can be generated from the email list.\nThey want to see a healthy, engaged list of prospects ready and excited to buy your products.\nAnd a healthy email list with good open and engaged rates producing revenue will increase your valuation multiple as well.\nA $6m valuation looks very different from a $9m valuation if the difference is the quality of your email list.\nTake care of email marketing --- it's the backbone of your business.\nSummary: Here’s Why You NEED To Learn Email Marketing\nYou’re able to unlock a new revenue stream and generate 30-50% more revenue without spending an additional dollar on ads.\n\n\nYou have a lot more margin to play with because you know you have a backend that can help you extend your LTV, so even if you’re spending a ton of money on the front with your ads, you’ll be able to squeeze a lot more revenue from your existing customer base.\nMore margin gives you a lot more confidence to scale aggressively on the frontend with ads.\n\n\nThe email channel is something that you own, there are no ad account bans, no external forces.\n\n\nIf you have a massive email list, you’re pretty much set for life.\n\n\nSo Who Is This Course For?\n\n\neCommerce business owners who want to learn how to run email marketing campaigns for their eCommerce store\neCom businesses who want to squeeze out more profit from their digital marketing efforts\neCom business owners who have a stagnant email list sitting in their database and you’re doing nothing about it\nIt doesn’t matter whether you’re doing woocommerce, Shopify or magento, every company who does business online needs an email list, you’re eventually going to have to do this.\nMarketers who want to learn how to do email marketing for eCommerce businesses and clients\n\n\nWho Will See The Results The Fastest?\neCommerce stores who are already in revenue, already running traffic, already have an existing email list that they are NOT actively engaging with\nAs long as you acquire customers in an online acquisition channel, you are running an online business. This would be suitable for you too.\n\n\nOk --- So What Is The OXG Media Email Marketing Course About?\nOur email course covers...\nModule 1:\nWe'll teach you about the fundamentals of email marketing.

      "description": "Use my proven winning product research formula that has helped me generate multiple 6 figure incomes from individual winning products and got me featured on the official Shopify Masters Podcast. A lot of Shopify marketers and dropshipping entrepreneurs are wasting a lot of time and money testing 5-10 products a day failing again and again to find anything successful. Testing 5-10 products a day is like gambling and with my strategic step by step winning product research you will learn to only spend money on ads for products through data backed validation.\nThere are two different type of winning products you will learn how to find in my course.\n1. Trending Products\n2. Evergreen Products\nTrending products are items that have an influx of consumers looking to purchase something for an event, movement, fad, or season. Although these type of products don't last forever they can make you thousands of dollars in a short amount of time. In my course I'll walk through how I generated $18,000 through this type of research and actually show you the real product, research, and even ads I used to capitalize on the consumer trend. From my course you'll be able to do data research online to find consumer trends in every niche possible.\nEvergreen products are items that are currently not trending and they might not ever trend except there is a continuous stream of consumers who are looking to purchase this product every month. You may not be able to scale this product to thousands of dollars in a day, however, you may be able to generate a steady profit of $1,000 per month. The more evergreen products you discover the longer you can expect to have a successful store for years to come producing a profit.\nNot only will I teach you to find winning products through data backed research, but also give you my best product testing calculator which is an equation I follow once I start putting money on ads to determine if I should scale or not. I'll also give you a few bonus videos on sourcing your product (if you only use Aliexpress you are missing the best places online to source quality goods) and share with you one of my exact stores and the set up I have on it.",

It is the “viral trend” of business models. This has caused a large influx of YouTube “Guru’s” who all seem to blurt out the same script. “Don't reinvent the wheel, find the beginning of a trend and ride the wave of success. Once you become successful, focus on becoming a brand”.\nAlthough this advice is safe and easy to follow, its a flawed concept. Have you ever wondered, who creates a trend? How do they know a product will trend? how are the price points set as they are? who decides this?\nWell, you! That’s right, I am Tamara, a sourcing agent and I will teach you the tricks of the trade. I will teach you China’s best-kept secret. What if I told you Aliexpress is aimed at foreigners and is massively overpriced? What if I told you Aliexpress is only a drop in the ocean of what really lays ahead?\nThis is no joke. I will teach you a new research method that will allow you to identify trending products in China, before they trend on Aliexpress.\nWhat is this secret? China’s largest online marketplace, Taobao. A fabulous sea of addictive online shopping that will allow you access to a platform that only local Chinese residents have access to. What does this mean for you?\n\n\n– YOU are able to source products at the same price points as the local Chinese market\n– YOU are able to identify trending products before they reach Aliexpress.\n– YOU will be in charge of your shipping and fulfilment options. This means FASTER shipping if you choose to do so.\n– YOU will be able to have conversational interactions with the sellers- YOU DO NOT need to know Chinese!\n\n\nWhat Are The Current Problems With Dropshipping?\n- Everyone is competing against the same products\n- Everyone is in a bidding war for ad space because they are all\nbidding for the same keywords and the same products\n- People are using the same spy tools for insight\n- The majority of people are following the herd and not thinking\noutside the box\n- Not many people are willing to invest in their own E-commerce\nEducation\n- Wasting money on ads for \"testing\" products that can already be\nproven\n- Too much guesswork and high risk\n- Your success is based on your budget\n\n\nSolution?\n- Remove yourself from the race and dropship untapped products\n- No need to be in a bidding war if you are one of the first to\nadvertise a product!\n- We are just launching this initiative. We started with a Beta group\nand you will see a case study below! AMAZING! You will be one of\nthe founding members of this initiative\n- You will be doing things differently from the norm. You will be\nunique by utilizing China's largest online marketplace\n- Learn new skills that won't ever expire when algorithms change\n- You will advertise products already proven with high reviews and\nare HOT in China therefore not wasting so much money on ads\n- Take the guesswork out of product research and significantly\nlower your financial risk\n- Your success is no longer determined by your budget, rather your\nability to use untapped products to your advantage\n\n\nGet ready to give yourself an unfair advantage with a lifelong skill that will never expire when the algorithm changes. This skill can be used for Shopify dropshipping, eBay Amazon FBA, wholesale, B2B and brick and mortar stores. Join our many successful clients who have undertaken the training and have gotten exceptional results.\nSee you on the inside :)",

With this course, you’ll learn how to make money online - you'll be looking at an extra $1,000 a month from your digital assets on Amazon Kindle, and beyond.\n\n\nAmazon Kindle Self-Publishing for Beginners consists of 8 modules\n\n\nModule 1: Introduction\nIn this module, I’ll show you the blueprint to my success. You’ll get a handle on what Kindle Publishing really looks like, what the business entails, and how you can get started. You’ll learn that even if you aren’t a writer, you can make a steady, passive income from bookselling on amazon by outsourcing the work – hiring ghostwriters, designers, and more, to ensure this business model works FOR YOU and not the other way around. Kindle publishing isn't just for fiction writers, and if you own a business and aren't publishing on Amazon, then you could be leaving a lot of money on the table.\nModule 2: Market Research\nIn this module, you’ll learn what is compelling the amazon market right now. Learn how to choose the correct niche, and how to get the best keywords to get your books trending. We’ll walk you through every stage of the process from the research phase, so you can order your books in the future phase (if you want to outsource the process completely.) Most people let this stage hold them back from getting started; but once you learn exactly what to do in this module, and you see how easy it is, you'll wonder why you haven't published an ebook on Amazon already.\nHow to differentiate between a fad niche and evergreen niches\nHow to conduct extensive niche research, and really get to know what books will work for you\nHow to choose the right keywords for your book\nHow the right keywords can boost your visibility and give you a leg-up on the competition\nModule 3: Creating Your Book\nIn this module, you’ll walk through the process of creating your book – from the bare bones, to ordering it from a ghostwriter and a look into the cover design process. Every book has to start somewhere, and yours can start here. All of your creation questions answered upfront, so when you’re ready to publish – you’re navigating this process like a pro.\nFinally, you'll learn how to create a high-converting ebook cover for only $5-10, and learn why book covers can really make or break your content. We’ll go through the process of what makes a good cover, and how to ensure you communicate exactly what you want from your designer every time.\nModule 4: Free Products\nIn this module, you’ll learn about some of the free products available to keep your publishing costs down. If you’re just getting started, maybe you’ve wondered – how do I keep this venture low-cost? While down the line, you can make things easier on yourself by outsourcing the work entirely – the concern is understandable, and there ARE answers out there! From book formatting to designs, royalty-free images, HTML description formatting, and more – free products exist out there, ready for you to take advantage of them!\nCanva\nHtml-online (description formatting)\nDraft2digital formatting\nUnsplash\nACX\nBabelcube\nModule 5: Publishing\nLearn how we publish on amazon, a guide from Formatting, to descriptions, and actually publishing a book alongside you. That way, you have a visual guide to this process and everything it entails.\nOur super-easy 10-minute process for publishing your book on Amazon.\nHow to price your Kindle eBook to boost your royalties and income.\nHow to choose the right categories for your books, to maximize sales and attract hundreds of extra readers to your book.\nModule 6: Kindle Marketing\nIn this module, you’ll learn how to promote your eBook to Kindle and ensure it reaches your audience, and you can start making money fast. You’ll learn all the tricks and tips I have to offer to get traffic flowing to your book, as well as common issues you might encounter (and how to fight back). You’ll also learn how to market to your existing customers over and over again to create repeat buyers and long-term profits, and we'll show you how to turn your buyers into lifetime buyers by building on your existing content and maximizing your revenue.\nModule 7: Continue Publishing\nScaling up from just publishing on amazon, and what your best course of action can be from here – Learn about platforms like IngramSpark and Babelcube, and how you can use them to get your books on the shelves at major retailers like Walmart, Target, Barnes, and Noble and more; Learn how translating your book with the help of professionals on Babelcube can help you expand your audience beyond your wildest dreams.\nModule 8: Conclusion\nOnce you've finished your course, congratulations! A video to close off the course - and a special offer to those who want to know more!\nWe've only included what we think are the most important factors in creating, publishing, and marketing a top-selling ebook for the Amazon Kindle and beyond. and how you can not only start this new business – but learn to scale up, and automate it all from the comfort of your home. You’ll be making an extra $1,000 a month, all in your spare time!\n\n\nWe hope you get a lot of value from this course and as always we'd love to hear your feedback!\nTo Your Success,\niPublishGhostwriters",

If you see a good number of search results, that means your seed keywords are good to go.\nNote: If you see suspiciously few results on keywords that you believe should be high-volume, be cautious. Sometimes listings get through manual review that shouldn't have.\nIn the example above, I searched for \"Beer Olympics\" and saw 4 results... this is a massive red flag indicating to me that these keywords are NOT safe for use on Merch listings.\nThe next reason to search Merch only listings is that they're in a class of their own, as they're Prime eligible.\nAccording to data from Millward Brown Digital, Amazon Prime members have a conversion rate around 74% whereas non-prime members convert around 13%.\nShoppers are able to easily filter out tons of fulfilled-by-merchant (FBM) print no demand listings by simply clicking the \"Prime\" checkbox on the search results page:\nWhile it's possible for FBA t-shirt listings to exist outside of Amazon Merch, it's a pretty rare occurrence.\nThe last reason to use Search Merch to begin your niche research is because Amazon's search algorithm isn't that great!\nIt's not hard to search for \"search terms\" + \"T-shirt\" & find a bunch of results that aren't t-shirts.\nWhy go through the hassle of combing over them when you don't need to? Search Merch does the dirty work for you.\nDS Amazon Quick View injects each products BSR into the search results, making it easy to see how well it's selling.\nThe lower the BSR, the more sales it's getting.",

EVEN CREATING PASSIVE INCOME STREAMS TAKES TIME.\n\"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" - Warren Buffett\nWe live in exciting times. These days, thanks to technology, anyone can start making \"passive income\" online - or in other words, make money while they sleep, travel or work on other projects. In the past, passive income was reserved for the wealthy, the \"elite\"... but now? thanks to the internet, passive income can be achieved by anyone, anywhere.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn this comperhensive course, I'm going to show you several ways to make passive income online. This is a full ledge training course where I will be transferring all my exclusive methods to you that are proven to be effective. You can literally “copy & paste” my methods and apply to your business! Along with the video course, you will get instant access to resources that will help you implement these methods.\nYou will learn...\nDifferent types of passive (continous) income, and how to make money with each one of them.\n10 free and paid ways to generate traffic (no traffic = no sales, as anyone will tell you).\nHow to make money without the technical terms that prevent you from making it.\nAnd much, much more.\nBUT LISTEN.\nWhile this course is comperhensive and will teach you proven methods to make passive income, this is not a \"get rich quick\" scheme. You CANNOT get rich overnight (unless you win the lottery). Moreover, I'd recommend staying away from anything and anyone that can guarantee overnight wealth. Consider this a slow-and-steady path to making money online. And of course... if you don't implement these methods and stick with them, nothing is going to change!\nAre you ready to supercharge your profits?",

Finish your Udemy course and Contact us to get your Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Certificate!\n\n\nNo matter what you end up doing, working online is a marvellous opportunity and a magnificent way to enjoy more freedom and potentially greater earnings.\nIf you work online, means working from anywhere, that you can set your own pace to work at and that you can determine your salary.\nBut while working online is great, there are a lot of various forms that this can take and not all are made equal.\nIn other words, some online Home Businesses are more successful and more fun than others and if you’re working to provide a service like a web design, copywriting or coding, then basically you won’t be doing anything different from working for an employer.\nClients mean deadlines and they’re essentially very similar to bosses!\nWe firmly believe that becoming an authority blogger is the ultimate method to earn money online.\nFirstly, being an authority blogger means generating a passive income. You’ll have a website that will make money for you, but you won’t need to put in a lot of daily work for that to happen. The perfect Home Business.\nThat’s means; the ability to do things like\nDo work up front, and kick back to relax while the money comes in from advertisement, digital products sales, and sponsorship.\n\nHow and when you Write the occasional blog posts and do some promotion, will be up to you.\nYou won’t dread doing it as you’ll be writing about the topic that you enjoy and you’ll be doing things that you’re proud of doing.\n\nBe a celebrity: people read what you write, and leave comments and respond.\n\nFeel amazed when you compose a post that makes you proud of and that you poured your heart into, and then receive emails from people who read it and found it engaging.\n\nImagine the feeling when you stumble onto a forum where subscribers are discussing your ideas or recommending your blog!\n\nBecome an expert in the niche you love and get to spend all your time learning and writing about it!\n\nGet great potential earnings for a top blogger. The only limit is your ambition.\nAnd the list goes on.\nBecoming an Authority Blogger is a highly rewarding way to work and earn money online.\nBlogging for money, yes we said it.\nHow to make money Blogging?\nWe are often asked how to make money blogging so want in this course to lay out some necessary steps that we see most bloggers who earn a living from blogging go over.\nHere is how to make money starting a blog.\nSet up your blog\nStart creating useful content\nGet off your blog and start finding readers\nBuild engagement with the readers that come\nStart making money from the readership you have by one or more of a mixture of income streams\nSounds easy, doesn’t it! On some levels the method is simple – but you need to know up front that there’s a lot of each step and below we are going to give you some pointers on each.\nHere is how to make money starting a blog.\n1. Start a Blog\nTo make money blogging, you’re going to need to have one. While this is pretty clear, it is also a stumbling block for various Blogging Beginners who come to the idea of blogging with limited or no technical background.\nIf that’s you – don’t worry! It was our story too, and most bloggers start out feeling a little overwhelmed by the process of starting their blog.\n2. Create Useful Content\nA blog is never a blog without content, so once you’ve set it up, you need to focus your attention on creating valuable content. What you choose to create will depend a little on the subject that you decide to write about (most successful bloggers have some of their focus to their blogging whether that be a niche or a demographic that they write for).\nThe key to creating content is to have it as useful as possible. Focus upon creating content that changes people’s lives in any way will be the type of material that people will value the most and it will encourage people to know, like and trust you, which is essential if you later want to make money from your blog.\n3. Leave your blog and start finding readers\nAs you create the most valuable content that you possibly can, it is easy to get very insular with your focus and waste most of your time looking at building your blog. Several bloggers have a ‘build it, and they will come comprehension’ with their blogging, but this is a bit of a trap.\nIf you need to make money from your blog, you need to not only focus on building a magnificent blog, but it is also necessary to get off your blog and to begin promoting it.\nThere are many ways to experiment with building your blog’s audience, but it is essential to enter into all these strategies remembering that you should not just be searching for ‘traffic’ but ‘readers’.\nStart by thinking strictly about the type of reader you’d like to have read your blog. You might want to design an avatar of that reader (sometimes called a reader profile or persona) to help you work out who you’re trying to attract.\nOnce you know who you’re hoping to have read your blog, ask yourself where that type of person might already be hanging out online. Begin to list where they might be gathering:\nAre they reading specific blogs? List the top 3\nAre they participating in particular forums? List the top 3\nAre they listening to podcasts? List the top 3\nAre they engaging in particular social networks? List the top 3\nWhich accounts are they following on each of these social networks? List the top 3\nEach of these places that you readers might already be gathering has opportunities to develop a presence whether that be by leaving good comments, offering to create guest posts or just by being helpful and answering questions.\nWith such a list of blogs, focus, podcasts, social media accounts in hand you will have some good places to begin to hang out and create value.\nThe core is to build authority, to add value, to foster relationships – not to engage in spammy practices.\n4. Engage with the readers that come\nWith a maintained focus on creating extraordinary content and finding readers, you’ll start noticing more people visiting your blog and engaging with the content.\nAt this point, you will need to turn your focus to engaging with your audience and building a community.\nRespond to reader's comments, reach out to them and do everything that you can to keep them coming back again and again.\nLook after your readers well, and you’ll find they spread the word of your blog for you and support make your blog even more widely read.\nHaving an engaged reader is also much easier to make money from.\n5. Begin making money from the readership you have using one or more of a diversity of income streams\nOK – the first four steps of beginning a blog, creating content, finding readers and building engagement with those readers are important foundations that you do need to get in place before you can build long-term income for your blog.\nThere’s no doubt that what we’ve covered is a lot of work though if you do it well, you’ll be setting yourself up properly and giving yourself every opportunity of being able to make money from your blog.\nWith these foundations in place, you’re now set to start attempting to make money from your blog, but you do need to be conscious that just because you have set up your blog, have content and have engaged readers that the money won’t just automatically flow.\nIt takes continued work and experimentation to make money from your blog.\nTo make it easy to learn about the best methods for becoming a Top Blogger, we’ve put together a step-by-step guide that will teach you exactly how to do it.",

Otherwise, you wouldn't have started down this path in the first place!\nBut let us ask you this:\nAre you really reaching the biggest audience possible? Are you truly experiencing the fullest measure of enjoyment and satisfaction from helping the people you care about the most?\nAnd are you really creating the levels of wealth, freedom, and financial independence you know you deserve?\nLet us tell you something that may shock you:\nEven though we may not know you personally, the answer to most of these questions is probably “no.\"\nBut like the creators of this course - both bestselling authors, top-earning instructors, and renowned podcasters - you have the potential to achieve financial freedom and design your own independent lifestyle. And it can all start today, simply by understanding and using the same resources and techniques we've used to create our own six figure businesses.\nAnd it's not just about having no financial worries, traveling the world and essentially doing what we please at a moment's notice.\nIt's about creating value for others, improving lives, and touching entire communities. When you do that, your income explodes, and you can help even more people in ways that give you even more free time. It's a perfect circle.\nIf building a business like this interests you, then listen to each and every word we have to say, because this may be the most important message you ever hear:\nA short time ago, the ability to publish a book, or teach your own courses to tens of thousands of people, or produce your own radio show with worldwide syndication, and put those creations in front of the masses was unheard of. But there's a new industry growing like wildfire on the Internet.\nToday, you can take something like a book and multiply its impact by making it available in different forms on different media platforms to generate incredible - and passive - income streams for yourself. The \"ground floor\" opportunities to take part independently is enormous.\nAnd the projections for future growth are almost unbelievable.\nBut here's the thing:\nAlmost no one is multiplying their media across multiple platforms! Even some of the top-earning, New York Times Bestselling authors and thought leaders are leaving money on the table due to a lack of understanding and the misconception that all of this is “really quite difficult.\" It is not!\nThat means that you as a content creator have an exciting opportunity.\nAnd in this course, we are searching for those of you who are ready to enjoy higher earnings, reach more people and most importantly, start Branding You™. We will teach you the highly sought after science behind the Branding You™ 5+ Pillar Ecosystem Strategy, a paradigm that allows you to simultaneously create and manage various forms of media, to drive traffic and create cross-pollination between all of your assets. We will teach you how to build your own ecosystem from the ground up, turning it into a self-managing powerhouse of impact, revenue, and growth.\nYou'll learn:\n• How and why to set up your own blog and website\n• How and why to set up your own email list and social media\n• How and why to set up your own books, eBooks, and audiobooks\n• How and why to set up your own online courses\n• How and why to set up your podcast\n…and most importantly…\n• Exactly how to link all of these properties together to accelerate the growth, profits, and exposure of each individual product line\nYou'll also become part of the Branding You™ community, a lively group of up-and-coming information entrepreneurs collaborating and supporting one another to generate tens of millions in revenues!\nTake it from us: all of this is within your reach, and given the proper instructions and guidance, you can achieve your own multimedia empire quickly and painlessly.\nWant to learn more?

      "description": "Fire your boss and build a scalable full-time income with Facebook Marketplace dropshipping. Forget about paid Facebook Ads and testing a bunch of unprofitable items on Shopify that are eating into your profits and hard-earned money. Facebook Marketplace offers dropshippers over 100MM+ U.S. shoppers who are actively looking to purchase an item, and all that traffic is given to you for free. Facebook Marketplace is also the easiest way to get started with eCommerce and dropshipping, and is an essential opportunity for both expert & beginner dropshipper looking to expand their eCommerce portfolio.\nAnd a little bit about myself - my name is Andrey. I quit my full-time job at an advertising agency in October 2020 as a Paid Search Lead, as I was able to finally crack the dropshipping code, and now I want you to do the very same with me in this course. With this said, not only will you learn about Facebook Marketplace dropshipping from A-Z, but I will also show you how to scale this business model to a full-time level using a VA team, and Commerce Manager shops, a new focus by Facebook that is being heavily promoted by Facebook itself. Here are just a few topics that you can expect to find in this course:\n· Live Examples of Product Research, Listing, Pricing, and More From the Instructor\n· Creating Quality Listings from Top-to-Bottom to Maximize Conversion Rates\n· Finding Winning Products and U.S. Suppliers Using Several Methods\n· Handling Account Suspensions, Disapproved Items, Seller Metrics\n· Commerce Manager Shop Onboarding and Full UI Overview\n· Automating Efforts Using a VA Team and Advanced Software\n· Fulfilling Orders and Getting Around Amazon TBA Tracking\n· Handling Customer Service and Resolving Returns\n· And More!\nThis course will work the best for the U.S. residents, as Facebook Marketplace requires SSN verification for the shipping option, while Commerce Manager shops accept SSN and ITIN. I also have to be honest that it will be tough to achieve a scalable full-time income for international users, as Facebook does not like VPNs, and can disable your shipping option, and lock your account (personal experience), so international users please be warned in advance.\nMoreover, you can carry over your winning products from Facebook Marketplace and / or Commerce Manager using my methods and test them on any other platforms such as eBay, Shopify, Etsy, Mercari, Amazon, and more. In other words, treat Facebook Marketplace as your starting experimental product testing platform, and scale from there to other sales channels (just gave you a free tip, by the way).\nSo with all of this said, if you are in the U.S. and are looking to finally quit your day job, fire your boss, and build a scalable full-time income with Facebook Marketplace dropshipping and eCommerce - you came to the right place! I included a preview video if you are interested in learning more, and I will always be available within 24 hours to answer your questions on Udemy, Instagram, and/or LinkedIn.\nReady to make this happen?

      "description": "Recently we collaborated with Alibaba to update our course content (including adding many new lectures) making it one of the only Amazon FBA courses to be endorsed by Alibaba, the leading platform for global wholesale trade.\n\n\nThe Enormous Amazon FBA Opportunity\nYou already know there is a huge Amazon FBA opportunity. But you probably don’t know exactly how huge it really is…\nIn the next 15 seconds I will explain why so many people, just like you, are enormously excited…\nLast year, in 2016, Amazon’s 200 plus million customers purchased $136 billion dollars worth of product.\nMost importantly, 45%+ of those sales came from third-party sellers (these are people just like you)\nIn 2016, 100,000 of these people each made over $100,000 in sales from their Amazon FBA business.\n\n\nOn Amazon 100,000 People Made Over $100,000 In Sales Last Year\nI graduated from Penn State University and our football stadium is one of the biggest in the world, holding a little over 100,000 people. Imagine every single seat in that stadium filled with someone that made over $100,000 in sales from their FBA business!\nNot only is the Amazon FBA opportunity enormous, it also keeps growing! 2016 was another record-breaking year for the company.\nIt’s easy to see why you’re so excited to start your own Amazon FBA business.\nSo, what’s the problem?\n\n\nThe 3 Roadblocks That Are Stopping You\nWe received 60 survey responses to this question and discovered there are 3 roadblocks that stop most people from creating their Amazon FBA business.\nI bet that at least one of these is stopping you right now.\nRoadblock #1 - You have a lack of knowledge of what to do and the more you try to learn the more overwhelmed you feel.\nRoadblock #2 - You have a fear of failing. And of those fears the strongest is losing the money you invest\nRoadblock #3 - You don’t know how to find the right product to sell\nIn other words… You don’t have the right knowledge and are afraid of failing and losing your money.\n\n\nThe More You Try To Get The 'Right Knowledge' The More Overwhelmed You Feel\nIt’s an annoying problem. The more time you spend searching for the ‘right knowledge’ on how start an Amazon FBA business the more overwhelmed you feel.\nAnd the more overwhelmed you feel the greater your fear of failing and losing your money becomes.\nEventually this fear will grow to the point where you give up on starting an Amazon FBA business.\nOr, instead of giving up you will say, “I will just start my Amazon FBA business later.”\nBut we both know that “later” will never come. And even IF you were to start later, the opportunity won’t be as great as it is now because of increasing competition.\nCan you imagine how many people who would have successfully made a $100,000 per year Amazon FBA business didn’t because they gave up before they even started?\n\n\nIn 2013 And With Only $500 Erik Started His Amazon FBA Business\nAfter years of selling items on eBay, Erik was getting tired of doing everything himself.\nEvery few weeks a new shipment of products would arrive to his apartment. He packaged every single one of those products himself and made daily trips to the local post office.\nHe was making money but hadn’t created the profitable business he wanted. Instead he had created a full-time job.\nIn 2013 Erik first heard about Amazon FBA. The idea was exciting! All he would have to do is ship all his products to Amazon and they would do the work for him.\n\n\nAt First, Erik's Amazon FBA Business Was Failing\nWith less than $500 to invest Erik decided to try starting an Amazon FBA business. Did he have immediate success? Nope. It was failing, fast.\nHe was a small step away from giving up on the Amazon platform completely. He decided to give it one last chance. This was it.\nHe started tweaking his Amazon listings and the sales slowly started to increase.\nMost people would say this small amount of success was not worth the effort. But Erik saw the potential. This led him to spend years figuring Amazon out.\nIn this process he wasted huge amounts of time and money but he was learning. To him that was the most important thing.\n\n\nAfter Years of Trial And Error Erik Learned A TON And Now Has $11,231 in Sales Each Month\nOver time he turned his original $500 investment in Amazon to an Amazon FBA business that today generates $11,231 per month. And the best part?\nHe only spends 2 hours of work a week maintaining it.\nHe became one of those 100,000 people in Beaver Stadium.\nBut It wasn’t until Erik started teaching Amazon FBA to one of his friends that things got interesting…\n\n\nErik Found The Most Important Part Of Creating A Profitable Amazon FBA Business\nAfter years of experience Erik realized the MOST important part of creating a profitable Amazon FBA business was selecting the right product.\nIt is also the first place every beginner should start when creating their Amazon business.\nEarlier we talked about the 3 roadblocks that stop people. To help you overcome these challenges we knew our course had to be different.\nBy combing the expertise of myself, an eLearning Expert teaching over 42,000 students, and Erik Rogne, an Amazon FBA expert, we have created a unique course that solves all 3 of these roadblocks.\n\n\nThe Solution To The Three Roadblocks That Are Stopping You\nRoadblock Number #1 - You have a lack of knowledge of what to do and the more you try to learn the more overwhelmed you feel.\nOur Solution: We made this course action focused. That feeling of being overwhelmed and lack of knowledge comes from learning too much but not taking action.\nIn 25 of the videos in our course you get 1 action step to complete. Then we walk you through, step-by-step, exactly how to complete that step.\n\n\nRoadblock Number #2 - You have a fear of failing. And of those fears the strongest is losing the money you invest\nOur Solution: Almost everyone that fails on Amazon FBA and loses their investment did so because they chose the wrong product.\nThat is why we decided to focus our entire course on this subject. It’s that important!\n\n\nRoadblock Number #3 - You don’t know how to find the right product to sell\nOur Solution: We’ve taken all the guesswork and chance out of this process. You will be watching over our shoulder as we walk you through every step of finding a profitable product.\nTo make things even easier we’ve created 11 PDF resources that do all the work for you.\nThis PDFs tell you what factors make a product a good one. Your product either passes or it doesn’t.\nYou can’t do it wrong.\n\n\nOur Brand New Course Is Already Helping 2,000+ Students Learn The Right Knowledge And Take Action!\nOur course was released in February 2017 and already it has helped students learn the right knowledge, overcome their fear of failure and most importantly given them the confidence to take action!\n\n\nVery informative, perfect pace, and more importantly…interactive!\n-Robbie Hartzell\n\n\nThis is the best course on Amazon FBA  I have come across. It contains everything  needed for your Amazon FBA journey…\n-Elearning Guru\n\n\nGreat information, well structured  and organized. Very good job!\n-Onofrei Razvan\n\n\nClear, systematic, informative,  well structured, and of course very practical.\nThis course makes the process from  researching products and suppliers  to ordering your products easy.\n-Kagiso\n\n\nHere Is Our Offer:\nYou get 40 confusion-crushing videos\n25 of those videos are action-based\n11 Interactive PDF forms that do all the work for you\nBONUS: Excel Definition List - Learn the insider language\nBONUS: Excel Profit Margin Calculator - Calculates profit margin automatically\nBONUS: Excel Supplier Comparison Sheet - Organize and compare all your potential suppliers\nBONUS: Access to our FB community (150+ members and growing)\n\n\n30-Day No Questions Asked Money Back Guarantee\nFor $200 you get lifetime access to all of this material, the bonuses, our FB community and answers to any questions you have.\nYou also get Udemy’s no questions asked 30-day money back guarantee.

Say \"Goodbye\" to frustrating dreams about being your own boss and \"Hello\" to your new career as a respected copywriter.\n\n\nIN THIS COURSE YOU WILL LEARN:\nA researched & proven 10 step system for writing optimized sales copy for any format (sales letter, banner, sales pages, ad copy etc.)\nWhat copywriting is and why it's a great career opportunity\nHow to structure the elements of a sales page or commercial to get the best results\nHow to get your first paid freelance copywriting work in 7 days\nHow to build a $1000/m part-time side income\nHow to build a full-time copywriting business or use your skills to get a normal 9-5 job at an advertising agency.\nHow to turn your copywriting skills into $1000/m passive income (Bonus lecture)\n\n\nHERE'S WHY MY STUDENTS ARE EXCITED!\n\"Top notch course! This course is well thought out, organized, and packed with actionable information. I am confident that after applying what I have learned I will be able to secure well-paying copywriting jobs. I like that there is an interactive element to the course and that Ivan gives concrete examples of what he is teaching. I am very happy with my purchase, and I recommend this course to anyone thinking about pursuing a career as a copywriter.\"\n- Erica Pless, USA\n\n\nGUARANTEE\nIf within 30 days of using the Lumpy Mail method you haven’t seen the results you expected (or for any other reason) please, get a Udemy-backed refund and spend the money elsewhere. I only want satisfied customers.\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nWho are you? My name is Ivan Westen. I have 10 years of experience running a business owner. I run several e-commerce businesses in Europe and I sell web design to businesses in a variety of sectors. Copywriting has been a central part of my business and in my 10 years of doing business, I have continually worked on improving my skills as a copywriter and i have used these skills to sell a lot of products on my own sites as helped clients with their sales copy.\nWhat's in it for you? I get paid for teaching you step-by-step how to write sales copy and become a professional copywriter part- or full time. I use the money you pay me to buy coffee and diapers for my daughter + I love seeing my students succeed.\nI have no experience as a writer - Will this course work for me? Yes, it will. The 10 Step Copywriter System is made for beginners that know nothing about copywriting. The system teaches you to write optimized copywriting by breaking copywriting principles down to simple mathematical formulas that can be learned and applied by anyone. I have focused on making it as simple to grasp as possible, and my experience is that most students learn it pretty quickly, even with no experience.\nHow much can I expect to earn? It depends. A beginning copywriter will usually make $30-$50 an hour and an experienced will make $100 an hour. Then it's just up to you to decide how many hours you want to work (since there is an endless supply of companies that needs freelance copywriters - I show you where to find them in the course). A yearly salary of $100.000 is not uncommon for many freelance copywriters.\nCan you guarantee the 10 Step Copywriter System will work for me? To become a professional copywriter you have got to WANT it to happen. It takes effort to build a job replacing income. But, if you are just out to get a $500 side income, this can be done very fast. But, as with all things, it takes effort. So, naturally, I can't guarantee that you will have success, but If you make an effort there is a high probability that you will.\nAnd if for some reason you do not like your results – just get a refund.\nDoes it work in other languages than English? It sure does. I'm from Europe and I primarily use the system in my native language Danish. The principles and formulas for writing sales copy are universal and can be used in any language.\n\n\nARE YOU READY TO BECOME A PAID COPYWRITER 7 DAYS FROM NOW?\nPlease press the \"Take This Course\" button on top to start your new career!",

      "description": "Master Contactless Payments and the Future of Digital Transactions!\nIn a world rapidly shifting towards contactless solutions, driven by the ever-expanding reach of smartphones, swift transactions, and the ongoing impact of COVID-19, the preference for contactless payments is surging. Why? because they're not only speedy but also remarkably secure. Unlike physical cards, contactless cards are a tough nut to crack when it comes to data cloning.\nBefore you embark on this transformative journey, please take a moment to delve into our comprehensive curriculum. It's your portal to mastering the skills needed to thrive in contactless payments.\nCourse Highlights:\nExplore the Dynamics of Contactless Payments\nUnveil the Magic of Near Field Communication (NFC)\nDecode Host Card Emulation (HCE) and RFID-Based Digital Payments\nUnderstand the Difference between Embedded Secure Element (eSE) and HCE\nVenture into the World of Bluetooth Payments\nMeet the Giants: Android Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay\nDiscover the Innovation of MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission)\nTackle Risk and Mitigation Strategies\nGet a Glimpse into the Technology and Backend Processes\nImmerse Yourself in the Realms of FinTech, Mobile Payment Systems, and Payment Processing\nJourney through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-Based Payments\nDelve into PayPal Video on Beacon-Based Payments\nNear-field communication (NFC) is a game-changer. It's a wireless data transfer method that allows devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets to share information when they're in close proximity, typically within a 2-inch radius. While it may sound like Bluetooth, NFC technology uses less power and functions exclusively when devices are nearby, eliminating the need for device discovery or manual synchronisation.\nNFC technology plays a pivotal role in contactless peer-to-peer payments through mobile wallets such as Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, as well as contactless cards. To accept these cutting-edge payment methods, you'll need specialised card readers. As the world increasingly embraces these technologies, especially in the era of COVID-19, NFC and HCE are becoming paramount in the realm of Digital Payments.\nWe're thrilled to simplify and demystify this essential contactless digital payment method, making it accessible to everyone in the FinTech and digital banking industry. Join us on this enlightening journey, and let's explore the future of digital transactions together.\nSee you in the course, where your journey toward expertise begins. Happy Learning!\nWith Best Regards,\nThe Global FinTech Academy\n\"If It's FinTech, Learn From Us\"",

      "description": "Want a fast way to fill your bank account with an extra $500... $1,000... Even $10,000 or more by the end of next week?\nThen you need to\nwatch the video above\nand read every word on this page. That's because on this page you will discover a brain dead simple way to earn 6 or even 7-figures…\nWithout having to leave your home…\nWithout having to do any hard selling...\nIn fact you can run this business in just 20 minutes a day all over email and see your first payment by this time next week.\nFact:\nLocal mom and pop businesses have a MAJOR problem that is affecting their business and is costing them customers.\nMore and more customers are turning to online review sites like Yelp for recommendations on where to take their business. Reviews on these sites can make or break a business, well reviewed businesses can get a flood of customers from these sites while a business with bad reviews are left in the dust.\nTheir problem is your opportunity...\nBiz owners are willing an eager to pay $500 per month or more to anyone who can solve this problem for them. $500 is peanuts compared to the amount of money they are losing by not taking control of their online reputation.\nThe good news is that only costs around $100 to hire a service that monitors their online reputation and improve their scores on review sites. That leaves you with a profit of $400/month for EVERY biz owner you connect to this service.\nA simple Google search turns up hundreds of thousands of businesses across the country that have not claimed their yelp listing and need help managing their online reputation. Many businesses don't know about this problem, and one's who do feel helpless to fix it!\nA single email is all it takes...\nI've been emailing the business owners about this problem and getting replies of them thanking me for pointing it out and asking to hire me to fix it.\nI usually book a new client for every 20 emails I send out to business owners.\nWith the explosive popularity of online review sites, there are more businesses that need this than there are consultants that can help them.\nThis opportunity is only getting bigger.\nThere are simply more businesses in the country who need this service than there are people who can help them. The reputation management industry is set to explode in 2018, and I’ve decided to put together a Udemy course to help you get in on the action.\nBy the end of this Udemy master class, you will:\nFlood your inbox with biz owners who are eager to pay you $497 a month or more to help them with this problem.\nFill your bank account with monthly payments that arrive like clockwork on the 1st of every month.\nEarn a profit every month as a middle man by connecting these biz owners to the services that can help them.\nAnd to help you get started earning money even faster, I have put together an exclusive bonus package for $438 if you were to buy these items on my website individually.\nInside this free package you are getting:\nDone-For-You sales video that sells this service (\n$197 value\n) - How would you like to only hear from business owners after they have paid your fee? Let this proven video do all the selling for you so you can wake up tomorrow to your first pay check.\nCopy-paste cold emails to send out to business owners (\n$97 value)\n- Just copy and paste these emails to 5 businesses a day and you will have landed your first paying client in a week's time.\nOver the shoulder walkthrough video that you can follow along with (\n$47 value\n) - Set this up correctly the first time by following along in my over shoulder video.\nBonus client work agreement (\n$97 value\n) – Lock biz owners into an annual contract that guarantees you get paid every month for this service.\nNormally these bonuses would cost you $438 if you bought them on my Success With Luther site, however they are yours FREE when you enroll in this Udemy master class.\nJust imagine it: Each night this week you perform a simple Google search to find businesses that need this help...\nYou send just 5 of them an email before you go to bed…\nYou wake up in the morning next week and see that first $497 payment in your back account... The first of many to come in that week.\nAll it took was 20 minutes each night to send a few emails before bed.\nThink about it:\nIt only takes about 20 cold emails sent to the right businesses to land a paying client.\n20 cold emails nets you 1 new client paying $500/month\n200 emails would land you 10 clients earning $5,000 a month\n2,000 emails would land you 100 clients and earn you $50,000 a month\nHow fast can you send out that first batch of 20 emails?\nDisclaimer:\nthis won’t work for everyone.\nMost people who enroll in Udemy courses watch the videos and don’t take any action, and NEVER see any results. Earning money with any online business requires work, it requires you take what you learn and apply it in the real world.\nIf you are the type of person who expects results without having to do any work, then this program is not for you. However, if you are willing to dedicate the time to watch this training and put in just 20 minutes a day for the next week into growing your income…\nThen this is not just another Udemy course for you.\nThis is the ONLY program you will ever need.\nSo, let’s make this a complete no brainer for you ok?\nSee if you were to join my exclusive business coaching program to learn this method you would have to pay my coaching fee of  $2,500. I’m sure you'd agree $2500 is a small price to pay considering you will earn 6-figures a year as a result am I right?\nThe retail price of this course outside of Udemy is $497... which is a total bargain considering the results previous customers are already seeing with this training.\nHowever, being new to publishing on Udemy I want to make this course a no-brainer for you. So if you are on this page now, consider yourself lucky, that's because you're getting in on this program at less than half what everyone else will pay.\nYou won't be paying my consulting fee of $2,500 today… nor will you be paying the retail price of $497, not even half that!\nYou are receiving the entire consulting training course, the bonus restaurant website software, the done for you sales material in a copy-paste format, and all the done-for-you sales bonuses all for one easy payment of just $X.\nListen:\nDon't decide right now.\nTake advantage of my 'First client in 30 days' guarantee. Just try this course out for a full 30 days on me…\nWatch the training videos and spend 20 minutes a day sending out these copy/paste emails to business owners in your local area. If you don't land at least one client...\nIf you are not totally satisfied with the training...\nOr even if you don't like the font I use in my videos, anything at all...\nJust send me an email or support ticket with the word refund and I will send you back every penny. No questions asked, no hassles. You can even keep the bonus software and eBooks as a thank you for trying out my first Udemy course.\nAs long as you have actually watched the videos, and given this course a real shot, I am personally promising that you will be satisfied - a promise backed with an iron-clad 100% money backed guarantee. That's a powerful promise for just $X am I right?\nClick on the green button, the one that says 'take this course now' to get started in this course.\nRemember:\nThe sooner you can get started the sooner you will become the 'goto' expert in your local area. This high ground will make you the authority for online consulting and businesses will naturally flock you.\nSeeing that first payment land in your PayPal account from a business owner who needs your help is LIFE CHANGING. It’s an experience that can’t be put into words… The pride, and confidence that comes with it… Knowing that YOU have the power to generate income on demand and you will never have to worry about money ever again.\nIt’s an experience I want YOU to have, and one that I am willing to personally promise you.\nClick on the ‘take this course’ button now to lock in your discounted price. Follow the instructions on the next page to get started today on this life-changing course. I will see you inside with some extra surprise bonuses.",

      "description": "The Complete Etsy Print-on-Demand Store & Product Creation using USA-based suppliers.\nDuring this course, you can expect to learn the ins and outs of Esty, Shopify, Dropshipping, and Facebook Ads.\nIt seems like a lot but we walk you through the process, step-by-step, so it's easy to understand and even simpler to implement.\nWe dive into product research and creation first. During this time, we are going to find \"passion products\" that we can dropship ourselves. These are products that are considered 'impulse buys' because they are generally for a loved one during a special time.\nWe all know how we spend more than we have to during gift seasons.\nWe're going to be taking advantage of these moments.\nOnce we begin generating sales on Etsy, we are going to expand into our very own Shopify store so that we can keep more of each sale!\nSince Shopify isn't going to send us buyers (like Etsy does), we are going to branch off into Facebook Ads to begin sending ourselves waves of customers.\nIf Facebook Ads seems like a daunting task, don't worry - I used to be petrified of them as well.\nUntil I learned to K.I.S.S. - (keep it simple, stupid!)\nWe use a very basic and easy to follow strategy called the 5 CBO Method. This is where we test 5 quick audiences with simple ad structures and Facebook will figure out which one is best!\nSo to recap, this will be the progress we are making throughout the course:\nWe're going to get started with product research and ideas. We need to find that flagship product we want to sell as our own.\nOnce we have our product and confirm our USA supplier, we are going to get into branding. We're building a REAL business, not a quick dropshipping store. We need to look authentic.\nAfter that, we're going to build our Etsy store and upload our products, making sure they are optimized for conversions.\nAt the end of our Etsy phase, we are going to activate ads and see how quickly we can generate sales!\nOnce we've confirmed our product is a winner, we will expand our store into Shopify.\nAfter Shopify is fully set up and designed - we are going to activate Facebook Ads!\nFrom there, it's all about managing customers, orders, and scaling your ads.\nI hope to see you inside the course!",

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to the “Amazon FBA Sourcing Alibaba Listing Product & Sell on Amazon” course.\nAmazon FBA Course- Sourcing Alibaba for Amazon (FBA, Dropshipping, Wholesale) & Product Listing & PPC, Selling on Amazon\n\nAmazon FBA is a great way to launch a successful business from home. OAK Academy's features courses taught by entrepreneurs and business professionals alike that will show you how to set up and make money with your FBA account right away, even if your starting budget is small. Amazon fba, amazon, fba, amazon fba course, amazon seller, sellng on amazon, amazon fba wholesale, amazon ppc, amazon fba private label,\nAlthough I have no experience with Amazon FBA, I feel a lot more comfortable after taking this course. I am currently a paralegal that is searching for the freedom to live a less hectic lifestyle. I have just purchased a product that I am excited to test out and look forward to sharing the results. Amazon fba, amazon, alibaba, amazon fba canada, selling on amazon, alibaba amazon, alibaba to amazon fba, fba, sourcing, amazon fba selling, sell on amazon\nStarting an Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) account is a great way to eliminate some of the annoying logistics associated with running your own home business. Rather than source, package, and ship products yourself, Amazon takes care of the hassle by storing and then fulfilling your orders for you.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon. com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because of sellers who use Amazon. com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon. com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon. com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse. Not only does this take the packing and shipping burden off your shoulders, but it also means you can offer Prime shipping to those 200 million Amazon Prime members — who on average spend over 4 times as much as non-Prime shoppers.\nUsing FBA also means Amazon takes responsibility for any problems that arise during shipping, like late shipments, damaged items, or other issues. Your reputation as a seller doesn't take a hit.\nOne of the most common questions asked by new Amazon sellers is, “Where can I buy products to sell on Amazon?\n“While there are a few different answers to this question, an experienced seller’s answer will most likely be, “On Alibaba.”\nAlibaba is a great place for sellers of all experience levels to source millions of different products that you can private label and brand. Many businesses rely on getting profitable products from Alibaba to Amazon FBA.\nIf you are unfamiliar with Alibaba and how it works, it can be overwhelming. In this Course, we’re going to go over everything you need to know about Alibaba amazon, so you can successfully source quality products for your private label Amazon FBA course business.\nWhy do Amazon sellers use Alibaba?\nMany Amazon sellers use amazon alibaba to source products because of the simplicity of its user-friendly site and well, the low prices. Most manufacturers that you come across on the platform will be based in China, where they can produce quality goods at a much more affordable price than, say, in the United States or Canada.\nAny seller can go to import from Alibaba right now and search for the type of product they’re interested in selling and come across thousands of potential suppliers. Finding a manufacturer for your product has never been easier.\nWhat is Amazon FBA?\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a service Amazon offers its third-party sellers. Using FBA amazon, sellers send their goods to one of Amazon’s fulfillment centers, and Amazon ships the items to the customer. Customers who buy FBA products usually get their items rather quickly. When an item sells, employees pick and pack the order and it leaves the warehouse shortly after the sale. Amazon’s shipping partners, including the USPS, work hard to ensure timely delivery. Even companies that don’t deliver on Sundays will ship FBA products seven days a week. It’s fairly simple to use FBA. Sellers must contact Amazon after they prepare their listings. They provide several details, including product information and the quantity they plan on sending. Amazon tells the seller where to send the shipment and they handle deal it from there. You can achieve, amazon fba private label, amazon fba wholesale, Amazon fba product research, amazon fba canada, free amazon fba, amazon private label.\nIn this course, You will succeed amazon ppc, amazon marketing, amazon advertising, amazon ads, ecommerce marketing, retail arbitrage, ecommerce, e commerce, php, amazon ppc, google shopping, ecommerce website, ecommerce marketing, amazon dropshipping, shopify development, amazon.\nIs Shopify better than Amazon?\nSelling on Shopify using Amazon’s FBA service requires a different mindset than selling on Amazon with FBA. Other than in a few specialty categories, Amazon’s referral fees range between 8% and 17% of the sale amount. People who sell on Shopify try to avoid these fees, but there’s a reason why people gladly pay Amazon’s referral fees. Amazon attracts buyers from around the world to its platform, while Shopify sellers have to do their own marketing to sell their products. Shopify sellers also aim to build a brand without being subject to Amazon’s regulations. For example, Amazon does not allow its sellers to contact buyers. Many people feel that engaging customers is the best way to grow a business. Each of the platforms has its advantages, but people who want to list items without having to market them should definitely sell on Amazon.\nShould I Sell on Amazon or eBay?\neBay and Amazon have distinct platforms. Deciding which one to use depends on your goals and what you're looking to sell. Amazon, in general, has a much higher sales volume than eBay. Many sellers choose Amazon because they feel they could earn more money there. While this is true in a lot of cases, some items do perform better on eBay. Amazon is the more restrictive of the two, so there are some products that you can only sell on eBay. For example, Amazon doesn’t allow used clothing sales. For many products, you need preauthorization before you sell them on Amazon. eBay has fewer guidelines for creating listings. If you only plan on selling a few pieces of each item, you might want to stick with eBay. Either way, both Amazon and eBay are great options for most sellers.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because sellers who use Amazon com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\n\nDropshipping is an order fulfillment option that allows e-commerce businesses to outsource procuring, storing, and shipping products to a third party. This order fulfillment method appeals to entrepreneurs seeking low overhead and low capital investments, but it can come at a cost.\nEcommerce is competitive. Dropshipping may appeal to entrepreneurs looking to sell generic products, but it can limit opportunities to build a brand or differentiate products. Thus, businesses that use drop shipping may wind up competing on price, leading to low margins.\nIf you are considering drop shipping for your eCommerce business, there are several factors you should review—including some variations and alternatives that offer similar benefits.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse.

You will have the choice of offering physical products to your buyers.\nWhat will you learn in this course?\nGetting started with focus and mindset while organizing and planning tasks\nSetting up your eCommerce website the right way\nPicking a niche and doing keyword research for that niche\nHow to design your site and pick a theme\nMaximizing conversions to get more buyers\nBasic overview of eCommerce SEO\nPromoting your eCommerce site with Social Media\nUsing free and paid advertising to promote your site\nOutsourcing Virtual Assistants to help you build your site faster\nLearning the basics of Email marketing for eCommerce\nMoving beyond Amazon Affiliates - Selling on Amazon & eBay\nWorking with Dropshippers and buying products Wholesale\nHow long is the course?\nThis course is split up into 6 weeks, each week you are provided with homework so you have tasks to complete after watching the modules and reading through the content.\nIt may take longer than 6 weeks to complete the entire program, the course is designed to allow you to create a part time or even full time eCommerce store if you choose to do so.\nMost of the advice I provide allows you to make sales without a ton of commitment when it comes to purchasing physical inventory. You can start slow and grow as you make progress through the course.\nCheck out these awesome testimonials!\n\"Found this just as I started work on an Amazon site. Really useful advice on how to set up shop. I'm implementing now and honestly, that alone will save me the next few days of my life at this point in my project.\nThat's worth the price of entry alone!\nBut the course has a lot more to give: outsourcing tips, sensible approach to promotion. Also heaps of stuff on FBA and other things beyond Amazon affiliate that held no interest and I thought weren't really for me, but I can now see offer a lot of potential for growth of my store down the line. Great stuff. I also appreciate the straight up approach here.\nNo typical marketers fluff, filler, hype or BS. Just laying out what seems solid advice and an action plan that will get you up and running in short order. You know the course is solid, as John walks through the set up of one of his sites, which is a cut above the usual robo-Azon affiliate spam site.\nEven outsourcing leaves the hassle of managing workers, as we all know. It'd also be better if the intro gave some idea of the minimum kinds of investment of time and money you should expect to put in to get any result.\n\n\nOf course, you can keep it passive, but consumers are more savvy than they've ever been. So i'd suggest getting into this with a view to build out and up: in which case the the slog begins.\" - Paul Andrews\n\"Start off gently as an as an Amazon Affiliate and then transition into your own eCommerce juggernaut. John will show you how it's done and demonstrate the software that makes it possible, easy and profitable.\" - Dr. Phillips\n\"This course is way more than just about Amazon Affiliates. Anyone starting an online business will also benefit from this course there is so much information in here and very useful information. John does a great job keeping you engaged in what he has to say, he's very knowledgeable and shows proof that he knows his stuff! Thanks for a great course John.\" - S Howard\n\"I've used Wordpress for years so when I saw this course focused on the WooCommerce plugin I decided to give it a shot. It really is a comprehensive course covering everything you need to know about starting your own Amazon affiliate store.\" - Glen Thonis\n\"I'm very happy to have subscribed and this is a perfect course if you want to setup your own ecommerce store. John is an expert and his advises are very practical and easy to follow. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole course and i have already started implementing them into my own business.\" - Hussain Ahmed",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nThe share of online purchases is constantly growing. We have a lot of pure players, but also traditional businesses that build their own e-commerce business units. Consulting firms are quite often hired to help analyze and improve e-commerce businesses. Those projects are interesting yet challenging. Luckily, there are a lot of interesting techniques and frameworks that will help you analyze and model e-commerce during consulting projects. In this course, I will teach how to perform fast and efficiently different types of analyses related to e-commerce.\nIn the course, you will learn the following things:\nThe drivers of the e-commerce business model\nConduct analyses of e-commerce in Excel during consulting projects\nHow to model an e-commerce business in Excel\nHow to analyze potential improvements in e-commerce\nHow to model marketplaces\nHow to do funnel analysis in e-commerce\nHow to measure and lower the costs of acquiring customers (CAC)\nHow to measure and increase the Lifetime Value of the Customer (LTV)\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from the Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who are now Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that, my courses on Udemy have already been taken by more than 315 000 students, including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excel files as well as additional presentations and materials shown in the lectures. Therefore, as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nE-commerce has become an important business unit for the majority of Retailers and Consumer Brands (especially FMCG and SMCG). It behaves differently from traditional businesses, and you have to adjust your approach to the new situation. Most firms don’t give you the full toolbox that you need. This may lead to huge frustration during consulting projects and a lot of inefficiencies.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students understand or refresh the main skills and tools that they will need during consulting projects devoted to e-commerce. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do during consulting projects devoted to e-commerce. You will master how to analyze data and draw conclusions from the analyses.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst, you have to have a pretty decent understanding of the e-commerce business model. That is why I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those who did not finish business school. The course will help you become an expert in e-commerce at the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience, as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that, thanks to the course, you will learn:\nThe drivers of the e-commerce business model\nConduct analyses of e-commerce in Excel during consulting projects\nHow to model an e-commerce business in Excel\nHow to analyze potential improvements in e-commerce\nHow to model marketplaces\nHow to do funnel analysis in e-commerce\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is currently divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little introduction to the course, as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nEssential Concepts. We will start with some essential concepts around e-commerce. This will help us later on with more advanced issues. We will also see how to create a basic e-commerce model in Excel.\nModeling Cash Flow in e-commerce. In the previous section, we showed you how to do a simple business model in Excel for e-commerce. In this section, we will concentrate on modeling the Cash Flow in a simple way.\nFunnel Analysis. Funnel Analysis can be used to map and analyze a series of events that lead to a particular goal. In this section, we will discuss what a funnel analysis is and how you can use it to achieve better business results.\nSales Funnels by Cohorts. Quite often, you want to go deeper and analyze what the sales funnel looks like for different segments and cohorts. This is when cohort analysis comes in handy. We will discuss it in this section.\nAdvanced model of e-commerce. In some cases, you will have to create more complex models of e-commerce. In this section, we will see how this can be done in practice.\nCustomer Acquisition. Without customer acquisition, you will not enjoy much growth. In e-commerce, you will spend a lot of time optimizing and finding more optimal ways to acquire customers. In this section, you will learn how to analyze and optimize customer acquisition.\n2-sided market. Many e-commerce businesses will try to expand their business by becoming a marketplace, which is a type of 2-sided market. We will discuss it in this section.\nMultichannel. In this section, we will discuss the so-called multichannel, and I will show you the main challenges in this concept\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\nUseful frameworks and techniques\nAnalyses showed in the course\nAdditional resources\nLinks to additional presentations, articles, and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will learn:\nThe drivers of the e-commerce business model\nConduct analyses of e-commerce in Excel during consulting projects\nHow to model an e-commerce business in Excel\nHow to analyze potential improvements in e-commerce\nHow to model marketplaces\nHow to do funnel analysis in e-commerce\nWho should take this course?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness Analysts\nManagers\nFinancial Controllers\nInvestment Analysts\nStartup Founders\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics\nBasic or intermediate knowledge of finance & accounting",

If you are struggling to achieve your goals on Amazon FBA, this course has the tools to keep you moving on the right track. A few years ago, I bought the most expensive course on the market (around $5000), but received less value than this amazing course for a few bucks. Sumner does an excellent job of breaking the content down for everyone to understand. Thank you Sumner :).” - Ardie L\n\n\n“Do yourself a favor and buy this course if you are interested in Amazon FBA. Sadly, I must say that I purchased this course when it was on sale, but it would definitely be worth the full price as this course is amazing. I will admit that I was one of those idiots that purchased expensive courses for learning Amazon FBA. Other than a few courses on Udemy I also purchased a course at $400 and purchased a mentorship at $1,350 and then purchased another course on Amazon and Ranking that was $5,000. The funny thing is, is that I keep coming back to this course to learn. This course far surpasses the value of the other courses I had purchased and it was not even 1/4th the price.” - Eric N\n\n\n“It is kind of hard to describe the quantity of information Sumner communicates in this course. It's a long course (19.5hrs). During the whole time Sumner is fresh, prepared and he clearly explains all topics. And I mean ALL topics. He covers all areas of Amazon FBA but then goes further with pointers to other aspects of e-commerce which you can explore. I have an amazing number of new bookmarks pointing to critical tools in my browser and a huge number of bookmarks within the course. The bookmarks within the course will be my guideposts to go back and review topics as they come up in my business, which I'm sure they will. If you are going to do Amazon FBA take this course. It will take you a while to go through it but you will thank the e-commerce spirits for guiding you to it. Best of luck and Here's to a prosperous year. Thank you Sumner!” - Erbium D\n\n\n“First of all, if you want to learn about all things Amazon, but find those Amazon Seller courses advertised on Youtube obnoxious and over the top, this Udemy course is for you. This is a nuts and bolts, no-nonsense course, filled with loads of relevant and insightful content. The instructor provides not only the basics, but goes above and beyond in offering tips, tricks, and loads of professional advice on the marketing side of the business (I believe his university focus was on marketing--so this is a pleasant surprise). I believe Sumner found a gap in this AMZ seller education market, and has filled the niche nicely with top-notch course material, great referrals, and attentive responses to student questions. I took the course at a steep discount, however easily worth the full $200 value.” - Cory T\n\n\n\"Life changing\" indeed as the instructor promised at the beginning. If one listens to every word and takes massive action, the world is yours! These words are coming from someone who has tested out too many courses in the market. Just checked my Udemy course purchases to validate. :)” - Guatam P\n\n\n“I have no experience with Amazon sales. His lessons are great for me so far because they are detailed, and he explains every step of the process. I actually appreciate that he speaks fast so that we can get through each lesson quickly. I can always pause and replay if I miss something, so I don't know why some reviewers complained about that. So far, I am really learning a lot of valuable information.” - Cori V\n\n\n“Excellent course! Much more content and information than what I expected. I will definitely start my Amazon FBA business using the information I received here. Thanks Sumner for all your information and help.” - Ferdinand G\n\n\n\"Great course, gives some great pointers and tips on how to scale your Amazon business. It also provides A LOT of tools and extra's to download - these tools alone make the course very much worth it!” - Yosief E\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have EVERY SINGLE tool, template, and resource you need to consistently sell HIGHLY profitable products on Amazon FBA for years to come.\n\n\nStudents who enroll today will gain my 15 Amazon FBA tools & templates for 100% FREE.\n\n\n30 DAY GUARANTEE: If this course doesn’t completely change the trajectory of your life, Udemy will refund your entire purchase within 30 days.\n\n\nYou have nothing to lose and so much to gain!\n\n\nADD TO CART now and get closer to a freer, happier life than ever before.",

I'm going to teach you, step-by-step, how to build a highly profitable eCommerce store, from scratch. You don't need any prior knowledge of eCommerce or any technical skills - if you can use a web browser you are good to go!\n\n\nMy name is Kyle Plummer and I've built multiple 7-figure Shopify Dropshipping businesses and can be found in mass media publications like Yahoo Finance, Fox News, ABC, Business Blurb, Disrupt Global and more. Originally I was working as the Director of Marketing at an International Training company in corporate for years. I began dabbling in online businesses 4 years ago and have built a keen knowledge for what works and what doesn’t.\n\n\nSince I left, I’ve seen the “other side”. I can work where I want, when I want and don’t have a ceiling on my income. And that’s what I’m here to teach YOU.\n\n\nYou can find me teaching others these topics with my more than 100k combined social media followers. But that’s enough about me. We are here to talk about your goals and future.\n\n\nAt the end of this course you will have a profitable eCommerce store which could supplement your existing income or transform your life by giving you your very own online business that could even allow you to escape the 9 to 5 altogether. It's entirely up to you, your commitment, your determination - if I can do this then anyone can. I’m going to teach you the secrets to breaking through in this fast-growing business model.\n\n\nThe course is designed with the total beginner in mind. But, this builds on intermediate and advanced methods to bring people from zero all the way to an expert in one course. The beauty of the course is we don’t just talk theory. This is a hands-on step-by step guide. You will see me build a Shopify Dropshipping store from scratch in real-time. Everything is digestible and you will be able to build your business along with me.\n\n\nI’m going to teach you how to find highly profitable products, how to create your ad creatives, building a highly-converting store, scaling methods, operations, and how you can outsource most of the mundane work so your business can run on autopilot.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have a strong grip on what it takes to build a successful dropshipping business that can earn you $100k a year or MORE.\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for, let's get started right now on building you financially free future.",

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to the “Amazon FBA Course- Sourcing Alibaba & Selling on Amazon FBA” course.\nLearn to Source Alibaba for Amazon (FBA, Dropshipping), Sales Tactics, A9 Algorithm, Amazon PPC (Ads) to sell on Amazon\n\nAmazon FBA is a great way to launch a successful business from home. OAK Academy's features courses taught by entrepreneurs and business professionals alike that will show you how to set up and make money with your FBA account right away, even if your starting budget is small.\nAlthough I have no experience with Amazon FBA, I feel a lot more comfortable after taking this course. I am currently a paralegal that is searching for the freedom to live a less hectic lifestyle. I have just purchased a product that I am excited to test out and look forward to sharing the results.\nStarting an Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) account is a great way to eliminate some of the annoying logistics associated with running your own home business. Rather than source, package, and ship products yourself, Amazon takes care of the hassle by storing and then fulfilling your orders for you.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon. com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because sellers who use Amazon. com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon. com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon. com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse. Not only does this take the packing and shipping burden off your shoulders, but it also means you can offer Prime shipping to those 200 million Amazon Prime members — who on average spend over 4 times as much as non-Prime shoppers.\nUsing FBA also means Amazon takes responsibility for any problems that arise during shipping, like late shipments, damaged items, or other issues. Your reputation as a seller doesn't take a hit.\nOne of the most common questions asked by new Amazon sellers is, “Where can I buy products to sell on Amazon?\n“While there are a few different answers to this question, an experienced seller’s answer will most likely be, “On Alibaba.”\nAlibaba is a great place for sellers of all experience levels to source millions of different products that you can private label and brand. Many businesses rely on getting profitable products from Alibaba to Amazon FBA.\nIf you are unfamiliar with Alibaba and how it works, it can be overwhelming. In this Course, we’re going to go over everything you need to know about Alibaba amazon, so you can successfully source quality products for your private label Amazon FBA course business.\nWhy do Amazon sellers use Alibaba?\nMany Amazon sellers use amazon alibaba to source products because of the simplicity of its user-friendly site and well, the low prices. Most manufacturers that you come across on the platform will be based in China, where they can produce quality goods at a much more affordable price than, say, in the United States or Canada.\nAny seller can go to import from Alibaba right now and search for the type of product they’re interested in selling and come across thousands of potential suppliers. Finding a manufacturer for your product has never been easier.\nWhat is Amazon FBA?\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a service Amazon offers its third-party sellers. Using FBA amazon, sellers send their goods to one of Amazon’s fulfillment centers, and Amazon ships the items to the customer. Customers who buy FBA products usually get their items rather quickly. When an item sells, employees pick and pack the order and it leaves the warehouse shortly after the sale. Amazon’s shipping partners, including the USPS, work hard to ensure timely delivery. Even companies that don’t deliver on Sundays will ship FBA products seven days a week. It’s fairly simple to use FBA. Sellers must contact Amazon after they prepare their listings. They provide several details, including product information and the quantity they plan on sending. Amazon tells the seller where to send the shipment and they handle deal it from there. You can achieve , amazon fba private label, amazon fba wholesale, Amazon fba product research, amazon fba canada, free amazon fba, amazon private label.\nIn this course, You will success amazon ppc, amazon marketing, amazon advertising, amazon ads, ecommerce marketing, retail arbitrage, ecommerce, e commerce, php, amazon ppc, google shopping, ecommerce website, ecommerce marketing, amazon dropshipping, shopify development, amazon.\nIs Shopify better than Amazon?\nSelling on Shopify using Amazon’s FBA service requires a different mindset than selling on Amazon with FBA. Other than in a few specialty categories, Amazon’s referral fees range between 8% and 17% of the sale amount. People who sell on Shopify try to avoid these fees, but there’s a reason why people gladly pay Amazon’s referral fees. Amazon attracts buyers from around the world to its platform, while Shopify sellers have to do their own marketing to sell their products. Shopify sellers also aim to build a brand without being subject to Amazon’s regulations. For example, Amazon does not allow its sellers to contact buyers. Many people feel that engaging customers is the best way to grow a business. Each of the platforms has its advantages, but people who want to list items without having to market them should definitely sell on Amazon.\nShould I Sell on Amazon or Ebay?\neBay and Amazon have distinct platforms. Deciding which one to use depends on your goals and what you're looking to sell. Amazon, in general, has a much higher sales volume than eBay. Many sellers choose Amazon because they feel they could earn more money there. While this is true in a lot of cases, some items do perform better on eBay. Amazon is the more restrictive of the two, so there are some products that you can only sell on eBay. For example, Amazon doesn’t allow used clothing sales. For many products, you need preauthorization before you sell them on Amazon. eBay has fewer guidelines for creating listings. If you only plan on selling a few pieces of each item, you might want to stick with eBay. Either way, both Amazon and eBay are great options for most sellers.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because sellers who use Amazon com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\n\nDropshipping is an order fulfillment option that allows ecommerce businesses to outsource procuring, storing, and shipping products to a third party. This order fulfillment method appeals to entrepreneurs seeking low overhead and low capital investments, but it can come at a cost.\nEcommerce is competitive. Dropshipping may appeal to entrepreneurs looking to sell generic products, but it can limit opportunities to build a brand or differentiate products. Thus, businesses that use dropshipping may wind up competing on price, leading to low margins.\nIf you are considering dropshipping for your ecommerce business, there are several factors you should review—including some variations and alternatives that offer similar benefits.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse. Not only does this take the packing and shipping burden off your shoulders, but it also means you can offer Prime shipping to those 200 million Amazon Prime members — who on average spend over 4 times as much as non-Prime shoppers.\nUsing FBA also means Amazon takes responsibility for any problems that arise during shipping, like late shipments, damaged items, or other issues. Your reputation as a seller doesn't take a hit.\nSo Wondering how to sell on Amazon? Do you already have a brand and products, but do you want to learn how to start an Amazon FBA business? You found a very good product but don't know how to supply it?\nYou are at the right place!\nIn this course, we explained the topics and tactics of sourcing and selling on Amazon step by step practically. .We discussed the Amazon A9 Algorithm in all its details and explained the working logic of the system.

It’s a goldmine of opportunity, with space for new and creative products to succeed. But success doesn’t happen by accident—you need the right strategies to stand out.\n\n\nIn this course, I’ll show you how to dominate your Amazon product niche by combining the 4 most effective strategies to sell products on Amazon:\n\n\nAmazon SEO to rank at the top of searches.\nRecommendation algorithms to get Amazon to promote your products.\nAmazon Ads (sponsored and display) to drive traffic to your listings.\nHigh-converting product listings that turn visitors into buyers.\n\n\nAll these tactics must be combined to boost one another and blow away your competition. When you truly dominate an Amazon product niche, you can build a big business on Amazon.\nTo bring these strategies to life, I’ll share two real-world examples: 1) My Kindle and paperback book and 2) A physical cleaning product sold by one of my clients who has built a million-dollar business selling cleaning products on Amazon, and it took him under a year with my guidance.\n\n\n$1,000,000 DOLLAR AMAZON SELLER - CLIENT CASE STUDY\n\n\nOne of my Amazon clients went from not selling on Amazon at all to earning over a million dollars in annual revenue from Amazon. In this course, I show all his Amazon strategies so you can use what he did to grow your Amazon business.\nAnd yes, the strategies work for any type of product.\n\n\nCHOOSE WINNING PRODUCTS EVERY TIME\n\n\nNot all products succeed, but with the right system, you’ll know how to pick the winners. In this course, I’ll teach you a proven method to identify products with high demand, low competition, and strong profit potential.

      "description": "An in depth Step-by-Step Course on how to scale up your Poshmark Closet and turn it into the Passive Income Stream you've always dreamt about\n\nPoshmark is a fantastic app for selling clothes you no longer use. One person's trash is another person's treasure and those old clothes you don't wear anymore can make you thousands, literally! Don't donate them or sell them to a store that'll offer you pennies compared to their worth. List them on Poshmark and watch the money come in!!\n\n\nNow, of course it's a little more complicated than that. There are some serious inside tips and marketing strategies to understand before you can make serious money on Poshmark, but there are already tens of millions of people on the app looking for the clothes you want to sell. The market and demand are there for you. You just have to learn how to tap into them properly.\n\n\nThis course will teach you the ins and outs of listing items on Poshmark that sell and the basics that are not so basic. It will also give you step by step instructions on how to build a following of hundreds of thousands of people (all more likely to purchase the products you list). From there, you'll learn more in depth strategies on how to continue to grow and acquire cheap items you can turn for a profit consistently.\n\n\nThe last two things the course lays out are vital for long-term sustainable profit. You'll learn how to continue to get products and start your own boutique (all within the website/app).
