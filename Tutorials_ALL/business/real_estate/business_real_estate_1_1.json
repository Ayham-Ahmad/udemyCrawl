It's the one skill that, once mastered, can catapult your real estate business to new heights through hefty wholesale fees and increased return on your capital.\nThis course will go over the nuts and bolts of how to generate off-market leads so that you can create a thriving commercial real estate investing business and live a life of abundance and financial freedom.\nIn this course you will learn how to:\nSetup Your Systems - without systems, your business will be chaos.

This is a project-based course, meaning you'll start with a blank Excel workbook and walk away with a fully-functional, dynamic, eight-tab real estate development model for condos, townhomes, and for-sale single family homes that YOU'VE created - from scratch.\nWhen I was first learning real estate financial modeling, I would download real estate investment models or real estate investment calculators on the internet, only to feel overwhelmed and frustrated by the complex functions and formulas everywhere in the Excel file. And once I felt like I was getting used to one of these things, I still was petrified to touch or change anything because I didn't want to \"break\" the model. And honestly, even if I understood it and I believed the model was working correctly, I still had no idea if I could even trust the calculations in the first place.\nIf you've ever felt any of these things, this course will pull back the curtain and uncover the \"Black Box\" that most real estate financial models appear to be. By the end of this course, you'll be able to build a dynamic, professional-quality real estate development model from scratch, and your first one will be done by the time you finish the last lecture.\nThis course will teach you how to build a real estate development model the way the largest and most sophisticated private equity real estate firms look at deals. At the end of this course, you will be able to:\nBuild an institutional-quality, dynamic real estate development model to analyze land acquisitions and development projects building condos, townhomes, or for-sale single family homes, all from scratch in Excel\nLearn key Excel shortcuts to double your real estate financial modeling speed\nModify and customize existing residential for-sale real estate development models to fit your specific investment scenario and needs\nConfidently model key investment metrics such as the IRR, Equity Multiple, and Total Profit, and calculate these metrics automatically as you change manual input drivers\nBuild a dynamic construction budget (including S-Curve and straight-line modeling functionality)\nModel pre-sales and deposits that change automatically as construction timelines change\nModel deposit holdbacks and build in functionality to use deposits as equity to fund the project\nBuild out floating rate construction loan draws, dynamic equity draws, and incremental loan payoffs to accurately model the financing and payoff as individual units are sold\nBuild formula \"checks\" to error-proof your work and feel confident your calculations are correct\nThis course is perfect for you if:\nYou're a college student or graduate student looking to break into real estate development after graduation, and you're looking to add the key technical skill sets to your arsenal that will put you head and shoulders above the competition and allow you to land a lucrative career opportunity in the field\nYou're a professional in a different field, but looking to become a real real estate developer on the side and want to be able to confidently analyze a ground-up for-sale residential development deal\nYou're an existing real estate professional looking to advance your career, increase your compensation, and break into the real estate development field\nYou've bought rental homes or duplexes, and now you're looking to become a real estate developer and want to feel confident in your ability to analyze new ground-up construction projects\n\n\nIf you have a basic understanding of real estate finance, and you're looking to apply that knowledge to analyze new for-sale residential real estate development opportunities, enroll now and let's get started building this model together today.

In this course, I will lift the veil and show you how to do one type of real estate that requires little to no money. The type that I am referring to is called wholesaling. The premise of this type of real estate is about finding people that who for one reason of the other must sell their property, they are known as motivated sellers. Often at times, these motivated sellers are distressed as a result of debt, divorce, being an absentee owner, probate, foreclosure, having bad tenant. Regardless of what is causing them to be distressed, they all have one goal to be rescued.\nIn How to Build Wealth with Wholesaling Real Estate I will teach you how to locate these people, evaluate their property, make them an offer, and put their property under contract. Simultaneously you will learn how to locate buyers or other investors and assign a contact to them at a marked up price. In essence, I will show you how to become the middle man between motivated sellers and buyers. You will learn how to coordinate between the two, close the deal, and collect a check. There are some essential documents that must be executed, I will show you what they are and provide a copy to use as an example in crafting your very own, with the help of your attorney. Everything you need to know from initiating a conversation with a motivated seller to showing up at the Title Company at the day of closing to collect your check with be explored. You will leave this course with a clear plan on how to run your own wholesale business from A to Z.\nThis course is about Wholesaling Houses\nYou Need This Course If You Want:\nTo successfully wholesale\nTo acquire skills in real estate\nTo keep more of your own money\nTo be financially astute\nTo enjoy economic freedom\nTo create a plan for your finances\nTo become an entrepreneur\nTo build wealth\nTo properly protect wholesale business",

Not just from taking the course. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil.\nIf you take my course AND apply the learnings to start your career in commercial real estae in the future, then you have a chance.\nWhat I can guarantee is that you will leave with some serious commercial real estate knowledge.\nWhat else does this course cover besides commercial real estate?\nThis course is ALL about and ONLY about commercial real estate concepts and how to start a career in commercial real estate brokerage. So nothing else. But as you can see, just this topic is quite a bit to cover already.\nAll of my courses have the highest quality information with no hype and no fluff. I don’t just teach theory - I give you real world examples from people who are in the trenches everyday just like you. I know what you need to be successful in commercial real estate.\nWhether moving into commercial full time or just adding an occasional commercial transaction to your investment portfolio or residential agent services, my step by step information will show you the exact steps you need to take to move forward.\nAdditionally, I have other courses on specific commercial property types and subjects so that you get in depth education on each subject while breaking it up into multiple courses so you can absorb the material and put that information into action.\nWhat WON'T I get from this course?\nYou will not get a Real Estate License from taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency of your state and country. But what is taught in this course has nothing to with getting a license, which focuses on how to legally transact real estate deals between buyers and sellers. This course is about investment analysis.\nI will not be going over  real estate investment analysis in this course.\nThis course does not cover any of the wide range of OTHER real estate topics, which deserve their own courses, including but not limited to: contract negotiations, real estate legalities, real estate marketing, REITs, etc...  In this course, I try to cover the most important concepts as it relates to getting started in commercial real estate.\nTell me again why I should take your course?\nIf you've read this far down, you already know why. You've always wanted to. So why haven't you pulled the trigger?\nAsk yourself this: \"What is holding me back?\"\nAre you afraid you'll actually learn what you've always said you would but never did?\nYeah, you'll have to put in the time and effort. If you're lazy, this course (or any other course) won't be able to help you.\nBut if you're serious about learning how to get into commercial real estate, then this course is for you.\nPlus, you have absolutely ZERO risk.\nUdemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee and they're really really good on that.\nWho is the target audience?\nAnyone who wants to succeed as a Commercial Real Estate Agent\nActive Real Estate Agents\nResidential Real Estate Brokers\nCommercial Real Estate Agents\nAnyone who just wants to learn more about Commercial Real Estate",

So nothing else. But as you can see, just this topic is quite a bit to cover already.\nAll of my courses have the highest quality information with no hype and no fluff. I don’t just teach theory - I give you real world examples from people who are in the trenches everyday just like you. I know what you need to be successful in commercial real estate.\nWhether moving into commercial full time or just adding an occasional commercial transaction to your investment portfolio or residential agent services, my step by step information will show you the exact steps you need to take to move forward.\nAdditionally, I have other courses on specific commercial property types and subjects so that you get in depth education on each subject while breaking it up into multiple courses so you can absorb the material and put that information into action.\nWhat WON'T I get from this course?\nYou will not get a Real Estate License from taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency of your state and country. But what is taught in this course has nothing to with getting a license, which focuses on how to legally transact real estate deals between buyers and sellers. This course is about investment analysis.\nI will not be going over real estate investment analysis in this course.\nThis course does not cover any of the wide range of OTHER real estate topics, which deserve their own courses, including but not limited to: contract negotiations, real estate legalities, real estate marketing, REITs, etc...  In this course, I try to cover the most important concepts as it relates to listing and selling commercial real estate.\nTell me again why I should take your course?\nIf you've read this far down, you already know why. You've always wanted to. So why haven't you pulled the trigger?\nAsk yourself this: \"What is holding me back?\"\nAre you afraid you'll actually learn what you've always said you would but never did?\nYeah, you'll have to put in the time and effort. If you're lazy, this course (or any other course) won't be able to help you.\nBut if you're serious about learning how to get into commercial real estate, then this course is for you.\nPlus, you have absolutely ZERO risk.\nUdemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee and they're really really good on that.\nWho is the target audience?\nAnyone who wants to succeed as a Commercial Real Estate Agent\nActive Real Estate Agents\nResidential Real Estate Brokers\nCommercial Real Estate Agents\nAnyone who just wants to learn more about Commercial Real Estate",

A detailed house appraisal informs potential purchasers on the qualities, costs, and benefits of the property they want to purchase. The property buyer may wind up in a terrible transaction if he or she does not have an adequate understanding of the current rate, real estate trend, and cost-benefit analysis. Property valuation serves as a safeguard against deceptive methods and frauds that lead to buyers paying more for a home than it is worth. Furthermore, this procedure provides the buyer with precise information, facilitating the borrowing and mortgage processes.\nProperty valuation informs a buyer about the property's true value and whether the seller's/stated owner's sale price is reasonable. In certain circumstances, property owners justify high rates by citing factors such as construction quality or additional facilities. Some apartment developers demand exorbitant supplementary fees or charge high per square foot pricing relative to the market rate in the area, then sell the flats for exorbitant prices. A buyer should get a Property Valuation done before finalizing the agreement to avoid paying a higher rate or falling victim to the builder's frauds or malpractices.",

      "description": "UPDATE: Instructor Symon He hosts near daily LIVE office hours on TikTok 10:30PM PDT. Find him @SymonHe.\nTheodore Papadopoulos - 5 Stars\n“This course is an excellent primer on real estate investing. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning some real world core concepts. Symon starts off basic and builds on concepts learned in previous lectures. In summation, this course will teach you some basic mechanics in how to evaluate a real estate deal.”\n\n\nSusan Corry - 5 Stars\nSymon did a great job of explaining the fundamentals of real estate investing. It was the perfect introduction for me and gave me the confidence to continue with more complex course subjects!\nJacob Nelson - 5 Stars\nGreat course! Symon is obviously 1) very knowledgeable on real estate investing 2) skilled at training others. The combination makes for a great course. Thanks for creating this!!! Can't wait to check out his other stuff\nDo you have absolutely ZERO knowledge or experience in real estate investing but want to get started?\nDo you have the drive and ambition but you're just not sure where to start?\nDo you feel overwhelmed with the seemingly endless choices and options available to new investors?\nShould you start with fix & flips, rentals, wholesaling, lease options, or something else entirely?\nWhat is the smartest way for a new investor to start?\nIn other words, what should you know before making your first investment?\nIf you want to learn the most important real estate invest concepts and develop a solid foundation as a first step towards your real estate investing education, this is your course.\nIf you’re still unsure, here are some of the questions I get asked many by prospective students:\n_______________________________________\nI don't live in the US, is this course still relevant to me?\nYes! While the examples I use are USA properties (because the vast majority of my students are from the USA) ALL of the concepts taught and tools provided are just as useful for any market around the world.  In fact, I have students from over 190 countries who are learning and using the tools provided in the course to help them invest wherever they are located.\nHow is this different from your other courses?\nMy other real estate courses here are all focused primarily on investment analysis--one focusing on analyzing fix & flips and rental income properties, another that focuses only on multifamily, and a third, more comprehensive, course that covers residential as well as a host of other commercial real estate scenarios. The other courses all go deeper on the analysis side but do not touch on many of the topics I cover here.\nYou can think of those courses as getting down to the ground level in terms of detail and this course is at the 30,000 ft. level, just getting the overall scope of things without getting you bogged down in numbers and details.\nWhat if I already have some real estate background?\nThis course is NOT for you.  This is meant for beginners and those who little to no existing knowledge.  Although, I will say that some students with experience found this to be a nice refresher, especially the section on real estate cycles.  If you are an experienced investor, you may find some valuable insights in here, just please be aware that this course is designed for brand-new investors.\nWhy is there so much math and numbers?\nMath is a necessary evil to understanding real estate investing.  If you can't do the math, it'll be difficult for you to really get a firm grasp on the concepts.  If/when you're confused, just leave a message in the forums--I usually respond within 48 hours.  For what it’s worth, there is WAY more math in my other, more advanced courses.  I've put the bare minimum here.  Every serious investor needs to be able to do these investment calculations. If your math is rusty, now is the time to get a handle on it.\nWhy do you use Excel so much?\nGood question.  Analyzing real estate investments involves looking at the numbers and it's easiest to do that with spreadsheets, which is why I use Excel extensively.  The good news is you don't have to build any of the models yourself. I’ve done all the hard work for you.  You just need to be able to follow along and use the models I’ve created for you.\nCan you make me rich by taking your course?\nNo way! Not just from taking the course, at least. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil. If you take my course AND apply what you’ve learned to make smarter investments in the future, then you have a chance at creating some major profits.\nWhat I can guarantee is that you will leave with some serious real estate investing knowledge and techniques.\nWhat else does this course cover besides real estate investing?\nThis course is ALL about and ONLY the foundational real estate investing concepts.\nWhat will I be able to do after I take your course?\nAfter taking my course, you will be:\n•           Able to confidently use professional real estate investment techniques.\n\n\n•           Able to evaluate both residential and commercial real estate opportunities.\n\n\n•           Able to structure investments with business partners in a smart and equitable way via the waterfall framework\n\n\n•           Know how to identify and mitigate investment risks.\n\n\nSunil Ramsumair - 5 Stars\n“Very informative, great instructor and course material, I am very happy with the content of the course.”\nEthan Wong - 5 Stars\n“Yet another successful course from Symon. Even though I have some experience as an investor, I found this class to be quite valuable. Although I was already quite familiar & comfortable with the course material and topics, the experiences gained from completing the exercises showed me where I have a couple weaknesses in my network. That alone made the class worth my investment…”\nWhat WON'T I get from this course?\n•           You won’t get any kind of real estate license from taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency of your state and country. But what I teach in this course has nothing to with getting a license, which focuses on how to legally facilitate transactions in real estate between buyers and sellers. This course is about the investor's prospective.\n\n•           I will not be evaluating your personal investment deals for you for this course. This is about you learning how to do it on your own using the lessons and the tools here. If you really want me to consult with you privately, you can reach out to me. My hourly rate is $350/hr.\n\n•           This course does not cover any of the wide range of OTHER real estate topics, which deserve their own courses, including but not limited to: contract negotiations, real estate legalities, real estate marketing, REITs, etc...  I try to cover the most important concepts as they relate to evaluating investment opportunities.\n\n\nWhat’s holding you back?\nAre you afraid this course won’t work?  I promise you it will.\nAre you afraid this course will work and you’ll actually have to start investing? I think that’s a pretty good problem to have.\nAre you afraid it will take time and effort? It will. Real estate isn’t an easy business, if it was everyone would do it. But if you put in the work I promise you’ll see results.\nBest of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for.\nSo go ahead, sign up and let’s get to work right away!\n-Symon",

The development of digital signatures has made it possible for people to legally bind themselves to legal documents without physically  signing them. The necessity for in-person meetings has been reduced and accessibility has been increased thanks to video conferencing technology, which allows notaries to witness document signing remotely. Internet notary services can now accurately verify people's identities remotely because of advances in identity verification technology like biometrics and multi-factor authentication. Also digital notary services are feasible because of the advent of cloud computing, which allows for the safe keeping and management of papers as well as the universal accessibility to notarized documents. Due to the popularity of smartphones, several mobile notary businesses have created apps that allow users to access their services from their mobile devices.\nIn an era where digitization has revolutionized the way we conduct business, remote online notarization's have emerged as a game- changer in the realm of electronic signings in real estate transactions. One critical innovation that has further bolstered the security of electronic signings is the integration of blockchain technology. Blockchain simplifies this by providing a universal recognized and verified record of notarization.",

Or are you already a host but feel like your competitors are doing better than you, and that you can improve and earn much more? If yes, then this course is for you. You will learn how to become the best Airbnb option in your area. This course will teach you how to generate the maximum amount of money that your unit can bring in - in other words, how to make the most out of your local Airbnb renting market. Also, it will prevent you from doing mistakes that can lead to bad reviews, and consequently have a negative impact on your renting business. This course provides practical knowledge that you will be able to use to generate a good income by renting your space on Airbnb in the most efficient way.\n\nI have several listings on Airbnb and all of them are the most profitable in their cities, meaning that they attract guests first, before my competitors, and therefore generate the most money. I always used the same techniques to publish and kick-start my new units on Airbnb that I explain in this course and it worked every time. But as Airbnb is growing around the world, more and more hosts are proposing homes to rent, and there is more and more competition. That's why it's even more important to stand out and become the best Airbnb option in your area and consolidate your position as such.\n\nIn this course I give out all my knowledge and experience that I accumulated over 6+ years of successful Airbnb renting of various units in different cities.\nWant a fun fact? There is a host renting a similar flat to mine on Airbnb in the SAME building as one of my listings. But their \"Location\" rating is 3/5, while mine varies between 4,5/5 and 5/5. That says a lot about how guests can have a negative perception of everything if their overall experience is bad. The location is absolutely the same! So Airbnb guests rate my competitor's location down along with the other criteria because they generally have a bad experience with him. It's pretty interesting...\n\nThe knowledge inside this course will save you months or even years of trial and error.",

      "description": "Want to learn how to build professional, dynamic, institutional-quality commercial real estate development pro forma models from scratch for office, retail, and industrial projects in Microsoft Excel?\nThis course will take you by the hand and walk you step-by-step through the entire process of building a complete, dynamic, eight-tab commercial real estate development pro forma model, starting with a blank Excel workbook and ending with a complete commercial real estate development pro forma model that you've created (from scratch).\nWhen I was first learning real estate financial modeling, I would download real estate development models or \"calculators\" on the internet, only to feel overwhelmed and frustrated by the complex functions and formulas everywhere in these Excel files. And once I felt like I was finally starting to get used to these, I still was scared to change anything because I didn't want to \"break\" the model. And in most cases, even I believed the model was working correctly, I still had no idea if I could even trust the calculations in the first place.\nIf you've ever felt any of these things, this course will pull back the curtain and uncover the \"Black Box\" that most real estate financial models appear to be. By the end of this course, you'll be able to build a dynamic, professional-quality commercial real estate development pro forma model from scratch, and by the time you finish the last lecture, you'll have an institutional-quality model that you've built from start to finish.\nThis course will teach you how to build a commercial real estate development pro forma model the way the largest and most sophisticated CRE development firms look at deals. At the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\n\nBuild an institutional-quality, dynamic commercial real estate development pro forma model for office, retail, and industrial projects from scratch (without expensive software)\nModel advanced real estate financing structures like mezzanine construction debt, dynamic permanent loan sizing based on multiple constraints, and more\nCreate a dynamic sources and uses table, so you'll know exactly how much you'll need to fund a development project\nModel complex commercial real estate lease structures in Excel including NNN, FSG, MG, and BYS reimbursement structures, custom rent escalation schedules, percentage rent clauses, and more\nCreate dynamic re-leasing scenarios based on renewal probability and re-leasing assumptions to create future projected lease cash flows automatically\nModel investor distributions on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis and switch between the three options (quickly and easily)\nCreate custom charts and graphs that automatically populate in your model, that you can use to present to investors, lenders, and partners\nBuild formula \"checks\" to quickly correct errors and feel confident in your calculations\nThis course is perfect for you if:\nYou're a college student or graduate student looking to break into real estate development after graduation, and you're looking to add the key technical skills to your resume that will put you head and shoulders above the competition and allow you to land internships and full-time jobs in the CRE development field\nYou're an existing real estate professional looking to advance your career and increase your compensation.\nYou have a basic understanding of real estate finance and you're looking to take your real estate financial modeling skill set to an expert level to more confidently model and analyze your own real estate development deals\nHere's what some of our students have had to say about the class:\n★★★★★ \"Great course, amazing content made relatively simple, all thanks to Justin. Thank you for making these courses and spreading the knowledge of Real Estate Financial Modeling. Really Grateful.\"\n★★★★★ \"Very clear explanations! I like the repetition through the different examples to embed learning. It's also helpful to say which shortcuts you are doing so that this becomes second nature.\"\n★★★★★ \"Fantastic course, and just like with Justin's other courses: crammed with great content and hands-on application. No fluff. Just into the materials and the mechanics. This course is rather advanced, but it covers a lot of different techniques, methods, and concepts.\"\nIf you have a basic understanding of real estate finance and you're looking to apply that knowledge to analyze land acquisition and ground-up commercial real estate development opportunities, I'd love to have you in the class!",

      "description": "The key objectives for a successful construction project are to: 1) Stay on schedule 2) Stay on budget 3) Minimize Stress. In order to achieve these objectives, it is critical for all parties involved to fully understand the order of the phases of construction, what is included in each phase of construction and when the selections and decisions must be made so the materials are available in time to keep the project going without delay. The construction team, which consists of the owner, builder, architect, designer, realtor, and the subcontractors and vendors can all benefit from the knowledge and tools in this course. To gain the holistic understanding of the residential construction process this course provides can take decades of blood, sweat and tears. Please allow my lessons learned from 22 years of experience and over $100,000,000 worth of projects completed to help you avoid costly mistakes, nail the key objectives, and to find your construction flow.\n\n\nIn a construction project, the work that is done before the first shovel of dirt is moved will set the stage for all that is to come. The selection of a builder, architect, designer, and lender will establish the team that will surround and support the owner throughout the process.\n\n\nThe design of the house and the material specifications will drive the cost and the timing of the entire project. The bid and contract with your builder will establish the scope and budgets for all the work to be completed. It’s very important to understand what a thorough bid and contract should encompass. A well done bid and contract should be an accurate representation of your desired outcome including appropriate line item costs and material budgets. Working together with your builder and designer to create the specifications for your bid is the best way to produce a bid that will be accurate and complete.\n\n\nLast but not least in this section is permitting. The process of getting permits can be quick and painless or slow and agonizing. Most of the time it is somewhere in the middle but a good plan and implementation from the construction team will create the best outcome. Understanding what is included in the permitting process and how it works can ensure that the plan for handling permits is solid.\n\n\nLet me leave you with an example of the value of the information in this section of the course. When selecting a lender, it is very important to understand what their policies are on advancing funds for line items that may require deposits when ordering materials. I had an owner recently who ordered custom cabinets from overseas, custom metal siding and low voltage equipment all within the same month. Each of these items required a 50% deposit to place the order. The owners bank would not advance funds for any of these items until they were on site and installed. The owner had to pay for deposits out of pocket which included putting large amounts on their credit card and paying interest for months while the products were delivered and installed. This situation could have been avoided or mitigated if the owner had known the banks policies in advance. The owner could have also selected a different bank that had policies that were better suited for their project. In any case, knowing this information in advance would have saved the owner hundreds of dollars in interest on the credit card bill. This is just one example of many where the information in this course can save money during your construction project.",

Young professionals spend an extraordinary amount of time trying to understand the complexities of a modern building.  Every project is different and the materials and systems can change drastically from one building to the next.  Time can be better spent by adding value to projects instead of learning terminology and construction sequencing.  The lessons in the course have been developed to boil down years of on-the-job training into high-impact, bite-sized classes.",

      "description": "Welcome to Fundamentals of Analyzing Real Estate Investments, my practical course on how to use professional techniques to evaluate investment opportunities in real estate. This course has been propelling students from total beginners to confident practitioners in a matter of weeks.\n\n\nHere is what a few of my students have to say:\nJames McCarthy: 5 stars\nFor the most bang for your buck, this is the most value-packed course I have on Udemy out of 84. The tools and materials in this course are top-notch. This course is a clear investment in achieving my investment goals. You're not likely going to build a house without a hammer. You need the right tool for the job, and this is it!\"\n\n\nDave Clinton: 5 Stars\n“The instructor not only gave you a strategy but also showed you how to apply it in real-world situations.”\nBradley Garza, 5 Stars\n“Tremendous value—just a wealth of content and knowledge I don't see anywhere else. The investment models and examples alone are worth 100 times what I paid for this course. The instructor is responsive and continues to update the content. Thank you, Symon!”\nMark Forest, 5 Stars\n“There is a tremendous amount of information in this course that far surpasses anything else offered by Udemy.\nIt doesn’t matter what facet of the real estate investment industry you are interested in; this course is full of invaluable information that will save you time and, if you apply what you learn, money.\nInside, you’ll find useful information on:\n•    Rental Income Properties\n•    Fix and Flip\n•    Multifamily Apartments\n•    Commercial Properties\n•    Land Development\n• and a whole lot more!\nWant to know what real estate investment analysis is all about?\nTired of \"no money down/get rich like me\" real estate investing \"secrets\" from supposed real estate gurus that leave you filled with nothing but marketing fluff and upsells trying to convince you to purchase their ten thousand dollar elite coaching program?\nMe too. That’s why I developed this course for students who are looking for actual results and not a magic bullet.\nI can't promise I'll help you get rich enough to buy your own yacht and a pair of Ferraris, but I can teach you some serious real estate investment analysis techniques.  The same techniques are used by the best and most successful investors.\nIf you want to learn the real fundamentals of real estate investing and how to actually evaluate investment opportunities the way professional investors do, this is the course for you.\nAfter getting my MBA from Stanford, I became a licensed broker and real estate consultant and worked on over 400 million dollars in real estate deals. I’ve spent hundreds of hours on research, not counting the countless deals I’ve made over the years.\nAnd I’ve taken all that knowledge and put it all into this course.\n\nJim Bo: 5 Stars\n“This is a very detailed and thorough course that covers many aspects and builds a solid foundation for real estate investing. In addition to superb videos, Symon does an excellent job of promptly answering all your questions with a lot of details. Anyone who is thinking about investing in real estate should take this course!”\nNelson Robertson: 5 Stars\n“Well organized, thorough, and easy to follow. Symon makes a point to be very responsive to questions and provides very detailed answers. Tremendous value.”\nHow do you know if this course is right for you?\nHave  you ever wanted to\n\n• Invest with business partners, but do so in a smart and fair way.\n• Want to appeal to investor clients as an agent?\n• Want to land an acquisitions role as an analyst or associate?\n• Want to get into real estate private equity and need to get up to speed?\n• Want to be able to analyze any real estate opportunity?\n• Look at and evaluate deals the way a professional investor would.\n• Become smarter and more efficient at finding and evaluating deals than you did before.\n• Know what Airbnb short-term rentals are all about and if it's worth your effort.\n• Become an agent who could target investor clients instead of just home buyers?\n• Do you have professional investment analysis tools that you could use immediately to evaluate your own investment opportunities?\n• Get into a real estate acquisitions role (analyst or associate) in real estate i-banking or private equity (you get 20+ investment models or examples!)\n\nIf you answered yes to any of the above, then this course is definitely for you.\nTheododre Catillo: 5 Stars\n“Very comprehensive. Much more than I expected. I recommend it to anyone wanting a solid foundation.\nPriska Prasetya: 5 Stars\n“Easy to understand. The teacher makes the explanation simple. Highly recommended!”\nJorge Juyo: 5 Stars\n“The information is really well organized and presented; Symon uses all the media and audiovisual aids possible, and that makes it easy to follow.”\n\n\n_______________________________________\n\nFrequently asked questions\n______________________________________\n\n\nI don't live in the US; is the material still relevant to me?\nYes! While all of the examples use US properties, all of the concepts taught and tools provided are just as useful for any market around the world.  In fact, I have students from over 190 countries who are learning and using the tools provided in the course to help them invest in their local area.\nWhat if I don't have any real estate background?\nPerfect! I start you off with a heavy dose of the fundamentals, so students with no experience or background can get the most out of the rest of the course. Check out my foundational sections below.\nI have some real estate background already; what could I learn from your course?\n\nBesides everything listed above, I’ll show you how to answer these types of questions for every kind of real estate property:\n• How do you know if a particular investment is worth your time and money?\n• How do you know if property A is better than property B?\n• How do you find deals that make sense for you? That fits your risk preferences and goals?\n• How can you calculate your expected return on your investment?\n• How would you analyze the returns for your investment company?\n• How do you structure an investment with investment partners?\n• How do you analyze operating assets?\n\nIf you know how to do all of that, this course isn’t for you. The good news is that I have plenty of advanced courses available as well; feel free to check those out right now to find the one that’s appropriate for your experience level.\nHaving said that, I put a lot of useful materials in here, so you're more than likely going to learn something new.\nI've had folks with over 20 years of experience find something of value in this course, so I’m certain you can too.\nWhy is there so much math and number crunching?\n\n\nYou can't properly evaluate a real estate investment without looking at its numbers.  So if you hate math and don't like numbers, this course isn't for you.  Serious real estate analysis is probably not for you either.\nWhy do you use Excel so much?\nGood question.  Analyzing real estate investments involves looking at the numbers, and it's easiest to do so with spreadsheets, which is why I use Excel extensively in this course.  But the good thing is that you do not have to build any of the models yourself.  You just need to be able to follow along, and then you'll be able to use the models I give you.\nCan you make me rich by taking your course?\n\n\nNo, not just from taking the course. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil.\nWhat I can guarantee is that you will leave with some serious real estate investing knowledge and techniques that can then lead you to be more profitable with your investments.\nWhat else does this course cover besides real estate investing?\n\n\nThis course is all about and only about professional real estate investing concepts and techniques. Nothing else. But as you can see, this topic alone offers quite a bit to cover.\nActually, I do cover one more thing: I will also cover daily affirmations that help you build that winning mindset. Oh, and I’ll have lots of sales videos that will push you to sign up for my super-secret real estate system for only 12 low monthly payments of just $999. Just kidding.\nWhat will I be able to do after I take your course?\nAfter taking my course, you will be:\n• Be able to confidently use professional real estate investment techniques.\n• Able to evaluate both residential AND commercial real estate opportunities\n• Able to structure investments with business partners in a smart and equitable way via the waterfall framework\n• Know how to identify and mitigate investment risks.\n\n\nWhat won't I get from this course?\n\n• You will not get a real estate license by taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency in your state or country. But what is taught in this course has nothing to do with getting a license; it focuses on how to legally transact real estate deals between buyers and sellers. This course is about investment analysis.\n\n\n• Due to the sheer number of students, I am unfortunately unable to help you evaluate your personal investment deals in this course. This is about you learning how to do it on your own using the lessons and tools here. If you really want me to consult with you privately, my hourly rate is 350 dollars per hour, with a minimum of 20 hours per request.\n\n\n• This course does not cover any of the wide range of OTHER real estate topics that deserve their own courses, including but not limited to: contract negotiations, real estate law, real estate marketing, REITs, etc.  I try to cover the most important concepts as they relate to evaluating investment opportunities.\n\nDiego Ginzo, 5 stars\n\"Excelente. Son clarisimas las explicaciones y la conceptualizacion.\"\n\n\nLarry Butler, 5 stars\n“Like the Bacchanal Buffet in Las Vegas for real estate investing, there is a lot to devour, but each is deliciously made. I'm already feeling full, but I can't wait to go back for more platefuls. If you're hungry and have a refined palette with respect to real estate, look no further.”\nWhat’s holding you back?\nAre you afraid this course won’t work?  I assure you that it will.\nAre you afraid this course will work and you’ll actually have to start investing? I think that’s a pretty good problem to have.\nAre you afraid it will take time and effort? It will. Real estate isn’t an easy business; if it were, everyone would do it. But if you put in the work, I promise you’ll see results.\nBest of all, there is absolutely zero risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money-back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for.\nSo go ahead, sign up, and I'll see you inside!\n~Symon",

If you’ve ever considered investing in real estate, foreclosures, pre-foreclosures, fix and flips, rentals and finding huge equity in real estate, this course is an astounding value.",

It's possible for people to buy or sell their home without using a professional, but a real estate agent can make the process a lot easier.\nBy advising clients on prices, mortgages, and market conditions, an agent instructs sellers on how to price their house accurately and present the property in the best light. Agents guide buyers toward the home that best fits their needs by generating a list of properties for sale, accompanying the client to see the properties, and negotiating an offer with the seller.\nReal estate agents must be knowledgeable of the communities in their area, particularly in the facets that matter most to people: schools, safety, job opportunities, healthcare, and activities.\nThis practice exams will help prepare you for general questions you will face on your Real Estate License Exam.\nTake this practice test to see how prepared you are for a real estate agent certifying exam. All states require real estate agents to be licensed by the state to engage in the sale of real estate. The tests cover such subjects as forms of ownership, physical descriptions, valuation and regulation.\nFor all 600 Questions with complete sections check out the Real Estate Agent License Practice Exam - it will help you pass your State Real Estate Agent License Exam the first time.

      "description": "Flipping houses can be fun as well as profitable, if you know how to do it well. New flippers who jump in too fast, however, learn some valuable lessons the hard way and rarely turn a profit on their first several houses. But that does not have to be you. A successful, profitable flip starts with a thorough strategy and the perfect property, completes the right renovations on schedule, and sells quickly. You generally need about 25% of a house value for a down payment. You would not know exactly what that dollar amount is until you find a property, but it is nothing. A bit of cash on hand is necessary to get started. House flippers get to set their own hours, take vacation, have the flexibility to work from anywhere and ultimately have more freedom to do what they love. Potential flipper must understand that you need special mindset, spirit and a very particular set of skills to become more successful in house flipping business.\nNowhere does it say an investor needs to fund a deal with their own money. As it turns out, there are several options for funding a deal made available to today's investors, none of which will require you to use capital from your own pocket. In fact, it is easy to argue that using other people money is the gold standard at least when it comes to real estate. Private lenders, hard money lenders and any flipping investors with interest in making money are more than viable options to seek out for your next deal.",

      "description": "Real estate investing involves the purchase, management and sale or rental of real estate for profit. Someone who actively or passively invests in real estate is called real estate entrepreneur or a real estate investor. Some investors actively develop, improve or renovate properties to make more money from them. The real estate industry keeps on changing day in and day out so its very important that a serious investor must ensure that they quickly understand the new business trends, they must also seek knowledge so that they can readily forecast current situations to predict future business opportunities. Those wondering how to start a real estate business should be cautioned that owning a real estate company is no easy feat. Like any business one must ensure that there is accurate goal or relevant business goals that is ahead of the investor, as well as professional and financial goals. A successful business plan is always preceded by in-depth industry research, identifying a specific niche, market area, and potential competitors. Many first time investors will opt for wholesaling, allowing them to learn the ropes before purchasing properties. However, depending on your goals, rehabbing or buy- and-hold strategies may be great options as well.\nSince such a small percentage of the purchase price of real estate is normally provided from the savings of the purchaser, available sources of funds need to be known to anyone desiring to purchase real estate. While savings and loan associations are not the largest financial intermediary in terms of total assets, they are most important source of funds in terms of dollars made available for financing real estate. Examples of sources of real estate financing include commercial banks, mutual savings banks, mortgage brokers, finance companies, real estate investment trust etc. There are certain scenarios that make partnering up with another real estate investor a sound decision. For example say you find a potentially profitable property to acquire but do not have enough mone to pull off a deal. Bringng on an investor may increase your purchasing power and enable you to close the deal. Perhaps you want to diversify your portfolio by adding commercial property to it but you lack experience when it comes to buying and managing this type of real estate. In this case it may make sense to partner with an experienced commercial real estate investor.",

      "description": "This course will provide many useful tools for real estate investors and home buyers.\nReal estate investing in a complex topic for many reasons. Real estate is a large investment, often requiring a significant part of an and individual’s asset portfolio. Real estate investing often requires financing which increases the complexity. The reason for purchasing real estate varies greatly form person to person, some looking for a long-term home, others looking primarily for an investment, most wanting some mixture of both. Regulations also play a significant role in real estate investing decisions.\nWe will include many example problems, both in the format of presentations and Excel worksheet problems. The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.\nThis course will start out with the basics. We will discuss basic real estate terms because every specialized field will have terminology we need to understand to communicate well and make decisions.\nReal estate transactions have many components and players involved. Once we understand the basic terminology, we will discuss how those components and players fit together for a real estate transaction to take place.\nBecause real estate is a long-term investment, we need to understand time value of money concepts. This course will provide a section explaining what time value of money concepts are and will demonstrate the tools needed to use time value of money concepts. We will learn how to use Excel formulas to calculate present value, future value, payments, and interest rates.\nLearners will understand different financing options. We will apply our time value of money concepts as we create amortization schedules and worksheet to help us analyze different financing options.",

In this course, I teach everything from scratch: how to start an Airbnb business without owning property. I like to compare it to Amazon—sellers who joined early took the largest share of the profits. Those who joined later still made money, but not nearly as much as those who got in at the beginning.\nThis course isn’t just theory—everything I teach has been implemented by me in real life. Most courses online won’t tell you how to legally sublease a property. The main difference with this course is that I show you how to build a legitimate, compliant business. I’ll also be available to consult with you and answer your questions. Join our Facebook group to ask me anything, anytime. Learn your rights when landlords try to prohibit subleasing.\nOverall, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Many people won’t even hear about it, but if you’ve made it to this page, you’re already ahead. Don’t let this opportunity pass—it might stay in the back of your mind forever if you don’t act. So, don’t wait, my friend—hop on, and let’s conquer the world together!",

Make more money.\nThis course will walk you step-by-step through dozens of advanced real estate financial modeling and analysis exercises, and whether you're looking to break into the real estate industry for the first time at a top investment, development, brokerage, or lending firm, looking to take the next step in your existing real estate career, or looking to analyze deals to build your own property portfolio, this course will help you take your real estate financial modeling and analysis skill set to an expert level.\nIf you don't know me already, my name is Justin Kivel, and throughout my career, I've worked for and with some of the largest commercial real estate investment, brokerage, and lending firms in the world. And to share what I've learned, I created a training company called Break Into CRE, and I've had the privilege of teaching tens of thousands of students real estate financial modeling and analysis through the Break Into CRE platform.\nAfter spending almost a decade in the industry myself, this course packages up everything that I've learned about how some of the largest and most successful investment firms in the business both create and use real estate financial models in Excel to analyze and evaluate investment opportunities.\nAt the end of the course, you'll be able to:\nCreate dual-metric data tables to sensitize multiple investment return metrics within the same analysis\nBuild a dynamic best/base/weak case analysis that automatically calculates returns based on your upside (and downside) investment scenarios\nCreate a next-buyer analysis to make sale value projections at the end of a real estate investment\nPartition the IRR of a deal to understand the percentage of returns coming from operating cash flow versus sale proceeds.\nBuild a hold/sell analysis to calculate the optimal sale year of an investment\nBuild out senior construction loan draws, mezzanine construction loan draws, and dynamic equity draws to model unique capital structures on ground-up development deals\nModel investor cash flow distributions on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis\nThis course is perfect for you if:\nYou're a college student or graduate student looking to break into the real estate industry upon graduation, and you want to make sure you have the modeling and analysis skills you'll need to ace an Excel modeling exam and stand out from the competition\nYou're a current real estate professional looking to improve your modeling and analysis skills to take the next step in your career and increase your compensation\nYou're a real estate investor looking to build the skills necessary to analyze unique deal scenarios and make decisions related to new investment opportunities or your existing real estate portfolio\nHere's what some of our students have had to say:\n★★★★★ \"This course was definitely intense, but the information is invaluable. Justin does a great job explaining everything thoroughly and I've learned more about Excel in my past few courses than my entire life.\"\n★★★★★ \"Another great course by Justin. I found this to be the most difficult of all his courses, very advanced. The best part is the comprehensive case study at the end that really ties everything together well. I felt like I learned a lot.\"\n★★★★★ \"Loved this course.  Justin's approach is very didactic and on point. If you have strong understanding of the basics in real estate finance, but don't know how to create a model, this course is for you. As Justin said, the secret to succeeding in this particular field is practice. Create the model again from scratch, go back to the solution file to make sure you get the right numbers.\"\n★★★★★ \"This was a fantastic course! Justin is very knowledgeable and explains all the concepts extremely well. I feel that this course has helped me very much and I am looking forward to continuing practicing the topics and improving on my skill set. I would highly recommend this course to anyone. Thank you Justin for the great work that you have put together.\"\n★★★★★ \"If you are a beginner to a veteran in CRE, and you've always wondered how to analyze an investment and the capital stack behind it, this is the only course you'll ever need. Justin Kivel does an excellent job of breaking down each of the considerations and explains them thoroughly. Thanks to Justin for putting out such a high-quality course!\"\nIf you have a basic understanding of real estate finance and Excel and you're looking to take your real estate financial modeling and analysis skill set to an expert level, you're in the right place.\nLooking forward to seeing you inside!",

      "description": "Get more bookings, have fewer guests - the Airbnb monthly rentals model\n\n\nAirbnb is a hospitality business. But vacation rentals and short term guests are not the only way for a host to run an airbnb business. Did you know Airbnb has a platform for month long rentals? Google “airbnb sublets” and you’ll see.\n\n\nThe signs are here. Airbnb in changing. Most hosts have seen more and more listings going up in their area, and a different kind of guest coming in (or simply fewer guest altogether).\n\n\nThis has created a new set of challenges for all hosts, new and experienced.\n\n\nSome hosts are finding that the number of reservations has really dropped off.\n\n\nNew hosts who are thinking about Airbnb for the future or just finding their feet are looking for guidance in a difficult marketplace\n\n\nExperienced hosts are looking for a more passive model (that has been buried under the increasing professionalisation of the business) so they can choose how involved they are in the day-to-day\n\n\nAt the same time, Airbnb as a platform is adapting to a different kind of guest. These guests are freelancers, remote workers, people in between permanent homes. They are people looking to book for a month or more.\n\n\nThis type of guest can be really attractive for airbnb hosts.\n\n\nFewer guests means less work and more passive income for hosts\nLong-term guests are more careful with your property, and in their relationship with you\nThey book for the off-season\nIt’s win-win; you can offer them a steep discount and still make a great profit\n\n\nBut long-term airbnb guests are risk averse. Put yourself in their position. They are booking for a month or more. They won’t just look and book. Where they stay will determine a lot of their life experience for the months that they are there.\n\n\nThey have different needs to short term rentals or vacation rentals. They want to see that their needs are met. And that the price is fair.\n\n\nIf you’re going to attract them, the fundamental challenge for you as a host is this:\n\n\nDeveloping an inside-out knowledge of how long-term rentals work, in your particular case, with the property you have and the guests you can attract.\n\n\nIt takes work to do this. There are some important changes to implement in your airbnb business. With this course you can break the challenge down into 5 parts. Each part relates to an already familiar part of your work as a host.\nYou’ll learn more about:\n\n\nGuests - Who long-term guests are and what they want\n\nHospitality - How to make them feel at home in your property (true hospitality!)\n\nPricing - How to set a win-win price\n\nListing - how to optimise your listing for increased conversions\n\nMarketing - how to get the word out about the great offer you’re making\n\n\n\n\nI was ready to be among the first to make these changes in my native Italy. I think this was for 2 reasons:\n\n\nI’ve travelled the world working remotely - I’ve experienced long-term rentals as a guest\nI’ve worked in apartment rentals for the last 17 years and I’ve had an airbnb business for the past 3\n\n\nOver the years, I’ve collected this mix of experience as both guest and host. This is something that lead Wired to write about me and my work, and the TTG International Hotel Exhibition to invite me to speak on the topic of “hacking Airbnb”.\n\n\nI’ve been teaching hosts in Italy how to adapt for month-long bookings and now, with this English language version of the course, hosts everywhere can learn what I’ve found to work.\n\n\nHere’s what you’ll do in this course so you see more 30+ day bookings come in:\n\n\nYou’ll perform a quick check to see if the opportunity is right for you. It’s free in the videos below. It’ll take max. 10 minutes and will give you an idea if it’s worth spending more time doing a proper assessment of your pricing (which is also free to you).\n\n\nYou’ll understand why long-term rentals are a good deal for you, for your guests and for the future of your business\n\n\nYou’ll follow a step-by-step process for setting a win-win price that’ll provide you a decent passive income and offer a great deal to your guest. (Also free, for a limited period of time.)\n\n\nYou’ll discover everything you need to know about how to make long-term guests feel truly at home in your property (which is so important for those 5* reviews)\n\n\nYou’ll find out the most cost-effective ways to get your property ready for long-term guests\n\n\nYou’ll optimise your listing so potential guests can see everything they need to know and actually click “Book”\n\n\nYou’ll decide if you want to try one of our suggested optional strategies for actively marketing your property.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see what the hosts I’ve worked with in Italy have to say:\n\n\nLuisa - I followed Luca’s courses despite having worked in the sector for 10 years and I find them useful - some parts are illuminating even! Luca explains so clearly…\n\n\nAnnalisa - I took several of Luca’s courses and honestly, right now, I’m doing pretty well [...] There’s so much information that I would have had trouble finding myself, and here it’s all together which is a huge advantage! [...] For me his courses have been extremely useful!\n\n\nSo if you’re curious about what this course can do for you then try the quick check. It’s worth 10 minutes of your time to see if this idea can really change your business.\n\n\nIf that works out, then skip the module on why long-term rentals are a good deal for you. It’s important to understand, but you can do it later. First check that you have a good chance of making more money with long-term rentals. Do the module on Setting a Win-Win price.\n\n\nIf that works out, then I know I’ll be seeing you in the course soon enough.\n\n\nGood luck with the work!\nLuca",

I became quite aware of the lack of preparation students were receiving in the area of mindset regarding studying and actually taking and passing the exam.\nYou see, in the world of business it’s been known that mindset is the most important aspect. Everything else is learnable. But, in real estate school and other prep courses, there’s nothing about mindset. It’s all laws and vocabulary terms to memorize.\nYou are not being properly taught and that’s why you are most likely having difficulty.\nIn the following sections, I will teach you what you really need to know in order to pass the exam the first time (or if you’ve taken it more than once already, you’ll pass the next time).\nI am a licensed Realtor in Arizona. I’ve been in and out of real estate since 2005. During all these years, I was also a licensed psychotherapist and mindset coach. For the past few years I’ve been a business coach to a lot of real estate agents.\nI will help prepare you to not only pass your exam with confidence and ease, but I will also help you with the mindset needed to succeed in business. Here’s the kicker…\nAs soon as you become licensed as a real estate agent, you will be starting your real estate business!\nYou will be a business owner. Some of you may have already been a business owner but many of you have not.\nI want you to think about how you are approaching your exam. If you’re freaking out over an exam, think about what it may be like to run a whole business.\nDon’t fret. I’m here to help.",

We will talk through the advantages of waterfalls vs. straight split profit share models.  Then we will discuss why waterfall models are advantageous to investors and what to watch out for. Next we will define key terms to allow you to have more certainty when reviewing investor packages.  We will deep dive on what preferred returns are and how preferred returns work. We feature an example waterfall, so you can begin to understand how profits flow through the hurdles/tiers and have a better understanding of when you get paid. The class finishes by teaching you how to review the distribution section of an LP agreement to help you verify what the sponsor told you is legally correct.\n\nThis course is for you if you are a passive investor looking to up your game in the difficult economic environment. This course will help you to invest at a higher level by gaining an in-depth understanding of waterfall structures. This course was made based on conversations with numerous passive investors who wanted to participate in more exciting deals, but were hesitant due to not understanding the nuances of waterfall structures. My goal for this course is for you to be able to ask educated questions as a sophisticated investor to sponsors whose deals you are considering investing in.",

When I first started off, it took me over a year and a half to even get my first house under contract. Yeah - it's embarrassing to admit. Why did it take me so long? FEAR. I was scared of making a mistake that would result in a lawsuit. Simple as that. I conquered my fear by gaining an understanding in how contracts can protect me from liability. Once I realized that, and had contracts that I could use to control houses RISK FREE, I was off to the races and I've gone on to close more than 400 houses! I hope you can benefit from understanding Real Estate contracts as much as I did.",

      "description": "As we become more and more accustomed to the convenience that's followed the rise electronic signature technology,many have grown frustrated with the traditional paper- based in-person process of notarization. But now, through remote online notarization technology, notarization is experiencing its own digital upgrade. In addition to  making business more efficient and improving the customer experience, notarizing document with the help of a remote notary helps mitigate risk and fraud throughout the notarization process. Many states have already adopted notarization legislation to allow a remote notary to notarize documents, and the trend has only accelerated since many people were forced to work remotely during the pandemic and have continued to do so.\nTo notarize a document means to have it certified by a notary public. Notarization involves the official verification of the authenticity of signatures on legal documents and the confirmation of the identity of the parties involved in the transaction. When a document is notarize, a notary public acts as an impartial witness to the signing of the document. Notarization is the process of notarizing a document remotely through the use of electronic signature, identity verification, audio-visual communication and electronic notarial journal and record keeping technologies. These technologies enable notaries to notarize securely while also saving time and travel for themselves and the parties involved.",

      "description": "In this advanced course, you will even learn more about property management.  Before advertising and showing your rental unit, you need to set your asking rent. I will guide you through the process of doing this. Through determining your rent based on the return on your investment,  I show you how to calculate the costs of owning and operating a rental property. I will also show you the best way to set your rent to conduct a market survey of comparable rental properties in the area where the property is situated. You will set your final asking price so you can formulate a marketing strategy to ensure you get the best price for your rental property.\nThe importance of taking the correct security amount from a tenant is crucial as this serves as the protection you need before turning your real estate asset (the rental unit/s) over to a tenant. This is your best insurance policy for getting your rental unit back in decent condition. What happens to a security deposit after a tenant paid the same? These funds legally belong to the tenant and I explain more in detail what must be done with these deposits and when to refund the deposits paid by tenants.\n\nLong term or short term rental contracts - which is the best? Why is a marketing plan so important? I take you through from creating a marketing plan (which helps you narrow your focus and set goals) to writing ads and to use the incredible resources of the Web to broaden your reach for prospective tenants. I further discuss Fair Housing laws whenever you advertise and Internet marketing.\nYou can count on this course to be your essential step-by-step toolkit to accelerate your success in Property Management\nWith the strategies that you learn from this course, you will be able to efficiently capitalize on Property Management and get more every day!\nCourse duration - 1.5 hours.\nONE-TIME ENROLLMENT FOR LIFETIME LEARNING\nGet live access to NEW and UPDATED content at zero additional charges after enrolling in this course. This course will be regularly updated to bring you the latest tips and information!\n**************************************************************************************\n30-DAY MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE\nI trust that you'll like this course as much as I enjoyed teaching it.\nYou can choose to cancel the course if it is not to your liking within the first 30 days and get a full refund of your money.\n**************************************************************************************\nAre you excited to start experiencing the enjoyment of working more efficiently than you've ever been?\nGetting yourself enrolled is easy.

      "description": "Want to learn how to build professional, dynamic, institutional-quality real estate development models in Microsoft Excel? This course will take you by the hand and walk you step-by-step through the entire process. This is a project-based course, meaning you'll start with a blank Excel workbook and walk away with a fully-functional, dynamic, eight-tab real estate development model that YOU'VE created - from scratch.\nWhen I was first learning real estate financial modeling, I would download real estate investment models or real estate investment calculators on the internet, only to feel overwhelmed and frustrated by the complex functions and formulas everywhere in the Excel file. And once I felt like I was getting used to one of these things, I still was petrified to touch or change anything because I didn't want to \"break\" the model. And honestly, even if I understood it and I believed the model was working correctly, I still had no idea if I could even trust the calculations in the first place.\nIf you've ever felt any of these things, this course will pull back the curtain and uncover the \"Black Box\" that most real estate financial models appear to be. By the end of this course, you'll be able to build a dynamic, professional-quality real estate development model from scratch, and your first one will be done by the time you finish the last lecture.\nThis course will teach you how to build a real estate development model the way the largest and most sophisticated private equity real estate firms look at deals. At the end of this course, you will be able to:\nBuild an institutional-quality, dynamic real estate development model from scratch\nLearn key Excel shortcuts to double your real estate financial modeling speed\nModify and customize existing real estate development models to fit your specific investment scenario and needs\nConfidently model key investment metrics such as the Stabilized Return on Cost, IRR, and Equity Multiple, and calculate these metrics automatically as you change manual input drivers\nBuild a dynamic construction budget (including S-Curve functionality)\nModel dynamic lease-up revenue and expenses that change automatically as construction timelines change\nBuild out floating rate construction loan draws, dynamic equity draws, and permanent take-out financing to accurately model any financing structure\nBuild formula \"checks\" to error-proof your work and feel confident your calculations are correct\nThis course is perfect for you if:\nYou're a college student or graduate student looking to break into real estate development after graduation, and you're looking to add the key technical skill sets to your arsenal that will put you head and shoulders above the competition and allow you to land a lucrative career opportunity in the field\nYou're a professional in a different field, but looking to become a real real estate developer on the side and want to be able to confidently analyze a ground-up development deal\nYou're an existing real estate professional looking to advance your career, increase your compensation, and break into the real estate development field\nYou've bought rental homes or duplexes, and now you're looking to become a real estate developer and want to feel confident in your ability to analyze new ground-up construction projects\nHere's what some of our students have had to say:\n★★★★★ \"I have taken other RE Development courses and they were over-complicated and hard to follow, this course was just the opposite. As with all his other courses, Justin delivers a clear and easy to follow lesson, making him easily the best Real Estate modeling instructor on the internet. I honestly bought this course within 3 minutes of its release, and it was worth every penny.”\n★★★★★ \"I've been in CRE valuation, investment sales brokerage, and realty capital for over 30 years, and I've never taken a class with this much detailed content. Justin not only crushes this course, but more importantly pulls back the curtain on how institutional investors view and model their deals. You'd have to work at an institutional PE or CRE firm for years to learn what he is offering here. It's not an easy walk but if one can master this content, you can size and model anything in the CRE universe. Congrats, Justin - job well done!\"\n★★★★★ \"Another flagship course by Justin! First, it's all about the thoroughness of the course design (takes me step-by-step). Second, and more importantly, Justin keeps the communications going with his students. I am experiencing this myself and you could verify this by how many I post in the Q&A section, and how many got answered. I don't get this treatment often.\"\n★★★★★ \"Something that I've been looking for for a long time! I feel like I understand how to approach almost any RE modeling going forward.\"\n★★★★★ \"I've taken several real estate financial modeling courses to improve my skill level for my job. This is by far the best I have taken. Everything is taught step by step with clear instruction and explanations of formulas.\"\n★★★★★ \"Another great course taught by Justin, this was filled with many in depth excel modeling techniques to implement when forming a development model. Trying to break into CRE finance/ development can be tough and these skills can really give you an upper hand on the competition. Thanks!!\"\nIf you have a basic understanding of real estate finance, and you're looking to apply that knowledge to analyze new real estate development opportunities, enroll now and let's get started building this model together today.

As a licensed Realtor for the past 4 years, I have managed over 50 rental properties for clients across Louisiana. I currently have twenty-five 5-star reviews on Zillow. I also own a fourplex, a single family home, and 4 mobile homes that are all tenant occupied. I know landlords and I know tenants from all walks of life, and more importantly, I know what they are looking for and what they are thinking.\nThis course will teach you a variety of tools, tips, and tricks that will focus on two main course objectives: Reduce Vacancy Time, and Maximize Rent Rates.\n\nVacancy is the number one enemy of a property owner! As a property manager, I picked up a client that had a vacant condo unit for 6 months that was under contract with a \"professional\" property management company! Think of the all those lost rents. And we know that just because the rent isn't coming in, doesn't mean the mortgage bill, the association fee, or the tax and insurance bill stop! He reached out to me in desperation. Using the tools in this course, I leased his property in a mere THREE DAYS! I have done this multiple times!\n\nThere is something for everyone in this course, from the person considering buying their first property, to the new Landlord, to the professional property manager!\nI will share with you my years of practical and professional experience in what works and what doesn't. You will learn:\nProper attitude and mindset.\nHow to make your property Rent Ready to maximize results for as little money as possible!\nAll techniques of Physical Advertising (much more than one sign in your yard!)\nAn in-depth study of multiple Online Advertising techniques to get your property exposed to thousands of renters in your local area. I will show you EXACTLY how to prepare the perfect advertisement and on what sites to post it on. Your phone will be ringing off the hook with leads!\nWhat to do after the signs and Ads are up to guarantee success! Most people don't get this part, even professional property managers that I have worked with! If you fail here, then all of your previous work is for nothing!\nWhat to do before, during, and after the showing.\n*******And finally towards the end of this course, I will share a technique that will TRANSFORM the way you show property FOREVER! This technique will supercharge the power of your showings by giving your property an aura of SCARCITY and VALUE! I will give you a real example in which this technique had a prospect BEGGING me to lease the property and gave me SIX MONTHS in ADVANCE CASH for rent at the very first showing!*******",

      "description": "Getting hired as a mortgage loan processor can be an easy and simple process if you know what to do. This course will teach you how to prepare and how to apply with banks and lenders that are currently hiring. I will provide you with all the information you need to apply with over 13+ banks or lenders that are looking for mortgage professionals!\nThis essential course will go over the most important things you need to complete and prepare before applying as a loan processor even if you don't have any experience at all. Some of the key topics that will be on this course are: how to prepare a mortgage specific resume, how to get double or triple your income as a loan processor, the difference between working for a lender, bank, or mortgage company, how to manage your income, and what type of lifestyle you will have as a mortgage loan processor. Loan processors are in high demand and can become your dream job by having a stable, high salary, and dynamic job.\nMain benefits of this course and of getting hired as a mortgage loan processor are:\n- Start making a great salary even with no prior experience\nThis course includes 13+ banks and lenders that are hiring mortgage professionals and some of which provide signing bonuses of $25,000 while offering a starting salary of over $50,000+.\n- Learn how lenders and banks hire and what to say on the interview\n- Potentially work from a remote position (from home)\n- Learn how to overcome the experience requirement most lenders have\nMortgage loan processors have the potential to grow in their career or upgrade to another position by becoming an underwriter or closer. What many loan processors don't consider is that they can even start their own loan processing company or their own mortgage company with the knowledge they acquire and grow their income to $150,000+ per year.\nThe first two sections of this course will introduce you to the course and will teach you how to quickly and easily apply with lenders that are hiring right now. Learn exactly how to find loan processing positions on their website and apply immediately!\nThe third and fourth sections will take you through two hugely important topics of getting hired which are: how the hiring process works even if its done remotely, and second what to say on the day of your interview so that you become the ideal candidate. Getting an interview is great but even more important than that is maximizing that opportunity by knowing what they want to hear and what you should say.\n\n\nOnce you complete 100% of this course, you will receive a course diploma which is yours to save or print. For instructions on downloading your course diploma you can go to: https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229603868-Certificate-of-Completion\nYour instructor\nJoseph Correa is the founder and CEO of Finibi Mortgage, a licensed mortgage brokerage business based out of Orlando, Florida. Having closed hundreds of mortgage loans and processed many of them, he has the necessary processing knowledge to help you become a success.

      "description": "When you invest and look at potential deals, can you tell a gem from a lemon?\n\n\nMany people already know that the investing in real estate is one of the possible ways to transform your earned income (income from salary) to a passive income (income from an asset that doesn’t require your time and effort). But the problem is that they are not familiar with the real estate deals, they don’t know how they work and why a particular deal is better than another one.\n\n\nEverybody of us is afraid that some fast talking real estate agent might push us a lemon and we will have to deal with it for a long period of time and eventually even to lose money. To avoid this you need to know how to tell the good deal from the bad one.\n\n\nThat is the reason why I am creating my courses. I want to try to answer all your questions, to make your fears smaller by sharing with you my experience with the real estate. After I have shown to the very starters among you how and why the real estate is superior asset class and after I have proven (in another course) that the Real Estate market is predictable, now I want to show you how to know whether somebody is selling you a good investment or a lemon.\n\n\nHey,\n\n\nMy name is Svetoslav Deltchev and I invest in income generating real estate for the last 12 years. I am convinced in the advantages of the real estate investments and I will show you in this course how to use them as well.\n\n\nWho is this course for?\n\n\nThe course is for beginner investors who want to understand how to tell if a particular deal proposed to them is performing well and if it  suits their expectations or not. The financial ratios that I am elaborating in the course will help you to compare a property with the market and with the other alternatives that you have. This topic is a bit theoretical and mathematical, but I have tried to give you many practical examples for better understanding. On top you are welcome to ask me questions if you need further explanation or clarifications. We have also a Facebook Group for students questions and discussions. It’s called Udemy SD Academy. You may use the Udemy chat as well of course.\n\n\nDo you need any prior knowledge?\n\n\nNo. The course is for beginner investors as mentioned and you don’t need prior knowledge. There are some lectures that dig deeper in a specific topic, but I make a note at the beginning of the lecture that you may skip it, if it is too much for you.\n\n\nEven if you have no experience you will learn the various types of ratios and when to apply each one of them.\n\nThis course will be useful for people who are aiming to invest in:\n\n\nrental properties - multifamily properties, single family houses etc.\nFix&flip deals\nWholesale\n\n\nWhat you will NOT find in this course:\n\n\nI will not cover the topic “WHEN is the right time to invest in properties”. I have mentioned in one of the lectures that the availability of stable market patterns on the real estate market is one of its advantages but I haven’t gone into details.\nI will not cover the legal due diligence of a real estate transaction\nI have not offered real estate investing strategies\nI have not discussed the topic about the financing of the property transaction\nI have not covered the topic how to select the best property for our investment.\n\n\nThe course is FOCUSED on the way how YOU could tell the gem from the lemon when you are looking for a good investment!\n\n\nIn particular you will learn:\n\n\nthe 3 groups of financial ratios and when to use each one of them\nThe economic meaning of the interest rate and how interpret it\nThe 5 financial ratios from the first group and when they are helpful\nThe advantages and the disadvantages of the ratios of the first group\nThe “Time value of money” concept and how it changes the way we look at deals\nWe will introduce the second group of financial ratios\nMain differences between the ratios of the first group and the second group\nThe 3 ratios of the second group and how to calculate them\nSome more advanced topics like the most common mistakes people do when calculating the NPV\nThe application of the IRR ratio and when to apply it.\nSome pitfalls in the calculation and application of the IRR ratio - for more advanced investors.\nWhy we need debt in the real estate transaction\nWe will introduce the third group of financial ratios\nThe 3 financial ratios of the third group and when they are applicable\nWhich is the ratio that measures YOUR performance and not the performance of the asset\nHow exactly the debt is boosting the return of the investor\nWhat we should capitalise and what we should expense at once. How this changes the calculation of some ratios\nAnswers of some students’ FAQ\n\n\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n\nWhy we must differentia three groups of ratios? Can’t we just have directly the formulas of the ratios.\n- You could, of course, but when you bring some order in your knowledge it will be easier for you to keep the information for a longer period of time.\n\n\nCan I use these financial ratios on my market? Can I use them for every deal?\n- Of course. They work for everybody and for every market and for every deal. Actually I have also learn them many years ago from foreign language literature. This is universal language. These are mathematical equations and they are valid on the whole planet. For more of this I can’t take any guarantee.\n\n\nWhat if I can’t apply everything from the very beginning? Should I bring a financial calculator always with me to calculate the IRR for each and every deal?\n- What I am doing is to bring my smart phone with me, when I am going to an inspection of a new potential property. I calculate on the phone the ratios from the first group and it they make sense I continue to calculate the ratios of the other two groups. The ratios of the first group are ideal for a back-of-the-envelop calculation.\n\n\nWhy this course is right for me?\n- Because you need to know which deal is good for you and which one is a “no go”. The investors are doing this all the time. The are selecting, carefully choosing their next investment. Nobody is simply buying what is available on the market before making any analysis.\n\n\nWhy I should trust you?\n- I am investing in residential real estate for more than 12 years. I have experienced personally the pain of doing a deal without knowing if it will fly or not. The pain to buy a deal that is not working for you is much bigger than the effort to learn how to differentiate and compare the deals. I had to learn this the hard way. Don’t repeat my mistake!\n\n\n6. What are the best parameters of the financing and ratios that we should look for in a deal?\n- The answer of this question require more explanations, so I have tried to give a bit longer answer in my last bonus lecture. Please refer to is for more information.\n\n\nI wish you successful investing and don’t forget that there is no risk enrolling in this course. You have a 30 days money back guaranty.\n\n\nSee you inside the course!\n\n\nSvetoslav Deltchev",

      "description": "Instructor Symon He hosts near daily LIVE office hours on TikTok 10:30PM PDT. Find him @SymonHe.\nAlexander Lang - 5 Stars\n“Symon is so knowledgeable in the realm of real estate analysis I feel I've been in the business for years not months under his tutelage. His tone is smooth and well articulated. His \"Wholesaling-Calculator\" alone is worth the price of admission. You can literally plug in the numbers and all the work is done for you. I Highly recommend this course!”\nDerral Fralish - 5 Stars\n“Symon is great! I've completed two of his courses and highly recommend his lessons to anyone!”\nEthan Wong - 5 Stars\n“Another very good class from Symon. Clear lectures, and very good class materials. I really liked the included worksheets that had pitches to the two main types of end buyers.”\nSo you want to get into wholesaling, but you’re not sure how to evaluate a deal.\nThis is the course for you.\n\nBefore you decide to drop hundreds or even thousands of dollars on some real estate “guru’s” system, save yourself time and money by learning vital foundational knowledge here first.\nI don’t deal in fluff, just relevant concepts and tools you need to know in order to start learning how to evaluate a wholesaling deal.\nIf you want to learn the techniques that the pros use to evaluate their deals AND get a custom-built calculator to speed up that process for you, then this course will get you started on the right foot.\nBefore you read further it is important to note that THIS IS A BEGINNERS COURSE designed for total novices with little to no background in real estate. If you are an experienced real estate investor, you should look elsewhere. (Like maybe some of my other courses you can find on the bottom of this page!)\nI can't promise I'll help you get rich enough to buy your own a yacht and a pair of  Ferraris, but I can teach you the important fundamentals you’ll need to understand to properly evaluate wholesaling deals.\nAfter getting my MBA from Stanford, I worked on over $400M in different real estate deals.   And as a licensed broker and consultant, I've worked with many clients doing all sorts of deals, from wholesaling all the way to ground-up multi-million dollar commercial real estate deals.  I know what makes a deal work not work.\n\n\nMark Bowden  - 5 Stars\n“I have been a Realtor for over 10 years and have worked with investors during most of this time. Symon's course of \"Real Estate Wholesaling Investment Analysis for Beginners\" is a great resource for beginning investors and Realtors working with them. His Excel spreadsheet is also a great way to quickly analyze a property for investment purposes. if you decide to purchase a property you still need to do a detailed scope of work which this spreadsheet isn't designed for. Symon stated this in the course overview. He has additional courses that give you the knowledge you need to be successful in real estate investing.”\nJohnathan Mark - 5 Stars\n“Calculator will definitely be used. Also, I appreciate the ability to print out PDFs for my buyers.”\nHow do I know if this course is right for me?\nIf you've EVER wanted to know:\n•           The basics of wholesaling analysis\n\n•           What is the 70% rule?\n\n•           What is the After Repair Value, why it matters, and how do you calculate it?\n\n•           What is the Fixed Costs Method?\n\n•           What is the Maximum Allowable Offer, why it matters, and how do you calculate it?\n\n•           How do you pitch your property to a flip investor buyer?\n\n•           How do you pitch your property to a buy & hold investor buyer?\n\n\nIf you said YES to any of the above, then this course is definitely for you.\nHow is this different from your other courses?\nThis course only covers how to run an investment analysis for a wholesaling deal and nothing else.\nFor comparison, my other courses focus exclusively on other types of investing--running analysis for fix & flips and rental income properties as well as more comprehensive coverage of topics such as investing in apartments, investing with partners, investing in Airbnb units, commercial real estate, and more.\nIf you just want to learn analysis for wholesaling, then just take this course.\nIf you only intend to invest rental income properties, invest with business partners, in apartments or in commercial properties, etc.... then check out my other real estate courses here on Udemy.\n\n\nWhat if I don't have any real estate background?\nNo problem. You can get started without any real estate background. I’ve designed this as an introductory course for people just like you.\nWhen you’ve finished this course, if you want to learn other foundational and advanced topics, please feel free to check out my other courses here on Udemy.\nI have some real estate background already, what could I learn from your course?\nUnless you are already familiar and experienced with evaluating wholesaling deals and have your own effective calculators, you'll benefit from this course.\nAdvanced students have told me numerous times over the years that the investment calculator provided in the course is worth the price  by itself.\nCan you make me rich by taking this course?\nNo way! Not just from taking the course, anyway. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil.\nIf you take my course AND apply what you learned to make smarter invests in the future, then you have a chance at making some real money.\nWhat I can guarantee is that you will leave with some serious real estate investing knowledge, techniques, and tools.\nWhat else does this course cover besides real estate investing?\nThis course is ALL about and ONLY about investment analysis concepts and techniques for wholesaling. Nothing else.\nWhat will I be able to do after I take your course?\nAfter taking my course, you will be:\n•           Able to confidently use techniques like the 70% Rule and the Fixed Costs Method to evaluate your wholesaling deals\n\n\n•           Able to confidently present the deal economics to both potential flip investor buyers as well as buy & hold investor buyers\n\n\n•           Able to confidently use the custom-built calculator to evaluate all your future wholesaling deals\n\nWhat WON'T I get from this course?\n•           You will NOT learn everything there is to know about wholesaling.  This particular subject has a lot to cover and this particular course is only about the small (but important) analysis part of the process.\n\n\n•           You will NOT become an expert or understand advanced techniques.  This is a BEGINNERS COURSE meant for BEGINNERS.\n\n\n•           You will NOT get a real estate license from taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency of your state and country. But what is taught in this course has nothing to with getting a license, which focuses on how to legally transact real estate deals between buyers and sellers. This course is about investment analysis only.\n\n\n•           I will not be evaluating your personal investment deals for you in this course. This is about you learning how to do it on your own using the lessons and the tools here.  For students who want to become my consulting clients, I do offer private consulting services starting at $10,000 USD.\nDaniel Apte - 5 Stars\n“Great course! This is the kind of brass tacks number crunching we need to succeed in real estate—thanks!”\nGuy Perry - 5 Stars\n“Amazing course! Quick, but very detailed. You got to have this course if you are planning to do any wholesaling deal.”\nAnupom Ghosh - 5 Stars\n“....another great real estate financial analysis course created by Symon He. The spreadsheet and the lessons on ARV and MAO are very important when your dealing with rehabbers ,buy-hold, and other wholesalers because you have to know your numbers or you will go nowhere. Take the class!”\nWhat’s holding you back?\nAre you afraid this course won’t work?  I promise you it will.\nAre you afraid this course will work and you’ll actually have to start investing? I think that’s a pretty good problem to have.\nAre you afraid it will take time and effort? It will. Real estate isn’t an easy business; if it was everyone would do it. But if you put in the work I promise you’ll see results.\nBest of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for.\nSo go ahead and sign up.\n\n\nI hope to see you inside.\n-Symon",

      "description": "UPDATE: Instructor Symon He hosts near daily LIVE office hours on TikTok 10:30PM PDT. Find him @SymonHe.\nI’m very excited to unveil this brand-new course as part of my ongoing series in real estate investing.   Although the course is new, this is not my first course.  Just take a look at my thousands of 5-star reviews from my other courses to see the value and commitment I give to my students.\n\n\nGregory A. Weinstein on my Multifamily Investment Course- 5 Stars\n“Course material is comprehensive, presented in an engaging manner and the modeling tools have real-world applicability making this course valuable!”\nMark Forest on my ‘Fundamentals of Real Estate Course - 5 Stars\n“There is a tremendous amount of information in this course that far surpasses anything else offered by Udemy.\nJason Mora on my ‘How To Analyze Rental Properties Course - 5 Stars\n“I'm loving it so far. The content is top notch. The instruction is clear and concise. The pace is perfect and the extra resources are enormously helpful. Well done!”\n\n\nThe commercial real estate game has long been reserved for big financial institutions and deep-pocked private investors, but not anymore.\nWith the emergence of crowd-investing platforms and the right investment knowledge, practically anyone can start investing in commercial real estate today.\nIncluding you.\nWhether you're new to real estate investing or have dabbled in residential real estate, getting an understanding of commercial real estate can seriously expand your investment horizons.  However, you have to have some foundational knowledge before you get started.\nWith this course, you'll take the first crucial steps toward understanding commercial real estate.\nWhy should you learn from us?\nI have an MBA from Stanford University and have worked on many commercial real estate properties across a dozen asset types in multiple markets. I even helped create the underwriting standards for a 2000-store private restaurant chain, helping them open new locations around the world.\nAnd as a licensed broker and real estate consultant, I've helped many private clients with locating, evaluating, and structuring investment opportunities including multi-million dollar commercial property acquisitions and 1031 exchanges.\nMy co-instructor, Brandon Young, has a Masters in Real Estate Finance & Development from the University of North Carolina Charlotte as well as a Masters in Finance from Tulane University.

      "description": "Did you know that hard equity loans are the fastest and easiest loans to close? Are you looking to get hired by a hard equity lender by having the knowledge necessary to start working? When real estate prices go down, these are the lenders that start hiring as many loan processors, loan originators, and underwriters as they can. Don't miss your opportunity.\nHard equity loans are short term real estate loans that have high interest rates but that can close in a matter of days. Most states in the U.S. don't require that the loan originators be licensed. Most people don't know that during slow or declining real estate markets, hard equity or hard money loans are the most popular types of loans which can be a huge opportunity for people who are prepared to close these loans. These kinds of loans usually pay loan originators 1 to 3% of the loan amount which is usually pretty high. For example, if you close a $10M hard equity loan and charge 1.5% as your origination fee, you would be making a $10,000,000 x 0.015 = $150,000 commission on one single transaction closed. Most hard money loans are for higher loan amounts which is why they are such a profitable opportunity for most loan originators. If you're thinking of working for a hard money lender, this course will teach you the entire process and what its all about so you can get hired and start working even if real estate prices decline. Most people don't realize that real estate goes through cycles and when prices go down, you need to be able to offer a loan product that is highly sought after which is what hard money or hard equity loans are.\nHi, my name is Joe Correa, and I’m the CEO and founder of Finibi Mortgage, a licensed mortgage brokerage business based out of Orlando, Florida.

Let me explain…\nI’m sure you are very aware that we live in a very sue happy society!Dear Fellow Real Estate Investors,\nSo once again I ask you – Do You look good in stripes? If you answered No, then your prevention road map instructions are below…\nSafely Invest In Real Estate\nDid you know that the American Bar Association did a study over 10 years ago putting the number of law suits in the US at 20 Million per year!\nIn 2010 that number grew to 42 million! Of those, 15 million had to do with Real Estate transactions!\nIn order to have Success in anything life has to offer it is based on how YOU PREPARE YOURSELF ! In the legal profession, one of the first lessons you learn is that cases are won and lost in the Preparation !\nChance favors the prepared mind.Are you prepared for the legal hassle that could be opened if you make just one small mistake? “Ignorance of the law is no excuse”, that’s a quote according to the American Legal System. You may be saying, that’s what lawyers are for Jim. Well that’s fine if you want to spend thousands of dollars for legal opinions, or you are willing to entrust your investing business to what you hear from people at REI ( Real Estate Investing ) clubs that are just repeating something they read off the Internet or heard at a networking event.\nAfter years of investing, 26 years to be exact, what if you could learn to take care of potential problems before they happen? Well, as most of you know in addition to being an active real estate investor, I am also a Federal/State Arbitrator with over 27 years of experience with issues just like the ones I have described above. Since so many of you have e-mailed/called me frustrated on how you have put in mega hours of your valuable time and countless dollars into learning a strategy, just to find out that you can’t do it in your state, I have decided to release to you the very method I use to prevent this from happening, which will make you “bullet proof” from law suits without the use of expensive lawyers.\nIf this sounds good to you then continue reading below; if not I hope that all the lawsuits and violations you may be slapped with will be found in your favor and that of your wallet.\nHere’s the cool thing…\nI’ve discovered a way to get up and running safe guarding and bullet proofing your real estate investments within 7 days !\nI know this might be hard for you to believe and trust me, if I were you I would be skeptical too.\nBut here’s exactly what I’ve discovered:\nMost legal problems occur because of lack of knowledge by the investor. Believe me real estate is an ever changing arena which would require a research time 8 hours a day to keep up on the latest trends and regulations. I have figured out how to get these teams for FREE!\n5 minutes of investigation prevents 99%% of potential real estate investing problems.\nAttorney’s only give you an opinion based on their interpretation of the law, regulation or ordinance, and if that was the only thing you needed there would never be any law suits.\nMy mentoring student’s have paid me thousands of dollars for this information that I will share with you in this exclusive training.\nAnd although everything I’ve said so far might lead a reasonable person to believe that my program is tons of money… it’s not! Your investment is only $27.00 !!!!",

      "description": "Interested in learning how to analyze office and/or industrial real estate investments? This course was designed to take you from zero to hero in office and industrial real estate investing, After taking this course, you will be able to confidently analyze an office or industrial real estate deal, whether you're looking to buy a property on your own, invest with partners, or land a job with a top office or industrial real estate private equity firm.\nThis curriculum was specifically designed with the following people in mind:\nAspiring commercial real estate investors who want to buy bigger properties with less headache - Office and industrial properties are generally larger and often entail fewer headaches than a single-family home investment, a fourplex, or even a small apartment building. The longer lease terms and business-oriented tenant base allows investors to take a more hands-off approach to office or industrial than residential real estate investments.\nStudents or career switchers who want to land a job in office or industrial real estate private equity - According to CEL & Associates, the 2021 median total compensation for an office/industrial acquisitions associate was $146K per year. This course will teach you the fundamental office and industrial product-specific skills and knowledge you won't be able to find anywhere else.\nPassive real estate investors looking at investing in office or industrial real estate deals - Office and industrial deals can be extremely lucrative - long-term contractual lease obligations limit downside in the case of market corrections, operating income can be far more predictable than a single-family or multifamily real estate investment, and massive returns within short periods of time are very possible with lease-ups of large portions of a property's square footage. But as a passive investor, do you really know what you're getting yourself into? Is the property you are looking at a \"good\" deal? This course will teach you the main things you need to look out for when investing in an office or industrial real estate investment deal.\nYou'll also get a complete \"done-for-you\" office/industrial acquisition model included with your enrollment, so you can practice everything you've learned in the course in a full pro forma model. And with Udemy's 30-day money back guarantee, you can try the course out completely risk-free.\nSee you on the inside!",

While all of the examples in the course use US properties, ALL of the concepts taught and tools provided inside are still useful for any market around the world.  In fact, I have students from over 190 countries who are learning and using the tools provided in the course to help them invest in their local area.\nWhat if I don't have a real estate background?\nIf you missed it earlier, this course assumes prior knowledge or background.  Go take Symon He's Intro to Real Estate Investing course if you have ZERO background in real estate.\nWhy is there so much math and numbers?\nYou can't properly evaluate a real estate investment without looking at its numbers.  So if you hate math and don't like numbers, this course isn't for you.  Serious real estate analysis is probably not for you either.\nWhy do you use Excel so much?\nGood question.  Analyzing real estate investments involves looking at the numbers and it's easiest to do so with spreadsheets, which is why I use Excel extensively in this course.  But the good thing is you DO NOT have to build any of the models yourself.  You just need to be able to follow along and then you'll be able to use the models I give you.  For what it’s worth, these are the same models I used when I worked for a multimillion-dollar investment fund to help them find and analyze development deals.\nCan you make me rich by taking your course?\nNo way! Not just from taking the course, at least. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil.\nIf you take my course AND apply what you’ve learned to make smarter investments in the future, then you have a chance at making some real money.\nWhat I can guarantee is that you will leave with some serious real estate investing knowledge and techniques.\nWhat will I be able to do after I take your course?\nAfter taking my course, you will be able to confidently use professional real estate investment techniques to evaluate single-family home, office, and multifamily development opportunities.\n\n\nWhat WON'T I get from this course?\n•     You will not get a Real Estate License from taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency of your state and country. But what is taught in this course has nothing to with getting a license, which focuses on how to legally transact real estate deals between buyers and sellers. This course is about investment analysis.\n\n•     I will not be evaluating your personal investment deals for you in this course. This is about you learning how to do it on your own using the lessons and the tools here. If you really want us to consult, you can reach out to me. My hourly rate is $350/hr.\n\n\nWhat’s holding you back?\nAre you afraid this course won’t work?  I promise you it will.\nIf you’re an advanced student you know the value of being able to evaluate real estate development opportunities. This is invaluable information for any professional to have.\nBest of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for.\nSo go ahead, sign up and let’s get started.\n\n\nI look forward to seeing you inside!",

If you are looking for a quick and easy \"get rich quick scheme\" - and good luck with that strategy - you might want to look for a different course.\nAn educated real estate buyer needs to project cash flows for an investment, consider their ownership time horizon for a personal residence, review title issues, get bids on mortgage financing, procure the proper dwelling and liability insurance, review HOA documents and budgets, etc. and review all the other risk issues that could occur and cause the investment (or a personal residence investment) to perform poorly or fail. Then they must mitigate the potential that issues occur by doing the proper due diligence before they acquire the property, and during their ownership.\nThat’s what this course teaches, the basics on how to make better, smarter, long term real estate buying and investing decisions!",

Are you a loan originator, loan officer, loan processor, or underwriter or planning to become one and haven't gone over this document yet?\nThe old 1003 is out and the new 1003 is in and has new sections and is now 9 pages long. This document can make or break borrowers which is why you need to master this document if you want to close more loans. Besides that, you need to prevent fraud by knowing if information entered is accurate and truthful by noticing errors or information that doesn’t make sense or doesn’t match which will be covered in this course. Hi, my name is Joe Correa, and I’m the CEO and founder of Finibi Mortgage, a licensed mortgage brokerage business based out of Orlando, Florida.

When you complete the new 1003 correctly or properly, you can increase the amount of loans closed which will increase you total commissions, bonuses, and overall loan production. Imagine closing just 1 more loan per year by having this new knowledge. This would equate to $4,000 - $15,000 as a loan originator, loan processor, or underwriter. (Loan originators are paid on a commission or compensation basis, loan processors are paid a salary or per loan closed fee but can recieve bonuses based on loan production, and underwriters are paid a salary plus bonuses based on loans closed so all will benefit by mastering the new 1003.)\nCan you use an extra $4,000 - $15,000 per year?\nThis course will teach you how to interpret the new 1003 and all its sections and subsections, you will also learn what things a borrower should never do after being approved for a loan. Besides that you are going to learn what new information is required on the updated 1003 so that you know what needs to be double checked and go over this document.\nTHIS COURSE INCLUDES:\n3 complete instructor-led examples\n3 course assignments to put into practice what you're learning\n5 course pdf documents with samples for you to complete and follow along with this course\n24 hour access to your premium instructor via Udemy Q&A messaging\nlifetime access to the course\nexercises to help you implement what your learning\nCourse certificate upon 100% course completion\n30 day money back guarantee\nTHIS COURSE WILL TEACH YOU TO:\nCorrectly complete an entire NEW 1003 with all the added sections and subsections\nComprehend key sections that determine if loans are approved or not\nBecome an expert on the NEW 1003 so you can assist borrowers and other co-workers\nLand a job with a top lender thanks to your increased knowledge\nIncrease your income by closing more loans\nPrevent fraud and save you from losing your license\nIf you want to be a success in the mortgage industry, you need to take this course and learn how to master the new 1003 as a mortgage loan originator, mortgage loan processor, or mortgage underwriter.\nClick on the enroll button right now to get started.\nI’ll see you inside the course!",

      "description": "Are you looking to start a career as a mortgage loan processor? Have you considered hiring yourself instead of working for others? Did you know that all you need to start your own loan processing business is a mortgage loan originator license? Yes, that's right. Even if you're not thinking of starting your own business, the second and third sections of this course will show you how to process loans like a senior loan processor with practical examples which is incredibly valuable if you want to start working as a mortgage loan processor.\nStarting your own mortgage loan processing company requires very little time and will allow you to start working with lenders and mortgage companies not as their employee, but as the owner of your own company. You will build relationships with different companies that will send you loans to process for them. By outsourcing the work to you, they save on loan processor salaries and will increase their profits. You can choose to work for them or to work with them as a partner. Some lenders even hire loan processing companies as preferred loan processors which is a huge benefit because you will receive loans to process on a consistent basis and will charge a fee for processing these loans.\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN IN THIS COURSE?\nUnderstand what you need to do to start your own processing company\nDevelop your loan processing skills further so you can process loans even if you're new to this field\nLearn how to hire and pay loan processors that work for you\nGo over most of the loan processing documents you'll see in real life so you can become as knowledgeable as possible\nHow to think like a senior loan processor\nHow to double, triple, or quadruple your income by charging lenders and mortgage companies a flat processing fee\n\n\nLoan processing companies normally charge between $300 - $900 per loan processed which can result in an annual income of:\n$300 x 20 (loans processed per month) x 12 (months in a year) = $72,000 or more in annual income on the low end\n$900 x 20 (loans processed per month) x 12 (months in a year) = $216,000 or more in annual income on the high end\nWHAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS COURSE?\n35 downloadable course documents as pdf files\n5 Practical exercises\n2 advertising examples you can use to get your business started\n2 Practice tests to prepare you to start your own loan processing business\nMany examples of how to complete the most common loan processing documents\nAccess to the instructor in case you have any questions\nIn the first section of this course, you will learn how to set up and start your mortgage loan processing business, including: how to get MLO licensed to start your processing business, how to create and build lender and mortgage business relationships to bring in loans to process, what you need to do to get paid and pay others, where you can find the right contacts that will send you loans to process, and how much you can expect to get paid as a 1-person company or if you decide to hire other loan processors.\nIn the second section of the course you will learn what steps are necessary when processing a loan file including: what documents need to be reviewed and supplemental documents such as letters of explanation (LOX's) and gift letters, what third party verifications should be completed and sent out such as VOE's, VOM's, VOD's, VOI's, request for title, request for insurance, etc. , who will take care of different steps in the process, who you need to be in contact during the loan process to get the loan to closing, what lenders and mortgage companies need to provide you so that you can perform your job (ID's, passwords, credit vendor information, etc.), how to obtain a denial letter when necessary, what the underwriter will take of, what the mortgage loan originator is responsible for, and much more. Also, I will go over some of the most important loan documents you will need to read and understand as a loan processor including: the loan estimate, a conditional loan approval, and mortgage payoffs and how to fill them out.\nThe third section will go over important things you need to consider when starting a loan processing business such as working remotely and hiring loan processors remotely. You will additionally learn what loan processors should be doing and what loan processors should not be doing which is very important either as the owner of a loan processing business or as a loan processor that works for a lender or mortgage company.\nThis course, in combination with my course on \"Loan Processor & MLO Mortgage Math: Problems & Solutions\", will give you the tools necessary to become knowledgeable enough to become independent as a loan processor.\nOnce you complete this course, you will have advanced loan processing knowledge and a course diploma to show employers. A course diploma will be available to you when all sections have been completed at 100% which you can save or print. For instructions on downloading your course diploma you can go to: https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229603868-Certificate-of-Completion\nYour instructor\nJoseph Correa is the founder and CEO of Finibi Mortgage, a licensed mortgage brokerage business based out of Orlando, Florida.

Coming up with 20% down is a difficult task for most investors and can be the biggest hurdle when attempting to break into investment real estate. This is a step by step walk through the Lease Option Agreement I have used to acquire my rental properties. At the completion of this course you will have an agreement you can take to your local real estate attorney and get into compliance with local and state laws. You will be one step closer to achieving your goal of controlling a rental property with no money down.\nWith real estate being a great vehicle to becoming wealthy, this will be a great tool to help you begin with minimal resources. Once you acquire the property you will still have to maintain a good working relationship with the owner, but you will be on your way to building a real estate portfolio. Although Lease Options and Owner Financing a great tools to get your foot in the door of the real estate business, then end goal should be to acquire the title from the seller and have 100% control of your own property. That is how you build wealth!",

This course will teach you how to:\nConfidently be able to run the acquisitions process when purchasing commercial real estate properties, either on your own, with partners, or in your job at a real estate private equity, brokerage, or lending firm.\nMinimize your equity investment and maximize profit potential through understanding fee and waterfall structures, and how JV equity partnership structures are commonly put together on commercial real estate transactions.\nDetermine if a career path in acquisitions is right for you based on what you want to get paid, how you want to get paid, and what your goals are over the long-term.\nThis course will cover the entire process of a commercial real estate acquisition from start to finish. You'll learn things like the key components of physical and financial due diligence, how investors go about the equity raise process, what lenders are looking for when assessing your deal, and even how you can structure your partnerships with equity investors to create a \"win-win\" scenario for all parties involved.\nUltimately, you'll leave this course with a strong understanding of the real estate acquisitions process for apartment buildings, retail shopping centers, office buildings, and industrial properties, whether you're looking to do deals on your own (and raise capital to do it), or you just want to get a more detailed look into what your company is doing when taking down a new acquisition.\n\n\nHere's what some of our students have had to say about the class:\n★★★★★ \"Clear and to the point. Love that he does not waste time. Lays it out simply and clearly.\"\n★★★★★ \"A great high-level introduction to syndicating real estate deals! I work for a small commercial real estate development/management company, and I'm just beginning to put these sorts of deals together myself, so it was nice to have such a solid run through of the process. I'm working through a few other RE financial modeling courses by Justin and I'm really impressed with his knowledge, pacing of course material, and the quality of his explanations. Having an in-depth understanding of these course topics and the ability to apply what I've learned has really helped me stand out at work.\"\n★★★★★ \"This is an excellent overview of real estate syndication deals and the transaction elements of a typical commercial real estate acquisition. The material is presented in a logical and easy-to-follow manner from the start to finish of the acquisition deal cycle. The material in this course could serve as a comprehensive checklist for the proper execution of commercial real estate transactions. This course exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone interested in understanding how real estate syndication works or learning the commercial real estate transaction process.\"\n\n\nII hope to see you in the course!",

      "description": "Welcome to Real Estate Fundamentals: Market Research & Property Analysis course. This is a comprehensive tutorial designed to equip you with the essential skills and knowledge required to succeed in real estate business. This course covers basic market research, property valuation techniques, financial modelling for real estate, and key metrics to evaluate investment opportunities. Whether you are planning to buy a property or just intending to explore opportunities in the real estate market, this course will help you to make more informed and data driven decisions. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of real estate investing, such as getting to know different types of investments, understanding common risks involved, and learning how economic factors like interest rates and inflation impact the market. Then, in the next section, you will learn how to conduct extensive market research for real estate. We will be focusing on key metrics like median sale price, rental yield, vacancy rates, demographic data, days on market, and foreclosure rates. Additionally, we will also leverage Perplexity AI to automate some of the market research tasks, making the process more efficient and straightforward. Afterward, we will learn how to conduct property analysis and valuation, using Crexi as the primary tool. This will enable us to understand market trends and apply data-driven insights to determine a property’s true value. Following that, we will learn how to build real estate financial models and conduct risk analysis, using spreadsheets to model different financial scenarios, including revenue stream, ROI, and cap rates. This will enable us to assess the financial viability of properties and make better investment decisions. Then, in the next section, we will apply our knowledge to a case study by selecting one property from Zillow and another from Redfin, and using the concepts learned to analyze their market potential. This will enable us to compare properties across different platforms and develop practical skills for evaluating investment opportunities. The next section will cover taxation and regulations, specifically, we will explore the various taxes that impact real estate investments and how to navigate regulatory environments, helping us optimize our investment strategy while minimising legal and financial risks. This will empower us to make informed decisions and safeguard our investments. Lastly, at the end of the course, we will learn how to use Julius AI to automatically analyze real estate market data and extract valuable insights. You will be able to ask any question about the data, and the AI will provide the answers.\nBefore getting into the course, we need to ask these questions to ourselves, why should we learn about real estate business? Why does this sector have a good prospect? Well, here is my answer: Real estate offers the potential for passive income, allowing investors to earn steady income with minimal active involvement. With the right strategy, it can generate long term growth, providing financial security and stability. Additionally, real estate tends to appreciate over time, making it a sustainable asset that can yield consistent returns, even in fluctuating markets. It also offers tax benefits, such as deductions on mortgage interest and property taxes, which can enhance your overall financial strategy. Furthermore, real estate provides diversification to your portfolio, reducing risks by balancing other investments.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of real estate business, such as getting know different type of real estate investments, common risks involved, how interest rate and inflation impacting the market\nLearn about real estate market research metrics such as median sale price, rental yields, vacancy rates, demographic data, days on market, and foreclosure rate\nLearn how to analyze real estate market using Crexi, Placer AI, and X Map AI\nLearn how to conduct real estate market research using Perplexity AI\nLearn how to conduct real estate supply demand analysis and comparative market analysis\nLearn about property valuations methods using income approach and cost approach\nLearn how to analyze location and demographics using Neighbourhood Scout\nLearn how to calculate cap rate, COCR, and return on investment\nLearn how to build real estate financial model in Google Sheets\nLearn about real estate risk assessment\nLearn about real estate debt and leverage, specifically comparing fixed rate mortgage and adjustable rate mortgage\nLearn how to analyze a single family home from Zillow\nLearn how to analyze apartment unit from Redfin\nLearn how to calculate property tax, capital gain tax, and rental income tax\nLearn about real estate regulations, zoning laws, landlord tenant laws, and environmental regulations\nLearn how to analyze real estate data using Julius AI",

      "description": "***Updated November 2020***\nDo you enjoy riding around looking at old houses? Have you always wanted to fix and flip a house but you were not sure where to start?

Do you want to make money in Real Estate Investing? Are you a Homeowner, Landlord or Real Estate Investor who would like to save money by doing your own home repairs? Would you like to become knowledgable enough about Home Improvement, to hire the right contractors and know if they are doing their job properly? Would you like to learn how to \"Fix\" a \"Fix and Flip\" deal?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then this course is for you!\nThis course will teach you what you need to know to \"Fix\" many of the common problems that occur in your personal/investment properties. This course is dynamic and new lectures will frequently be added!\n*Bonus Section* For those who decide you don't want to make any repairs yourself, this course will also teach you how to Find, Select and Manage a General Contractor (GC) to have the repairs completed for you.\nSave Thousands of Dollars Fixing Your Own Houses\nThe knowledge that you will gain from this course can save you thousands of dollars as a homeowner or investor and make you thousands of dollars as a handy man. Not only will you save money in labor costs, but you will save money in holding costs since you will no longer have to wait on contractors to squeeze you into their schedule.\nLearn in Real Time\nThis course will be jammed packed with live action video that comes with in-depth  explanations. In these videos, the contractors take their time making repairs, which will insure that you fully comprehend the lesson at hand. Important concepts will be reinforced throughout the course to make sure that you get a solid understanding.\nYou will see:\nReal live installs taking place on real live projects.\nReal life improvisation where you have to find shortcuts and work arounds.\nDays in the field just to watch \"general\" work being done around construction projects\n\"Behind the scenes\" footage of contractors in action!\nThese aren't just some boring \"how to\" videos that you can find on YouTube, you're actually getting exposed to real life projects by real life investors, so there's no need to spend hours searching online video sites since all of these videos will be contained in the course and updated frequently.\nThe ultimate goal of this course is to give you enough knowledge to do your own home improvement OR to give you enough knowledge to know if a contractor is trying to \"BS\" you or not.\nWhat makes this course unique from the many real estate courses on the market is that it is designed for individuals who want to maintain their day job and who have little knowledge about real estate home repairs. The lessons will teach you the practical knowledge and the \"in the field videos\" will show you how we apply these principles in real life, to make high quality home improvements. It is a great course that will allow you to learn more about real estate while you begin to gain experience and generate a profit. It is also a great way to learn Rehabbing if you plan on doing the BRRRR method to real estate investing!\nThis course covers all of the things that I wish I had known when I first began investing in real estate. I have placed an extra emphasis on teaching this course as if we were sitting in the same room, chatting about real estate investing and home improvement.\nIn this course, I will take you on live \"days in the field\" where you get to see properties that we have worked on, properties that we are currently working on or properties that local contractors are working on.\nI will be updating this course often with new home improvement information and videos. Besides the extensive knowledge and resources that I provide you in this course, the biggest benefit, in my opinion, is the fact that you have access to ask me and your classmates questions, at any time in this course. As a Bonus, I have partnered with several other Real Estate Investors to create a Facebook Group to assist with questions and networking. Please Feel free to join us there as well in the group named: Happy People Real Estate Investing.\nWhether you want to fix and flip a deal, learn more about real estate/home improvement or just network with like minded individuals, this course is for you! Enroll in this course now to get started.

      "description": "This course is for Airbnb hosts or managers who have multiple listings and need to save time on repetitive tasks. Everything inside this course comes from my own experience: I'm a part-time real-estate investor and I rent my properties on Airbnb. However, the more properties I was buying, the more time I was dedicating to hosting. And since this is not my main business activity, I put everything in place to automate and optimize it to the maximum. As of today, I arrived at a point where almost everything works in the background. Here are some of the tasks I automated:\nBookkeeping inside Google Sheets. Everything is filled and calculated automatically.\nCleaning crew dates notifications. They receive the next check-out dates automatically by text message.\nMessaging with guests: 90% of it is automated, the rest is optimized so they don't need to ask me questions.\nSelf check-in: guests always arrive and depart by themselves, I never need to go myself.\nBetween the bookings: my cleaning crew is efficient and takes care of everything. Refills are optimized.\nBetter ratings. Thanks to a few tricks, my ratings are going up automatically.\nAnd although in this course I will show you how to get your Airbnb booking data inside Google Sheets, you will also be able to do get it inside Xero and Quickbooks if you prefer to use that. This is not covered in this course but once you understand how it works with Google Sheets you will be able to easily reproduce the same system with QuickBooks and Xero. For everything else, I'm still working on the remaining manual tasks and I'll be updating the course when I come up with automated solutions. But for now, this can already help you free out a lot of time. Just please understand the following before taking the course:\nI will be using paid services here, you can't make these things work for free.\nSome parts are very technical but totally doable. There is no coding involved.\nThere might be glitches. You'll need to look for solutions and I'll try to help where I can.\nSo, as an Airbnb host, if you feel concerned by the problems I'm mentioning here, don't hesitate to take this course!",

      "description": "Are you frustrated with the get rich quick schemes on house flipping and wish there was a course that explained the hidden secrets of auctions and how the process really works? This course examines single family homes as an investment property class, how trustee foreclosure auctions look like, what you need to know to successfully bid and compete with flippers and other investors, and how the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) got it right or maybe wrong. Using scientific research, case studies, along with my personal experiences this course will provide you with winning techniques and key insights.\nBy the end of the course, you will feel both confident and comfortable bidding, buying and investing in properties.\nFrom 2009-2011, single family homes were for the most part a very new concept. There were no real BIG players. Then large companies started buying properties almost over night and traditional flippers started to get outbid at a very quick pace.\nThis course will teach you to understand the difference between how a flipper analyzes a property and how an investor analyzes a property. And more importantly, what this means on auction day and how to be prepared and win successfully against the competition.\nIf you are not a math wizard, no problem. Included with the course are materials to help you analyze properties easily and quickly, and handy check-lists for auction preparation and research.\nGoing once...going twice... SOLD.

While both perusing a myriad of entrepreneurial ventures such as clothing brands, door-to-door sales, fitness training and wholesaling, it was only when they partnered together that they saw any true momentum. Since starting mobile home investing together, they have collectively closed 38 deals within the past 14 months and have developed a passion in helping others by sharing the system that lead to their rapid success.\n\n\nA Word from Branden & Brian:\nThis course is special to us because we had both previously been unsuccessful with traditional wholesaling as we soon realized that we were battling for leads who already felt bombarded by other investors. We also didn't have enough money for fix and flips or rentals, and we both felt extremely discouraged. However, neither of us gave up and instead found mobile home investing, which we now consider to be the most unsaturated market in real estate. In this course, we share our methods that have been crucial to ensuring our success in this unique real estate niche. In addition to our personalized explanations, we demonstrate how to take care of business on the front end, by properly understanding lead generation and negotiation, as well as the back end, by showing you how to run simple comparables, financial analysis, and the paperwork to smoothly close your deals.\nTo truly be successful as a mobile home investor you have to be able to master many moving pieces at once, though it is cannot be overstated how rewarding the end result is. Through this course, it is our hope that we can share the success we've achieved with you and your future endeavors.\n\n\nWho this Course is For:\n• This course is designed for anyone who wants to start and scale a successful side hustle to replace their primary income\n• Existing real estate investors who want a faster, less saturated niche and more scalable system to acquire profitable deals",

We had to get those battle scars. But you dont need to.  By following this path, YOU dont need to make those same mistakes we did. You’ll already be taking the right actions\n\n\nWhat would achieving your goals mean to your life?  If you’re like most people, the first answer might be, having more money.  But how would it affect those around you? Your family, your partner, your friends.  How much would people in your social circle admire you.  They’d probably look to you, for the secrets to life too. They might ask your advice. And then YOU too, can share this knowledge, and help THEM climb the ladder too.\nIf you follow this model, and everything you’ll learn in this course, you WILL achieve those goals in your personal life, and in your business.\nAll you have to do, is follow the plan.\n\n\nSo let’s look at some of the things, you’ll learn in this course\n\n\nYou will learn:\nHow to find the most viable (& profitable) project\nHow to attract the perfect buyer, & sell them exactly what they want\nIdentifying the type of areas to avoid, at any location in the world (without ever travelling there)\nOptions to develop the perfect property, that only the professionals use\nHow to get your project plans approved quickly\n10 things to look out for, in your chosen area - (that add value whilst you sleep)\nHow to calculate the Yield on a Real Estate deal\n11 strategies to finding more deals, that the professionals use\nHow to create & manage a constant flow of potential deals\nBuilding a DREAM TEAM of experts, to help you do more deals & make more money\nWhat permissions & licences you'll need before starting your project\nWhich features add the most value, and which features to avoid\nThe three options to completing the project, & the pro's and con's to each\nFinding & working with contractors\nHow to specify and buy materials for the project\nHow to develop a project budget, to avoid spending too much money\nWhich Project management tools to use, and which to avoid\nProject sequencing for both renovation & new construction projects\nPreparing a resource schedule for the project\nLearning about Critical paths in a project, & how to avoid serious over-runs\nPreparing a cash flow forecast for the project, to avoid running out of money\nUnderstanding the various options to financing a project\nThe main construction methods used across the globe\nThe legal obligations & responsibilities when developing Real Estate\nWhat types of insurance you'll need for your project\nHow to comply with your Health, Safety, Environmental, Waste & Welfare responsibilities, to avoid legal action\nWe'll look at some example projects\nHow to track progress on a project, & what to measure\nWhat are the biggest cause of delays & hidden costs, and how to avoid them\nThe options to exiting the project\nWhen is the best time of year to sell Real Estate\nHow to Market your property, & what you'll need to do, to get the best results and sell quickly\n10 strategies to sell your project, that only the professionals know about.\nHow to attract investment from other investors for your project\nHow to measure returns on your project, & what to measure\nCreating a plan to achieve anything you want, using Real Estate as the vehicle to get it\nThe Number 1 rule to being successful at Flipping Real Estate\nHow to Manage your Project\nProduce GANTT charts like the professionals\n\n\nNOTE:\nThis course has a unique feature that means you can skip the sections that you aren't interested in.  The course starts with having the right Mindset, whilst I think this is important to achieving anything, if you want to get right into the detail, you can just skip that section, and the rest will take you through the process from start to finish\n\n\nIf you're ready to start your property journey, let's get started NOW",

I found myself aimless as a result, asking questions like:\n\n\nWhich skills do I need to have to be competitive for jobs?\nHow do I build my network?\nWhere should I be looking for job opportunities?\nOnce I actually land an offer, what type of money should I expect to be making?\nIf you're asking yourself these questions right now, and you want a step-by-step guide for how to go about this process and ultimately land your dream job in commercial real estate, this course is the resource you've been looking for.\nThe commercial real estate industry is more competitive than ever, and even if your technical skills and experience measure up, actually showcasing this in your application materials and building the relationships you'll need to get your foot in the door are completely different animals. If you want to stand out from the crowd of applicants, you need to do things differently, and this course will provide a framework for how to do this and pitfalls to avoid.\nAccording to CEL & Associates, the 2022 median total compensation for an acquisitions associate in retail, office/industrial, and multifamily was 142K, 150K, and 130K, respectively. This course will teach you \"soft\" skills you'll need to make a job in the industry a reality, and land your first (or next) role in commercial real estate.\nIf you're ready to break into the industry but still on the fence about the course, here's what some of our students have had to say about the curriculum:\n★★★★★ \"Really good insight into the whole CRE job process, from start to finish. I like how comprehensive this course was, from learning how to adequately use LinkedIn, to negotiate your offer, and what to do next. I've taken a number of courses from Justin, and every time there is something new to learn, even for somebody that's already in the RE arena.\"\n★★★★★ \"Another high quality course from Justin. [...] Wish I knew about this a couple years ago. Very actionable networking and resume advice. Super helpful checklists and templates to systematize efforts. Lots of smart insights into how CRE people think and will view certain wording when sending networking emails/messages.\"\n★★★★★\"I truly enjoyed Justin's course of How to Land a Job in Private Equity Real Estate, and I am looking forward to starting a couple of his other course in the near future. I found this course to be very beneficial for someone just starting out or for a career switcher, like myself, because it provides a clear path of how to start and the skills needed to break in.\"\n★★★★★ \"Justin is very talented when it comes down to providing clarity and simplifying things. I've taken previous courses with him and I've always left with more clarity and confidence to apply what I've learned.\"\n\nWorking in commercial real estate is one of the best ways to get paid to learn, make great money in the process, and even invest in deals you wouldn't otherwise have had access to along the way. If that sounds like something you're interested in, I'm excited to have you in the course!",

      "description": "Hello and welcome to AgentExamPass\n\n\nMy name is N Max Rock. I currently hold my real estate brokers license in California and Georgia. When I first passed my license exam over ten years ago, I made a list of all the vocabulary words that I studied. While these words are for the California Real Estate License, over 80% of them are applicable to all real estate licenses nationwide. Furthermore, I have come up with a unique study method of arranging real estate exam words in order of the Most Active Index™ (MAI) which puts most used words at the top of the study list for maximum study efficiency. Over the years, I have revised and republished this list to help others pass their real estate exam on the first try. Hope it helps.\n\n\nHow To Use Our List -- Study our word list -- in order.\n\n\nWe use a system we developed called the Most Active Index™ (MAI). The MAI derives from crowd theory that given exposure to a large enough group, the most active words are the most important words. The most active words are therefore the words most likely to be used in real estate work, in real estate courses, and on real estate license exams nationwide. The words on our list are arranged according to the MAI from most active to least active. Users can maximize their study time by studying the most active real estate license words first.\n\n\nStudy our AgentExamPass word list -- in order.\n\n\nAs a quick overview, we have available for your studying-use: a 30 question quiz, 60 question quiz, 120 question quiz, 300 question quiz and a 600 question quiz. (Please check the title of the course you are looking at now to confirm which course this is.) The quizzes are cumulative so if you start with the larger question-number quizzes, then all the prior questions are included. As an example, the 600 question quiz is our complete exam-like multiple-choice quiz in order of most important study. Why have quizzes with fewer questions? Several reasons may apply to your situation. If you are not sure you are going to like our quizzes and want to give us a trial run, or you don’t have much time to study, then start with the 30 question quiz. If you have more time, then consider the larger number of questions as we feel all 600 are important for your test prep, all quizzes are in order of our Most Active Index™ (MAI). (Again, please check the title of the course you are looking at now to confirm which course this is.)\n\n\nGood luck and we wish upon you all of your dreams!",

      "description": "Interested in learning how to analyze retail real estate investments? This course was designed to take you from zero to hero in retail real estate investing, After taking this course, you will be able to confidently analyze a retail real estate deal, whether you're looking to buy a property on your own, invest with partners, or land a job with a top retail real estate private equity firm.\nThis curriculum was specifically designed with the following people in mind:\nAspiring commercial real estate investors who want to buy bigger properties with less headache - Retail properties are generally larger and often entail fewer headaches than a single-family home investment, a fourplex, or even a small apartment building. The longer lease terms and business-oriented tenant base allows investors to take a more hands-off approach to retail than traditional real estate investments, especially for triple-net single tenant properties.\nStudents or career switchers who want to land a job in retail real estate private equity - According to CEL & Associates, the 2021 median total compensation for a retail acquisitions associate was $137K per year. This course will teach you the fundamental retail product-specific skills and knowledge you won't be able to find anywhere else.\nPassive real estate investors looking at investing in retail real estate deals - Retail deals can be extremely lucrative - long-term contractual lease obligations limit downside in the case of market corrections, operating income can be far more predictable than a single-family or multifamily real estate investment, and massive returns within short periods of time are very possible with lease-ups of large portions of a property's square footage. But as a passive investor, do you really know what you're getting yourself into? Is the property you are looking at a \"good\" deal? This course will teach you the main things you need to look out for when investing in a retail real estate investment deal.\nHere's what some of our students have had to say:\n★★★★★ \"Excellent course that rivals master-level courses on the subject of Retail Investing. Extremely useful and practical!\"\n★★★★★ \"Great course overall! I especially liked the resources provided, it makes it a lot easier to apply what I learned in the course.\"\n★★★★★ \"Incredible value! Just what I was looking for!\"\n\n\nYou'll also get a complete \"done-for-you\" retail acquisition model that you can use when looking at new potential acquisition opportunities included with your enrollment in the course. And with Udemy's 30-day money back guarantee, you can try the course out completely risk-free.\nSee you on the inside!",

Doing something you're uncertain or perhaps somewhat anxious about can be really unnerving. But as they say, Discomfort is a catalyst for Growth. Doing the things that scare you are often the most rewarding.\nA good tip would be to find your \"why\", your reason for needing to invest, whether it's your children, your retirement, dreams of travel etc. This will motivate you to do what is necessary to achieve your financial goals. You've got this!\n\n\n- Are you afraid it will take time and effort?\nIt will. Real estate investing requires dedication, but that is why the returns are so rewarding compared to other asset classes! If it was uber easy, everyone would do it and returns would be way lower.\nOur Property Investment Strategy however, is designed to require minimal management because we put systems in place to reduce our involvement in the investment. Having had full time jobs for the majority of our Investing career, we needed flexibility and therefore designed our Strategy to optimise for \"part time management\". After all, if you aren't enjoying the investing experience, you can be driven to quit the journey prematurely.\n\n\nBest of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for.\nSo go ahead, sign up and let's start this profound journey of financial self-discovery together!",

The Assignment of Contract is what wholesalers use to make money in real estate. Learn all the components of the contract and when to use it. Also get 2 bonuses, including using the Double Closing as another tool to make more money.\nThe goal in real estate wholesaling is to sell the home to an interested party before the contract with the original homeowner closes. This means no money exchanges hands between the wholesaler and the seller, not at least until a buyer is found by the wholesaler. So how does the wholesaler make money? He makes a profit by finding a buyer willing to purchase the home at price higher than the amount agreed upon by the buyer. The difference in price—paid for by the buyer—is the profit, retained by the wholesaler.\nWholesaling real estate is best suited for people who want to get into the business, but don't have the finances. One of the best things is that you don't need to take a course, pass an exam, or get a real estate license to become a wholesaler. If you have great people skills and are fairly patient, wholesaling may be right for you.",

Instructors provided valuable detailed instruction!!!”\nGregory A. Weinstein - 5 Stars\n“Course material is comprehensive, presented in an engaging manner and the modeling tools have real world applicability making this course valuable!”\nThinking about investing in multifamily apartments but not quite sure how?\nThis course will show you professional techniques and give you professional investment models to help you find the winners in multifamily properties.\nBefore we go further, please note that this is an advanced course.\nThis course assumes you have a working knowledge of real estate investing fundamentals and you're comfortable working with financial models in Excel.\nIf you've never worked with financial models or aren't comfortable working in Excel, this is not the course for you.\nWe also assume you understand the fundamentals of discounted cash flows and you have a working knowledge of IRR, yields, cap rates, etc...\nYou’ll get the most out of this if you take one of Symon’s introductory courses first, which you can find at the bottom of this page.\n\n\nWhat's covered in this course:\n•           How to conduct market analysis at the regional, neighborhood, and competitive level.\n\n•           How to conduct financial analysis for a multifamily investment.\n\n•           How to analyze and verify income sources\n\n•           How to analyze expenses\n\n•           How to look at capital expenditures\n\n•           Evaluating rent roll\n\n•           Creating tenant profiles\n\n•           Key points of negotiations for the Purchase & Sale Agreement\n\n•           What is the Gross Rent Multiplier and how to use it\n\n•           Review of key investment metrics in the multifamily context.\n\n•           Proper due diligence\n\n•           Multi-family case studies\nIvana Bunjevacki - 5 Stars\n“A great course! Very detailed with in-depth explanations and analysis and above all, very practical and applicable to real life situations.”\nChris Ross - 5 Stars\n“Very methodical, great pace, excellent presentation”\n_______________________________________\nI don't live in the US, is the material still relevant to me?\nYes! While all of the examples in the course use US properties, ALL of the concepts taught and tools provided inside are still useful for any market around the world.  In fact, I have students from over 190 countries who are learning and using the tools provided in the course to help them invest in their local area.\nWhat if I don't have any real estate background?\nIf you missed it earlier, this course assumes prior knowledge or background.  Go take Symon's Intro to Real Estate Investing course if you have ZERO background in real estate.\nWhy is there so much math and numbers?\nYou can't properly evaluate a real estate investment without looking at its numbers.  So if you hate math and don't like numbers, this course isn't for you.  Serious real estate analysis is probably not for you either.\nWhy do you use Excel so much?\nGood question.  Analyzing real estate investments involves looking at the numbers and it's easiest to do so with spreadsheets, which is why I use Excel extensively in this course.  But the good thing is you DO NOT have to build any of the models yourself.  You just need to be able to follow along and then you'll be able to use the models I give you.  For what it’s worth, these models are the same ones we built when we worked for multimillion-dollar investment funds to help them find and analyze multifamily deals.\nCan you make me rich by taking your course?\nNo way! Not just from taking the course, at least. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil.\nIf you take my course AND apply what you’ve learned to make smarter investments in the future, then you have a chance at making some real money.\nWhat we can guarantee is that you will leave with some serious real estate investing knowledge and techniques.\nWhat will I be able to do after I take your course?\nAfter taking my course, you will be able to confidently use professional real estate investment techniques to evaluate multifamily deals.\n\n\nWhat WON'T I get from this course?\n•           You will not get a Real Estate License from taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency of your state and country. But what is taught in this course has nothing to with getting a license, which focuses on how to legally transact real estate deals between buyers and sellers. This course is about investment analysis.\n\n•           We will not be evaluating your personal investment deals for you in this course. This is about you learning how to do it on your own using the lessons and the tools here. If you really want us to consult, you can reach out to us. Our hourly rate is $350/hr.\nEverton Allen - 5 Stars\n“The presentation is simple, clear and relevant.”\nRichard Reichmann - 5 Stars\n“Absolutely the best value. Everything is very well explained. Trainer speaks slowly and clearly easy to understand. Excellent course highly recommended.”\nGlenn Levine - 5 Stars\n“The instructor is exceptionally knowledgeable and keeps the course very informative and interesting!”\n\n\nWhat’s holding you back?\nAre you afraid this course won’t work?  I promise you it will.\nIf you’re an advanced student you know the value of being able to evaluate multifamily properties. This is invaluable information for any professional to have.\nBest of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for.\nSo go ahead, sign up and let’s get started.\n\n\nWe look forward to seeing you inside!",

      "description": "If you care for your own property or the property you manage for others, such as landlords (as a property manager or estate agent), this training course will help and assist you in your everyday tasks so that you can efficiently and successfully accomplish the tasks. Many landlord-tenant relationships are stressful, but they wouldn't have to be. A rental property owner who understands how to properly manage his rental property and responds quickly to genuine issues of his tenants will be rewarded with great tenants who stay. The objective is to keep your rental property in good condition and also to invest in upgrades and improvements on a continuous basis. In so doing, you will be able to meet your long-term financial goals while also realizing that being a landlord is a wonderful primary or additional income source. The most significant advantage of having a property managed is the sense of security it provides the owners. Landlords may take comfort in knowing that their property, deposit, and tenant are being protected by an independent third party. Property managers will handle and manage the day-to-day challenges that may emerge, which could be time consuming. Please be aware that this is a basic Introductory course.",

        "The course is for landlords who wish to manage their own property portfolio, real estate agents who wish to manage properties on behalf of their clients i.e. landlords and newbies who wish to learn property management and want to make a career from property management."

I have since gotten other courses by Justin, as they are what I need to get me up to speed at my new job. Also, Justin is great at answering questions when I get stuck and pointing me in the right direction.\"\n★★★★★ \"Excellent Course! Thank you for all your hard work in transforming a complex concept into an easy to understand format. This course has multiplied my understanding of financial modeling and the use of Excel.

In addition such systems can help negotiations and also in the legal process, including drafting relevant emails and the like.\n\n\nUPDATE 22/9/23 - We have now updated the course to include some information about using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Chat GPT as this technology can be a very useful tool when buying, selling or renting property.\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\nWayne Norcliffe BA (HON's) DipHi, FRICS, FCABE, MISVA, RICS Registered Valuer",

This data, combined with the unique model of rental arbitrage without owning a single property, presents a lucrative and scalable opprtunity available to hosts wordldwide.\nIn this course, I would like to share with you all my learnings throughout my rental arbitrage journey so that you will be well on your way to join the movement of successful rental arbitrage entreprenuers.

I quit my full-time job at an advertising agency in October 2020 as a Paid Search Lead, as I was able to originally crack the eCommerce dropshipping code as a result of dropshiping on Facebook Marketplace, Etsy, eBay, and other retail venues. I then reinvested my eCommerce dropshipping profits into building my first rental arbitrage units on Airbnb, VRBO, Booking that are now seeing an average of 85-100% occupancy rates, and profitability year round.\nWith this said, not only will you learn about Airbnb VRBO rental arbitrage from A-Z, but I will also show you how to scale this business model to a passive-income level using a variety of automation tools. This will then allow you to do this model anywhere in the world, or rather let AI machines and teams do all the work for you.\nBelow are just a few topics that you can expect to find in this course:\n\nUnderstanding Rental Arbitrage\nUnderstand STR Laws, Regulations, and the Permitting Process\nUnderstanding Platforms' User Interface (UI)\nFinding Profitable Markets and Property Types Using Data\nHow to Setup and Market Your Properties for Instant Bookings\nSuperhost Criteria\nAutomating Efforts\nBuilding Teams\nScaling Tactics\nAnd More!\nWith all of this said, if you are looking to build a scalable source of passive income, dipping your toes into real estate, and short-term-rentals, great news you came to the right place! I included a preview video if you are interested in learning more, and I will always be available within 24 hours to answer your questions on Udemy, Instagram, and/or other venues.\nReady to make this happen?

Could you use some extra income in your life? Heard that fixing and flipping is fun? Do you want to make money in Real Estate?\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then this course is for you!\nIn this course we will ride around and film prospective properties, to give you a sense of what we look for before investing in a deal. When possible we will also give walk throughs of current deals we are working on to show work that is progressing.\nThis course will teach you what you need to know to analyze a Fix and Flip real estate deal in your city. Since no two houses are alike, you can expect to pick up more knowledge from every house that we analyze.\nThe methods that you will learn in this course will:\n1.) Allow you to make more money on your Real Estate Deals\n2.) Avoid deals which may lead to costly repairs\n3.) Save money by learning some of the \"tricks of the trade\" when it comes to types of repairs that are made on buy and hold (rentals) vs. resales (fix and flips)\n\n\nHere's what some current class members had to say about this course:\n\n\nRichard C. - 5 Stars\n\"Perfect Match for me. I am learning a lot.\"\n\n\nWisler A. - 5 Stars\n\"This is the best course ever on rehabbing and estimating expense. It's way better then other courses that I came across on Udemy.\"\n\n\nTanya DJ - 5 Stars\n\"This course so far is giving me all the tools to successfully start my business.\"\n\n\nWhat makes this course unique from the many real estate courses on the market is that it is designed for individuals who have the basic book/theory knowledge of Fix and Flip investing, but desire to see real live \"days in the field\". The analysis will teach you the practical knowledge and the \"in the field videos\" will show you how we apply these principles in real life, to make money. It is a great course that will allow you to learn more about real estate while you begin to gain experience and generate a profit.\nThis course covers all of the things that I wish I had known when I first began investing in real estate. I have placed an extra emphasis on teaching this course as if we were sitting in the same room, chatting about real estate investing. In addition I have added Closed Captions (optional), to the videos, for your convenience.\n\nIn this course, I will take you on live \"days in the field\" where you get to see properties that we are considering purchasing, as well as properties that we have fixed and flipped in the past.\nI will be updating this course often with new information and videos. Besides the extensive knowledge and resources that I provide you in this course, the biggest benefit, in my opinion, is the fact that you have access to ask me and your classmates questions, at any time in this course. We have recently started a Facebook Group called Happy People Real Estate Investing, so feel free to join us on there as well!\nWhether you want to complete a deal, learn more about real estate or just network with like minded individuals, this course is for you! Enroll in this course now to get started. With Udemy's money back guarantee, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain! Looking forward to the opportunity to interact with you and to help you learn how to make money fixing and flipping real estate!",

      "description": "Self-storage is an investment that offers outstanding returns and diversification along with downside protection!\n\n\nHigh Yields\nAccording to the National Association of REIT  self-storage had an average annual return of 17.43% from 1994 – 2017. This is higher than apartments, residential, industrial, office properties and the S&P 500!\nExcellent Diversification\nThe most common advice given to investors is to diversify your portfolio to protect yourself. You need assets that are low risk, yet give you passive income (especially for retirement.)\nBut if you’ve been watching the stock market (or the price of Bitcoin), you know that the world is incredibly unpredictable.\nDo you throw some money into an IRA and pray it works out? Purchase some rental properties and be woken up at 2AM by angry, who always pay late and will leave the property in shambles when they leave?\nInstead of only having a few tenants, you can diversify because you can have 50 self-storage units in the same place as you had 3 rental units! And Self-storage investments are not directly correlated with the market and produce reliable cash-flow.\n\n\nRecession Resistance:\nWhat you need is an asset that will perform well when the economy takes a turn for the worst.\nAmericans have way too much clutter and that clutter can make you some serious money! When the economy is good people buy more “stuff” and need somewhere to store it. On the other hand, when times are bad, people lose their homes or downsize, and utilize self-storage as a short-term holding area and wait for the economy to improve.\nThis is why I love self storage! It offers\nImpressive cash-flow\nDiversity\nRecession Protection\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\nEnroll Now and Start Generating Passive Income!\n\n\nIf for any reason you are dissatisfied with this course, we offer a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee & Refund\n\n\nOur instructor for this course is Glenn Brook,\nHe has invested in real estate for 14 years with his wife, Lisa.\nThey have done everything from notes to apartments, self-storage to fix& filps and  have been able to finally retire on the passive income from their investments and want to give back to the world in a small way by creating courses.\n\n\n** please note that this course was originally Self-Storage Investing: Make Passive Income Now! We have updated the audio and moved it to a Udemy account specifically for Self Storage.**",

Follow all the videos and all the 100 secrets one by one until you understand how to go about them together. After the end of this course, you will have sellers calling you tomorrow and not you searching for them and loosing confidence day-by-day.\n\nThere are hundreds of ways to market yourself, your services and your company that don’t cost hundreds of dollars. As a founder of Real Estate Investor School, a director of a profitable business mindset program in a large sales training center in Florida, I know how hard it is to stay ahead of the marketing game!\nIn such a competitive marketplace it is imperative that we all have a strong consistent marketing plan. I know what you are saying, who has the time or money to start more marketing strategies? Well, guess what it doesn’t have to be time consuming or bank breaking!\nI have put together a list of 100 low cost marketing tools you can use right away to increase your customer data base and presence in real estate and any market, get better search engine rankings and drive quality leads to your funnel or website.\nInstead of being a real estate, internet or any other business entrepreneur you must become a marketer of your entrepreneurial business or any other business you can think of, that is what it comes down to.\nIf you are in business, you need to make this change in your thinking, because no business is going to prosper or be successful without a lot of customers.\nMaking this change in thinking, in orientation about who you are, focuses you on the singularly must important and financially rewarding aspect of business marketing.\nThe money is in marketing, not in doing the business. It may take a while before you really sink in. Read it again. Take a minute, once you change your thinking to accept that you are a marketer first and a real estate or any business entrepreneur second, then you finally will be able to start making the kind of money you really want to make.\nAccepting your role as a marketer is the thing that will move you out of the rut of occasional mediocre deals and up into a level of sustained success that would not otherwise be possible for you, and this is true of anyone in any other business or industry.\nThe person or corporation, who is most on top of their marketing, makes all the money and dominates their market. There are two essentials requirements to become a successful marketer.\nFirst able understand that you are not your business. Your business does not by itself turn you into a great marketer of your business. You need to program your mindset to become a profitable marketer and to achieve that, you need two things:\nOne, you need to know how to write and develop the appropriate marketing methods and techniques for your business effectively.\nTwo, you need to have a devoted enthusiasm for the task. Now the question is:\nWhere are you going to get these two things? In this course.\nMarketing techniques are a set of actions, practical skills you can learn, reading books, scouting the internet, joining your local business organizations, going to seminars, you can easily learn what to do, and what will work best for your business. None of these, however, will provide you with devoted enthusiasm, the will power to stop procrastination and take action.\nFor that, you need to know how to activate your inner resources, your subconscious mind where the real you exist, where your will power drives and your permanent memory dwells,   and where would you go to learn how to become a successful and profitable?\nThis course will teach you one hundred ways to market yourself and your business and at the same time give you a bonus Technique #101 the hypno marketing script to record an audio disc or MP3 and listen to it frequently, designed specifically for entrepreneurs and marketers who need to learn at their subconscious level all these marketing methods and techniques.\nThe hypno marketing script in course is a manual of how to market yourself and your services to re-ignite and fuel your passion for your business and direct it towards your business marketing needs.\nThis course will teach you how to access a state of profound inner calm sometimes known as an 'alpha state'. Neurologically speaking, this is the brain state most conducive to effective long-lasting learning and change to give you the tools to build and sustain a burning commitment to doing what it takes for your business to flourish and the tools which you can call upon whenever you need.\nYou are invited to join our Cash Buyer Community Group\n\n\nTo your success\n\n\nJohn",

      "description": "Investing in Real Estate has been around forever and is a great way to get regular income (Rent) and at the same time have your investment in a property rise over time so when you sell you make a profit.\nThe problem is when you own an actual physical piece of property there is a lot of hassle and downsides that turn off many investors such as:\nHigh costs in terms of down payments, loans, and other expenses.\nDifficulty in buying and selling property in terms of the length of time it takes and the risks involved.\nThe cost of repair and maintenance you are responsible for. Either hiring someone to do it, expensive, or using your valuable time to personally perform repair and maintenance. Either way it eats into your profits and can add up fast.\nMany legal issues and costs associated with owning physical property.\nHassle of finding and responding to tenants, for example, when they have an emergency repair in the middle of the night.\nTHIS COURSE WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO GET ALL THE BENEFITS OF OWNING REAL ESTATE WITHOUT THE EXTRA COST AND ISSUES OF OWNING A PHYSICAL PROPERTY.\nThe financial industry recognizes the downsides of physical property and there are proven alternative ways to get the benefits of owning Real Estate such as income, growth, and diversification without all the hassle.\nIn this course you will learn how to invest in:\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (REIT), that trade like stocks on regular stock exchanges and provide a high level of income in the form of dividends. In fact, they are required by law to pay out 90% of their profits to their shareholders (You). With a REIT you have the opportunity to invest in a wide range of Real Estate such as Data Centers, Office Buildings, Residential Property, Hospitals, Hotels, Retail Marketplaces, and a lot more.\nMaster Limited Partnerships (MLP), which are very similar to REITS and focus on energy infrastructure such as pipelines.\nPeer-To-Peer Lending (P2P), where you can invest in a variety of loans where in effect you act as the banker and people pay you. You never actually meet the borrowers and instead leverage online marketplaces that rate the quality of the loans and give you a variety to choose from.\nReal Estate Notes, where you are buying the real estate loans from banks and others and you are paid interest directly. You have the opportunity to buy loans at a discount, increasing your potential profit, and are backed by the property itself as collateral. Can easily find options on online marketplaces which you will learn in the course.\nReal Estate Sharing Economy where you can earn side income from Airbnb and VRBO.\nReal Estate Crowdsourcing, where you invest in property along other investors through a marketplace but you are not involved in the day to day hassle of managing that property. You are an investor and the management company does all the day to day work and takes a portion of the profits to cover their costs. Allows you to invest much smaller amounts with a lot less risk than doing it all by yourself.\nReal Estate Focused Stock Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), where you can invest in different sectors of Real Estate such as Home Builders, Suppliers, Construction Companies, Hardware Retailers, and more. Get instant diversification across many sectors with mutual funds and ETF.\nOne great aspect of all these investments is you are able to buy and sell your investments very quickly. For example, REIT and MLP trade on stock exchanges so you can buy and sell these investments in minutes compared to months or even years trying to buy or sell a physical property.\nMany investors want to invest in Real Estate but hate the idea of searching for property, coming up with big down payments, taking on loans, exposing themselves to lawsuits, being responsible for repairs, and the headaches of dealing with tenants and these alternatives allow you to avoid all that and do what you really want which is to...invest in Real Estate and make a return on your investment without a lot of hassle.\nCan be truly passive income.\nPlus, with Udemy's 30 day money back guarantee if you do not love the course you can return it for a full refund. Real easy.\nMany thanks and I hope to see you in the course!\n-Steve B",

Private mortgage lending is one of the most profitable business models in the mortgage industry with the lowest risk when done right. Many people don’t know that as long as a borrower closes their loan in the name of an LLC, you don’t need to have a lender license to conduct business in most states in the U.S. Most private mortgage lenders charge 5% - 18% interest rates and have additional upfront fees which makes this is a very lucrative business model. Besides that, private mortgage lenders require borrowers to come in with a minimum down payment of 35% or more which greatly reduces risk and creates other potential profit opportunities.

      "description": "In the super-competitive real estate market, Realtors need every advantage they can get.\nDon't you hate it when a potential client that you spoke with months ago, buys or sells their home... and uses another agent?\nImagine, for a minute, that you had the undivided attention of your ideal prospect. And not only that, you were talking in their ear on a weekly basis. Maybe, they aren't ready to sell their home or buy a new one this week, but what about next week, next month, next year.\nIf you can remain top-of-mind with your clients and position yourself as the \"One and Only\" Realtor for them to turn to, regardless of when they decide to buy or sell, what would that do to your business?\nEveryone has a smartphone. Everyone in your farm could be listening to your online radio show or Podcast.\nWhat is a Podcast? It is audio or video shows, that when you subscribe to them, are automatically updated on your Computer, Smartphones, iPads, Tablets, and/or iPods. Think of them as free radio or TV shows which you deliver Spam-Free! directly to your audience every time you produce one.\nPodcasting is bigger than you think. When we survey people who listen to free, commercial-free audio Podcasts at least once a month: we discover an interesting fact: It beats AM/FM Radio, streaming audio, CD's, TV Music channels, & Sirius!\nIf you compare the number of people listening to Podcasts monthly, they are as popular as Twitter with 39 mIllion listeners, even if it doesn't get the same 'Respect'.\nBut instead of communicating in impersonal 140 character Tweets, with Podcasting, you get right into the head of your target market for as long as you talk.\nPodcasts are portable — and because of this, they are listened to everywhere... in the car, walking the dog, at the gym, at the beach, on a plane, anywhere.\nWhen you claim your seat in this course, you'll have permanent online access to watch the course 24/7, and there's a Q&A discussion section by each lecture, where you can post questions - and we'll answer them personally!\nBy following the short, simple, easy-to-follow lectures, you will be able to work through the process of setting up your show and publishing your first episode quickly.\nPodcasting is increasing in popularity, and thanks to CarPlay, Google jumping on Podcasts and Apps, Podcast will continue growing for years to come. It is just past the 'Early Adopter' stage and has huge potential moving forward. Don't miss out on the low-competition, high-demand opportunities that your fellow Real Estate Podcasters are enjoying.\n\nYour co-instructor, Scott Paton, has over 10,000 Podcast students on Udemy. Your other co-instructor, MO, or Michael Oden, is moderator of the 19,000 strong Facebook group, Lab Coat Agents.

      "description": "Want to learn how to build professional, dynamic, institutional-quality real estate pro forma models in Microsoft Excel? This course will take you by the hand and walk you step-by-step through the entire process. This is a project-based course, meaning you'll start with a blank Excel workbook and walk away with a fully-functional, dynamic, eight-tab pro forma model that YOU'VE created - from scratch.\nWhen I was first learning real estate financial modeling, I would download real estate investment models or real estate investment calculators on the internet, only to feel overwhelmed and frustrated by the complex functions and formulas everywhere in the Excel file. And once I felt like I was getting used to one of these things, I still was petrified to touch or change anything because I didn't want to \"break\" the model. And honestly, even if I understood it and I believed the model was working correctly, I still had no idea if I could even trust the calculations in the first place.\nIf you've ever felt any of these things, this course will pull back the curtain and uncover the \"Black Box\" that most real estate financial models appear to be. By the end of this course, you'll be able to build a dynamic, professional-quality real estate pro forma model from scratch, and your first one will be done by the time you finish the last lecture.\nThis course will teach you how to build a real estate pro forma investment model the way the largest and most sophisticated private equity real estate firms look at deals. At the end of this course, you will be able to:\nBuild an institutional-quality, dynamic real estate pro forma investment model from scratch\nLearn key Excel shortcuts to double your real estate financial modeling speed\nModify and customize existing real estate pro forma models to fit your specific investment scenario and needs\nConfidently model key investment metrics such as the XIRR, Equity Multiple, and Cash-on-Cash returns, and calculate these metrics automatically as you change manual input drivers\nBuild a dynamic renovation budget that captures exactly when and how you plan to renovate the property\nModel renovation premiums and timing for a property renovation\nBuild out dynamic loan schedules and refinancing scenarios to accurately model any financing structure\nBuild formula \"checks\" to error-proof your work and feel confident your calculations are accurate and can be trusted\nThis course is perfect for you if:\nYou're a college student or graduate student looking to break into real estate investment after graduation, and you're looking to add the key technical skill sets to your arsenal that will put you head and shoulders above the competition and allow you to land a lucrative career opportunity in the field\nYou're a professional in a different field, but looking to buy real estate on the side and want to be able to confidently analyze a deal\nYou're an existing real estate professional looking to advance your career, increase your compensation, and break into the real estate investment industry.\nYou've bought rental homes or duplexes, and now you're looking to move into bigger properties and want to feel confident in your ability to analyze deals.\nHere's what some of our students have had to say:\n★★★★★ \"Great Course! I really enjoyed the pace, the content and the explanations. I have worked on complex real estate models before but still learned a lot in this course. Will definitely take another course from Justin. Highly recommended.\"\n★★★★★ \"Justin does a great job of explaining how to underwrite a deal with this MBA-level course. Coming from Asset Management I thought I had a solid background into financial modeling, but later realized I was missing many of the advanced skills that are covered in this course. I recommend this course to anyone that wants to sharpen it's skills and move into the acquisition world. Justin is a great teacher and a very responsive one as well. (Usually responds the Q&A section within a day or two). As a bonus, I've sharpened my excel \"shortcut\" skills to another level! Thank you.\"\n★★★★★ \"Justin, Is a very effective instructor. This course is well organized and he lays out the material at just the right pace. His responsiveness to all student questions makes the class feel interactive and shows that he's engaged in this with you. This master class was excellent! He walks you step-by-step through everything, so even if you don't understand certain things you can at least build the muscle memory by doing the steps to build the model and then review the reason behind the steps later, if you need to. I definitely built some neural pathways through this one!\"\n★★★★★ \"The course is very on par with my education in MRED. It covers a great deal of the real estate pro-forma modeling, with great insights and 'checks'. It is a great foundation and practical experience brought to the masses.\"\n★★★★★ \"These classes are hands down the most valuable real estate modeling tools available online. The finished models themselves are useful, but the techniques you'll learn will give you the skillset to model any type of scenario you need. I work at a boutique investment and development firm and our principals and investment partners have been extremely impressed by the models I built based on Justin's coursework. I look forward to more classes in the future.\"\n★★★★★ \"Great course! Very helpful in both demonstrating the nuts and bolts of constructing an in-depth CRE financial model, and discussing some KPIs important to an institutional investor or lender. The instructor was concise, articulate and very responsive to questions posed in the Q&A section. While the instructor takes you step-by-step, this is still a very technical course. A solid knowledge of finance, plus some background in real estate and light programming will go a long way in helping you understand what's happening while he's explaining. If you're an aspiring developer or looking to do more modeling for work, I highly recommend this course.\"\nIf you have a basic understanding of real estate finance, and you're looking to apply that knowledge to analyze new real estate investment opportunities, enroll now and let's get started building this model together today. Looking forward to having you in the course!",

      "description": "Do you want to work in the mortgage industry but don't know what a closing disclosure is? Are you looking to advance in your career by having more specialized knowledge on one of the most important documents in the entire mortgage process?\nAnyone who works in the mortgage industry can tell you that you will see a closing disclosure on every loan you do. If you want to work as a loan processor, loan originator, underwriter, closer, or other similar position, you need to know how to read and understand this document. That's  why I created an entire course on this specific topic!\nThis practical course will go over 10 different examples of a closing disclosure and will break them down in detail so that you can be prepared to do it on your own. By knowing where to find vital information on a CD or closing disclosure such as the loan amount, interest rate, monthly payment, cash to close, and the closing costs, you'll be prepared to answer common questions from borrowers and from potential employers during job interviews.\nYou can quickly determine if someone is a beginner in the mortgage industry by asking them questions on information found on a CD or closing disclosure. For this reason, you need to take this document seriously and master it by taking this course. Besides that, you'll learn how to read the breakdown of closing costs on page 2 of a CD so that you can immediate figure out if a borrower has escrows or not, if they have to pay loan discount points, how much they are paying in loan origination fees, whether or not the borrower will have a prepayment penalty or not, if they will have a balloon payment, and so much more. I will go over 10 real life closing disclosures and then have you try for yourself. You can always go back and see the lecture to correct any mistakes you make. Finally, you'll have several practice tests so that you can see how you are progressing. These practice tests don't affect your course certificate and are just for your own private education. If you're thinking of starting a career in mortgages and want to get paid well, you need to start and finish this course.\nWhat you will learn & how you'll benefit:\n- You'll learn to master the closing disclosure\n- You'll become an expert on closing costs\n- You'll become familiar with important mortgage terms and definitions\n- You'll increase your chances of being hired and will impress potential employers\n- You'll Improve your career potential by being more knowledgeable so that you can apply for higher paying positions\nWhat this course includes:\n- 10 real life closing disclosure examples explained in detail by the instructor\n- 9 \"practice\" tests\n- 6 course \"assignments\" so that you can get hands-on practice\n- 3 downloadable PDF documents to help you in your career and to use during the course\n- Access to the course instructor in case you have any questions\nNot knowing how to read a closing disclosure is not an excuse. It's up to you to gain this knowledge by taking the time to go over the content included in this course. In less than 2 hours, you'll have the information you need to ace most interview questions on a closing disclosure when applying for a job. The closing disclosure is very complete and includes almost all the information the borrower needs to know about their loan which is why you need to be able to explain it to them in a comprehensive manner. Most experienced mortgage professionals don't know everything on this 5 page document but you can and you will when you finish this course.\nRemember, this course will teach you how to read, understand, and master a closing disclosure so that you can master both purchase and refinance transactions on FHA, Conventional, and VA loans.\nOnce you complete this course, you will have acquired valuable knowledge and a course diploma to show employers when applying for a mortgage position. A course diploma will be available to you when all sections of this course have been completed at 100% which you can save or print and include with your resume. For instructions on downloading your course diploma you can go to: https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229603868-Certificate-of-Completion\nYour instructor\nJoseph Correa is the founder and CEO of Finibi Mortgage, a licensed mortgage brokerage business based out of Orlando, Florida. Having closed hundreds of mortgage loans, he has the knowledge to help you become a success. In the past, he has also owned a correspondent lender business and invested in real estate as well.\nThis course is more advanced so if you haven't taken my \"Become a Mortgage Loan Processor\" course, I would suggest you start with that one first but you are welcome to start with this course and then move on to that one.",

Theory which I obtained from my two master degrees from Columbia University (NYC, USA), one Master in Advanced Architectural Design, the other Master in Real Estate Development, and while working at world renowned companies like Hines and Hewlett Packard.\n- All course examples come from real deals I have made over my 17 years of experience in the real estate industry, managing about USD $ 650 million.\n\n\n- Multiple downloadable attachments are provided in the forms of: Excel files, checklists, relevant web site links, global market and public companies reports, as well as case studies, for you to use for your own analysis.\n- No previous knowledge of either finance or real estate is needed to take the course.\n- Even experienced real estate professionals will find several chapters useful and refreshing. I have taught people with 25 years of experience in the real estate industry, including graduate level teachers, who still found most of the material completely new, useful and eye-opening.\n- Although the course main focus is real estate finance, there is complementary information including land parameters, construction costs, project and broker profitability as well as market analysis information. This material is included because a financial analysis is only as strong as the information you input into it, so it is extremely important to understand the basic parameters of all the information that goes into a Pro forma to end up with a professional financial analysis.\n- it does not matter where in the world you live in, all course information, material and methodologies can be applied to any country or region. Pro formas even have the flexibility of using two measuring systems (Square feet and Square meters) as well as two currencies of your choice, at the same time or individually.\n-This course is the result of thousands of hours of analysis, combining world class theory, 17 years of real estate experience, half of which I worked and learned from the corporate world, the other half I learned “On the street”, by being an entrepreneur and doing deals from scratch.\n\n\n- Course index:\n1 - Course introduction and instructions\n2 - Importance of knowing your numbers\n3 - Land\n4 - Market Analysis - Essential elements, Market Cycles\n5 - Market Analysis - Forecast\n6 - Development Costs\n7 - Property Valuations\n8 - Apartment Valuation (Available for FREE)\n9 - House Valuation\n10 - What is a Pro forma\n11 - Comparative Chart IRR, ROI and Capitalization Rate\n12 - Simplified Pro forma\n13 - Pro forma Checklist\n14 - Financial Definitions\n15 - Multi-family development - Pro forma - With Sensitivity\n16 - Airbnb Analysis\n17 - Land valuation - Multiple Scenarios\n18 - Highest and best use - Mixed Use - (Hotel, Office and Retail)\n19 - Case Study - Single-Family Development\n20 - Case Study - Retail Development\n21 - Case Study - Industrial Development\n22 - Project Profitability\n23 - Broker Profitability\n24 - Rent vs Buy Analysis\n- Due to the amount of student, I am not able to respond to each one of your questions regarding your personal real estate deals.

      "description": "Have you ever wanted to start learning underwriting skills that will open future job opportunities? This course goes over one of the most important steps in the underwriting process which is running, reading, and interpreting Desktop Underwriter and Loan Product Advisor findings.\nThis is the course you need to start closing loans!\nThis course teaches you how to pre-underwrite a loan before it's reviewed by the underwriter. If you are a loan processor, loan originator, or underwriter, you will use this important skill on every single loan you do. There's no way around this! DU and LP findings will need to be on every loan file that's completed by the lender to be compliant and to be able to sell the loan in the future. The truth is, underwriters can't approve a loan unless they get an approve/eligible or accept/eligible status from DU or LP (some banks or lenders do manual underwrites but they are very few of them and is not the normal way you will get loans approved).\nYou can't easily find content on this subject online because it's information that's taught to underwriters when they are being trained to underwrite loans!\nWhat will I learn in this course?\nYou'll learn what DU and LP are and how they affect the entire loan process.\nYou'll become much more knowledgeable when it comes to reading and analyzing DU and LP findings.\nYou'll learn to think like an underwriter by better interpreting the messages and the numbers that come back when you run the loan through Desktop Underwriter and Loan Product Advisor.\nYou'll be able to save more loans and close more loans.\nAlso, you'll become more confident when speaking to an underwriter about specific conditions.\nFinally, you'll be better prepared for future job opportunities that can come up.\nWhat's included in this course?\n4 real DU and LP examples explained in detail by the instructor.\nSpecialized knowledge you won't find commonly online\nLifetime access to the course\nAccess to the course instructor in case you have any questions\nCourse certificate upon 100% completion\n30 day money back guarantee\nLEARN DU & LP RIGHT NOW TO GET STARTED AND MOVE UP IN YOUR MORTGAGE CAREER!\nThis is a more specialized course that does require some basic mortgage knowledge so I recommend you take either of these courses on Udemy before starting this course so that you understand what is being explained:\n\"Become a Mortgage Loan Processor\"\n\"Start a Profitable Career as a Mortgage Loan Originator\"\n\"Conditional Loan Approval Mortgage Training\"\nWho will benefit the most from this course?\nLoan processors that want to prepare to do their best and get hired for higher paying positions.\nLoan Originators that want to close more loans by pre-underwriting loans before hand and provide DU or LP findings to realtors with the pre-qualification letter.\nAnyone who wants to start a career in underwriting.\nMortgage business owners that want to increase their turn over ratio and close more loans.\nRealtors who want to understand if a potential buyer has a high probability of closing on the loan.\nA course diploma will be available to you when all sections have been completed at 100% which you can save or print. For instructions on downloading your course diploma you can go to Udemy support.\nWho is your instructor?\nJoe Correa has closed hundreds of mortgage loans and owns his own mortgage company based in Orlando, Florida.

I cannot say enough about Justin and his teaching acumen. I learned so much in this class that I do not even know where to begin. The templates he provides are insane and are ready-made for anyone who wants to engage in MF investing. Thank you for this awesome class, Justin.\"\n★★★★★ \"Justin is a versed instructor of real estate who implements contextualization (ex: Excel spreadsheets) to drive his points home in the most concise and precise manner. His lessons are all relevant to today's real estate market and are interesting as well. He took a difficult and dry subject such as investment metrics and brought it to life making it something very easy to comprehend.

Justin does a great job of breaking things down into bite sized pieces, that make it easy to learn and follow. His teaching style, ability to breakdown complex ideas and the resources help you through everything step by step, rather than just showing you how to use the pre-built model.\"\n★★★★\"I have been an avid passive investor in multifamily syndications for a few years now. This course not only sharpened my perspective as a limited partner, but also provided me an understanding of a deal from both a sponsor and lender's point of view. Justin's comprehensive course material and ability to communicate 'technical' information to a potentially non-technical audience is proof of his expertise in the MF area. I look forward to any future courses that he may teach.\"\n\n\nEnroll today and get started on your multifamily investing journey. Looking forward to having you in the course!",

      "description": "Throughout history, real estate has made more people wealthy than any other asset class.  You have been doing your research and would love to invest in real estate yourself, but you aren't sure if it's even possible given your current financial situation.  Real estate typically has a very high barrier of entry imposed by the banks.  You first need to have a ridiculously high down payment (which is often more money than your average American will ever have), your credit score needs to be stellar, and then you have to jump through many hoops and provide countless documents to the bank in an effort to 'prove' that you are worthy enough to be given a loan.  This process is simply too much for most people, but thankfully there is a better way to purchase real estate!\n\n\nWhat if I told you that it was possible to buy real estate without ever needing to talk to a bank and never obtaining a loan?  What if I said your credit score didn't matter?  If I told you that after watching these lessons, you would be able to go out and look for motivated sellers and potentially start closing on deals the very next day?  If that sounds too good to be true, then keep reading.\n\n\nInstead of going to the bank and obtaining your own loan, why not simply purchase real estate by offering to continue to make payments on the sellers behalf to the loan that THEY already have with their bank?  By simply making payments on the existing loan on the sellers behalf, you are able to close on deals instantly, without the need for a credit check, inspection, appraisal, or any of the other items typically associated with purchasing real estate.  The only thing stopping you from closing on deals now, is finding motivated clients needing a quick and easy way to sell their home.\n\n\nMaybe your client is in pre foreclosure, maybe they inherited the property and don't want it, or maybe they just don't have enough equity to make selling the home the traditional way feasible after paying the closing costs.  In all of these situations, you are able to solve their problems, while also obtaining a property for yourself for little or no money out of pocket.\n\n\nOnce you own the property you can do whatever you want with it.  So whether you are trying to turn it into a rental, fix/flip, or resell it using owner financing, the options are limitless and so is the amount of income that this technique can generate.  The only thing stopping you from realizing financial independence now, is getting out and doing a little hustling to find your sellers.",

There are many people who call themselves property investors, but the vast majority of these are amateur investors and very often they do not know much more than the man in the street.\nIt has been said that ‘amateur investors make smart investors rich’ when their investments do not work out they are forced to sell and that’s when the professionals will buy those properties at a considerable discount! With the knowledge I impart in this course you will learn not to make this common and costly property investment mistakes.\nEveryone learns differently, by that, I mean some people are auditory, some visual, and some people need everything written down in front of them so that they can read over the text enough times so that the content stays with them, and if need be, they can refer back to the text as many times as they need to. This course provides not only audio and visual learning but also PDF files that can be downloaded and studied at your leisure, so no matter how you learn best, the course can work for you!\nYou will gain all of my expert property investment knowledge I have accrued over many years of working, and investing in property in a just a few hours, and unlike a course where you attend for one or two days, you will have the opportunity to watch, listen and read the course material over and over again until you are completely happy with your learning experience.",

Now, there are people that think they have a strong buyers list, but I've found that people often confuse SIZE with QUALITY. You see, you need both to really make things happen.\nYou can have a tiny list of capable buyers... and still struggle.\nYou can have a HUGE list of garbage buyers... and still struggle.\nThe magic happens when you have a MONSTER list of SERIOUS buyers.\n\n\nHere is how you will benefit from my course-\nLearn from an active investor who is closing 10+ deals a month.\nThe methods for growing your buyers list are tested and proven.\nThere's no prior experience required for you to benefit from the course.\nThe course is delivered in a series of short, to-the-point, instructional videos.\nEven when the course is completed, you can refer back as a handy resource.\nBoth experienced and new investors alike will benefit from the course.\nBuild your list using both automatic and manual methods of adding buyers.\nDiscover unique methods of finding the most serious buyers in your market.\nEverything you need for building and growing your buyers list is right here.\n\n\nThe course is largely build around the tried-and-true methods that I utilize in my own Real Estate wholesaling business. Every method can be implemented in any market.\nMaking easy money by flipping deals to your buyers list is easy - but the benefits of having a KILLER buyers list goes even deeper than that! The opportunities that will come your way by connecting with the serious players in your market are vast and unknown - but some of the best deals I've been a part of have come about through the connections I've made through building my buyer database.\n\n\nMy buyers list is easily the most valuable asset that I have in my Real Estate investing business. The quality and value of a strong Buyer List is priceless.\nFor anyone interested in quickly and effectively building out a SERIOUS buyers list - this is the course for you.",

Is This Course Suitable For Me?\nThis course does have a few lectures touching on REIT Investing basics and an Information Vault for beginners to read and understand REITs better.\nHowever the lectures do not stay 'basic' for long, as it has to meet up to the expectations of other students looking to enhance their REITs selection skills and\nAt the very least, you should have a rough understanding of what investing is and have the ability to operate excel at a rudimentary level.\nBut hi; if you are a complete beginner who is willing to work hard… No course will ever be too difficult for you.\nWhat is a REIT?\nWhat is reit; REITs stands for real estate investment trusts and are sometimes called \"real estate stocks\". To put it simply, REITs are entities (corporation/fund/trust) that own and manage a portfolio of commercial properties or mortgages. In this course, we will only be touching on publicly traded REITs and the investment opportunities they present.\nPublicly traded REITs include (Commercial REITs, Retail REITs, Industrial REITs, Hospitality REITs and Healthcare REITs)\nWhy should I invest in REITs?\nAs mentioned previously, one of the best way to invest money is via REITs, because of these 3 reasons\n1) Passive Income through yields:  REITs are some of the highest paying dividend stocks that you will ever come across. On average, REITs would give you about of 5-6% yields per year; while the best REITs can reward you even more.\n2) Diversification: According to varies studies; adding REITs to a diversified investment portfolio increases returns and reduces risk; this is because REITs have little correlation with the S&P 500\n3) Easy to manage: Relative to other investment instruments, the risks related to most REITs are kind of predictable. You only need to know where to look, anticipate and manage it.\nHow much money do I need to set aside, in order to start investing in REITs?\nIt depends on the unit/share price of the REIT that you are looking at. The key here is not to treat this investment as a 'once-off' endeavor, but rather treat it like on going savings project. Be discipline and consistent with ploughing back your savings into your REIT portfolio and one day, that portfolio of yours will free you.\n\n\nWhy can’t your course make me rich instantly?\n\"If it seems too good to be true, it probably is\"…\nAsk yourself this, why would anyone or any investment guru for that matter, want to share their true secret knowledge that make another person rich instantly? A secret is no longer a “secret” once you tell the whole world! Knowing this, the market will always balance itself. As more people know about a secret, the effectiveness of using that secret will dwindle.\nUnlike other 'investment gurus', I cannot promise you instant riches. But what I can promise is that , after you attended this course, you will leave with some serious REIT investment knowledge and techniques. You see when you invest in REITs, your money starts working hard for you. You need to be patient; save...invest...and reinvest the dividends so that compound interest can work its magic.\nWith the right amount of passion, education, and hard work (smart investing) anyone can achieve their financial independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould you show me a specific example on how REITs can eventually lead me to Financial Freedom?\nEvery $200,000 will grow to $800,000 in 12 years' time at 12% compounded yearly. This $800,000 will give you $40,000 yearly retirement income @ 5% withdrawal rate. That will be $3,333 a month of lifetime income. Implying that YOU will not outlive your money and you can still leave an estate for your loved ones.\nHow to achieve 12% compounded rate consistently?\nAnswer: Pick up exceptional REITs, accumulate and hold them in your portfolio!\n\n\nWho is the target audience?\n✔ Investors who are new to investing and looking for answers to 'where to invest money' and 'how to make money work harder' for them\n✔ Working Individuals looking for a relatively low-risk investment opportunities and a proven strategy to consistently grow their wealth via dividends\n✔ People who want to get a good understanding of REITs Investing\n✔ Dividend investors looking for another source of passive income\n✔ Anyone with an interest to join the REIT Industry\n\n\nReminder! This course is not made to teach you how to become rich or become financially free instantly\n\n\nWhat should i do next?\nIf you took the time to read through this course description, go ahead and also look at the free previews, to get a better feel of the teaching style and the values offered in this course.\nOnce you are ready. Go ahead and SMASH that green \"Take This Course\" button, and let's start your journey towards Financial Freedom today!",

Justin hit just the right balance between the big picture and the nuts and bolts of building the worksheet, and, therefore, truly understanding it.\"\n★★★★★\"Clear and straightforward. Wow! Amazed at this curriculum. He has made something super difficult easy and he explains it super clear. Its like meeting a super cool private equity guy spend the time to show you step by step. He can make your career!\"\n★★★★★\"This course is highly recommended for individuals wanting to learn about equity waterfall modeling. It's obvious that the instructor understands this topic very well and he presents it in a very simplified manner. The process of creating the model from scratch and having the instructor walk you through it on a step-by-step basis really solidified my understanding of this material. Excellent course!\"\n★★★★★\"Highly detailed and informative. Great for analyst who are just getting started. It's like taking an MBA level course!\"\n★★★★★\"This is a phenomenal course as are Justin's other courses. I am a commercial real estate professional working as an analyst at a 'Big Four' broker and have found all these courses to be invaluable, particularly if you are concerned about the technical test for job interviews.\"\nIf you're ready to get started building out your equity waterfall model with me, I'd love to have you in the class - go ahead and click that \"Buy Now\" button, and I'll see you on the inside of the course!",

      "description": "This is one of the few mortgage courses that actually teaches you how to obtain your mortgage business license from start to finish, how the entire business works, and how to run your own mortgage company. Once you become licensed as a Mortgage Brokerage Business, or Correspondent Lender/Lender, or Mortgage Servicer Lender you can get approved with different lenders to start originating mortgage loans and receive a much higher compensation than as an employee.\nIn this course you will learn:\nHow to start a mortgage business no matter what structure you choose to begin with can be very fulfilling financially and lifestyle wise. You can choose to make your business as large or as small as you want by having a small group of employees or a large group. You can choose to hire a branch manager to take care of the daily operations and you just oversee the business and its future growth. Just like starting any business, there are many things to learn but this course takes the guess-work out of the equation by telling exactly what you need to do and who to contact. In order to start any of these mortgage businesses you need to obtain your mortgage loan originator license and either work in the industry for 1 year or hire someone who has worked in the industry for 1 year but this can be done fairly quickly. This course will take you behind the scenes into a world that most people never want you to know about and will never teach you how to get started. The best thing is you will have very low start-up costs and very high profit potential. If you decide to work from home, your initial costs will just be paying for your licensing which you will learn about in this course.\nMain benefits of this course and of starting a mortgage business:\n- Get others to work for you. Stop chasing leads and borrowers. Your mortgage loan originators will bring in deals and you help them to close those deals and make a profit in the process.\n- More time. As the owner of the business you can choose to hire employees to take care of the daily operations of the business and have more free time to focus more on what matters the most and spend more time with the people you love.\n- More freedom. When you own a business, you get to choose your hours, who you want to work with, and how much you want to make.\n- Make more money. When you are an employee, you always receive a smaller compensation than as the employer. When you own a mortgage business you have the capacity to make much more of the profits than ever before.\nAs a mortgage business owner you can make $100,000+ if you're just starting out and $2,000,000+ if you're an established company depending on how you structure your business.\n- More control. You will have complete control over the transaction and the speed at which your loans close which is very different to make happen when you are not the owner of the business.\n- You get to help others have a job and a career. Everyone knows that finding a job is not that easy and a great paying job even more. That's why offering other people a chance to work for you and your business is a blessing that everyone will appreciate.\n- Having control over your own home loan. As the owner of a mortgage business and as a mortgage loan originator, you will have the unique opportunity to buy real estate at lower rates and with reduced closing costs.\n- You won't have to find a job anymore once you open your business you won't have to work for any one and will have the power to hire others and great an empire.\nHOW MUCH CAN YOU MAKE IN A TYPICAL TRANSACTION AS A MORTGAGE BUSINESS?\nAs a Mortgage Brokerage Business, you typically make up to 2.75% in compensation. This would be the breakdown of how much you can make:\nLoan amount $300,000 x 2.75% = $8,250. This is how much you would make and depending on your mortgage loan originators compensation pay structure you pay the MLO their portion of the compensation.\nWhat will you learn in this course?\n- How to get licensed as a mortgage business\n- How to get approved with lenders\n- How to choose what lenders to work with\n- How to choose a credit company to pull borrowers credit reports\n- Choosing what LOS (loan origination software) to use\n- Successfully hire mortgage loan originators\n- Successfully create a payment structure for mortgage loan originators\n- Understand how to process a loan and how to hire a processor\n- Understand how to prevent fraud and create a quality control plan\n- How to read and understand financial statements\n- How to prepare a profit and loss statement as well as a balance sheet\nA course diploma will be available to you when all sections have been completed at 100% which you can save or print.

      "description": "Welcome to Airbnb Hosting, Rental Arbitrage, Co-host, and Home Staging course. This is a comprehensive course where you will learn step by step on how to list your properties on Airbnb, however if you don’t have any property, don’t worry, in this course you will also learn about Airbnb rental arbitrage and Airbnb co-host.

Then, in the next session, you will learn about Airbnb policies for hosts. We will go over several policies about reservation commitment, communication between host and guest, and cleanliness. This section is very important because you want to make sure that your property is fully compliant to Airbnb policies. Afterward, you will learn step by step on how to register on Airbnb and list your property there. Once you have listed your property, you will also learn how to optimize your listing and get to know how to promote your property. In this section, you will learn several strategies like social media promotion and collaborating with travel influencers. Then, in the next section, you will learn about Airbnb rental arbitrage business model, you will specifically learn about how to find rental properties on real estate marketplaces like Zillow, Realtor, and Redfin. Once you have found the property, you will calculate the potential profit on Google spreadsheets. Then, you will also learn about laws and regulations for Airbnb arbitrage since not all cities allow short term rental arbitrage.

After that, you will learn how to be an Airbnb co-host, you will get to know co-host responsibilities, learn how to find Airbnb property owners to collaborate with, and learn how to draft an Airbnb co-hosting agreement contract.

This is another business model that you should consider if you don’t have any property. Lastly, at the end of the course you will learn about effective pricing strategies and you will also check ideal rental fees for your cities using tools like Rabbu and Awning.\nFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we start an Airbnb business? Well, there are many reasons why, first of all, if you own a property, it can be any type of property, house, apartment, or even villa and you have unused room, it has potential to earn you sustainable passive income if you rent it out on Airbnb. Well, you might be wondering why Airbnb and why not regular rent? The answer to that question is pretty simple, on Airbnb, your guest will pay per night not per month, so obviously, even with lower occupancy rate, your overall revenue is still higher compared to regular rent. For example, you own a two bedroom apartment and the average rent in your city is eight hundred dollars per month, however if you rent it on Airbnb, you will charge the guest eighty dollars per day. By doing so, you only need a guest to stay in your apartment for ten days in order to make eight hundred dollars. Therefore, even with a thirty three percent occupancy rate, you will be able to make the same as if you rent it out on a monthly basis.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of Airbnb hosting, get to know Airbnb market overview, and learn about essential amenities that every Airbnb host should have\nLearn about Airbnb policies regarding reservation commitment, communication between host and guest, listing accuracy, and cleanliness\nLearn how to list your property on Airbnb\nLearn how to add house rules and cancellation policies\nLearn how to add checkout instruction\nLearn how to generate Airbnb listing description using Listing AI and List Pro\nLearn how to create marketing video for Airbnb listing\nLearn how to promote Airbnb listing by implementing several strategies like social media promotion, collaborating with travel influencers, and search engine optimisation\nLearn about effective pricing strategies and conduct market research to find the ideal pricing point\nLearn how to find rental properties for Airbnb rental arbitrage business\nLearn how to calculate potential profit from Airbnb arbitrage business\nLearn about laws and regulations for Airbnb arbitrage business\nLearn how to be an Airbnb co-host and get to know their responsibilities\nLearn how to operate property management softwares, handle booking reservations, and track monthly revenue.\nLearn how to do virtual home staging using ReStage AI and Sofa Brain",

      "description": "BPO Pros is a course designed for real estate agents who wish to make money performing Broker Price Opinions for banks and lending institutions. Real estate agents are hired to perform BPO's usually in cases of Foreclosure, PreForeclosure, Short Sales, Refinances and Mortgage Sell Off. BPO assignment fees can range from $40-$300+ depending on area and property type. Banks use BPO's to save money as opposed to hiring a certified appraiser for value.  We will see more and more BPO's being issued especially in bad times throughout the country.  In a recessionary period foreclosures are inevitable and they are coming.  In the last crash some real estate agents were using BPO's to pay their bills while stacking cash to invest into what they sell during a downturn (real estate).  Providing BPO services is not only a great way to make quick cash but also it helps to really hone in on your skills of analyzing real estate values.  Picture every time you meet with a seller you are able to explain that you are a Broker Price Opinion expert which is one of the main reasons why properties do not sell due to over pricing.  You can walk in with confidence in each and every listing appointment here on out!  Many times, these BPO companies provide another service as well which is REO services.  Meaning they will put strong BPO agents in front of asset managers to get REO listings as well.  Don't forget to compliment your niche focus with our other courses especially in a recessionary period with short sales, BPO's, and property management.",

      "description": "In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of doing the research to invest in tax lien certificates anywhere in the country. PLUS, the skillsets learned here could easily be the base for learning how to research most real estate investing transactions prior to purchase.\nThis course includes actual bids I won in the Yavapai County tax lien certificate auction.\nI share the real estate property tax lien selection criteria I used to win those bids.\nThis course talks about the overall research process so that you can decide to participate in any tax lien certificate sales auction anywhere in the country.\nMost of the counties in the U.S. conduct their auctions online. Each county either holds those sales online through their site, or some other third party auction portal website.\nThe two most popular tax lien auction portals are:\n\nLienHub whose parent is GrantStreetGroup, and\nRealAuction (Real Tax Lien) who handles auctions for various counties within the country\nBoth sites also offer other services that compliment the real estate, tax lien and tax deed investing process.\nMy investing strategy was that of a very risk averse, first time, tax lien investor and so my investing strategy was drilled down to the very lowest common denominator which was to investing in tax liens that have a very high likelihood of redeeming and redeeming quickly.\nMy overall goal was to find an investment vehicle that would provide me returns greater than the bank without having to invest a lot of time, money and management.\nMany states returns are in the high teens like Arizona at 16%, Florida at 18% and Colorado at a whopping 36%, but when you are bidding you bid for something lower than that, but much higher than banks. And when you learn just the fundamentals of how to get started in the tax lien auction world of real estate investing, it opens up a lot of opportunity for education, growth and returns.\nPart of that growth is also the ability to invest in Over The Counter (OTC) or County Held Certificates as well as the very popular tax deed investing and this course brings that information to you too.\nDISCLAIMER\nThis investing course is for informational purposes and while it serves as a great starting point for learning and getting started investing in tax liens -- as a smart investor it is always best for you to consult your CPA and attorney when making investments.\nWith that said, this course is presented in such a way that it is easy for you to consume, take notes and expand your research, as all major points related to this topic are the focus of this course allowing you to understand a big topic in bite-sized chunks.",

You can find the descriptions and commentary, but you won’t find the detailed examples, action items, and investment advice that we provide to our students.\nIn theory, you could do this on your own by, buying a ton of books, listening to hours and hours of podcasts, scrounging for useful and applicable resources that may or may not be reliable, purchasing an overpriced guru training, OR ….you could just take advantage of the experience from our course’s instructors to learn their tips, tricks, and action items to help you make the best decisions for YOU and YOUR personal goals.\n\n\nWhat WON’T I get from this course?\nThis is an intro to multifamily real estate investing course, and it will expose you to a wide variety of information that most experienced syndicators will charge thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars to receive.\nWhile we will go more in-depth than most courses, this is only the intro course, and we will dive deeper into most of the subjects in other advanced courses.\nPlease check out the other courses after finishing the intro course for a more detailed understanding of each of the concepts you will learn in the intro to multifamily real estate investing course.\nYou also will not get a done for you guide, this is meant to teach you the basics, how to get started, and point you in the right direction. No one will do the work for you, so make sure you take action.\nThere is so much valuable content we provide, but you will only receive the incredible benefits of this information if you put it to work.

This was particularly true during and after COVID as people were forced to work remotely and sought out better places to live. As this trend continues, real estate prices will continue increasing in certain markets. This course will show you how you can analyze these markets to determine whether or not you can find profitable real estate investments. Then you’ll hear how to narrow down specific properties to purchase that will generate a positive cash flow, renovate them, rent them out, and manage them yourself—no matter where you are, and without hiring an expensive property manager.\n\n\nBy adding real estate to your portfolio, you’ll not only benefit from appreciation but also from the potential cash flow each month. All it takes is the discipline to do the research and the courage to get started.\n\n\nI offer this course to clients for free. I am a licensed real estate agent in Utah (license # 13918164-SA00) with a boutique brokerage, New Place Realty. You become a client when you contact me, we have a conversation about what investment you’re looking for, and I start the property hunt for you by creating a search on the MLS so you can start receiving listings as they hit the market. Of course, there will never be any obligation to purchase anything. My goal is to build a trusting relationship with you so that I can help you reach your financial goals, with real estate as one avenue for doing so.",

This particular contract has been successfully used to help me personally over 300 Real Estate transactions. It's been continually developed, simplified, and fine-tuned throughout a decade of continual use. It's been scrutinized & approved at an expense of over $10,000 by multiple contract lawyers. It's been through dozens of different closings offices and title companies in different States across America. It's been used to successfully close deals in as many as 17 different countries by various other students and Real Estate Investors.\nSuffice it to say that this Option contract is SPECIAL.\nSound interesting? It definitely should because you'll also be able to use this Option for yourself!\nThat's right - as part of this course you'll download a copy of my PROVEN Option contract, but the value doesn't stop there because you'll also be taken through the entire contract, line by line, with detailed explanations so that you come out of the course with a COMPLETE understanding of how the contract works.\nOne problem that many investors have is that they lack confidence in their own contracts. They worry about getting sued, losing their earnest money, or having their deals fall apart. After you complete this course you'll not only be able to write offers with complete confidence, but you'll also have a firm understanding of how the contract works so that you can effectively close more deals\n\n\nThis contract is very multi-use and lends itself to many different Real Estate investing strategies such as...\n- FIX & FLIP: Buy low, add value, then sell high with my proven Purchase & Sale contract!\n- WHOLESALING: Earn chunks of profit regularly, and never worry about losing your earnest money!\n- RENTALS: You can quickly grow your investment portfolio when you get more offers accepted!\nAs you can see, regardless of what your primary investment strategy is, you will benefit by putting my contract to work in your business. You'll be able to write more offers and have more of them get accepted. You'll protect yourself from financial loss by ensuring that you never lose your earnest money deposit. You'll gain a boost of confidence that comes from having a complete understanding of the legal language of your contract and how it works to help you grow your Real Estate business.\n\n\nIf you really boil it down, there are 3 reasons why my Option Contract is the best you can get...\n- REASON #1: Unbeatable Simplicity!\nThis contract contains ZERO unnecessary language, but still contains EVERYTHING you need to get deals done.\n- REASON #2: Unmatched Protection!\nThis contract creates a legal shield around the investor so they can operate with confidence.\n- REASON #3: Unequalled Effectiveness!\nThis contract produces 20% MORE accepted offers by not intimidating sellers with confusing language.\n- REASON #4: Unequivocally Proven!\nThis exact same Option has contributed to more than 300 successful Real Estate closings.\n\n\nDo I really need to say more?\nEnroll in the course, download the Option contract, and take your Real Estate business to the next level.\n\n\nI'll see you inside!\n\n\n-Ben",

By age 20, I purchased my first rental property and it was a gut rehab, where we pretty much fixed it up brand new to rent out to tenants.\nEvery year I look to acquire new flips and rentals to continue building the real estate portfolio.\nI do this in order to follow my plan of generating passive income. I enjoy living life freely and setting my schedule without worrying about trading time for wages.

      "description": "Welcome to ‘Get The Deals Now’.  This course is designed to teach you how to acquire heavily discounted houses as quickly as possible.  Hence, the name ‘Get The Deals Now’.  My name is Tyrus Gross and I’ve been buying and selling houses for over 27 years.  I started investing in real estate in Los Angeles, CA in 1989.  The first lecture briefly provides my background and discusses some of the struggles I encountered in the early years.  It also teaches you how to avoid the same mistakes that I went through.\nThe course quickly moves on to teach you how to quickly find and buy wholesale houses from wholesalers wanting to assign their contracts to you.  Therefore, helping you to avoid many of the headaches and stress related to trying to find the houses yourself.  In other words, this course is truly a shortcut to dramatically decrease your learning curve and catapult you to success as quickly as possible.\nAt the end of this course, students will be able to easily find houses with a lot of equity in seven days or less.  They will also be able to find private lenders to fund their deals and learn how to sell their houses quickly.  This course is for both the beginning real estate investor and for the experienced investor looking to take their business to the next level.\nThe course is divided into five sections – 1) Buying Houses From Wholesalers, 2) Funding Your Deals, 3) Auctions To Sell Your Property, 4) Bonus: Land Trust and 5) Forms.  The first section gives you several ways to find wholesalers very quickly and I also provided some current wholesaler websites you can access today.  Buying Houses From Wholesalers is the first section of this course because I wanted you to be able to find deeply discounted houses quickly and avoid wasting many months trying to find these deals yourself.  The second section teaches you how to find Private Lenders that can quickly fund your deals (these are not your conventional banks) that you buy from wholesalers – this includes the name and website of a company that is actively funding several deals each month right now.\nAuctions To Sell Your Property is one of the fastest ways to sell your house and speaks for itself.  The Land Trust section is truly a bonus from me to you and was created by an experienced real estate attorney to protect your real estate assets against lawsuits.  I spent well over $1,000 to have them produced and is absolutely essential if you are not going to sell your houses quickly.  If you’re going to hold on to them as rental properties, these documents are extremely important.  You will receive the fill-in-the-blank version as well as the full instructions on how to fill the blanks in yourself.  The last section is Forms.  You will find all the forms mentioned in previous sections here.  The appropriate form is also attached as a resource to its related lecture.",

      "description": "Assisted Living Facilities are an extremely profitable, in-demand investment that are almost impervious to market fluctuations!\n\n\nHigh Revenue\n\n\nYou can rent out spaces for more than three times more than you can to regular families! You could charge $3750 a month FOR EACH ROOM! That’s $11250 in income every month!\n\n\nHigh Demand\n\n\nThe Baby-Boomers are retiring!\nBecause of this, the demand for credible, long-term support is exploding! In fact, it’s so difficult to keep up with the demand that facilities are charging giant premiums for even shared spaces! There are currently 33 million people in the US of 65 years or older. This number is due to double in the next 25 years!\n\n\nLow risk\n\n\nJust like every property type, assisted living has its own business cycle. However, assisted living is needs-driven, i.e.someone goes into or puts their family member into assisted living because they have to. The buyer's choice is not discretionary, the issues of aging leave them with little of no alternative. This is opposed to other forms of real estate such as retail, office and industrial properties, whose demand is strongly affected by the economic and job markets.  Seniors are more likely to have a large amount of savings as well as investment portfolios that provide them with income during down turns, making this a very risk averse asset.\n\n\nAssisted Living facilities are extremely safe, profitable and is sought-after by millions!\n\n\nBut is also an incredible way to give back!\nMany people are in tough situations right now. They or a love one, are unable to carry out daily tasks and they need a loving, caring environment where they will be treated with respect.\nYou can give that to them! Your facility can be like a real home! (not an institution) with a friendly community in a place they can feel safe and well cared for.\nYou can also use the profits and facility to take the load off your own family by making sure you are set up when you get older.\n\n\nIt's a Win-Win situation that you can take advantage of.\nWhat are you waiting for?\nEnroll Now and gain an income stream while doing something rewarding!\n\n\nOur instructor for this course is Skye Larson\nShe started in Assisted Living in 2009 after the 2008 crash wiped out her parent's stock investments, leaving them with no way to pay for their senior needs.\nSkye was renting out rooms in her house then transitioned to assisted living after finding that it was a better fit for her situation. Her two facilitates allowed her to retire early and spend more time with her family and create this course.\n\n\nPowerPoint and video created by Robin Deibel.\nShe supports experts, like you,  get your ideas out in the world in a bigger way. Robin helps you leverage your knowledge by creating courses without you having to take it on all by yourself.",

This is not a get rich quick scheme.\nOnly you can take the knowledge you learn from this course and apply it to your investing strategies.\nBy taking the content from this course AND applying it, you will be able to underwrite deals. With this knowledge, you will be able to determine when a deal meets the returns you are looking to achieve. Then you should either invest with the sponsor who brought it to you or sponsor the deal yourself. Be sure to check our deal sponsor course showing you how to partner with other sponsors, build the right team, structure your own syndication, get a deal under contract, raise money for your deal, get financing for the property, close the deal, and find the best asset/property management.\n\n\nI can learn all of this elsewhere, why should I learn from you?\nMaterials in this course come from personal experiences and investment knowledge of experts who have already been there and done it.\nFrom owning 1,800+ units to passively investing in a TON of deals, our course instructors have exclusive wisdom to share about the dos and don’ts of syndicating deals themselves and what you should look out for as a syndicator.\nDon’t listen to gurus that want to tell you the theory, but yet have never done it themselves. Learn directly from current apartment owners, get the behind the scenes information, and connect with the best of the best to build your syndication knowledge today.\nIn theory, you could do this on your own by, buying a ton of books, listening to hours and hours of podcasts, scrounging for useful and applicable resources that may or may not be reliable, purchasing an overpriced guru training, OR ….you could just take advantage of the experience from our course’s instructors to learn their tips, tricks, and action items to help you make the best decisions for YOU and YOUR personal goals.\n\n\nWhat WON’T I get from this course?\nThis is not a business in a box, and we are not going to build it for you.\nYou must pay close attention, learn the details, and take action!\nAnyone can learn the business, study closely with a mentor, read the books, and understand the business.\nNone of that will do any good without taking action. Once you have completed this course, look for opportunities near you, and begin taking action.\nIf you have any questions about getting started, look for our more advanced courses or feel free to reach out to our instructors with specific/focused questions.",

      "description": "The #1 question borrowers ask when they call lenders, banks, or mortgage companies is \"What will be my interest rate\"? Mastering the process of quoting an interest rate will allow you to close more loans and increase your income as a loan originator, loan processor, or other. This course goes straight to practical examples. Borrowers will give you their loans if you know how to quote them lower interest rates!\nThis practical course will show you how to become a expert at: running a loan scenario for all types of borrowers, reading and understanding interest rates, be able to determine if a borrower will need to buy down the rate or if they will be able to get a credit to cover closing costs. You will also be able to lock and extend interest rates. Besides that, you'll learn how to master a mortgage calculator, which you can download on your smartphone to be able to calculate monthly payments, interest paid through the life of the loan, tax deductible interest, bi-weekly payments, PITI payments, amortization terms, loan-to-value, and much more. This will make you look like a pro when your on the phone or in front of a borrower. Realtors will love you because you can tell borrowers what their monthly payments will be in a matter of seconds. Mastering the process of calculating interest rates will increase your potential to make more money on each loan!\nMain benefits of this course and of understanding the process of quoting interest rates:\n- Increase your income by closing more loans\n- Close more loans by adjusting interest rates and mortgage payments.\nLoan processors and mortgage loan originators save and close 30-50% more loans when they know how to use interest rates to benefit the borrower.\n- Understand how interest rates are priced\n- Learn to quote exact interest rates to beat the competition\n- Learn the benefits of quoting 29 or 28 year mortgage rates\n- Learn to use your compensation to help more borrowers obtain financing.\n- Help more borrowers to reduce their closing costs or eliminate them completely\n- Both you and the borrow will benefit from a lower interest rate since the borrower will have a lower payment and the risk of default will go down as well because their total payments will be lower\nIn the first section of this course, you will learn how rates are priced and why some borrowers qualify for lower rates while others have higher interest rates. You will also discover why lenders have different interest rates and why they constantly change on a daily basis. In the second section of this course, you will learn how to obtain an interest rate based on a borrowers particular situation or loan criteria. Besides that, you will see live examples of how to lock an interest rate for either 15 days, 30 days, or longer.\nOnce you complete this course, you will be able to confidently quote a borrower an interest rate based on their situation and be able to tell them what their mortgage payment will be.

      "description": "Foreclosure is a legal process in which a lender attempts to recover the balance of a loan from a borrower who has stopped making payments to the lender by forcing the sale of the asset used as the collateral for the loan.\nIt creates a unique opportunity for real estate investors to acquire properties for a steep discount, while helping the owners get out of a tough situation.\nIn this fast paced course based on Jay's live presentations to a small group of dedicated real estate investors, you will discover:\nWhat foreclosures are\nHow to find pre-foreclosures before your competition\nHow the foreclosures process works\nWhy it is a Win/Win/Win/Win situation\nWhat to do with your foreclosure property after you close on it.\nand much more...\nPresident Joe Biden extended a federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosures in January, 2021. He also pushed for more aid to help struggling renters and homeowners pay their bills. That may provide some relief in the short term. But the new administration — like the one before it, and the one before that — faces a much longer-term affordability crisis.\n“We have a huge shortage of housing for pretty much every income level except the very highest,” said David Dworkin, CEO of the National Housing Conference, which advocates for affordable housing.\nThe global pandemic shattered the world order and the US economy suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter. The housing market too briefly hit pause in spring. Back in March of 2020, the real estate market looked to be headed into a steep decline due to widespread stay-home orders.\nThe pandemic has certainly affected every sector but residential real estate has been very resilient. The real estate sector has also been highly supportive of the economic recovery of the country so far. It has emerged as a pillar of support for the economy. 2020 was a record-breaking year for the US housing market. According to Zillow, in total, 5.64 million homes were sold in 2020, up 5.6% from 2019.\nThe typical U.S. home was worth $266,104 in December, up 8.4% (or $20,587) from a year ago. House prices in all the major markets continue to rise. According to economists and market watchers, home values are growing at their fastest pace in a generation, and are showing no signs of slowing down in 2021.\nBut behind all this are disturbing trends in Forbearance. the precursor to Foreclosure.\nSeriously delinquent mortgages are up 1.7 million in 2020 to 2.1 million. Rental payments are in arrears, which means landlords can't pay their mortgages, as 40% of renters say they cannot make their rent.\nThere is a huge opportunity in real estate coming.\nEnrol today!",

Note: This is how I got myself through college by looking at the answer key and backwards engineering the solution/method.\n2) The traditional method: Go through this e-Course sequentially.\n3) If you are an Accredited Investor, technically you don't need to know anything to invest.\nI have seen a lot of unsophisticated Accredited Investors invest this way however they do have the network of other sophisticated investors around them.\nWhen you complete this course, you are going to build a good high net worth peer group to get sustainable deal flow and to collaborate on due-diligence.\nRemember: Many people never get off the beaten path to learn this material, but they are also the ones that never get to real financial freedom.\nKeep on yearning and learning.",

      "description": ">WHO THIS COURSE IS FOR:  Realtors that want to create predictable, consistent commission and more free time by focusing on the most overlooked niche in real estate where the clients lifetime value is worth 2X-10X more than traditional home sales. Which means more money, more free time and less doing the tasks you hate.\n\n\n\n\n>HOW WE (AND YOU) DO IT: I show you how to leverage the Mom & Pop landlords niche, where they spoon feed you properties that need tenants placed (tenant placement as the foundation), this creates fast, easy commission that by itself can create 6-figures per year! We then stack on top of the tenant placement commission by converting both the landlords into sales/listing client as well as the tenants you placed into those properties into sales clients once they \"know, like and trust you\" from placing tenants!\n\n\n\n\n>WHY IT WORKS: This strategy has very little competition, works great in both up and down market cycles. So many Realtors overlook this niche since they think its small commissions, however the lifetime value of these clients are worth 2X-10X more then sales. Thats because they need quality tenants several times per years, every year which stacks up the commission fast. Unlike traditional home sales where the client on average only will use you once every 7-13 years if you are luck since only 23% of agents get repeat business on traditional home sales.\n\n\nTake A Sneak Peek At The Lessons & Content Inside!\n\n\n>MODULE 1: Business Set-Up For Success<\n8 video lessons\n6 action-based accountability check points\n1 module knowledge quiz\nModule 1 Lessons:\nModule Lesson Overview\nThe Branding Strategy Credibility, Easily Become Searchable\nSetting Up Your Rental Website\nChoosing a 3rd Party Background Check Company\nHow Much To Charge Landlord Clients & Local Competition Research\nMarketing/Branding Materials & Templates\nModule Recap\n\n\n>MODULE 2: Inside The Landlord Mind<\n4 video lessons\n1 module knowledge quiz\nModule 2 Lessons:\nModule Lesson Overview\nWhy Landlords Need Your Help\nLandlord Talking Points\nModule 3 Recap\n\n\n>MODULE 3: Marketing Leads Plan Layers<\n9 video lessons\n7 action-based accountability check points\nModule 3 Lessons:\nModule Lesson Overview\nMarketing Layer 1: \"Local Expert\" Part 1\nMarketing Layer 1: \"Local Expert\" Part 2\nMarketing Layer 1: \"Local Expert\" Part 3\nMarketing Layer 2: \"Low Hanging Fruit\"\nMarketing Layer 3: \"Explosion\" Overview\nMarketing Layer 3: \"Explosion\" Part 1\nMarketing Layer 3: Explosion\" Part 2\nMarketing Layer 3: Explosion\" Part 3\n\n\n>MODULE 4: Onboarding Landlords<\n1 video lesson\n1 module knowledge quiz\nModule 4 Lesson:\nOnboarding New Landlord Client Process\n\n\n>MODULE 5: Placing Tenants<\n6 video lessons\n5 knowledge check points\nModule 5 Lessons:\nModule Lesson Overview\nShowing Inquiries and Questions\nShowing Tips to Streamline Process\n3rd Party Background Check Process/Examples\nMove-in Best Practices\nMove-in Day Process\n\n\n>MODULE 6: Stacking For Sales<\n4 video lessons\n2 action-based accountability check points\nModule 6 Lessons:\nSales Stacking Overview\nLandlord Sales/Listing Stacking\nTenants Sales Stacking\nSales Stacking Recap",

In the BRRRR method of real estate investing you are able to buy properties and pull your equity out of those properties quickly. In doing so you are able to stay  more liquid. Your capital is always moving from 1 property to the next with a purpose of creating more cash flow.\nIn this method of real estate investing you need to make sure you:\nFind the right Properties\nConnect with Wholesalers to get the best prices (We'll discuss how)\nUnderstand funding on properties to avoid surprises\nUtilize your ability to quickly grow equity in properties to facilitate buying more properties\nIn real estate investing the name of the game is CASH FLOW. Very few methods create cash flow while giving you the potential to pull our your initial investment after the repair period like the BRRRR method does.\n\nThe focus of our examples in this course will be on single family homes because that is the most common use case for this method. However, this method has been successfully applied to multifamily properties. I have even personally worked with clients who have used this method to facilitate doing this method on commercial properties, specifically malls.\nThis method will not make you rich over night. In truth you should be aware of anyone advertising any kind of get rich quick scheme in real estate. This method takes a long time and a lot of hard work to see success in. But it has been used to great success by thousands of real estate investors.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Advanced Real Estate Equity Waterfall Modeling Class!\nIn this course, you'll learn how to create financial models for some of the most commonly used JV equity partnership structures in commercial real estate, and how each of these structures can ultimately affect returns to all investors in a deal.\nMy name is Justin Kivel, and throughout my career, I've worked on over $1.5 billion of closed commercial real estate transactions, working for and with some of the biggest real estate investment, brokerage, and lending firms in the world. After spending almost a decade in the trenches of the industry, I decided to teach the skills I learned on the job over the years, and since then, I've taught tens of thousands of students real estate financial modeling and analysis through the Break Into CRE platform.\nThis course was created to be a practical, hands-on guide to understanding how some of the most commonly used JV equity waterfall structures actually work in practice, and how to build out financial models to split cash flows between investors.\nIn this course, we'll walk step-by-step through four different equity waterfall model build-outs, including:\nThe Cash-on-Cash Waterfall Model: This model incorporates a preferred return and promoted interest using cash-on-cash-based hurdles during operations, as well as the opportunity for the GP to earn promoted interest when the property is sold.\nThe Dual-Preferred Return Waterfall Model: This model incorporates two preferred returns using IRR and equity multiple-based hurdles, with promoted interest only earned by the GP when both return hurdles are exceeded.\nThe GP Catch-Up Waterfall Model: This model incorporates a \"Catch-Up\" clause into the cash flows, with all distributions above an IRR-based preferred return hurdle split based on these terms, up to a maximum GP allocation of all distributions to investors.\nThe GP Catch-Up With Clawback Waterfall Model: This model incorporates the same \"Catch-Up\" structure as the original GP Catch-Up Waterfall Model, but also includes an LP clawback mechanism where promoted interest will be returned to the LP if preferred return hurdles aren't exceeded.\nWhether you're trying to land a job at a real estate private equity firm and want to make sure you're prepared to model the different waterfall structures you might come across on the job, or if you're raising capital to fund your own deals and just trying to find the best structure for you and your partners, this course will be a great resource to take a deep dive into this topic.\nHere's what some of our students have had to say about the course:\n★★★★★ \"Very clear explanations! I like the repetition through the different examples to embed learning. It's also helpful to say which shortcuts you are doing so that this becomes second nature.\"\n★★★★★ \"This is amazing training. It covers those hands-on things which are hard to get without being into the CRE business. Very detailed, error-less explanation of complex scenarios.\"\n★★★★★ \"Unbelievable course. I spent the weekend working through this and the prerequisite Equity Waterfall Modeling Master Class. This was the practical deep dive I needed to compliment my real world and academic exposure to Real Estate Private Equity.\"\n★★★★★ \"Fantastic course, and just like with Justin's other courses: crammed with great content and hands-on application. No fluff. Just into the materials and the mechanics. This course is rather advanced, but it covers a lot of different techniques, methods, and concepts.\"\nReady to get started? Just click \"Buy Now\" button on this page, and I'll see you on the inside!",

The instruction is clear and concise. The pace is perfect and the extra resources are enormously helpful. Well done!”\nDimitris Provatas - 5 Stars\n“Really enjoyed learning from Symon. Can't wait for more courses on real estate topics, especial financial modeling and evaluating investment proposals”\nEric Chaussé - 5 Stars\n“Very practical!!!! Love the lesson plans and the step-by-step instructions.”\nIf you've EVER wanted to…\n•           Invest in a rental income property\n\n•           Do a fix & flip for profit\n\n•           Have professional investment analysis tools that you could use immediately to evaluate your own investment opportunities\n\n\n…then this course is definitely for you.\n_______________________________________\nIf you’re still unsure, here are a few questions that I often get from prospective students:\nI don't live in the US, is the material still useful for me?\nYes!  The examples I use are primarily US properties because the vast majority of my students are from the US. However, ALL of the concepts taught and tools provided are just as useful for any market around the world.\n\n\nIn fact, I have students from over 190 countries who are using the tools and knowledge provided in this course to help them invest wherever they are located.\n\n\nThe only difference is that it's harder to gather the initial information in some markets and will require different tactics to get that data.\nHow is this different from your other courses?\nThis course only covers the foundational topics and only has two case studies with the fix & flip and the rental income property.\n\n\nIf you only intend to invest in fix & flips and rental income properties, this course has everything you need for investment analysis.\nIf you intend to invest with business partners, in apartments, in commercial, etc...then you should look into taking my other courses, which can be found at the bottom of this page.\nWhat if I don't have any real estate background?\nThis is the perfect course to get your feet wet.  I'll cover all the important foundational topics for you and then show you how to apply those same concepts to evaluating a fix & flip as well as a rental income property.\nI have some real estate background already, what could I learn from your course?\nIf you have some background, I'd recommend you check out my other more advanced courses.\nI can learn all of this elsewhere, why should I learn from you?\nNo, you can't. Go Google how to use the waterfall structure and try to find someone that not only covers the waterfall framework in great detail but also gives you numerous examples on how it’s used. I've looked and it's not there.\nThe same goes for all the other material in this course. You can find the descriptions and commentary, but you won't find the detailed examples and the investment models that I give to you here.\nIn theory you could do this on your own by searching all over the internet, buying tons of books, interviewing lots of experts, getting an MBA,  performing all your own research, getting a job in real estate private equity, and doing $400M+ in real estate deals and get the same level of knowledge I have.\nOR….you could just take advantage of my experience. I've done everything I listed above and I put the best of what I learned into this course. Trust me, it’s worth it.\nCan you make me rich by taking your course?\nNo way! Not just from taking the course, anyway. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil.\nIf you take my course AND apply what you’ve learned to make smarter investments in the future, then you have a chance at making some real profits.\nWhat I can guarantee is that you will leave with some serious real estate investing knowledge, techniques, and tools.\nWhat else does this course cover besides real estate investing?\nThis course is ALL about and ONLY about professional real estate investment analysis concepts and techniques. Nothing else. But as you can see, just this topic alone requires I cover quite a bit already.\nActually, I do cover one more thing: I will also give you daily affirmations that help you build a \"winning\" mindset and I'll have lots of sales videos that push you to sign up for my top-secret real estate system for only 12 monthly low payments of just $999. Just kidding.\nJames Cochrane - 5 Stars\n“Great class. You will learn a lot from this instructor and the subject material is good.”\nJerry Mastren - 5 Stars\n“Easy to understand, step by step instructions.”\n\n\nGlenn Levine - 5 Stars\n“The instructor is very informative and is a real estate expert. I will definitely purchase more of his video tutorials in the future. GL”\nWhat will I be able to do after I take your course?\nAfter taking my course, you will be:\n•           Able to confidently use professional real estate investment techniques.\n\n\n•           Able to evaluate both fix & flips as well as rental income properties.\n\n\nWhat WON'T I get from this course?\n•           You will not get a Real Estate License from taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency of your state and country. But what is taught in this course has nothing to with getting a license, which focuses on how to legally transact real estate deals between buyers and sellers. This course is about investment analysis.\n\n\n•           I will not be evaluating your personal investment deals for you for this course. This is about you learning how to do it on your own using the lessons and the tools here. If you really want me to consult, you can reach out to me. My hourly rate is $350/hr.\n\n\nWhat’s holding you back?\nAre you afraid this course won’t work?  I promise you it will.\nAre you afraid this course will work and you’ll actually have to start investing? I think that’s a pretty good problem to have.\nAre you afraid it will take time and effort? It will. Real estate isn’t an easy business, if it was everyone would do it. But if you put in the work I promise you’ll see results.\nBest of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for.\nSo go ahead, sign up, and let's get to work.\n\n\nI hope to see you inside,\nSymon",

Your old-school promotion isn’t producing results, which doesn’t surprise you since you just read in the Harvard Business Review that traditional marketing is dead.\n\nAnd that’s not really news either, because you keep hearing about how people are trusting traditional advertising less and less and trusting peer/social recommendations more and more.\n\nYou’ve tried growing your business with \"the aggregators,\" but a lot of those leads are low quality, all of them are \"cold\" by nature, and the prices for those services just keep going up.\n\nSize of Sphere = Size of Income?\nSo, you find yourself in this place where you’ve maxed out your sphere of influence using traditional methods.\n\nAnd anyone who’s been in real estate longer than 5 minutes knows that the size of your sphere determines the size of your income. More connections = more money, right?\n\nNew Life for Your Business\nAnd you think, “Those old, cold and expensive methods just aren’t working for me. I need to find a new way to expand my network and inject new life into my business.” And so, for all those reasons, you decide to give Twitter a try. And here’s what you discover:\n\nThat Twitter users are the most active and dynamic in all of Social Media\nThat you can use keywords and laser-focused geo-targeting to connect with people right in your community\nThat there’s not a lot of competition, because most people do the wrong things, get no results and blame Twitter for the lackluster ROI - when in reality the problem wasn't Twitter at all, but simply those people doing the wrong things\nThat Twitter is exploding, and there are now nearly HALF A BILLION people using the platform\nGrow Your Network\nSo, you start connecting with more and more people, growing your network every single day. You quickly realize that Twitter users love to engage and make new connections.\n\nAnd you discover a few things that you did not expect. That the learning curve is not that steep. And that Twitter is actually fun. Yes, FUN!\n\nYou nurture along hundreds of relationships, building and building a little bit more each and every week. And you wake up one day and realize that you’ve expanded your network dramatically while doing 99% of it at home in front of your computer. Or from your smart phone or you iPad.\n\nAnd you realize that what you heard was actually true: that Twitter really is the greatest relationship creation machine of all time.\n\nAnd you think, \"I only wish I had started using Twitter sooner.\"\n\nTake this course and let me show you how to grow your sphere of influence using Twitter....\n\nPS: This course isn't going to be ideally suited to all personalities or communication styles. If you purchase this course and feel even a smidgen of disappointment, Udemy will give you your money back, so long as it's within the first 30 days, no questions asked.\n\nPPS: Here is some \"Social Proofing\" I've received from a myriad of key players in the real estate industry.\n\nPPPS: Here is what happened when an industry VIP followed my advice and dramatically improved his Twitter experience quickly.",

      "description": "An easy way to pass the Real Estate License exam confidently.\n*** Real Estate has made many more millionaires than any other type of business in last century ***\nDo you want to start your journey towards a great career or make lots of passive income while working from home? Real estate salesperson license can help you get there. In order to become a licensed realtor, broker or salesperson; what you need most is Practice, Practice, Practice and thats where this course comes in to help you succeed.\nUnfortunately, there's no single exam in USA which is very frustrating for aspiring realtors. Each state has its own test patterns. If you are preparing to be a licensed real estate agent in more than one state, then you must take individual tests from all those states. This makes it a bit difficult & time-consuming process to get licensed in multiple states for realtors.\n\n\nHOW THIS COURSE CAN HELP YOU PASS THE EXAM\nThe real estate license exam mainly comprises of 2 major sections;\n1. National section\n2. State section\nThis course will help you prepare for the National section of the exam as state section is specific to individual states which you want to be licensed in.\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL GET IN THIS COURSE\nThis course is split into multiple practice tests with over 50 questions each in the similar format as the actual test would be. Each practice test is designed to help you prepare for all major topics in real test.\nIrrespective of which state you want to be licensed in, there will be lots of emphasis on math related questions. As it's one of the key skill of a real estate sales person, we recommend you to attemp all questions in these test papers to be prepared for all sorts of variations in which a question can be asked in real test.\n\n\nFORMAT OF THE REAL TEST\nNational section comprises of about 80 questions covering various topics ranging from common laws, federal laws related to contracts, hazardous materials, banking, math calculations, etc. This section also cover FHA (Federal Housing Administration) related questions.\nState section comprises of anywhere between 40 to 60 questions covering key topics such as environment, deeds, title, real estate commissions, etc.\n\n\nWHAT YOU SHOULD WATCH OUT FOR IN THIS TEST\nThe real estate exam is designed to test a candidate's reading, comprehension & interpretational abilities as much as overall knowledge about legal facts. So, be prepared to re-read questions and answers until you have a good grasp of the problem before selecting an answer. We recommend not to look at the options of answers before you are confident what the correct answer could be. This is simply to avoid any subconscious bias towards some answers.\n\n\nWHERE TO FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT STATE TEST\nUS States have their own test developers and slightly different formats. The national section of the exam consists of up to 80 questions while state section consists of anywhere between 40-60 questions. For your state, you need to find out who the test developer is and then go to their online website to learn about the format of their test, fees, test venues and available dates. Most of the test developers offer online test nowadays so you can take the final test remotely.",

Note: This is how I got myself through college by looking at the answer key and backwards engineering the solution/method.\n2) The traditional method: Go through this e-Course sequentially.\n3) If you are an Accredited Investor, technically you don't need to know anything to invest.\nI have seen a lot of unsophisticated Accredited Investors invest this way however they do have the network of other sophisticated investors around them.\nWhen you complete this course, you are going to build a good high net worth peer group to get sustainable deal flow and to collaborate on due-diligence.\nRemember: Many people never get off the beaten path to learn this material, but they are also the ones that never get to real financial freedom.\nKeep on yearning and learning.",

      "description": "Are you tired of paying for a timeshare you no longer want or use? Have you been told you’re stuck forever, or that you need to pay thousands to a cancellation company or attorney? You’re not alone—but you’re not powerless.\nI’m Wayne C. Robinson, a former timeshare sales agent with over 15 years of experience in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. I’ve also published numerous books on timeshare cancellation—available at major online bookstores—helping thousands of owners just like you break free from unwanted contracts.\nAfter years on the inside, I discovered the truth: if your U.S. timeshare is paid in full and you don’t owe any back fees, you can cancel your ownership—quickly, legally, and without anyone’s permission.\n\n\nHere’s What Most Owners Don’t Know\nYou don’t need to beg the resort for approval. You don’t need to pay a third party. You don’t need to wait for someone to “accept” your cancellation.\n\n\nYou simply notify the resort that you are canceling.\nIf your timeshare is deeded, you can use a quitclaim deed to transfer your interest back to the resort. If it’s not deeded, a simple cancellation notice is all you need. Either way, you are not asking—you are telling them that your ownership is over.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn in This Course\nHow to determine if you qualify for cancellation (paid in full, no back fees)\nThe difference between deeded and non-deeded timeshares\nHow to prepare and file a quitclaim deed (with templates included)\nHow to write and send a cancellation notice (with templates included)\nHow to properly notify the resort—so your cancellation is final\nHow to protect your credit and avoid future fees\nWhat to do if the resort tries to intimidate you or says you can’t cancel\n\n\nWhy This Works\nIf you’ve fulfilled your financial obligations, the resort cannot sue you or report you to credit bureaus. You own the right to use—not the property itself—and you have the right to walk away. The only thing you must do is formally notify the resort. Most owners never hear this truth, and the industry profits from your confusion.\n\n\nWhat’s Included\nStep-by-step video lessons for every stage of the process\nAll required templates (quitclaim deed, cancellation notice, sample letters)\nPersonalized support via email for your questions\n100% Money Back Guarantee—no risk, just results\n\n\nAbout Me\nI am a former licensed timeshare sales agent with deep experience in the U.S. timeshare industry. He is also the author of several best-selling books on timeshare cancellation, available at major online bookstores. After seeing too many owners misled and trapped, Wayne dedicated his post-retirement career to empowering owners with the real facts and practical tools to break free—without lawyers, scams, or stress.\n\n\nYou don’t have to stay stuck. If your timeshare is paid off, you can cancel—no permission needed, no more fees, no more stress.\n\n\nEnroll now and take back control of your finances and your freedom—today!",

      "description": "For many people owning a home is a very big dream of everybody, but it does not come easily because the cost involved is too huge and only few  people can save to pay the money and buy their home, because of that they go in for a mortgage to aid them buy the home and pay it over a long period of time and that loan is called mortgage. Mortgage is a very special type of loan you can use to buy a home or refinance a home. We all must understand that mortgage loan companies expect that the customers will have to pay a minimum down payment before they will be allowed to assess the loan to buy their required home base on the money given. There are some investors who can pay upfront for the home but they will still prefer mortgage so that they can pay it for a long time and have their own money being used for other investment. We must know this in principle that you cannot get mortgage loan when you do not have a stable income, meaning you need a good job before a mortgage can be given to you. You will be assess based on debt to income ratio. In the United State OF America, a government backed mortgage most of the times have a very low interest rate and the qualification mark is also very low than others.\nThe process you will go through before getting the mortgage is not ease, you have to get a good credit score and be out of debt, if you are paying many debts it will be very difficult for any serious company to give you mortgage, in that case you need to ensure that you do not borrow too much and spend money when need be. Lets understand in detail that not until you have completed paying off the mortgage loan the home does not belong to you, so be careful and plan your personal finances very well to ensure that you consistently pay or you mortgage money.",

      "description": "First off, welcome to the Stacking Houses and congratulations for taking the first step on your journey to financial independence. The purpose of this introduction is to help set the stage for what you can expect as we go throughout the course. Now the goal of the program is to give not only give you the framework and tools required to be a successful real estate investor but also the confidence needed to be able to close your first deal. So, will you be able to get your first deal by the end of the 8 weeks, probably not but you should be able to make your first offer. It just depends on how fast you move through each module and how much action you take after each lesson. I also want to address one concern for those with very busy schedules. The course is designed to be able to move through each section quickly so it should only take you a few hours each week. Don't worry I know many of you are working full time jobs in addition to other responsibilities like family. I know when I first got started I had a hectic travel schedule but was able to find spare time on airplanes and layovers and you'll find spare time as well.\nAnother concern are those that have a limited budget. Look we are all at different stages of life. When I was younger I didn't have a lot of money but I had more time and was able to partner with folks that had more money to do a deal. Now that I'm 45 and have three kids of my own, I have less time but more money to invest to help secure my retirement.\nI also want to warn you about something and it’s what all entrepreneurs come across when they venture out on a new path and these are the naysayers. It may be your family or friends telling you why this cannot be done or you’re better off just giving your money to a financial advisor investing in some mediocre mutual fund. Please keep this in mind that 90% of millionaires have made money through real estate. Historically it’s one of the most proven models if you have the tools and the resources to do it correctly. And I want to throw this out to you as well. If you feel like you need some extra assistance throughout the course, I do offer one-on-one coaching to help work through the challenges you may have.\nSo let me give you a quick tour of the course. You will notice that we have the course curriculum for each week starting with week one. Some of you may have past experience but I encourage you to go through lesson in chronological order from Week One to Week Eight as there are a ton of Pro Tips and nuggets of gold that you're sure to miss if you fast forward. Each week there will be a step-by-step check list designed to walk you through each step in the process. We have also included documents and guides that will correspond to each lesson. These documents can easily be downloaded for your own personal use. The idea here is to help you build a content library of everything you will need to buy your first deal.\nFinally, I encourage you to join the Stacking Houses Facebook group where you can connect  me as well as like minded investors. There are a lot of really successful people in this group and there’s probably some near you that you can connect with and maybe even partner up with to do a deal. So with that let's jump in!",
