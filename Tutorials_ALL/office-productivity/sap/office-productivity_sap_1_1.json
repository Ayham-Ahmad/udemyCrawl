      "description": "Electronic Bank Statement (EBS) in SAP\nThe Electronic Bank Statement (EBS) is a feature in SAP that automates the process of reconciling bank transactions with the organization’s financial records. It imports bank-provided statement files and posts them in SAP based on predefined rules.\n\n\nWhat are Search Strings in EBS?\nSearch Strings are tools in SAP that help identify and interpret specific patterns or text within the bank statement to automate posting rules. They enhance the automation of transaction matching by identifying unique references, such as invoice numbers, payment details, or bank fees, and mapping them to the correct general ledger (GL) accounts.\n\n\nSteps in the EBS Process\n1. Bank Statement Format\nThe bank provides electronic statements in predefined formats like:\nMT940: SWIFT standard format.\nBAI2: Bank Administration Institute format.\nCSV/XML: Custom formats.\n2. Configuration in SAP\nA. Bank Master Data Setup\nDefine the house bank in SAP using transaction code FI12.\nAssign bank accounts and link them to GL accounts.\nB. Create Posting Rules\nDefine posting rules to map transaction types to specific GL accounts.\nUse transaction code OT83 to configure the posting rules.\nC. Assign External Transactions to Posting Rules\nMap external bank transactions (e.g., 001 for credits, 002 for debits) to posting rules in SAP using OT57.\nD. Interpretation Algorithms\nConfigure algorithms for interpreting unstructured text in bank statements (e.g., customer invoice numbers).\n3. Importing the Bank Statement\nUse transaction code FF_5 to upload the bank statement file.\nThe system processes the file and applies the configured rules.\n4. Automatic Posting and Clearing\nTransactions in the bank statement are posted to corresponding GL accounts.\nAutomatic clearing matches payments with open invoices based on rules like document numbers or amounts.\n5. Manual Reconciliation (If Needed)\nUnprocessed or unmatched transactions are sent to a suspense account.\nUse FEBA or FEBAN to manually clear these items.\nKey Components of the EBS Process\nPosting Rules:\nDefine how specific transactions (e.g., credits, debits) are posted to GL accounts.\nSearch Strings:\nAutomate the identification of patterns or keywords in bank statements for posting.\nHouse Banks:\nMaintain details of the organization's bank accounts in SAP.\nClearing Rules:\nEnsure that payments are matched and cleared against open invoices.\nBenefits of EBS in SAP\nEfficiency: Reduces manual reconciliation efforts.\nAccuracy: Ensures consistent and accurate postings.\nReal-Time Updates: Provides up-to-date financial data.\nAudit Trails: Improves compliance and traceability.\nExample Workflow\nBank Statement:\nA bank sends an MT940 file containing daily transactions.\nImport:\nThe file is uploaded using FF_5.\nPosting:\nSAP processes the transactions and posts them to relevant GL accounts (e.g., customer payments, bank fees).\nClearing:\nOpen invoices are cleared automatically or flagged for manual review.\n\n\n\n\nBank Accounting (EBS) Course Contents\n· Introduction with Electronic Bank Reconciliation Statement (EBRS)\n· Process of Electronic Bank Statement With Manual Bank Statement And Electronic Bank Statement\n.

It has features such as multi-model data processing, application development, data virtualization, Benefits of SAP HANA and real-time analytics processing in addition to storing data is its accessibility in a fraction of a second. SAP HANA is a relational database management system that was marketed and developed by SAP SE and features in-memory data storage and column-oriented management. As a database server, the fundamental function of this system is to store and retrieve data as required by applications. SAP HANA, on the other hand, can execute advanced analytics including predictive analytics, text analysis, geographical data analysis, streaming analysis, graph data analysis, and even serve as an application server with ETL capabilities. The in-memory and column-oriented database that combines the OLAP (online analytical programming system) and OLTP (online transaction processing system) into a single system, making SAP HANA an OLTAP system, is the key feature that distinguishes HANA from prior generations of SAP systems. Data stored in main memory rather than on disc allows for faster data access, which aids in faster querying and processing, making it a more performance-beneficial but more expensive method of data storage.\n\n\nSAP HANA integrates data from multiple areas within an organization:\n1) Traditional business documents – including contracts and spreadsheets\n2) UX/UI (User Experience/User Interface) – including website forms, emails and other customer interactions\n3) Mobile – information from the mobile devices of customers and your workforce\n4) IoT (Internet of Things) – data from the many sensors that run in every aspect of a business, from warehouses and trucks to stores and offices\nThe SAP HANA system not only integrates all of this data; it can also apply machine learning and AI to analyze it instantly and deeply, accelerating real-time decision-making by providing key insights into a company’s operations.\n\n\nKey expertise and experience of SAP HANA Consultant/Administrator and Solution Architect include:\nStrong experience in HANA, involved in working with custom/freestyle HANA applications, extending the standard HANA apps and excellent debugging skill\nExperience in the development and support of the SAP application\nPerform SAP security, system\nExtensive SAP HANA and SAP BW configuration / implementation experience gained on a broad range of engagements\nKnowledge of client implementations using a mixture of SAP ECC / SAP HANA / BW / CRM and Business Objects toolset\nKnowledge of SAP BI solution consisting of SAP BW, SAP BusinessObjects and SAP HANA native based reporting\nExperience with SAP BW with good exposure to other SAP Modules including SD, MM and FICO\nExperience of creating data models consisting of SAP HANA Views, BW Objects and external data as determined by the business needs\nPossesses good technical abilities to deal with both back-end and front end issues\nFamiliar with SAPUI5 and knowledge of Fiori apps",

It ensures that as a store manager you are on top of everything and things are in their rightful place.\nThe SAP Warehouse Management system is able to control anything that comes into or leaves a warehouse and also ensures how fast or slow that happens. In other words, SAP WM streamlines and controls all warehousing processes to create an efficient operation. It allows users to manage all structures present in a warehousing operation, regardless of their complexity, while monitoring stock differences and controlling hazardous materials. It also makes use of barcode scanners to speed up inventory processes.\nStock transfers and goods receipts can be managed while monitoring inbound and outbound goods throughout the day. All logistics that are vital to a successful warehousing operation can be taken care of, and many time-consuming processes can be automated to conserve resources.\nWith SAP WM module the warehouses can be managed efficiently at 'Bin location' level. WM provides flexible, efficient, automated support that enables you to manage complex warehouse structures, define and manage storage areas and storage bins in the warehouse, manage several different types of storage, such as high rack storage, block storage or fixed bin storage, process all relevant postings and transactions such as goods receipts, goods issues and general stock transfers, monitor stock movements, execute stock placements and removals using different put-away and picking strategies, process stock differences and many functions/processes related to warehouse management.\nUplatz provides this fast track course on SAP WM to enable you to understand the core concepts of SAP WM module and their implementation as well as to prepare quickly for SAP WM job interviews and WM Certification exam.\nThe course begins with explaining the basic organisation structure and processes in SAP WM.

As your inventory processes speed up, employees will have additional time to focus on more important tasks.\nAccurate Goods Tracking: This software solution monitors all goods as they move in, out or within the warehouse. Up-to-date stock amounts help prevent errors that could lead to insufficient product and shortens pick and pack time with an accurate location of products that need to be shipped out.\nWarehouse Automation: SAP warehouse management automates a number of time-intensive processes that could fall victim to human error. As accuracy increases throughout the warehouse, costs are cut and extra time can be made available for higher-level decision making and guidance.\nBetter Organization: Defined storage bins for products keep a warehouse from becoming disorganized and prone to errors. Moving pallets containing a variety of stock becomes much easier when everything has a preset location.\nCustomize to Fit Your Operation: SAP Warehouse Management allows users to customize its functions in order to better suit their individual requirements. Complex operations can make use of the entire array of functions while smaller warehouses can pick and choose what they need to operate successfully.\nReduce Warehousing Costs: SAP helps you get the most out of your warehousing space, time and the employees. Set up your inventory to make the most out of employee pathing and only hang on to the inventory you need.\nIncrease Visibility: Always know where stock is located, how labor is assigned and how automation tools are performing. Discover problem areas and fix them before they turn into costly problems down the road.",

The system contains due date forecasts and other standard reports that you can use to help you monitor open items.\nThe SAP FI Accounts Payable application allows for configuration of balance confirmations, account statements, and other notifications to suit your correspondence requirements. There are balance lists, journals, balance audit trails and other evaluations available for documenting transactions in Accounts Payable. Vendor master is the key master data in AP.\nSAP FI accounts payable can be integrated with SAP FI-GL (General Ledger), FI-AA (Asset Accounting), SAP MM (Material Management), etc. The deliveries and invoices are managed according to the vendors.\n\n\nUplatz provides this end-to-end training on SAP Accounts Payable.

I have explained step by step configuration and testing\n- SAP MM Pricing Procedure configuration includes Condition type, pricing schema and schema determination etc.\n- Condition Table and Condition Records.\n- Testing Pricing Procedure with Purchase Order\n- Business examples for Process\n- Q&A sessions on Pricing procedure\n\n\nThe pricing procedure in SAP MM (Materials Management) is a method to determine prices in purchasing documents by combining various types of charges such as gross price, freight, discounts, and surcharges. This procedure helps in calculating the net amount by considering all these conditions.\nTo understand and configure the pricing procedure, you need to be familiar with the following components:\nCondition Table: This table stores fields with combinations for individual condition records. For example, if you use Plant as a condition table, the condition record will be created for the plant only.\nAccess Sequence: This defines the order in which the system searches for condition records for a condition type from the condition table. An access sequence can contain multiple condition tables.\nCondition Type: This represents different types of charges such as gross price, discount, freight, and rebate. Each charge type is assigned a condition type.\nCondition Record: This contains the record maintained against the condition table with respect to the condition type. It is fetched via the access sequence and condition type.\nSchema Group: This is assigned to vendors and purchase organizations to help determine the pricing procedure. One schema group is assigned to the vendor and another to the purchase organization.\nCalculation Schema: This defines the sequence for pricing calculations, including gross price, discounts, rebates, and surcharges. It groups all required condition types for the pricing procedure.\nSchema Determination: This involves maintaining the pricing procedure for purchasing documents by combining the vendor schema group and the purchase organization schema group.\nSteps to Configure Pricing Procedure\nMaintain Condition Table: Use T-code M/03 to create a condition table by specifying the fields required for the condition record1.\nMaintain Access Sequence: Use T-code M/07 to define the access sequence and assign condition tables to it.\nMaintain Condition Type: Use T-code M/06 to define condition types and assign access sequences to them.\nMaintain Calculation Schema: Use T-code M/08 to define the calculation schema and include all relevant condition types1.\nMaintain Schema Group for Vendor: Use T-code OMFN to create schema groups for vendors.\nMaintain Schema Groups for Purchasing Organizations: Use T-code OMFM to create schema groups for purchasing organizations1.\nAssign Schema Group to Purchasing Organization: Use T-code OMFP to assign schema groups to purchasing organizations1.\nMaintain Schema Determination: Use T-code OMFO to determine the calculation schema for standard purchase orders1.\nAssign Schema Group to Vendor: During vendor creation (T-code XK01) or modification (T-code XK02), assign the schema group to the vendor1.\nMaintain Condition Record: Use T-code MEK2 to maintain condition records against the key combination.",

I'll then share the tools and techniques used on the SAP Business Intelligence platform and talk about gathering of difference source of data and generate incredible insightful reports by using Crystal reports, web intelligence, analysis edition and dashboards. Finally, I’ll share about the new generation of data visualization tool - SAP Analytics Cloud.\nAs the 2nd part of the course, we will focus on - SAP Enterprise Performance Management.\nAs of 2023, the global Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) software market has experienced significant growth, with valuations ranging between approximately USD 5.8 billion and USD 7.6 billion, depending on the source. Projections indicate that the market could reach between USD 12.0 billion and USD 16.3 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 7% to 9.9%. In this competitive landscape, SAP holds a leading position, with reports indicating it commands a substantial share of the EPM market.

This SAP SD course will also help you crack the SAP SD certification exam. You will get familiar to the practical problems and their solutions within SAP SD module in the form of frequently asked questions and answers.\n\n\nSAP Sales and Distribution (popularly called SAP SD) is a popular module of the primary ERP software developed by SAP. SAP SD provides optimal management of sales and customer distribution data as well as processes in organizations. It allows organizations to store and manage customer- and product-related data. Companies use SAP SD application data to manage sales orders, shipping, billing, and invoicing of their goods and services. SAP SD module stores the consumer and product data of the customer of a company. SAP uses these details to make better choices and maintain a good relationship with the customer and the company/organization.\nSAP SD works closely with other SAP modules towards effectiveness while integrated into others, such as financial accounting (FI), controlling (CO), materials management (MM), and production planning (PP). SAP SD when combined with other modules like MM (material management), PP (production planning) can bring much better results very quickly. All these collaborate together and enhance the work process in business operations.\nSAP SD configuration requires adequate knowledge on handling SAP-developed software products as the SAP SD module has multiple components that integrate different processes within the job area. As a simple process flow, SAP SD generates a sales quote and the customer then places a sales order, the goods are picked from a warehouse or production facility and shipped to the customer, an invoice is sent with the order, and accounts receivable settles the payment with the customer. Each step in the process generates transactions in the SD module, which then generates further transactions in the other ECC modules.\n\n\nKey components of SAP SD module are:\n\n\nCustomer and Vendor Master Data\nContract Handling and Management\nTransportation of products\nShipping of Material\nCredit Management\nInformation System\nSales Activities\nBilling-related\nForeign Trade\nSales Support",

You’ll also learn how to define your company’s organizational structure, manage master and transaction data, and configure basic business processes in the cloud environment.\nIn later sections, the course covers service management scenarios in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. You will study the Service Contract Management process, seeing how organizations create, track and bill service contracts using S/4HANA’s tools. You’ll also learn about Service Order Management, following the creation and processing of field service orders.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Accounts Payable in SAP course by Uplatz.\n\n\nAccounts Payable is an important component of SAP FICO module that records and manages accounting data of vendors.\nAccounts payable accounting is also known as as sub-ledger accounting, as the business transactions are carried out individually in the vendor accounts. All the processed transactions in accounts payable are recorded directly in the general ledger account. The real time updates are done in the application through settings made in general ledger master while creation of account. The required settings are configured by choosing vendors for reconciliation account for each account type. Any posting done in accounts payable generates a respective posting to an assigned general ledger account ensuring that the sub ledgers are always reconciled with the general ledger.\nIn SAP FI, sundry creditors are called accounts payable and sundry debtors are called accounts receivable. The deliveries and invoices are managed according to the vendors. SAP FICO accounts payable can be integrated with FI-GL (General Ledger), FI-AA (Asset Accounting), SAP MM (Materials Management), and the like.\nThis course provides a comprehensive knowledge on end-to-end processes involved in Accounts Payable sub-module of SAP FICO. This training will help you to master the concepts of Accounts Payable in great detail thus getting you a unique edge in your SAP career.

      "description": "*** The Course has subtitles in English, Korean, Japanese, (Simplified) Chinese, Italian, German and Spanish.\n\nVariant Configuration is a framework that helps you manage  complex manufacturing involving various specifications of the same product Examples include Cars, Laptops, furniture and Fast-food Items. A specific range of car may consist of standard equipment which has manual locking, synthetic seat covers and a basic music system. On top this , the manufacturer offers add-ons such as  central locking which can be remote or manual, multiple varieties of seat covers  and multiple versions of Music system etc.  These enhancements involve additional work, more time to delivery and more pricing. It is quite difficult to maintain multiple product versions, Production BOMs, Routings, Pricing etc. It will also be difficult for sales executive to predict the lead time to make a reliable order promise in terms of price, date and quantities. Even if you want to main multiple combination as individual product versions software will have some limitations. For example, an ERP may have limitation of 99 Alternative BOMs for a Product. Any change to design will lead to changing each alternative BOM and Routing.\nVariant configuration provides a framework through which you can define a set of features of options for the product to offer for choosing by customer. The framework allows you to define a Super-BOM and Super-Routing which will have all standard components and operations as well as optional components and operations out of which a few will go to the actual BOM and Routing of Product, according to the selection of features and options within each feature by customer. The framework allows to define the logic that determines the right set of components and operations to go in to the BOM and Routing of this selection. The framework also provides an interface (Called Configurator) to choose features and options for all addon features provided the product.\nSAP Provides excellent functionality of Variant Configurator to ease out the functioning of Design, Production, Sales, Planning, Costing and Pricing teams.\nThe Course from eBodhisathva Solutions provides insight on how Variant configuration works.\nCourse is structured at high level as :\nContext of Course\nBusiness Scenario for Demo\nSetup\nCreation of Configurable and Raw Materials\nCreation of Characteristics and assign to Classes\nCreation of BOM, Routing\nDefine Selection conditions and assign to Components of BOM and Operations of Routing (selection conditions)\nCreate Configuration Profile and Run Simulation including error handling(5 demos)\nRun a Few business transactions on Configurable Material (Sales order and Purchase Order)\nAdditional scenarios\nDependencies of type Pre-condition, Procedure etc. to manipulate Characteristics and values (10+ demo lessons)\nUsing various built-in functions, expressions and operators in various demos given above (part of various demos)\nHide characteristic based reference characteristics (1 demo lesson)\nPrice determination from conditions (7 demo lessons)\nPricing for Configurable Materials\nVariant Matching to handle make to stock variants\nBest Practices in Variant Configuration\nUsing Variant tables for assigning values to characteristics (Only basic demo)\nConclusion\nPractice Kit of 25 questions\n2 assignments that need hands on experience to submit solutions\nWe wish you all the best.",

During my time in the industry, the number one problem for both companies and new consultants is that while they might be technically proficient, they do not know how to execute a standard business scenario in SAP.\nThat is why I have created this course. Unlike other courses that show you all the technical details with a short demo at the end, this course aims to teach you SAP SD using the most common SD scenarios in the industry.\nIn this course, I will show you:\nHow to execute a particular scenario, from the standard order to cash, with scenarios such as consignment or 3rd shipment.\nThe master data setup and configuration so as to make this scenario work in any SAP system.\nThe business context around this scenario so you can engage with the users meaningfully.\nAll of this enables you to improve your learning experience by learning by doing. All scenarios are based on SAP best practice configuration so that you can quickly learn to execute these scenarios in any SAP test system.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to\nExecute and understand the business scenarios in an SAP test system.\nHave a discussion with the users on the finer points of the scenario to implement it in any SAP system – in other words, deployment.\nIf your goal is to learn SAP Sales & Distribution, then this course is ideal for you! Please check out the sample training material before signing up for the course.\nChange Log\n2025 : Small market update for 2025;\n2023 update : International trade, GTS and Letter of Credit added",

The theme that will be used is called SAP Quartz Light Theme\n\n\nThe idea is not for this course to go through the basics of SAP SD and how to configure order types or set up a pricing procedure. There are already great courses for these topics\n\nInstead, let's focus on using all the new things in Fiori Apps, using your Launchpad and finding new ways of working in S/4HANA\n\n\nBest Regards, Simon\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nSAP is a registered trademark of SAP SE in Germany and many other countries.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP BW/4HANA course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP BW/4HANA module is a packaged data warehouse based on the in-memory architecture SAP HANA. As the on premise data warehouse layer of SAP's Business Technology Platform, it allows you to consolidate data across the enterprise to get a consistent, agreed-upon view of your data. With BW/4HANA, you get the flexibility of using cloud deployment. SAP BW/4HANA comes in three variants and based on the Business need you can choose the deployment option.\nWith the on premise deployment feature you can use your own infrastructure, customize and extend the solution with complete control of your environment. With the Cloud approach feature on SAP BW/4HANA you can deployed via managed cloud offerings such as SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud (HEC), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Microsoft Azure. Users can spin up SAP BW/4HANA in these managed cloud environments quickly and with minimal up-front costs.\nSAP BW/4HANA is SAP’s next-generation data warehouse solution. It is a new product from SAP (not a legal successor of any existing SAP Business Warehouse solution), built entirely on one of the most advanced in-memory platforms. SAP BW4/HANA provides a simple set of objects that are well suited for modelling an agile and flexible layered architecture of a modern data warehouse.

SAP BW/4HANA streamlines processes and support innovations with a single, trusted source for real-time insights. For companies seeking solutions in reporting, planning, dashboarding, Big Data, data integration, data engineering, and predictive & prescriptive analytics, SAP BW/4HANA is an ideal system.\nSAP BW/4HANA is not just a new version of SAP BW but is only available on the SAP HANA platform, not being part of SAP NetWeaver. It has been completely rewritten and optimized for SAP HANA. Thus all future innovations are associated with the new product and not with the older series of SAP BW 7.x on SAP HANA. Instead there is new SAP HANA-optimized content that leverages the Operational Data Provisioning Framework-based extractors, advanced DataStore objects (DSOs), and Composite Providers.\n\n\nUplatz offers this end-to-end training on SAP BW/4HANA, one of the most popular technical modules from SAP.

      "description": "You are interested in learning SAP Lumira and getting into the wide realm of programming and intense Tech Entrepreneurship. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning SAP Lumira (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to catch up is \"to work on it\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP Lumira and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP Lumira. Even though SAP Lumira can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word \"SAP\" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress though your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).\nIn this course, I will walk you though SAP Lumira Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the configure SAP Lumira, but also what the crux of SAP Functional is: POWER of SAP Lumira.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP Lumira finance and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the one of the most popular SAP Modules: SAP Lumira.",

A design of product is in place but product is made only after receiving the order. This is because product is quite experience to make and stock before sales. example: Locomotives. Steam Turbines, Portable offices etc.\n2. High level design of base product is in place but product may accommodate minor variations according to Customer choice. In such case the customer is presented with a few features and options for each feature to select. Accordingly the customer specific product is made and delivered.\nWith a product having large number of minor variations, you will find it difficult to plan and monitor each finished product with minor changes. Instead you can plan at sub-assembly and component levels. Finished products are determined only after customer chooses the features.\nSAP has variant configuration as one cross- functional module which eases out the design, planning, costing, pricing and sales / purchase of such Products.\nThis course will go through the concepts as well as demos on how SAP enables Make to Order Manufacturing and sales.\nIn addition, you will get off-line reading material for your reference.

SAP Implementation Project\nThis is divided into two types.\nBig Bang Project: This type of project aims to go live with all modules across all departments at the same time. The SAP implementation life cycle is followed end-to-end for the full scope of the company’s financial and logistical business processes. This approach may be used for smaller companies to keep costs low, as there is only one implementation life cycle to execute. However, the necessity for planning is amplified and the risk of missing deadlines is high.\nPros:\nQuick to implement: You can implement the new system in a short time in your entire organisation using this approach.\nUniformity: Big Bang implementation allows the usage of a single system in the entire company.\nCheaper: As the entire company is using a single system, it involves lesser funds.\nCons:\nDifficult testing: Full testing is quite difficult under this approach before going live.\nWider scope of issues: Due to the implementation of a new system in the entire organisation, the scope of potential system issues increases.\nPhased Project: A phased project is an alternative to Big Bang approach, where a set of modules are identified in an initial phase, then further integrations will be added later. For example, a company may decide to implement financial and analytical modules in the first phase like Finance (FI), Controlling (CO) and Human Capital Management (HCM). Then plan a second wave to incorporate logistics modules such as Materials Management (MM), Production Planning (PP) and Sales and Distribution (SD). In a third phase they may opt to implement remaining modules. In reality, the phased approach will include several end-to-end implementations- One for each phase. This leads to a longer implementation timeline and therefore higher cost, but much lower risk and steady performance in the long run.\nPros:\nBetter adjustment: Due to piece by piece SAP implementation of the entire system, everyone gets enough time to properly adjust and adapt to the new system.\nComprehensive testing : Incremental testing is possible under this approach.\nEasy to fix smaller Problems: Phased SAP implementation allows you to find out the smaller bugs and issues in a single area which allows the technical team to fix them quickly.\nCons:\nCostly: The longer timelines result in higher implementation and consulting costs.\nDelay in ROI: Return on Investment is delayed due to the large time gap between this starting and the final date of implementation.\n\n\n2. SAP Support Project\nSAP support project is also known as an issue tracking system because it handles tickets. Under this project, the errors and bugs from end users are forwarded to the support team to solve them.\nThe pros and cons of this project are similar to that of SAP implementation projects.\n\n\n3. Roll Out Project\nA roll out project is one in which centralised processes are defined and implemented at a central office, then deployed at different subsidiaries. For example, a company may begin their SAP roll out at their headquarters. This initial implementation may follow big bang or phased approach. Every country has its own set of tax, customs and legal regulations. Every legal entity registered as a company should adhere to the legal requirements of its respective country. Processes are defined centrally and country-specific changes are carried out during roll out.\nPros:\nSpeedy: It increases the speed of the new implementation project and helps you meet deadlines.\nControlled Budget: SAP roll out projects don’t need everything new, so helping you to implement the new system with in controlled budget.\nCons:\nExistence of Old Systems: The only disadvantage is you still need same software from your current system.\n\n\n4. SAP Upgradation Project\nIt is a periodic project that companies implement to upgrade their system to the latest version. Under this project, the goal of the company is to technically upgrade and to cover the evolution of the SAP technical enhancement package.\nPros:\nBenefits from Innovations: An upgradation project allows your company to enjoy the benefits of innovations.\nCons:\nCritical testing: The SAP upgradation project requires deep testing to identify critical issues which can lead to the failure of the entire system.\n\n\n5. SAP Expansion Project\nAll companies opt for the SAP expansion project during its growth years. However, there are certain cases under which an organisation is obliged to opt for this SAP project is\nAt the time of acquiring a new company from the same industry.\nDuring an opening of a new branch at a new geographical location.\nWhen a company wants to expand its existing facilities.\nThe pros and cons of this project are similar to the Implementation Project.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Integration of SAP FICO with HR, MM, SD & other SAP modules course by Uplatz.\n\n\nUplatz provides this course on SAP FICO integration with HR, MM, SD modules. This course will help you understand the inter-related processes across FI and HR, MM, SD and how they talk to each other. This training on SAP FI integration with HR, MM, SD, and other SAP modules will help you become a successful SAP Consultant in FI, HCM, MM, SD, and logistics areas.\n\n\nSAP FICO and SAP HCM Integration\n\n\nSAP HCM is basically Integrated with FICO through the Cost Center , GL account , Vendor Account etc. For integration, link the symbolic accounts (from HR) to GL accounts. Symbolic accounts are the point of integration between FI and HR. Every wage type have to assign the Symbolic account. The symbolic account will decide to which type of account (Expense Account, Balance sheet Account, Customer, Vendor) the postings will made in Finance. For every wage type you will have to assign the Symbolic account. The symbolic account will decide to which type of account (Expense Account, Balance sheet Account, Customer, Vendor) the postings will be made in Finance. In the Wage types Posting, you will define whether account will be debited or credited. For each Symbolic account you will have to assign the GL account to which the postings in FI has to be made. Symbolic Account act as a carrier between FI & HR.\nSAP FICO module integrates well with SAP HR, SAP MM, SAP SD, and other SAP modules.\n\n\nActivities in the HR System\n1. Define Employee Grouping Account Determination IMG -> Payroll -> Reporting for Posting Payroll Results to Accounting -> Activities in the HR System -> Employee Grouping and Symbolic Accounts -> Define Employee Grouping Account Determination\n2. Define Symbolic Accounts IMG -> Payroll -> Reporting for Posting Payroll Results to Accounting -> Activities in the HR System -> Employee Grouping and Symbolic Accounts -> Define Symbolic Accounts\n3.Define Posting Characteristics of Wage Types IMG -> Payroll -> Reporting for Posting Payroll Results to Accounting -> Activities in the HR System -> Maintaining Wage Types -> Define Posting Characteristics of Wage Types\n4.Maintain Posting Date for Payroll Periods IMG -> Payroll -> Reporting for Posting Payroll Results to Accounting -> Activities in the HR System -> Maintain Posting Date for Payroll Periods\n\n\nActivities in the AC System\n5.Assign balance sheet account & assign Expense Accounts IMG -> Payroll -> Reporting for Posting Payroll Results to Accounting -> Activities in the AC System -> Assigning Accounts -> Assign Balance Sheet Accounts\nIMG -> Payroll India -> Reporting for Posting Payroll Results to Accounting -> Activities in the AC System -> Assigning Accounts -> Assign Expense Accounts\n6.

Assign Vendor Accounts IMG -> Payroll -> Reporting for Posting Payroll Results to Accounting -> Activities in the AC System -> Assigning Accounts -> Assign Vendor Accounts\n8. Check Customizing for Account Determination IMG -> Payroll -> Reporting for Posting Payroll Results to Accounting -> Check Customizing for Account Determination\n\n\nSAP FICO and SAP MM Integration\nSAP MM FI integration is one of the advanced topics in SAP configuration. It is important to configure automatic postings in Financial Accounting and even more important to thoroughly test this configuration to make sure that postings are made to the correct G/L accounts.\nMM module is responsible for managing materials and inventory in SAP. However, value of the inventory must be reflected on financial accounts of a company. Stock of materials that a company has is its asset and it is a legal requirement to mention it on various financial reports. SAP ERP is able to automatically calculate value the company’s stock and keep financial accounts up-to-date thanks to the integration between MM and FI modules.\nHow does SAP know which accounts to use for different materials? This is controlled by a number of parameters. Let’s see what happens when a goods movement is done in MM. SAP will automatically determine the following parameters:\nChart of Accounts\nValuation Grouping Code\nTransaction/Event Key\nAccount Grouping\nValuation Class\nValuation area\nStock of a material owned by a company is an asset to the company. Valuation area defines the organization level at which materials are valuated.\nSAP has provided two options for valuation.\n1. Valuation at plant level: All materials are valuated at plant level.\n2. Valuation at company code level: All materials in all plants of a company are valuated at company code level.\nThis setting is defined in t-code OX14.\n\n\nMM-FI Integration process\nWhen we do material posting for a valuated material, below flow happens.\n1. Movement type and other attributes like special stock indicator, movement indicator etc. are determined based on business transaction like goods receipt for PO, production order etc.(OMWN). This is defined by standard SAP.\n2. Transaction key/event and account modifier is identified based on movement type and other standard attributes in step 1 (OMWN)\n3. Valuation grouping code activation is checked from OMWM\n4. If active, for the given valuation area, valuation grouping code is identified from OMWD\n5. For the identified transaction or event, check if valuation grouping code is active or not in OBYC (Click the rules button for the transaction key)\n6. Valuation class is determined from material master.\n7. Based on the above identified attributes, select the G/L account from OBYC.\nIf system can’t find any account for the found attributes, stock posting can’t be done and system through clear error stating for which combination of attributes, G/L account is missing. Such errors are mostly seen during go live/while posting to new materials due to missing G/L account maintenance or due to incorrect valuation class in material master data.\nNow you know the process, here is the short cut to find out G/L.\nAccount determination details are stored in table T030. If you want to know based on what details XXX account is determined, simply give that G/L in T030 table in field KONTS. This gives the possible combination of entries where this G/L is assigned.\n\n\nSAP FICO and SAP SD Integration\nAutomatic generation of accounting document due to sales activity is referred as SD FI integration.\nAn order process uses a purchase order (which is sent to your vendor). Also invoice verification is used further along the process to check that the invoice you send to your customer is the same material and quantity as that which the vendor sends to you (but obviously shipped\ndirectly to your customer).\nBilling is an SD function. But SAP needs to know, when processing a customer's payment, to which GL account the payment has to be processed. For instance payment of a UK based material would be placed in a different GL account to that of a non-UK based material. Furthermore, a UK based customer may have a different GL account to that of an Export customer. This is configured in Account Determination.\nThe Sales and Distribution module is part of the SAP logistics Modules and it addresses all the process of order-to-cash cycle. The S&D process starts from sales enquiry from customers to delivery, billing and incoming payment.\n\n\nBelow are the steps involved in SD process and how they related to FI:\nThe SD process starts with the pre-sales activities. Meaning the first contact with the customer, involving the processes of receiving customer Inquiries and sending quotations to Customers.\nIf the Customer decides to send a Purchase Order, then the next step in the sales process is to raise a Sales Order.\nThe next step after the sale order is the delivery of goods to the Customer. This is the integration trigger point between the relevant SAP modules of SD, MM and FI.\nThe billing process follows the delivery of goods to customers. The billing process impacts the SAP modules of SD and FI.\nThe final step in the order-to-cash cycle is the receipt of the incoming payment from the customer and the clearing of the customer open item.\nWhen goods are dispatched, finance document as shown below is posted automatically. Question is how system determines the GL account and amount to post the accounting document?\nSince goods are moved hence material document is created. Corresponding finance document gets created as a result of MM-FI integration. GL account for inventory account is picked from OBYC setting (transaction key BSX). GL account for COGS is picked from OBYC setting (transaction key GBB and account modifier VAX).\nInventory & COGS is always valued at standard cost of the material.\nAmount calculated = Quantity * standard cost of material per unit.\nWhen billing document is released to accounting, accounting document gets posted automatically. Question is how system determines GL account and amount to post accounting document?\nPrice determination procedure or pricing procedure\nPrice determination procedure is basically combination of multiple condition type. Condition type represents different prices that are put together (addition or subtraction) to arrive at net sales price.\nNet price = Base price –Discount + surcharge + tax\nEach of these prices “Base price, Discount, Surcharge, Tax etc. is created as condition type in sap.\nOnce pricing procedure is selected, list of all condition types involved is known. Now for each condition type system has to determine the condition value. Each condition type is linked to an access sequence. Access sequence is basically sequence in which condition tables are to be accessed to search for condition record (Condition records are maintained in condition table).\nAs per sequence maintained in access sequence, system starts with table 1. If condition record is found then system picks the condition value and stops searching any further. If condition record is not found in table 1 then system starts searching for table 2. If condition record is found then system picks the condition value and stops searching any further, if not found in table 2 then system starts searching in table 3. If no condition record is found in all the tables, system issues message no record found. Condition type gets zero value. Similarly value for each & every condition type is determined. System calculates (addition & subtraction of condition values) to arrive at net sales price. This net price is basically the price which is charged to customer. Hence GL account for account receivable is debited with this net price.",

      "description": "You are interested in learning SAP ABAP and getting into the wide realm of programming and intense Tech Entrepreneurship. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning SAP ABAP (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to program is \"to program\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP ABAP and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP ABAP. Even though SAP ABAP can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word \"SAP\" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).\nIn this course, I will walk you though SAP ABAP Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the program SAP ABAP, but also what the crux of programming is in terms of how we solve problems programmatically and harness the POWER of SAP ABAP.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP ABAP programming and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the most powerful language: SAP ABAP.",

This is typically done at the end of the year to prepare for the next fiscal period. However, sometimes it may be necessary to make adjustments to the financial data after the fiscal year has been closed.\n\n\nWhen this happens, there are two options for re-opening the fiscal year in SAP Asset Accounting:\n\n\n1. Reverse the year-end closing process: This involves reversing the steps that were taken to close the fiscal year, such as opening up posting periods and re-activating depreciation. This option allows you to make the necessary adjustments and then re-close the fiscal year.\n\n2. Re-open the fiscal year for specific depreciation areas only. This is typically done to adjust tax values for fixed assets without any impact to the (already closed) book valuation.\n\n\nOnce you have made the necessary adjustments and completed either of the above options, you can close the fiscal year again. This involves completing the same steps that were taken to originally close the fiscal year.\n\n\nThis course will walk you step-by-step through both options and show you how to re-open the fiscal year in SAP Asset Accounting.",

      "description": "You are interested in learning SAP HR and getting into the wide realm of programming and intense Tech Entrepreneurship. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning SAP HR (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to catch up is \"to work on it\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP HR and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP HR. Even though SAP HR can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word \"SAP\" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress tHRough your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).\nIn this course, I will walk you though SAP HR Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you tHRough in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the configure SAP HR, but also what the crux of SAP Functional is: POWER of SAP HR.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP HR finance and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the one of the most popular SAP Modules: SAP HR.",

      "description": "Activity-Based Costing (ABC) in SAP provides a more accurate way of allocating overhead costs based on the actual activities that contribute to overhead. SAP CO-OM-ABC, especially in S/4 HANA, offers a streamlined way of handling this. Let’s break down your steps for understanding:\nActivate Activity-Based Costing in Controlling Area: Here you activate the ABC functionality for a specific controlling area.\nMaintain Business Process Standard Hierarchy: Set up a standardized hierarchy for business processes in your controlling area.\nCost element creation-43 category: Cost elements of category 43 are created to capture the expenses related to activity types.\nActivity type-Labour -Master Data: This is the creation of labor activity types that you will use for ABC. Activity types represent the kind of work being performed.\nProduction Cost center -Master data: Cost centers are departments or units where costs accumulate.\nCost center with Activity type planning: Here you plan costs for activity types at specific cost centers.\nTemplate Allocation-BP Environment Creation: This is the setup of the environment where business processes and their associated costs can be modeled.\nBusiness Process creation -Master data: Define individual business processes.\nAssign Template to all Business Process: Use templates to allocate costs consistently across business processes.\nBusiness Process Group Creation: Group related business processes together.\nBusiness Process Planning-Cost Element wise: Plan costs for each business process based on specific cost elements.\nBusiness Process Planning-Activity type wise: Plan costs for business processes based on activity types.\nBusiness Process & Activity type rate calculation: Calculate rates for business processes and activity types based on your planning.\nTemplate Allocation-001 Environment: This step might be about initializing the standard allocation environment.\nMaterial Master creation: Define the materials that will be used in your processes.\nBill of Material (BOM): This lists all the components/materials required for a product.\nWork Center: This defines where work gets done (machines, labor groups, etc.)\nRouting: This outlines the path that production takes, including steps and their associated costs.\nProduction Version: Defines the specific combination of BOM and routing for production.\nCost estimation & Release: Calculate estimated costs for production and release them for further processing.\nProduction Order creation: Create a specific order to produce a certain amount of material or product.\nActivity Confirmation: Confirm the actual labor hours and machine hours consumed during production.\nTemplate Allocation -Execution of Business Process: Apply the template allocations to the actual business processes.\nFI Expenses to Direct Cost centers: Post financial accounting expenses directly to cost centers.\nCreation of Distribution Cycle: Cost spilt to Business Process: Define how costs will be distributed or split across different business processes.\nExecution of Distribution Cycle: Run the distribution cycle to allocate the costs.\nActual Business Process Rate Calculation: Calculate the actual rates based on incurred costs.\nRevaluation of Production Order: Adjust the values of the production orders based on the actual rates.\nVariance Calculation: Determine differences between planned and actual costs.\nSettlement: Distribute any variances to appropriate accounts or objects.\nIn essence, SAP's ABC model in CO-OM-ABC lets you move from traditional cost center accounting, where costs are often allocated based on simplistic measures, to a more detailed view where costs are allocated based on actual business processes and activities. This gives management a more accurate view of product costs and can highlight areas for potential efficiency gains or cost reductions.",

      "description": "Break into a role where top SAP consultants average $133,797/year—no experience needed to begin.\nBefore building this course, I’d already spent years deep in the weeds of SAP Fiori—configuring, breaking, fixing, and rethinking how enterprise UX should work.\nI didn’t just want to learn how to use SAP Fiori. I wanted to understand why it works the way it does. Why this app shows up in this tile. Why this role gets access while another doesn’t. Why the Launchpad crashes when you theme too aggressively. Why most tutorials are... pretty useless.\nSo I made the course I wish I had when I started.\nHere’s what you’ll actually walk away with:\nYou’ll understand how Fiori works behind the scenes. You’ll deploy apps like a pro, configure user roles and authorizations that don’t break, and design custom themes without breaking the Launchpad. You’ll activate OData services with confidence, use SAP Web IDE like it’s second nature, and finally understand what those cryptic task lists actually do.\nIn this course, you’ll learn how to:\nTranslate business roles into perfectly scoped authorizations.\nAutomate app activation and stop manually clicking around for hours.\nCustomize the Launchpad to actually look good and perform.\nDesign and apply global themes that don’t scream “SAP from 2006.”\nImplement notifications, bgRFC, and system messages like a real system architect.\nSecure your setup with SSO and proper network protocols.\nExtend apps with Fiori Elements and custom development workflows.\nReal Talk: Why this course?\nBecause Fiori is everywhere now—and it’s only getting bigger. If you’re working with SAP S/4HANA, you’re touching Fiori whether you like it or not.\nBut the problem? Fiori is a framework, not a feature. It’s made of a hundred moving parts, and most online content teaches it in isolation—ignoring how everything connects.\nThat’s why this course is different.\nWe go end-to-end. From understanding the SAP Fiori Apps Library and task lists, to configuring roles and testing access, to building themes and securing your system.\nYou’ll learn not just what to do, but why it matters.\nHeads-up: This course gets technical.\nYou’ll be working with authorizations, role maintenance, network configurations, and development tools like SAP Web IDE and Business Application Studio. You don’t need to be a developer—but you do need to be curious, committed, and ready to get your hands dirty.\nIf you're the kind of person who wants to really understand how things work—not just click through wizard screens—this is 100% your course.\nWhy Learn SAP Fiori?\nSAP Fiori revolutionizes the way users interact with SAP systems by providing a modern, intuitive, and responsive user experience. By mastering SAP Fiori, you'll be equipped to create user-friendly applications that enhance productivity and drive business success.\nWho Should Enroll?\nSAP Consultants and Developers: Enhance your expertise in SAP Fiori and SAP S/4HANA to deliver top-notch solutions to your clients.\nIT Professionals: Gain the skills needed to manage and configure SAP Fiori environments effectively.\nBusiness Analysts: Understand how to leverage SAP Fiori to meet business requirements and improve user satisfaction.\nAnyone Interested in SAP Fiori: Whether you're new to SAP or looking to expand your knowledge, this course is designed to meet your needs.\nI pride myself on providing exceptional support and personalized feedback to every student. I'm always available to guide you and answer your questions, ensuring you have a smooth and enriching learning journey.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be confident in configuring, deploying, customizing, and optimizing Fiori across any S/4HANA system.\nYou won’t just know how to make it work—you’ll know how to make it shine.\nLet’s master SAP Fiori together.\nI’ll see you in the course.",

As specialists in the field of automation and connection of hardware and IoT, we integrate them seamlessly for your efficient, SAP-based warehouse processing.\nIn many cases, we act as an intermediary in the area of tension between IT and the department and are happy to assume this role. Especially when switching to SAP EWM, it is important to manage the balancing act between process standardization and your requirements.\n\nBased on our in-depth industry know-how, we create transparent, maintenance-friendly end-2-end solutions with our own developments and accompany you as a reliable, strategic partner into the future of warehouse logistics.\nDuring the industrial revolution of the mid 18th century, the function of warehouses evolved and became more specialised. The mass production of goods launched by the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries fuelled the development of larger and more specialised warehouses, usually located close to transport hubs on canals, at railways and portside. Specialisation of tasks is characteristic of the factory system, which developed in British textile mills and potteries in the mid-late 1700s. Factory processes speeded up work and deskilled labour, bringing new profits to capital investment.\nWarehouses also fulfill a range of commercial functions besides simple storage, exemplified by Manchester's cotton warehouses and Australian wool stores: receiving, stockpiling and despatching goods; displaying goods for commercial buyers; packing, checking and labelling orders, and dispatching them.\nThe utilitarian architecture of warehouses responded fast to emerging technologies. Before and into the nineteenth century, the basic European warehouse was built of load-bearing masonry walls or heavy-framed timber with a suitable external cladding. Inside, heavy timber posts supported timber beams and joists for the upper levels, rarely more than four to five stories high.\n19th-century warehouses in Gloucester docks in the United Kingdom, originally used to store imported corn\nA gabled roof was conventional, with a gate in the gable facing the street, rail lines or port for a crane to hoist goods into the window-gates on each floor below. Convenient access for road transport was built-in via very large doors on the ground floor. If not in a separate building, office and display spaces were located on the ground or first floor.\nTechnological innovations of the early 19th century changed the shape of warehouses and the work performed inside them: cast iron columns and later, moulded steel posts; saw-tooth roofs; and steam power. All (except steel) were adopted quickly and were in common use by the middle of the 19th century.\nStrong, slender cast iron columns began to replace masonry piers or timber posts to carry levels above the ground floor. As modern steel framing developed in the late 19th century, its strength and constructibility enabled the first skyscrapers. Steel girders replaced timber beams, increasing the span of internal bays in the warehouse.\nThe saw-tooth roof brought natural light to the top story of the warehouse. It transformed the shape of the warehouse, from the traditional peaked hip or gable to an essentially flat roof form that was often hidden behind a parapet. Warehouse buildings now became strongly horizontal. Inside the top floor, the vertical glazed pane of each saw-tooth enabled natural lighting over displayed goods, improving buyer inspection.\nHoists and cranes driven by steam power expanded the capacity of manual labour to lift and move heavy goods.\n20th century[edit]\nAisle with pallets on storage racks in a modern warehouse\nTwo new power sources, hydraulics, and electricity, re-shaped warehouse design and practice at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century.\nPublic hydraulic power networks were constructed in many large industrial cities around the world in the 1870s-80s, exemplified by Manchester. They were highly effective to power cranes and lifts, whose application in warehouses served taller buildings and enabled new labour efficiencies.\nPublic electricity networks emerged in the 1890s. They were used at first mainly for lighting and soon to electrify lifts, making possible taller, more efficient warehouses. It took several decades for electrical power to be distributed widely throughout cities in the western world.\n20th-century technologies made warehousing ever more efficient. Electricity became widely available and transformed lighting, security, lifting, and transport from the 1900s. The internal combustion engine, developed in the late 19th century, was installed in mass-produced vehicles from the 1910s. It not only reshaped transport methods but enabled many applications as a compact, portable power plant, wherever small engines were needed.\nAdams & Bazemore Cotton Warehouse in Macon, GA, circa 1877\nThe forklift truck was invented in the early 20th century and came into wide use after World War II. Forklifts transformed the possibilities of multi-level pallet racking of goods in taller, single-level steel-framed buildings for higher storage density. The forklift, and its load fixed to a uniform pallet, enabled the rise of logistic approaches to storage in the later 20th century.\nAlways a building of function, in the late 20th century warehouses began to adapt to standardization, mechanization, technological innovation, and changes in supply chain methods. Here in the 21st century, we are currently witnessing the next major development in warehousing– automation.\nWarehouse layout[edit]\nA good warehouse layout consist of 5 areas:\nLoading and unloading area - This is the area where goods are unloaded and loaded into the truck. It could be part of the building or separated from the building.\nReception area - Also known as staging area, this a place where the incoming goods are processed and reviewed, and sorted before proceeding to storage.\nStorage area - This is the area of the warehouse where goods sit as it awaits dispatch. This area can be further subdivided into static storage for goods that will take longer before being dispatched and dynamic storage for goods that sell faster.[11]\nPicking area - This is the area where goods being dispatched are prepared or modified before being shipped.\nShipping area - Once goods have been prepared, they proceed to the packing or shipping area where they await the actual shipping.\nTypology[edit]\nIndia House, Manchester.\nWarehouses are generally considered industrial buildings[12] and are usually located in industrial districts or zones (such as the outskirts of a city).[13] LoopNet categorizes warehouses using the \"industrial\" property type.[14] Craftsman Book Company's 2018 National Building Cost Manual lists \"Warehouses\" under the \"Industrial Structures Section.\"[15] In the UK, warehouses are classified under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as the industrial category B8 Storage and distribution.[16][17]\nTypes of warehouses include storage warehouses, distribution centers (including fulfillment centers and truck terminals), retail warehouses, cold storage warehouses, and flex space",

In other words, it is no longer necessary to have a separate set of systems/servers/databases for SAP Transportation, as is the case with the classic side-by-side deployment option of SAP TM that we have seen to date.\n\n\nUplatz offers this SAP S/4HANA Transportation Management Training with comprehensive coverage of the S/4HANA embedded TM module. This SAP S/4HANA TM course will help you to understand each stage of SAP Transportation Management implementation and will enable you to use the system in your role as a SAP TM consultant or business user. In this course you will also gain an overview of the key business transactions and system capabilities to enable you to design the processes you will use within your own organization.\nThis SAP S/4HANA training will provide you skills to support processes within TM such as Order Management, Transportation Planning, Subcontracting, Execution, Charge Calculation and Settlement.\n\n\nAdvantages of SAP S/4HANA Embedded TM\nSmaller database and hardware footprint\nReduction in Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to smaller replication and monitoring effort\nEnhanced user experience leveraging S/4HANA \"look and feel\" and Fiori UI\nRemove the need to duplicate ERP customer, vendor and material master data into business partners and products in TM, thereby removing the need for the Core Interface (CIF). ERP and TM share a single set of harmonized master data objects.\nReal-time embedded analytics\nIntegration with new S/4HANA Enterprise Management for managing transportation-related equipment\nRemove the need to duplicate ERP orders and deliveries into Order-based Transportation Requirement (OTR) and Delivery-based Transportation Requirement (DTR) documents in TM. OTR and DTR documents are no longer necessary. Orders and deliveries are able to convert directly into Freight Units, Freight Orders, etc.\n\n\nFunctionality of SAP S/4HANA Embedded TM\nMain transportation network master data (zones, lanes, etc.)\nManual carrier selection and tendering\nFreight agreements\nDelivery based planning\nDangerous goods management (with some limitations)\nOutput management\nTransportation execution (without Event Management)\nBasic charge calculation and freight settlement\nAnalytics in BW\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nOutline transportation management business processes in S/4HANA\nIdentify and examine the SAP TM building blocks necessary for processing shipments of goods.\nEngage in Transportation network maintenance\nCreate transportation relevance for orders and deliveries and manage forwarding orders\nManage a transportation plan and shipment execution\nCalculate and settle freight charges and distribute costs\n\n\nSAP S/4HANA TM - Course Syllabus\n\n\n1.

      "description": "Big data analytics is the process of examining large data sets to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences and other useful business information. The analytical findings can lead to more effective marketing, new revenue opportunities, better customer service, improved operational efficiency, competitive advantages over rival organizations and other business benefits.\nThe primary goal of big data analytics is to help companies make more informed business decisions by enabling data scientists predictive modelers and other analytics professionals to analyze large volumes of transaction data, as well as other forms of data that may be untapped by conventional business intelligence programs. That could include Web server logs and Internet stream data, social media content and social network activity reports, text from customer emails and survey responses, mobile-phone call detail records and machine data captured by sensors connected to the Internet of things.\nBig data can be analyzed with the software tools commonly used as part of advanced analytics disciplines such as predictive analytics, Data mining, Text analytics and Statistical Analysis.\nPotential pitfalls that can trip up organizations on big data analytics initiatives include a lack of internal analytics skills and the high cost of hiring experienced analytics professionals. The amount of information that's typically involved, and its variety, can also cause data management headaches, including data quality and consistency issues. In addition, integrating Hadoop systems and data warehouses can be a challenge, although various vendors now offer software connectors between Hadoop and relational databases, as well as other data integration tools with big data capabilities.\nSAP has whole range of solution for taking care of entire analytics scope.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSAP® is a registered trademark of SAP A.G, Germany.

But the pain-point is difficulties in implementing, maintaining and operating such attachments through interfaces.  It is normally complex and often leaves gaps while catering business solutions with respect to capabilities and what Industry actually wants.\nSAP S/4HANA Core offers highly efficient Industry specific solutions which are faster, quicker and eliminates duel maintenance of master-data. Apart from that, interfacing is either easy or eliminated as all the set up and operations are centralized.\nThis course as explained in 'expectations' session is made purely to give an overview so that students / consultants will have an understanding of Industry Solutions apart from their core subject. That will certainly help to become an differentiator in their consultancy as well as in job interviews.\nThis course does not cover any technical system demo or exercise but provides useful overview explained in a detailed way so that students can visualize the scenario very well.\nThis course focusses on retail.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting Marketing (RMK) course by Uplatz.\n\n\nThe SuccessFactors Recruiting solution helps companies attract, engage, and select the best talent match.\nThe Recruiting Execution solution consists of two modules: Recruiting Marketing and Recruiting Management.\n\n\nRecruiting Marketing (RMK)\nFocuses on attracting and engaging candidates. This module increases sourcing ROI by showing clients which marketing strategies result in the best candidates for the lowest cost.\nThe Recruiting Dashboard, a key part of Recruiting Marketing, displays metrics for elements like time to fill a position and budget savings. Recruiting Marketing also features smart job publishing to distribute jobs, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to drive more traffic, and a talent community to capture passive candidates.\n\n\nRecruiting Management (RCM)\nThe RCM Applicant Tracking System supports the sourcing capability of Recruiting Marketing. The module supports opening requisitions, processing candidate applications, and selecting the best candidate for a position.\n- Identify, screen, select, hire, and onboard internal and external job applicants.\n- Move candidates through recruiting pipeline to the appropriate stage\n- Manage interview, offer, and hire process to close the requisition\n\n\nThe SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting Marketing (RMK) is an extremely robust and comprehensive module that along with its counterpart, Recruiting Management (RCM), provides sourcing, candidate engagement and candidate management happening in one platform. Recruiting Marketing offers an enhanced careers website, strong mobile technology, multi-channel job postings, and social networks integration.\nThe SAP SF RMK module has become quite popular due to its ability to facilitate the clients to maintain full governance of their enhanced careers sites. Powered with the new Career Site Builder (CSB), the customers, after the initial implementation, are able to edit their own career site with minimal level of support, just like it is done currently with the Recruiting Management version, but without this enhanced version which is offered by Recruiting Marketing.\nSuccessFactors partners are now able to implement RMK (including the new platform for Career Site Builder) which was not possible till recently. Each administrator can take full ownership of almost all functions of the module.\n\n\nThis course on SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting Marketing covers everything related to the SAP SuccessFactors RMK module.\n\n\nSAP SuccessFactors RMK - Course Syllabus\n\n\nIntroduction to SAP SF Recruiting Marketing (RMK)\nCareer Site Builder (CSB)\nCSB Pages and Components\nJob Data and Recruiting Management Configuration\nRecruiting Integrations\nSetup in Command Center\nCareer Site Design\nGlobal Settings, Global Styles, Brands, and Home Pages\nOther Page Types, Headers and Footers\nCareer Site Setup\nCandidate Relationship Management (CRM)\nLocale Configuration\nJob Distribution and Media Services\nMove to Production\nAdvanced Analytics Implementation\n\n\nCertification Exam\nC_THR84_2111 or the SAP Certified Application Associate - SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting: Candidate Experience 2H/2021 certification exam confirms that the candidate has the basic knowledge in the area of the SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting: Candidate Experience application. The SuccessFactors Recruiting Marketing certification - C_THR84_2105 - could be a great certification choice if you want an associate-level SAP career.",

We collect the department wise cost and redistribute it to other departments using allocation methods and finally allocate the cost to products based on how much resources of each department product is using.\nPlanning and actual cost can be posted to the cost centers, and we can do variance analysis. In new version of SAP S4 HANA we can also assign the control to restrict the actual cost up to plan values.\nCost center accounting is used for the calculation of activity price calculation. How much is the price of each activity. Activity price is then used to calculate the direct cost of manufacturing the products.\n· Product Costing\nProduct costing is used to calculate the price of products in detail with their cost components like cost of material, labor, and overheads separately.\nThree different types of product cost are going to be calculated:\n· Standard Cost.\nIt is estimated cost to produce one single unit.\n· Plan Cost.\nIt is estimated cost for the whole production order.\n· Actual Cost.\nIt is actual cost consumed to product goods in a production order.\n\n\nProfitability Analysis (COPA):\nIt is used to analysis the profitability using different dimensions like region, product, customer etc.\n\n\nInternal Order:\nIt is used to analyze the cost at the lower level like how much is the cost for one project.\n\n\nProfit Center Accounting:\nIt is used for both revenue and cost analysis like we want to analyze the profit for one material.\nMaterial Ledger Actual Cost:\nIt is used to actualize the standard cost of materials. It is mandatory for S4 Hana.\nIAS-2 valuate the materials at the lower cost and NRV.\nControlling Area:\nIt is for internal reporting purpose which records and analyze overhead related activities like:\ni) Cost Element Accounting\nii) Cost Center Accounting\niii) Internal Orders\nManufacturing related activities like:\ni) Product Costing.\nEvaluation of internal unit analysis and evaluation like:\ni. Profit Center Accounting.\nAssignment of company code to controlling area:\nMultiple company codes can be assigned to one controlling area but below conditions should be met:\na. Chart of account for company code and controlling area should be the same.\nb. Fiscal year variant should be the same. (Start and end of fiscal year & no of posting periods).\nControlling Area Components:\nFiscal Year:\nIt is used to validate the historical data as well. We need to specify the fiscal year from which we need to analyze the historical data.\nCO Number Ranges:\nLike FI document types in CO, we maintain different number ranges for different transaction types of CO but unlike FI document type number ranges CO number ranges are year independent.",

      "description": "You are interested in learning SAP PP and getting into the wide realm of programming and intense Tech Entrepreneurship. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning SAP PP (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to catch up is \"to work on it\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP PP and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP PP. Even though SAP PP can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word \"SAP\" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).\nIn this course, I will walk you though SAP PP Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the program SAP PP, but also what the crux of programming is in terms of how we solve problems programmatically and harness the POWER of SAP PP.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP PP finance and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the one of the most popular SAP Modules: SAP PP.",

In particular, from this course you will learn:\nFundamentals of the Predictive Analytics Library,\nThe structures involved, such as HANA Tables, Views, PAL SQL procedures and more,\nA comparison of the raw PAL SQL code with the HANA Analytical Processes available in SAP BW by creating the comparable HANA AP in BW,\nIntegrating Predictive Analytics into SAP BW and SAP Lumira\nPrerequisites:\nThis course assumes no knowledge of the HANA Predictive Analytics Library.\nBW and HANA experience would be helpful.\nWhat this course is not:\nThis course does not cover every single Predictive Analytics algorithm. It covers enough of the algorithms for you to get comfortable with using them and apply the techniques to any other functions. Covering all algorithms will result in a high level of repetition without any real value.\nWhat sets this course apart from anything available on other platforms is the fact that it covers the integration and application of the Predictive Analytics Library with the various other SAP BW and visualization platforms.\nThis course will always expend so check back regularly for updates and more content, for example, integration of PAL into SAP BPC Embedded, more case studies for Regression Algorithms, Text Analytics and more!",

      "description": "SAP MM is a very vast subject. The goal of the course is to simplify this process as much as possible. The word \"simplify\" - is really the key. This course does not claim to be the most comprehensive course in MM, nor the most advanced course in MM. It has just one goal - to let you learn SAP MM as simply as possible.\nThis course is designed to tell you everything you need to know about SAP MM in a very gentle way. Since this course is designed from a freshers' perspective, if you are already an SAP functional consultant ( in other areas of SAP ), then the pace of this course might be a bit slow.\nIn this course, I provided an explanation of the above topics. I tried to give business usage examples along with configuration which will be handled by SAP Consultants. I also provided the testing of each process which will be helpful to both SAP Consultants and End Users.\n\n\nAfter this course, the students will be able to identify and analyze the business requirements for any organization related to the Procurement to Pay process cycle and configure SAP S4 HANA Sourcing and Procurement accordingly.\nAfter taking this course, the Learners will be able to work both as a Consultant and End-User and can also take SAP S/4HANA Sourcing & Procurement certification exam.,",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP Controlling (CO) course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP CO (Controlling) is a key SAP module that supports coordination, monitoring, and optimization of all processes in an organization. SAP CO involves recording both the consumption of production factors and the services provided by an organization. It includes managing and configuring master data that covers cost and profit centers, internal orders, other cost elements and functional areas.\nThe main purpose of SAP CO module is planning. CO enables you to determine variances by comparing actual data with plan data and thus helps you to control smoothly the business flows in your organization.\nBoth SAP CO and SAP FI modules are independent components in an SAP system and data flow between these components takes place on a regular basis. Data flows relevant to cost flow into Controlling module from Financial Accounting. At the same time, the system assigns the costs and revenues to different CO account assignment objects, such as cost centers, business processes, projects or orders.\nIn essence, the SAP Controlling module provides information to managers & decision makers to understand where the company's money is being spent. While the purpose of SAP FICO is to help companies generate and manage financial statements for analysis and reporting and help with effective business planning and decision-making, the SAP CO module within FICO focuses more narrowly on planning and monitoring costs.\n\n\nSAP CO comprises of sub-modules that handle specific processes:\nCost Elements provide an overview of all the company's costs and revenues based on profit and loss statements, which are also known as income statements. Cost element accounting describes the origin of the costs, and the cost elements represent specific costs that the company incurs.\nCost Centers deal with the costs associated with the company's internal divisions or departments, such as sales, production, marketing or human resources. Cost Centers involves only expenses, not revenues.\nProfit Centers handle all of the cost data related to the company's business lines. It deals with both expenses and revenues, unlike Cost Centers, which deals only with expenses. For example, a global consumer products company may use Profit Centers for health products, soaps and detergents, cosmetics, food and beverages, and so on.\nInternal Orders are used to manage the costs for smaller internal projects or non-fixed assets -- for example, a limited-time marketing campaign.\nProfitability Analysis enables the company to analyze the profitability of its products. For example, Profitability Analysis can be useful for making decisions on matters like product pricing, distribution channels, or target market segments. It also allows levels of detail in analyzing profitability, such as for each region or country, product types and distribution channels, down to individual customer profitability.\nProduct Costing manages the data about costs required to produce the company's goods and services. Product costing analysis can help manage manufacturing costs and optimize efficiencies.\n\n\nThis SAP CO training by Uplatz focuses on providing comprehensive knowledge of SAP Controlling concepts with live examples and scenarios. SAP CO training will help you master the functionalities and configurations available within SAP CO module. Uplatz's SAP CO course will help you gain sufficient knowledge to appear in SAP CO Certification exam and apply for jobs in SAP Controlling area.\n\n\nSAP Controlling course curriculum\n\n\n1.

      "description": "Process Mining is the methodology which helps to understand process the way it happens in real environment.\nProcess mining is (Also called as Process Intelligence) helps to create investigations based on actual performance. This is done on actual workflow data in various IT systems such as SAP. Service Now etc.\nAn important aspect of any business process management (BPM) discipline is the discovery phase. This is where you gather information about your processes—what’s working well, and what’s not. It helps pinpoint where optimization potential lies. Traditional methods of discovery, however, such as interviews with business application users, tend to be manual and error-prone.\nProcess mining provides a much more accurate, effective, and data-driven approach to discovery. This guide illustrates the steps necessary to carry out a successful process mining project and explains how to use the resulting learnings to drive process improvement as part of a broader BPM strategy.\nThere are three main classes of process mining techniques: process discovery, conformance checking, and process enhancement.\nProcesses are the lifeblood of any business. Whether they are carried out by people, automated or both, most of those processes leave digital traces. Process mining uses these digital traces or event logs to visualize how each process actually functions, in comparison to how the process is intended to function. Process mining helps ‘paint a picture’ of what is really happening in your business.\nBy mining event logs data — instead of using interviews and estimates — process mining reveals where workarounds, shadow processes, bottlenecks and compliance issues occur and plays a critical role in improving business operations and reducing risks.",

      "description": "This SAP PP online course is something different from what you have seen so far.\n\nIf you want to learn more about SAP, specifically about Production Planning, you are in the right spot. In this course I will give you a practical hand on training in SAP, from the business point of view. Let me explain what do I mean by that. Business point of view means that you will get real challenges that companies have. Hand on means that you will learn how to customize processes to solve those challenges.\nBy taking this course you will dive deeper into SAP and will understand better how it works.\nCourse Structure\n\nThe course structure expands over 7 different sections designed to walk you trough the process of delivering to a customer a functional solution to his challenge\n1.       The Introduction Section will introduce the course concepts and objective. You will meet me as your trainer and will understand how the course is structured\n2.       How to install SAP for free Section will show you step by step how to get access to an SAP system.\n3.       Setting the business example will introduce you to your customer. This is the business approach you will benefit from in this course. You will solve a real life situation for a company that has a new process and they need your expertise to know how to handle it.\n4.       Process Introduction will introduce you to the process fundamentals required to understand your customer’s challenge and the options to solve it in SAP.\n5.       Customizing the complete process in SAP will get you hands on experience in SAP customizing.\n6.       Customer Demonstration Preparation will show you how to test your Master Data and customizing to make sure it will work smooth for the customer presentation.\n7.       Customer Demonstration will show you how to present the process to your customer. You will emphasis the initial challenges and how they are solved with SAP.\nHow to install SAP\nSAP IDES or the Internet Demonstration System, is my recommendation for this because it offers you master data created and customizing to start exploring. If you would install a fresh instance of SAP, it will be empty and you will need to create data and customizing for it to start using it.\nI will walk you through the installation process step by step and in the end of this course you will have access to SAP with your own user to start learning.\nSetting the Business Example\nThe key to learn SAP customizing is understanding the business challenges that companies have and how your customizing will make the companies run better.\nBy having this understanding, the customizing steps and requirements will make a lot more sense. You will be able to understand everything from a logical perspective and will make the learning process a lot more fun.\nProcess Introduction\n\nCustomizing in SAP can be sometimes very technical. On the other hand, the customer’s requirements are more business then technical oriented.\nThis section will show you the process fundamentals required to understand your customer’s challenge and the options to solve it in SAP. This represents the bridge between business and technical.\nCustomizing the complete process in SAP\n\nAfter completing this section, you will know how to customize the complete process by yourself. Yes, by yourself because you will make your own customizing. After each lesson I will have tasks prepared for you to guide you trough the process. From my experience this is the best way to learn, by doing it yourself.\nCustomer Demonstration Preparation\nIn this section you will test the process you have created. Using your own master data and your own customizing will give you a rewording feeling of testing your own work.\nThe objective is to make sure that the process works smooth and you will be on top of it when it will be presented to your customer.\nCustomer Demonstration\nYou have come a long way till here and I would like to congratulate you. In this section I will show you how to present the process to your customer. You will put an emphasis the initial challenges and how they are solved with SAP.\nThis is how it works in the real life. To gain your customer’s trust you will build a demo based on his challenges and will present this to him.",

Using extensive features of SAP Variant Configuration, you can support various aspects of Make to Order Manufacturing. You can define SuperBOMs which are supersets of all possible combination of components. these BOMs involve all optional components of which, only a few will go in to Customer's BOM, according to Features selected. Which component is selected for certain customer selection is determined by what is called Object dependencies. You will be able to restrict the selection of features (Characteristics in SAP) as well as options of each feature (Values of characteristics in SAP) to ensure only valid combinations are offered to customers. You can also provide guided selection by populating only features relevant to your initial selections. The costing and pricing of each variant resulting from SuperBOM and Routing are automatically calculated by settings available in Variant Configuration.\nHowever, for simple scenarios you can adopt solution involving Classes of type 200 (Material (Configurable objects) as BOM Items.\n\nAccording to this solution, You can use class items to control the selection of materials in a Super BOM. these materials are classified in a class of type 200. For each material, values are set for characteristics grouped under the class.\nIn this course you will understand how the solution works.\nThe course is structured as:\n1.

Enterprises strive to protect themselves against various threats and attacks. Threats are usually identified as external threats but actually there are also, hard to detect, internal threats. Meanwhile, employing many employees and using many systems, one should pay close attention to threats appearing within the organization. This type of risk is most often invisible, but its materialization can also have significant impact on the financial condition of the company.\nTo enable full control over the process of conflict identification and resolution and to obtain compliance with various Acts e.g. the SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley), the management decides to implement the appropriate GRC class tool.

      "description": "You are interested in learning SAP Materials Management and getting into the wide realm of programming and intense Tech Entrepreneurship. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning SAP MM (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to program is \"to program\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP MM and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP MM. Even though SAP MM can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word \"SAP\" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).\nIn this course, I will walk you though SAP MM Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the program SAP MM, but also what the crux of programming is in terms of how we solve problems programmatically and harness the POWER of SAP MM.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP MM programming and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the most powerful language: SAP MM.",

The credit exposure is the total combined value of the following documents:\nOpen orders\nOpen deliveries\nOpen billing documents\nOpen items (accounts receivable)\nThe open order value is the value of the order items which have not yet been delivered. The open delivery value is the value of the delivery items which have not yet been invoiced. The open invoice value is the value of the billing document items which have not yet been forwarded to accounting. The open items represent documents that have been forwarded to accounting but not yet settled by the customer.\nDynamic Credit Limit Check with Credit Horizon\nThe customer's credit exposure is split into a static part; open items, open billing, and delivery values (see above), and a dynamic part, the open order value. The open order value includes all undelivered or only partially delivered orders. The value is calculated on the shipping date and stored in an information structure according to a time period that you specify (days, weeks, or months). When you define the credit check, you can then specify a particular horizon date in the future (for example: 10 days or 2 months, depending on the periods you specify). For the purposes of evaluating credit, you want the system to ignore all open orders that are due for delivery after the horizon date. The sum of the static and dynamic parts of the check may not exceed the credit limit.\nMaximum Document Value\nThe sales order or delivery value may not exceed a specific value which is defined in the credit check. The value is stored in the currency of the credit control area. This check is useful if the credit limit has not yet been defined for a new customer. It is initiated by a risk category which is defined specifically for new customers.\nChanges Made to Critical Fields\nThe credit check is triggered by changes made in the document to values in any of the credit-sensitive fields. According to your Customizing settings, the system runs a check credit between changes or differences in the sales order data against the default values in the customer master record. Examples of such fields are terms of payment and fixed value dates .\nDate of Next Review\nUses the date of the next credit review as a trigger for an automatic credit check. If you process a sales order after a customer's next review date has already gone by, the system automatically carries out a credit check.\nOverdue Open Items\nThe relation between open items which are more than a certain number of days overdue and the customer balance may not exceed a certain percentage.\nOldest Open Item\nThe oldest open item may not be more than a specified number of days overdue.\nMaximum Number of Dunning Levels Allowed\nThe customer's dunning level may only reach a specified maximum value.\nUser-Defined Checks\nIf you want to carry out checks other than the standard checks, you can define your own checks in the appropriate user exits in Customizing for Sales.",

      "description": "Introduction to SAP Quality Management (QM)\nQuality Management (QM) is an integral part of the logistics function and within the SAP system it is fully integrated with complementary components including Materials Management (MM), Plant Maintenance (PM), and Production Planning (PP). Quality management is important to the warehouse, inspecting incoming material as it arrives at the facility and for manufacturing operations, where the quality of in-process items are checked during manufacturing process and finished goods are inspected before they reach the warehouse.\nQuality Management Components\nThe QM module covers three distinct areas of planning, notifications and inspections. The quality planning function allows your quality department to plan inspections for goods receipts from vendors and production, work in process and stock transfers. A quality notification can be used to request action to be taken by the quality department. This may be to review an internal problem, an issue with items from a vendor or a customer complaint. The quality inspection is the physical inspection using specifications defined in quality planning.\nPlanning\nIn SAP the quality inspection plans defines how an item is to be inspected. The plan also establishes how the inspection is to take place, the item characteristics to be inspected and all the required test equipment that is needed for the inspection.\nThe inspection plan is an important part of the QM planning process. The plan defines which characteristics of the item are to be inspected in each operation and what kind of test equipment is required for the inspection.\nNotifications\nThe quality notification records a problem that is either identified by a customer against a product that is produced by your company, or by your company against the product of a vendor. A notification can also be raised internally to report a quality issue that has arisen on the production line or somewhere at the facility. You can assign a quality notification to an existing QM order to create a new order for the specific notification.\nInspections\nA quality inspection occurs when someone in the quality department inspects an item as determined by the inspection planning functionality. An inspection is based on one or more inspection lots, where a lot is a request to inspect a specific item. Inspection lots can be created manually by a user or automatically by the SAP system. There are a number of events that can trigger an automatic inspection lot. Most inspection lots are automatically triggered by a movement of materials, such as a goods receipt or a goods issue. But other events like the creation or release of a production order, the creation of deliveries or a transfer of stock in the warehouse.\nThe inspection lot functionality allows an inspection of a product in the warehouse. The product can be a finished product, a raw material, or a piece of equipment that is used in the facility. When an inspection is performed the results of the inspection should be recorded for each of the inspection characteristics. The inspection lot can be accepted as being within tolerance or can be rejected if the inspection finds that the results do not reach the prescribed specification for a certain characteristic.\nWhen the inspection is complete for the inspection lot, a usage decision can be made as to whether the material can be accepted or rejected. After the quality department has made a usage decision the inspection is technically closed.\nReporting\nSAP provides a number of reports for the quality management team. The material defects report can show the number of times an item has been in a defect status. The vendor defect report shows the frequency of failed material by vendor. By examining inspection lots for goods receipts, a quality department can highlight vendors who are supplying goods that frequently fail inspection. The customer defect report shows the defects that were found on inspections for outbound deliveries. This is important as it can help get defects resolved which will improve customer satisfaction and customer service.",

Common examples include pallets, containers, crates, and racks. The key characteristic of RTP in SAP is that it is managed as special stock and is non-valuated. This means that while the quantity of the RTP is tracked in the company's inventory, its value does not appear on the balance sheet, as it remains the property of the vendor.\n\n\nAccounting Implications of RTP\nA fundamental principle of RTP management in SAP is its non-valuation. Consequently, the receipt, internal transfer, and return of RTP materials do not generate any accounting or controlling documents. The system is designed to track only the quantity and location of these assets without affecting the company's financial statements.\n\n\nBy adhering to these standardized processes and configurations, companies can effectively manage their returnable transport packaging within SAP, ensuring accurate inventory visibility and fostering accountability with their supply chain partners without creating financial reporting discrepancies.",

At the end of the SAP HCM Payroll course you will be able to describe how to organize and run payroll including subsequent activities.\n\n\nSAP HCM Payroll - Course Curriculum\nPayroll Basics\nPersonnel Calculation Rules\nWage Type and Absence Valuations\nBasic Payroll Elements\nTime Wage Type Selection\nPayroll Factoring\nAverage Processing\nIntegration\n\n\nPayroll Organization configurations\nSome basic settings must be made in Customizing to be able to run payroll in the SAP HR HCM System.\nA period parameter and a date modifier are assigned to each payroll area. The period parameter determines whether payroll is run monthly, quarterly, weekly or for several weeks.\nPayroll periods must be generated for each combination of period parameters and date modifiers assigned to a payroll area.\nDate modifier links the additional date types with a payroll calendar.\nControl record must be created for every payroll area. This control record controls the individual stages of payroll.\n\n\nPayroll Control Record\nA control record must be created in Customizing for each payroll area before it can be used. To Maintain Personnel Control Record use transaction PA03.\nThe payroll control record has the following functions:\nIt locks the personnel numbers, for which payroll should be run, so that master data cannot be changed which might affect payroll data when payroll is being run.\nIf the master data for the personnel number is being changed for which payroll is run, it locks the payroll for that time, so that nobody can run the payroll during this time\nYou can also get information on what is the next payroll period for which regular payroll should be run, up to what date is retroactive accounting carried out and what status does the payroll currently have.\n\n\nPayroll Process\nWhen payroll is run master data and time data changes are not permitted. Also payroll must not be run during master data maintenance. This can be controlled by payroll control record.\nPhases available during payroll run\nIf the function Release Payroll is selected from the menu, it locks the personnel number attached to payroll area under consideration. Thus, it will not allow any changes to infotypes for this personnel number. Though changes that affect future are still permitted. This function must be executed before starting payroll.\nIf Check Result is selected, it doesn’t allow you to start payroll for the payroll area concerned. This way, you can check the payroll result, as nobody can change the payroll result.\nIf Corrections is selected, lock on master data and time data records for the selected payroll area are released. You can make changes in infotypes for personnel numbers having selected payroll area.\n\n\nSAP HCM Payroll Certification\nThe \"SAP Certified Application Associate - SAP HCM Payroll with ERP 6.0 EHP7\" certification exam verifies that the candidate possesses basic knowledge in the area of SAP Payroll. This certificate proves that the candidate has the required understanding within this consultant profile of the HCM solution, and can implement this knowledge practically in projects under guidance of an experienced consultant.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP Cutover Activities Management course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP Cutover Activities are the phase wise activities that need to be finished before the start of every phase of a project. Cutover activities are done in both implementation and roll-outs. These are performed during final preparation phase of a project as per ASAP implementation methodology.\nIn essence, you complete preparations including testing, end user training, system management etc. You also need to resolve all open issues in this phase. At this stage you need to ensure that all the prerequisites for your system to go live have been fulfilled. Some of the important activities done during SAP cutover are balance upload from legacy to sap system, sign off from end users for training completion, and the like.\nIn simple words, Cutover is the process of planning, managing, and executing all of the tasks and activities that allow the impacted business function to 'cutover' to the SAP system. The key components of the Cutover Plan include business preparation activities related to cutover and legacy integration/shutdown.\nCutover data includes data on financial and materials balances that SAP must carry forward, and also how to handle open transactions from the legacy system. Open transactions are those business transactions that are still under process when the company switches from the legacy system to the SAP system.\nUplatz provides this comprehensive training on SAP Cutover Management covering the full range of Cutover activities in any SAP project implementation, deployment, and migration that need to be performed for a successful project execution or change management.\nThis SAP Cutover Training will provide you a deep-dive into the key topics of SAP Cutover strategy:\nWhat is Cutover\nIntroduction to Cutover\nPlan for the Plan\nCutover Planning Process\nCutover Plan vs. Business Readiness Plan\nContingency Planning\nMust Get Right\n\n\nSAP Cutover Activities course curriculum\nLearn the process and steps to be aware of while creating the cutover plan and cutover activity sheets. The dedicated trainer will guide you through all the activities for this phase. As each activity is completed, the aforementioned Cutover Activity Sheet is signed by the executor of that activity and turned into the project management function before any dependant activity can be started.\nTraining into different Areas of the Cutover Phase Training covers\nFreezing and releasing of legacy data\nExportation of legacy data into the conversion database input layer\nUnderstanding of Master and Transaction Data\nWriting the Data Migration Load programs through LSMW\nTransposition of legacy data into the conversion database\nReconciliation of the production data to the Conversion Database\nCopy converted data to different SAP System Landscapes\nManual conversion of non-converted accounts\n\n\nFollowing is a practical scenario for SAP Cutover plan and management:\n1. Preparation for Cutover\nDuring the time of cutover and migration to SAP, system will not available for almost a week. It is essential from business point to inform all the business partners about the down time in advance. Therefore as a part of preparation it is recommended to send this information in advance to all the customers and vendors.\n2. Prepare Production Environment\nIn this step production machine will be prepared and tested in advance for all the application components. Since production machine will be connected to client network it is necessary to test this connectivity in advance. In addition all printers will also be installed and checked in this step.\n3. Setup Application\nIn this step SAP application will be setup on Production system, after taking all the transports to production SAP AG will verify the system is ready to go live.\n4. Convert and Verify Data\nIn this step data will be downloaded from legacy system and converted into required format to upload into SAP. After verification data will be loaded into SAP.\n5. Verify production readiness\nThis is the final step before Go Live, in this step final review for cutover will be done to make sure all activities related to Go Live have been performed and system is ready to go in Production.\n6. Support after Go Live\nTo support the users after Go Live, helpdesk will be established. All the calls from users will be received by helpdesk and issues will be categorized into HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW. After creating the ticket support desk will assigned it to the respective team (FI, CO, MM, SD, BW) for the solution. Support team will then look into the issue based on priority.\n\n\nSAP Cutover Planning and Execution activities are organized and managed under the below mentioned categories:\nSystem Build (technical and functional)\nData Migration/Validation\nBusiness Preparation\nLegacy Integration/Shutdown\nBusiness Startup Activities\n\n\nSystem Build\nincludes the following activities:\nTechnical/Infrastructure Build\nBuild Production Environment\nConnectivity to Middleware, Bolt-ons, Legacy environments\nFunctional Build\nApply all Transports (configuration, security, deployment)\nPerform manual steps\nData Migration & Validation\nincludes the following activities:\nData accuracy testing\nExtract and Transform data\nLoad master data into production with end user sign-off\nLoad transaction data into production and reconcile with end user sign-off\nBusiness Preparation\nincludes the following activities:\nBusiness activities and procedures in support of the Cutover process e.g.\n-- last processing of business transactions\n-- inventory procedures, etc.\nLegacy Integration/Shutdown\nincludes the following activities:\nLegacy System freeze schedules\nShutdown and decommissioning procedures\nLegacy Interface re-pointing\nBusiness Startup Activities\nincludes the following activities:\nRestarting the business based on the new solution (processes, data, technology)\nFocused on key identified areas\n\n\nWhat is meant by cut off date?\nSAP system is configured as per the requirement of the client. The system is ready for the client to use. The client now needs to migrate from the Old system (Legacy system) to the new SAP system. The migration from the old system to the new system is known as cut off date. The old system is switched off and the new SAP system is switched on. The data will be migrated from the old system to SAP. The data will henceforth be entered in the new SAP system. To have a smooth switch over from the Legacy system to the new SAP systems are devised the cut off procedure.",

The objective of ITGCs is to ensure the integrity of the data and processes the systems support.\n\n\nDifferent types of Auditors?\nInternal Auditors - Internal auditors are employed by the organizations they audit. These auditors can review the performance of employees, compliance with company standards and financial and accounting systems. Internal auditors allow company leaders to be informed of what is happening within the company and to deal with problems or concerns in advance. The internal auditor then writes a report highlighting the issues and recommending remedies. Hence these are employees of the company’s management and are thus not considered independent auditors.\nExternal Auditors - The role of an external auditor is to determine whether the books of accounts have been adequately managed. Whether the annual financial statements provide an accurate and realistic picture of the entity’s financial situation. An external auditor’s report is crucial because it includes the auditor’s assessment of the company’s integrity. Both stakeholders, including the general public, are given access to the annual financial statements and the auditor’s report. An external auditor’s opinion is unbiased and pure. Specifically for the purpose of determining whether or not a corporation is being truthful to its shareholders\n\n\nAudit Objective Categories?\nStrategic\nOperational\nReporting\nCompliance\nAudit Principles?\nIndependence\nObjectivity\nProfessional Skepticism\nEvidence\nStandards can be referred for ITGC?\nCOBIT(Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology)\nGAIT\nITIL(Information Technology Infrastructure Library)\nCMM(Capability Maturity Model)\nISO 27000",

It is a new product, built entirely on one of the most advanced in-memory platforms today – SAP HANA® – and incorporates modern design principles through the SAP Fiori user experience (UX). SAP S/4HANA delivers massive simplifications (customer adoption, data model, user experience, decision making, business processes and models) and innovations (Internet of Things, Big Data, business networks, and mobile-first) to help businesses Run Simple in the digital economy.\nThere are redundant object models in the traditional ERP system. Here the vendor master and\ncustomer master is used. The (mandatory) target approach in S/4HANA is the Business Partner approach. Business Partner is now capable of centrally managing master data for business partners,customers, and vendors. With current development, BP is the single point of entry to create, edit,and display master data for business partners, customers, and vendors.\nAt the same time there are several important other master data changes making the application simple lean and easy to maintain.\nThis course exclusively discusses Simplifications taken up by SAP related to master data. At the end of this course you will gain knowledge on data transformation, need, requirements and care to be taken for a flawless system transformation.",

      "description": "SAP has renamed SAP NetWeaver Exchange Infrastructure -- SAP NetWeaver XI -- as SAP NetWeaver Process Integration (SAP NetWeaver PI). NetWeaver PI serves as the integration engine for SAP's implementation of SOA middleware. With NetWeaver PI, SAP has included pre-built integrations for connecting SAP systems to each other and to non-SAP systems. But many SAP users are still not sure what the difference is between NetWeaver PI and NetWeaver XI.\nSAP calls XI an integration mediator between entities with varying requirements in terms of connectivity, format, and protocols. According to SAP, XI reduces integration costs by providing a common repository for interfaces. The central component of SAP XI is the SAP Integration Server, which facilitates interaction between diverse operating systems and applications across internal and external networked computer systems.\nThe components of the SAP XI system are available via a web interface for configuration, integration design, system landscape definition and integration server monitoring.\nSAP NetWeaver Process Integration (SAP PI) is SAP's enterprise application integration (EAI) software, a component of the NetWeaver product group used to facilitate the exchange of information among a company's internal software and systems and those of external parties. Before the current version, SAP PI was called SAP Exchange Infrastructure (SAP XI). Like other NetWeaver components, SAP PI is compatible with software products of other companies.\nSAP calls PI an integration broker because it mediates between entities with varying requirements in terms of connectivity, format, and protocols. According to SAP, PI reduces the TCO by providing a common repository for interfaces. The central component of SAP PI is the SAP Integration Server, which facilitates interaction between diverse operating systems and applications across internal and external networked computer systems.\nPI is built upon the SAP Web Application Server.\nFirst release of SAP Exchange Infrastructure was XI 2.0. Later on, releases 3.0, 7.0, 7.1, 7.1 EHP1 and 7.3 followed. From release 7.0 onwards, SAP Exchange Infrastructure has been renamed as SAP Process Integration (SAP PI).\nSAP PI / XI is SAP's middleware technology ( Formerly known as SAP XI or Exchange Infrastructure ). XI is used to connect SAP with different non-SAP SAP systems. There are built-in adapters that can directly connect SAP to other standard third party systems with minimum customization involved. It relies heavily on SAP's Netweaver Platform. For SAP Training, Remote SAP Access\n5 Reasons for using SAP NetWeaver Process Integration 7.1\nUse Process Integration as an SOA backbone\nEstablish ES Repository as the central SOA repository in customer landscapes\nLeverage support of additional WS standards such as UDDI, WS-BPEL and tasks, WS-RM\nEnable high-volume and mission-critical integration scenarios\nBenefit from new functionality such as principal propagation, XML validation and BAM capabilities",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP S/4HANA EWM (Extended Warehouse Management) course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP S/4HANA EWM (Extended Warehouse Management) is a module built on SAP S/4HANA infrastructure and allows customers to take advantage of the higher processing power of SAP HANA and lower the total cost of ownership compared to using standalone or decentralized EWM.\nSAP EWM (Extended Warehouse Management) module is used to efficiently & effectively manage the inventory in a warehouse. It is also used for supporting the processing of goods movement. SAP EWM allows the company to control its warehouses' inbound and outbound processes and movement of goods in the warehouse. The main process in a warehouse is to manage the incoming and outgoing materials, goods receipt and goods issue, fulfill customer orders, and distribution of goods. SAP EWM application module is one of the leading warehousing applications available worldwide for enterprises both large and small in size.\nWith the help of SAP EWM, all the goods movements are controlled by a warehouse management system and provides the warehouse managers/supervisors the tools to monitor warehouse activities. Additional functions in the warehouse can also be managed through SAP S/4HANA EWM and these are for e.g. creating a serial number, batch number, vendor management inventory, resource optimization, and value-added services. SAP Extended Warehouse Management allows you to not only monitor the quantity of goods in warehouse but to manage other critical functions and delivery of goods efficiently.\nThe basic embedded EWM functionality is available to anyone with an SAP S/4HANA license, with advanced features available via an additional license. In Q4/2016, SAP EWM became an embedded application component within SAP S/4HANA.\nAs SAP S/4HANA is the next generation of ERP to modernize for digital businesses, SAP's business solutions are consumed as part of the SAP S/4HANA giving more choice to customers, allowing true hybrid scenarios and incremental deployments. With the release of EWM over S/4HANA platform, both basic warehousing and extended warehouse management are running on a common code base embedded in SAP S/4HANA. Thus in essence, the SAP EWM is now available as an embedded application in SAP S/4HANA and combines best-in-class proven warehouse management capabilities with the benefits of S/4 HANA.\nS4HANA EWM comes with a set of new features for warehouse management in different deployment options. These include new and improved Fiori apps for picking, packing and warehouse KPIs, as well as improved stock consolidation and physical inventory. With the powerful new release, you can now extend your visibility immensely and provide employees and customers with real-time insights into your operations.\nTechnically, the simplified integration of the embedded EWM within the on-premise edition of S/4HANA is reached by the adoption of a unified data model (that is, new product code line). The goal is to simplify the data model as much as possible. The primary simplifications include the following:\nCore Interface is not used any more for master data including a business partner, material master and batch.\nRedundant customizing tables are eliminated.\nDirect read of actual data in SAP S/4HANA is realized instead of replication, for example, material values, accounting objects, purchase\norders, production orders, etc.\n\n\nAdvantages of SAP S/4HANA Embedded EWM\nThe organizations may choose embedded EWM for a number of reasons. For small to mid-size customers, the basic functionality may be enough for their needs. For those with more advanced needs, the application of functionality to their specific business processes should be considered when choosing a license. But no matter which option is picked, those running embedded EWM benefit from ease of deployment and the lowered total cost of ownership, primarily because they only need to maintain and use a single physical system rather than multiple physical systems as in case of standalone EWM.\nA good number of embedded EWM implementations are being done worldwide and the organizations implementing the same are very much satisfied with the outcomes. Benefits listed by these clients include reduction in master data duplication, removal of additional transactional documents, and the use of advanced SAP Fiori apps available out of box.\nBy embedding EWM on SAP S/4HANA, clients could take advantage of the SAP HANA in-memory database and execute high-speed transactions for their warehousing operations. With each new version of SAP S/4HANA, more functionality was added to embedded EWM, including an ever-growing list of innovative SAP Fiori apps and a stripped-down version called stock room management.\nSAP S/4HANA Embedded EWM is the functionality that SAP offers for the management of warehouse inside the new release S/4 HANA. In terms of inventory management, SAP EWM helps to subdivide SAP Inventory Management Storage Locations in different specific bins and at the same time it offers all related functionality for the placement in Warehouses (Putaway processes) and the removal from them (Stock Removal processes).\nIt is a functionality every logistics consultant or practitioner should be aware of it.\nThe latest version i.e. SAP S/4HANA EWM 1909 provides a lot of flexibility to the users to define and manage a variety of warehousing landscapes.\n\n\nUplatz provides this extensive SAP S/4HANA EWM training covering both business and technical processes for embedded and decentralized EWM for version 1909.\nThe purpose of this training is to provide you a clear understanding of basic concepts and functionalities of SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) on S/4HANA infrastructure. This training provides building and executing end-to-end scenarios in the system.\nJoin this webinar to get a look into what is new in 1909 and learn how you can bring your supply chain to the next level with a fully integrated real-time supply chain suite.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nUnderstand Warehousing Structures and Master Data\nBasic Processes in SAP S/4HANA EWM\nUnderstand key functionalities in EWM\nWarehouse Monitoring and Processing with Mobile Devices\nAdditional Functions in SAP EWM\nWarehouse Organization\nBasic Customizing Process\nOptimization of Resources\nWarehouse Extensions\nSAP EWM Rapid-Deployment Solution\nCombined Inbound and Outbound Processes\nBuild and execute multiple end-to-end EWM scenarios\n\n\nAt the end of the course, the participants will be able to:\nDescribe the SAP Logistics Execution Process\nDefine the SAP S4H EWM Organization Structure and their relevance within the SAP EWM process\nCreate, change, display different Organization, Master and Transactional data for relevant SAP S4H EWM\nCreate, change and display SAP EWM-IM Stock splitting\nUnderstand SAP IM-EWM Interface\nCreate, change and display SAP EWM transactions\nSAP EWM End to End Scenarios independently!\n\n\nSAP S/4HANA EWM - Course Syllabus\n\n\n1.

      "description": "Üretim planlamayla ilgili genel bilgilerle başlayıp SAP' de kullanılan işlem kodları ve ekranlarda yapılan işlemleri adım adım uygulayacağız. Bu eğitim programı Üretim Planlama 'nın temel çerçevesini belirleyecek ve ileri seviyede bilgilerinizi katlayacaktır.  Yeni başlayanlar için de önemli bir kaynak olacaktır.  Ders notlarını son eğitim videosu altında bulabilirsiniz.\n\n\nSAP PP (PRODUCTİON PLANNİNG)\nÜRETİM PLANLAMA EĞİTİMİ\n\n\nÖncelikle Üretim planlama nedir, SAP ‘de nasıl uygulanır eğitimin genel kapsamından biraz bahsedelim.\nÜretim planlama, müşteri taleplerini karşılayacak ve üretim ortamındaki makine, ekipman ve işgücü gibi kaynakları kurumun performans hedefleri doğrultusunda kullanacak şekilde üretim faaliyetlerinin organize edilmesidir.\nÜretim planlama üretici kurumlar için kritik bir iş sürecidir. Bu yüzden üreticilerin hem müşteri beklentilerine, hem de kendi kurumsal hedeflerine cevap verecek şekilde tasarlanmış ve başarı ile uygulanan bir üretim planlama sürecine ihtiyacı vardır.\nHazırlanan üretim planı, üretimin çıktılarının miktar ve zamanlamasını gösteren bir projeksiyondur.\nİşletmeler için her konuda kısa, orta ve uzun vadeli planlama hayati önem taşır. Risklere karşı hazırlıklı olma, pazar payını artırma, büyüme gibi işletmeleri ilgilendiren her konuda plan yapmak ve bu planları uygulamak, diğer yönetim fonksiyonlarının başarısı için birinci şarttır. Planlama yapılması gereken konulardan biri de üretimdir.\nEn basit haliyle “Ne, ne zaman ve ne kadar üretilecek?” sorularının yanıtlarına göre hazırlanan üretim planlama, bir işletmede istenilen zamanda, miktarda ve kalitede ürün ya da hizmetin üretilmesini sağlayan süreçlerin tamamıdır. Üretim planlama doğru şekilde hazırlandığında, oluşan ve oluşacak müşteri taleplerini karşılayacak kaynakları (hammadde, üretim araçları, iş gücü vb.) etkin bir şekilde kullanmak mümkün olur..\nÜretim Planlama Aşamaları\nZaman Aralığı Belirleme\nÜretim planlama aşamalarının ilki olan bu adımda, üretimin yapılacağı zaman aralığı belirlenir.\nStok Politikalarını Belirleme\nStok maliyetini en aza indirecek stok miktarı belirlenip, emniyet stokları eklenir.\nTalep Tahmininde Bulunma\nEldeki veriler ve öngörüler ışığında, oluşabilecek talep miktarı tahmin edilir.\nDönem Başı ve Sonu Stok Miktarı Belirleme\nDönem başında depoda bulunan malzeme stokları ve henüz gelmemiş olan malzeme stokları ile dönem sonunda emniyet stoğuna ilaveten bulundurulması istenen stok miktarı belirlenir.\nÜretim Miktarı Belirleme\nPlanlama dönemi içerisinde üretilmesi gereken ürün miktarı belirlenir.\nÜretim Zamanlaması Belirleme\nBelirlenen miktardaki ürünün üretimi, dönem içerisine dağıtılır. Dağıtım sırasında tatiller, üretim hızı değişimleri, stok miktarındaki değişimler, maksimum üretim kapasitesi, arıza/tamir/bakım süreçleri gibi durumlar göz önünde bulundurulur.\n\n\nÜretim Planlama Stratejileri\nİşletme yöneticileri, üretim planlamasının doğru bir şekilde işleyebilmesi için üretim planlama stratejileri geliştirmelidirler. Geliştirecekleri strateji sayesinde aksaklıkların önüne geçerek, üretim sürecinin etkin bir şekilde tamamlanmasını sağlayabilirler.\nÜretim planlama konusunda genellikle 3 farklı strateji söz konusudur.\nTalep İzleme Stratejisi\nözellikle hızlı talep değişimi olan ürünlerde ya da sektörlerde kullanılan bu yöntemde sıfır ya da sıfıra yakın stok tutulur. Bunun yanı sıra, talep değişimlerine bağlı olarak istihdam düzeyinde değişikliğe gidilir. Bunun sonucunda, işe alım ve işten çıkarma maliyetleri diğer stratejilere göre daha yüksek olur.\nSabit Üretim Hızı Stratejisi\nAdından da anlaşılacağı gibi, üretim planlama yapılan dönem boyunca üretim hızı sabit tutulur. Bu strateji uygulandığında, üretim miktarı ile talep arasında oluşacak farklılıklar stok bulundurmadan doğan maliyetlerin artmasına neden olur. Diğer stratejilere göre daha kolay bir şekilde planlanabilmesi nedeniyle, birçok firma tarafından bu strateji kullanılır.\nKarma Üretim Stratejisi\nDaha önce bahsettiğimiz iki stratejinin dezavantajlarından kaçınmak amacıyla uygulanan stratejidir. Bu yöntemin doğru şekilde uygulanabilmesi kolay değildir çünkü çok fazla alternatif içerir. Bu yöntemi kullanan işletmeler genellikle bilgisayar programları yardımı ile süreç yönetimini tercih ederler.\n\n\nÜretim Planlamada Dikkat Edilmesi Gereken Konular\nÜretim planlamanın doğru şekilde uygulanabilmesi için işletme yöneticileri tarafından dikkat edilmesi gereken çeşitli konular vardır. Bu konular;\nHammadde, işletme malzemesi ve yardımcı malzemeleri doğru miktarda, zamanda ve yerde bulundurmak.\nİş akış şemasına uygun bir planlama ile üretim araçlarını hazırlamak.\nPiyasa şartlarına ve müşteri taleplerine uygun kalitede ürünlerin üretimi için gerekli çalışmaları yapmak.\nÜretim planından ve talep tahminlerinden yola çıkarak, işgücünü etkin bir şekilde kullanmak.\nÜretim bölümü ile işletmenin diğer bölümleri arasında koordinasyon sağlamak.\nÜretimi gerçekleşmiş ürünlerin dağıtımını sağlıklı bir şekilde gerçekleştirmek.\n\n\nSAP ‘DE ÜRETİM PLANLAMA\nSAP Üretim Planlama, ERP'deki kilit modüllerden biridir ve kapasite planlama, malzeme planlama, üretim siparişinin yürütülmesi, malzeme listesi ve mal hareketi gibi planlama süreçleriyle ilgilenir.\nBu eğitimde SAP Production Planning'in (SAP PP) temel kavramlarını: BOM, İş Merkezi, Veri Merkezi vb. Gibi SAP PP modülünü önemli bileşenlerini öğreneceğiz.\nÜretim Planlama: Bir şirketin üretimi ile ilgili tüm iş sürecini yönetir. Üretim kaynaklarını etkin ve verimli bir şekilde kullanarak, üretim ve planlama süreçlerinin sağlıklı ve koordineli bir şekilde yürütülmesi, SAP PP modülü ile gerçekleştirilmektedir.\nÜretim planlama modülü, Kesikli Üretim, Proses Tipi Üretim ve Seri Üretimi destekleyecek yapıdadır.\nSAP PP (Üretim Planlama) Malzeme İhtiyaç Planlama (MRP) gibi tüm faaliyetleri kapsayacak, Malzeme (BOM), kapasite planlama gibi üretim sürecinin akışına olanak sağlar.\nŞirketlerin en önemli faaliyetlerinden olan Planlama faaliyetlerinin yürütüleceği yapıyı da PP modülü içinde ele almak mümkündür.\nBu eğitim SAP PP hakkında çok az bilgisi olan veya hiç bilgisi olmayanlar için uygun olmakla beraber yeni başlayanlar ve ileri seviye üretim planı yapabilecek kişiler için hazırlanmıştır. Bu eğitimde en iyi şekilde yararlanmak için SAP Temelleri ve Malzeme Yönetimi-MM modülü hakkında bir ön bilgiye sahip olmanız gerekir.\nSAP Temelleri ve Malzeme Yönetimi-MM modülü ile ilgili temel düzeyden ileri seviyeye eğitimimizi ziyaret edebilirsiniz.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP Project System (PS) - Plan, Execute & Control Projects course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP Project System (SAP PS) is an integrated module within the SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system that helps organizations manage and execute large-scale projects across various industries. It is designed to facilitate comprehensive project management, covering all aspects of a project's lifecycle—from initial planning and budgeting to execution, monitoring, and final reporting. SAP PS enables seamless integration with other SAP modules such as Finance (FI), Controlling (CO), Materials Management (MM), and Sales and Distribution (SD), ensuring that project-related data is consistent and accessible across the enterprise.\nSAP Project System is a powerful tool that helps organizations manage complex projects with precision and control. Its ability to integrate with other SAP modules, combined with its comprehensive feature set, makes it an essential component for any organization looking to optimize its project management processes.\n\n\nHow SAP Project System Works\nSAP PS works by providing a framework for planning, executing, and controlling projects in a structured manner. Essentially, this is how it works:\n\n\nProject Structuring\nProjects are structured using a hierarchical model, typically divided into Project Definitions, Work Breakdown Structures (WBS), and Networks. The Project Definition acts as the umbrella under which all project activities and elements fall. WBS elements break down the project into manageable components, and Networks represent the sequence of tasks or activities required to complete the project.\nPlanning\nSAP PS allows detailed project planning, including time schedules, resource allocation, cost estimation, and budgeting. Users can plan activities, define milestones, and allocate resources such as labor, materials, and equipment. Cost planning integrates with the Controlling (CO) module to monitor financial aspects of the project.\nExecution\nDuring execution, SAP PS tracks the progress of tasks, manages resource utilization, and monitors costs against the budget. Actual data, such as labor hours worked or materials consumed, are recorded and compared with planned figures to identify variances. This helps in real-time decision-making and adjustments.\nMonitoring & Controlling\nSAP PS provides tools for monitoring the status of projects through various reports and dashboards. It tracks key performance indicators (KPIs), such as time schedules, costs, and resource usage. The system allows for early detection of issues, enabling corrective actions to keep the project on track.\nClosing & Reporting\nUpon project completion, SAP PS facilitates the closing process, including final cost settlement, delivery of results, and reporting. It generates comprehensive reports that provide insights into project performance, cost analysis, and lessons learned for future projects.\n\n\nKey Features of SAP Project System\n\n\nWork Breakdown Structure (WBS)\nThe WBS is the backbone of project structuring in SAP PS, breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and sub-tasks, making it easier to plan and control.\nNetwork and Activities\nNetworks represent the sequence of activities and their dependencies within a project. This feature allows for detailed scheduling and management of tasks, ensuring that all elements are executed in the correct order.\nCost and Revenue Management\nSAP PS integrates with FI/CO modules to track costs and revenues throughout the project lifecycle. This includes budget management, cost planning, and real-time tracking of actual costs versus planned costs.\nResource Management\nThe module allows for the allocation and tracking of resources (people, materials, equipment) needed to complete project tasks. It helps in optimizing resource utilization and reducing bottlenecks.\nMilestone Billing\nSAP PS supports milestone billing, where customers are billed at different stages of project completion. This feature is crucial for managing cash flow and ensuring timely payments.\nProject Scheduling\nAdvanced scheduling tools within SAP PS allow for detailed time management, including critical path analysis and time-related costing, to ensure projects are completed on time.\nReporting and Analytics\nSAP PS offers a wide range of standard and custom reports, including financial reports, progress reports, and variance analysis. It also integrates with SAP BI (Business Intelligence) for advanced analytics.\nIntegration with other SAP Modules\nSAP PS seamlessly integrates with other SAP modules, such as MM, SD, FI, and CO, ensuring that all aspects of the project are connected and that data flows smoothly between different functions.\nVersion Management\nThis feature allows the creation of different versions of project plans, which can be compared to track changes over time and understand their impact on the overall project.\nProject Procurement\nSAP PS integrates with Materials Management (MM) to manage procurement processes specific to projects, including purchase requisitions, orders, and vendor management.\n\n\nSAP Project System (PS) - Course Curriculum\n\n\n1.

We will learn about each phase along with key actions and activities involved in it. This will help you get a good grasp of the overall SAP Activate methodology and understand the position of the fit-to-standard workshop in it.\nThen we will learn about different types of workshops which comprise fit-to-standard workshops and how we should prepare structurally for these workshops. We will also learn about the different resources and reference materials available for fit-to-standard workshops which can help to accelerate our preparation. We will also touch on the different options to get the reference demo system for the workshop.\nAfter it, we will discuss the different types of gaps we come across in these workshops and an empirical approach to prioritise the gaps. Finally, we will learn how to conduct these workshops like an experienced consultant and drive the discussions with the business to deliver results.\nIn the concluding section, we will discuss the key activities after the fit-to-standard workshop as output and preparation for the next phase.\nSo, what are you waiting for —let's learn together and lead the workshops like a pro.",

      "description": "SAP Engineering Workbench is a great utility to provide the extra value over the traditional offerings in SAP Processes.\nYou normally define the Bills and Task Lists (Routings) in individual processes of SAP (CS01/02 and CA02/02).\nYou define component assignments to Operations and vice versa through switching between the Routing and Bill multiple times.\nYou however at any point of time, do not get the wholistic view of how your Product is structured and what sequence of steps are executed, what tools are used and which material is used in which step (Operation).\nYou are prone to make mistakes if you do not make a notes of which component to be mapped to which Operation or any other relevant transaction.\nEngineering workbench provides one interface providing wholistic picture through which you can view the Task lists, Bills and the relations between components and Operations and many other relations.\nChanges in integrated manner\nWhen you try to redesign your product you may make changes to the components of one or more products. In particular case of a specific item being upgraded and phased out by another one, the impact is on multiple parents. You may want to make the updates to all the Bills in one go. You are aware the changes can be done through Mass Changes Program. However Mass Changes program can perform one type of change at a time even though it is quite good to make that type of change in multiple bills or task lists.\nWhat if you want to make multiple changes and to multiple Bills or Task lists?\nWhat if you want to make one change to the component in one Bill and another change to the same component in a few other bills?\nWhat if you want to make the changes to task lists while the components are changed (It is quite likely that your operations will change when the corresponding Material is replaced or upgraded to different characteristics)\nEngineering Workbench helps you perform multiple actions on multiple Bills and Routings in one view.\nIn some sort of effective workaround, you can use the Workbench as a Data Extraction tool for Bills, Task lists and other relevant details of Product. You can export the data in multiple formats such as Text files, HTML, CSV and other formats according to your requirements in Data Migration and SAP Rollouts. You may use the text output as a flat file to load the data in other systems. You can use structured presentation in HTML to SMEs for review and analysis. CSV files can be compiled to the kind of form from which you can derive meaningful conclusions for your decisions. You can share the data with other relevant stakeholders with appropriate Sensitive settings.\nThis course will explain how the Engineering workbench helps you achieve the integrated Product design and changes in seamless manner.\nThe course is structured as below:\nIntroduction of Engineering Workbench\nElements of Engineering Workbench\nNavigation and cockpit overview of Engineering Workbench\nDemo\nSetup\nFinished Material Creation for Demo\nComponent Material Creation for Demo\nBill Creation and Copy to other finished Material Bills\nCreate and Copy Routing\nDemo of multiple Scenarios\nWork Area Overview\nCockpit Overview and Navigation\nChanges to Component attributes in multiple Bills\nAdd and Delete components in multiple Bills\nComponent Assignments to Operations\nMass changes to Operations of task lists\nEngineering Workbench as a Data Extraction Utility\nMulti-level Copy of BOM and Routing Headers (Added on 30th March)\nA brief on What is in S4HANA for Engineering Workbench\nDemo of a Few Flows in S4HANA\nMass Changes\nComponent Assignment Creation\nCopy BOM and Routing Headers along with Component Assignments\n\n\nWe wish you all the best.",

What are you expected to know as you join a S/4 HANA project?\nThis course cuts through all of the marketing and training hype to deliver a course that just focus on delivering the information you will require as you participate on S/4 HANA projects within the Enterprise Management area (or as it was known before, the S/4 HANA Simple Logistics)\nWhile all other courses focus on individual technical changes that can be found in the SAP simplification list or regurgitate SAP training literature, this course is the distillation of experience of the two instructors on their S/4 HANA projects. It focus on understanding S/4 HANA core changes, how to find out more on S/4 HANA and more importantly, how to leverage these changes in the new SAP S/4 HANA environment.\nNote : This course does not cover each change item in the simplification list, but rather a introductions to the core changes of S/4 HANA\nBecause it is built on the experience of our instructors, this represents unique context on S/4 that cannot be anywhere else.\nIn this course, the instructors will cover\nWhat is S/4 HANA, and how do you get access to SAP trail version\nWhat has changed in S/4 and what can be leverage.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP EWM (Extended Warehouse Management) course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP EWM (Extended Warehouse Management) is a unified software solution by SAP for flexible, automated support for processing various goods movement and managing stock in the warehouse. EWM module supports users with planned and efficient processing of complex logistics processes.\nSAP EWM brings together maximum functionality and comprehensive process support for all types of warehouses, and is thus one of the most powerful software suites for warehouse management and control worldwide.\nThe principal components within SAP EWM (SAP Extended Warehouse Management) include warehouse management (SAP Extended Warehouse Management) and material flow control (SAP Material Flow System).\nIn complex warehouse and distribution centers the classic basic functionality of a warehouse management system is no longer sufficient – such as support of goods-in and goods-out, replenishment and inventory management. Additional functions supporting complex processes are required, such as cross-docking, returns processing, additional logistics services, and multi-customer warehouses. Also, mapping material flow components with direct link to the programmable logic controllers is becoming increasingly important. In addition, to counter the cost pressures, resource and labor management functionality is required.\nThe performance of SAP EWM goes beyond the existing and widely available SAP WM module. SAP EWM is part of SAP Supply Chain Management (SAP SCM) and supports inventory management and movement of goods in warehouses. The multi-client warehouse management solution was designed for large distribution centers with complex and highly automated processes. Inventory management and goods movements are closely linked. A warehouse can be mapped in the system down to storage bin level. The affiliation to SAP SCM has the advantage of a strong integration in supply chain planning, collaboration, and supply chain visibility.\n\n\nUplatz provides in-depth training on SAP EWM module with detailed practical sessions and hands-on demonstration of industry scenarios on SAP EWM S/4HANA application module.\n\n\nSAP EWM course curriculum\n\n\n1.

SAP EWM is similar to SAP WM but it provides more features like picking, put away, RF framework, Warehouse structure and more flexible options to manage the warehouse functions.\nYou can create new elements like an activity area, resources, labor management and work centers in SAP EWM which were not available in WM.\nSAP EWM provides more a robust solution to manage warehouse functions in an organization. It is also a part of SAP Supply Chain Management and also supports all the processes within logistics and supply chain.",

      "description": "SAP consultants earn an average of $133,797 per year—it’s one of the most rewarding careers in tech.\nSAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition is one of the most talked-about solutions in enterprise software today. Yet, let’s be honest—it’s also one of the most misunderstood.\nI’ve been there.\nThat's why I spent months crafting this course: to peel back the layers of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. I wanted to demystify how it actually works—beneath the surface.\nThis course is for the thinkers.\nThe ones who don’t settle for “just follow the config guide.”\nThe ones who ask, “What’s really happening behind the Launchpad?”\nThe ones who question, “How does a public cloud ERP adapt to unique business needs?”\nThey want to know why the system feels lightning fast one day, and sluggish the next.\nThey want to understand how SAP rolls out updates to thousands of clients without breaking customizations.\nThey want to know what “RISE with SAP” really means beyond the sales pitch.\nThey care about process, architecture, transparency—and unlocking the power of SAP, not just surviving it.\nBecause once you understand what SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition is really doing, you stop fighting it—and start designing systems that flow with it.\nWhy SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition?\nSAP S/4HANA Cloud is the cutting-edge, intelligent ERP platform that enables businesses to operate more effectively, leveraging AI-driven insights and automation. By choosing the Public Edition, you embrace a streamlined, cost-effective solution with continuous updates—no need to manage on-premise infrastructure. We break down the complexities so you can harness this technology quickly.\nGet Instant Access to:\n6+ hours of easy-to-follow video lessons\nStep-by-step demos showcasing real SAP environments\nDownloadable resources (checklists, flowcharts, and more)\nExpert instructor support for your questions and challenges\nPractical, Project-Based Learning\nThis course isn’t just about theory. You’ll get hands-on practice with:\nLive demos on key functionality—like accessing the free trial and configuring business roles\nRealistic case studies to understand how SAP S/4HANA Cloud fits into various industries\nScalable best practices for organizations of all sizes and structures\nHere’s what we unpack in this course:\nThe Architecture of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition\nWe start from the top—what makes this cloud ERP different? How is the public edition architected for scalability, performance, and global rollout? What happens when you click a tile on the Launchpad?\nInternals That Matter\nWe go one layer deeper. Learn how business configuration works under the hood. See how Identity and Access Management is wired. Understand how roles are composed, not hardcoded. Appreciate how the Fiori Launchpad space is more than just a UI—it's your access gateway to powerful microservices.\nPerformance and Integration\nYou’ll learn how the system handles real-world integrations with third-party tools. How business events are triggered. How to migrate legacy data without chaos. And how SAP Central Business Configuration keeps everything aligned—even across global rollouts.\nReal Projects, Real Problems\nWe don’t just show slides. You’ll configure roles, assign apps, adapt interfaces, and deploy changes—all in a real SAP system. You’ll walk through guided demos and case studies to see how the cloud ERP responds in different industries.\nOptimization & Strategy\nOnce you understand the system, you’ll start seeing patterns. Bottlenecks. Best practices. You’ll learn how to structure your organizational elements, manage testing, handle upgrades, and most importantly—train users to get the best out of the system.\nIf you’ve ever asked questions like:\nWhy can’t I customize the backend like I used to in ECC?\nWhat’s the difference between SAP Activate and Accelerated SAP?\nHow do I balance flexibility with governance in a multi-tenant cloud?\nWhy does SAP push “Fit-to-Standard” so hard—and what does it actually mean for our business?\nThen this course is for you.\nIt’s not for those who just want to tick the project checklist. It’s for those who want to understand ERP as a system—not a black box.\nPrerequisites?\nIf you know the basics of ERP or have worked with SAP before—even just a bit—you’re good to go. And if you’re brand new? Don’t worry—we guide you from the fundamentals up to advanced integration scenarios.\nThis course is your deep dive into how SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition works, and why it was designed this way.\nBy the end, you’ll be ready to design, implement, and extend cloud ERP like a pro—with clarity, confidence, and control.\nReady to stop guessing and start understanding?\nLet’s get started.",

Regular Function Module\nThis is the standard and most common type of Function Module. It is executed synchronously in the same work process as the calling program. The program waits until the Function Module has finished its execution before continuing.\n2. Remote-Enabled Function Module (RFC)\nThese Function Modules can be called from other SAP systems or even non-SAP systems. They are the backbone of communication and integration between different systems. To make a Function Module remote-enabled, the \"Remote-Enabled Module\" processing type must be selected in its attributes. This is the foundation for BAPIs (Business Application Programming Interfaces).\n3. Update Function Module\nUpdate Function Modules are designed to perform database updates in a separate update work process. They are not executed immediately when called. Instead, they are registered for execution and are triggered by a COMMIT WORK statement. This ensures that database changes are bundled into a single Logical Unit of Work (LUW), maintaining data consistency. There are two types of update modules:\nV1 (Primary) Update: These are critical updates that are processed first.\nV2 (Secondary) Update: These are less critical updates that are processed after all V1 modules have been successfully completed",

      "description": "Poor performance of custom ABAP programs in an SAP system can have a significant impact on the overall productivity of a company. It is crucial to ensure the efficiency of these programs to maintain optimal system performance, and this can be achieved by tuning them from various aspects.\nOne of the most critical aspects of tuning custom ABAP programs is data selection from the database. When retrieving data from the database, it is essential to use efficient query statements to minimize the amount of data retrieved. Additionally, data management in the application server is also vital in achieving program efficiency. Managing data properly can significantly reduce the processing time required for a program to run.\nAnother crucial aspect of tuning custom ABAP programs is using optimized commands in the source code. This involves understanding the various ABAP commands and their performance implications, and choosing the most efficient commands for a given task. Additionally, program design and architecture can also have a significant impact on performance, and this course will cover best practices for program design and architecture to improve performance.\nIn this course, you will learn how to identify performance issues in custom ABAP programs and apply the appropriate optimization techniques to solve them.

      "description": "You are interested in learning SAP ABAP and getting into the wide realm of programming and intense Tech Entrepreneurship. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning SAP ABAP (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to program is \"to program\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP ABAP and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP ABAP. Even though SAP ABAP can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word \"SAP\" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).\nIn this course, I will walk you though SAP ABAP Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the program SAP ABAP, but also what the crux of programming is in terms of how we solve problems programmatically and harness the POWER of SAP ABAP.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP ABAP programming and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the most powerful language: SAP ABAP.",

Asset Accounting is classified as a subset of Financial Accounting and serves as a subsidiary ledger to the general ledger providing detailed information on transactions involving fixed assets.\nSAP Asset Accounting is also called as sub ledger accounting and is one of the important sub-modules of SAP Financial Accounting (SAP FICO) module. The main purpose of asset accounting is to determine the exact value of the fixed assets owned by the company as on a particular date.\nIn SAP Accounting powered by SAP HANA only new Asset Accounting is available with new General Ledger Accounting. For you to be able to use new Asset Accounting, you need to have activated and set up the General Ledger Accounting (FI-GL) (New) application component.\n\n\nUplatz offers this extensive course on Asset Accounting in SAP.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP MM Integration with all SAP modules (FI PP PM QM SD WM) course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP MM (Materials Management) module integrates well with other SAP modules viz.\nSAP PP (Production Planning)\nSAP SD (Sales and Distribution)\nSAP WM (Warehouse Management)\nSAP FICO (Finance and Controlling)\nSAP QM (Quality Management)\nSAP PM (Plant Maintenance)\nUplatz provides this dedicated training focusing on SAP MM module's integration with other SAP modules.\nLearn step-by-step how to allow data flow and control flow between SAP MM and other SAP modules viz. PP, SD, WM, FICO, QM, PM.\nSAP MM is one of the critical components in SAP ECC. Part of SAP ECC's logistics function, SAP MM plays a vital role in a manufacturer's supply chain and integrates with other ECC components like Production Planning (PP), Sales and Distribution (SD), Plant Maintenance (PM), Quality Management (QM), Finance (FI), Controlling (CO), and Asset Management (AM).\n\n\nMM with PP module - SAP MM deals with the material procurement on the basis of Production required, therefore it is linked with PP module. It is integrated in the area like MRPs, Receipt and Issue material against Production Order.\nMaterial Requirement Planning is based on Stocks, expected receipts, expected issues. It generates planned orders or purchase requisitions which can be converted into Purchase Order/ Contract. Inventory Management is responsible for the staging of the components required for production orders.The receipt of the finished products in the warehouse is posted in Inventory Management.\n\n\nMM with SD module - SAP SD module is proportionally linked with MM module because it uses the information of the material when creation of sales order or when the quantity sent for production.\nIt is integrated in the area like Delivery, Availability Check, Stock Transfer Requirements etc. As soon as the Sales order is created, can initiate a dynamic availability check of stock on hand.When the delivery is created, the quantity to be delivered is marked as schedule for delivery. It is deducted from the total stock when the goods issue is posted. PO can be directly converted to delivery for a stock transfer requirement.\n\n\nMM with WM module - The SAP WM module is related to MM module because it maintains information about the material storage and material transfer inside the organization.\n\n\nMM with FICO module - The FI module is linked with MM module because every operation performed in MM Module like Goods Receipt and Invoice Receipt directly impact the financial operation of the organization.\nIt is integrated in the area like Material Valuation, Vendor Payment, Material Costing, etc.Whenever inventory posting are debited, it updates the G/L Accounts online in the background. Logistic Invoice Verification will vendor liability in vendor account immediately on posting the document. Any advance given again update the PO History. For every Inventory Posting is corresponding CO document to update profit center accounting reporting Finished Goods costing is link through MM and PP. Procurement of capital item cost can be directly booked against asset number.\n\n\nMM with QM Module - The MM module is integrated with QM for Quality Inspection at Goods Receipt.\nIn the case of goods movement, the system determines whether the material is subject to an inspection operation. If so, a corresponding activity is initiated for the movement in the Quality Management System. Based on quality parameters vendor evaluation is done.\n\n\nMM with PM module - The material/service requirement is mentioned in Maintenance Order. This leads to generation of PR. This PR is converted to PO by MM. The goods for a PO will be in warded to Maintenance by MM. The spares which were reserved for maintenance order will be issued by MM against the reservation number.\n\n\nFollowing are the main components of SAP MM that are closely integrated with other SAP modules in order to allow smooth flow of information between the different processes involved in an organization.\nPurchasing - allow user to control the entire purchasing process\nInventory Management - allow users to keep track of the material in stock. It also helps user to perform operation like Goods Receipt, Goods Issue and Physical Stock Transfer\nInvoice Verification - allow users to verify invoice from vendor. The invoices compared with Purchase Order and Goods Receipt in the following three ways:- Content, Price and Quantity\nPhysical Inventory - allow users to keep track of the material stored in an organization\nValuation - allow users to calculate the value of all fixed and current assets, along with all payable, at a certain time and with the legal appropriate legal requirements.\nMaterial Requirement Planning - it helps user to create a material procurement plan for a plant and company\nMaterial Master - helps user to manage all the materials related data.\nService Master - helps an organization keep records of the services that is procures\nForeign Trade / Customs - allow users to manage the export and import merchandise among different custom territories.",

It brings together the detailed segmentation of market segments from costing-based CO-PA and the integrated financial structure from account-based CO-PA. This development ensures a seamless integration with the General Ledger (GL) and offers a high degree of transparency and flexibility in profitability reporting.\nBenefits of cPA:\nReconciliation with the GL: Since cPA integrates information from the FI General Ledger, reconciliation issues are vastly reduced, which was a significant challenge in costing-based CO-PA.\nCurrency Flexibility: cPA offers multi-currency types, similar to the capabilities in the FINSC_LEDGER.\nDetailed Reporting: With the multiple quantity view, businesses can evaluate profitability from various angles.\nReal-time Insight: The availability of CO-PA documents at the Sales Order Delivery time ensures timely insights into profitability.\nImplementation in Key Modules:\nMaterials Management (MM) - Procure to Pay Process:\nPurchase Order Creation: When a PO is created, conditions that are relevant for profitability (like surcharges or discounts) are captured for cPA.\nGoods Receipt: On posting a goods receipt, inventory value gets updated, and simultaneously the corresponding CO-PA segment is updated based on the conditions captured during the PO.\nInvoice Verification: On verifying an invoice, any variances from the PO conditions update the profitability segment.\nSales and Distribution (SD):\nSales Order Creation: cPA captures sales conditions relevant for profitability (e.g., discounts, surcharges).\nDelivery: With every goods issue against a delivery, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) is posted, updating the CO-PA segment.\nBilling: When an invoice is released to accounting, revenue postings in the GL are replicated in the CO-PA segment, capturing the profitability.\nProduction Planning (PP):\nProduction Order Creation: At this stage, the expected costs are captured.\nActivity Confirmation: On confirming activities, actual costs are recorded. These get captured in cPA against the relevant profitability segment.\nGoods Receipt: On posting the final product receipt against a production order, the inventory gets updated, and the CO-PA segment records the change in value.\nVariance Calculation and Settlement: At month-end, variances between actual and standard costs are computed and are posted to the respective profitability segments in cPA.\nFinancial Accounting (FI):\nDirect Postings: Any direct financial postings that have a relevance for profitability (e.g., certain expenses or revenues) will have a corresponding update in the CO-PA segment, ensuring that cPA provides a complete picture of profitability.\nIn Conclusion:\nCombined Profitability Analysis (cPA) offers businesses a unified platform to evaluate their profitability from both a market perspective (like product lines, customers, regions) and a financial perspective. By integrating key processes from MM, SD, PP, and FI, cPA ensures that profitability insights are timely, accurate, and fully reconcilable with the General Ledger, thereby giving businesses a powerful tool to drive their decision-making and strategy.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP Basis Administration with S/4HANA course by Uplatz.\n\n\nWhat is SAP Basis?\n\n\nSAP Basis is the technical foundation layer that enables all SAP applications (like SAP ERP, SAP S/4HANA, SAP CRM, etc.) to function.\nThe term “Basis” stands for Business Application Software Integrated Solution.\nIt acts as a middleware between the operating system, database, network, and the SAP applications, ensuring that the system runs efficiently, securely, and without downtime.\nIn simple terms:\nIf SAP were a house, SAP Basis would be the plumbing, wiring, and foundation — you don’t see it, but without it, nothing works.\n\n\nWhat Does SAP Basis Do?\n\n\nAn SAP Basis administrator is responsible for:\nInstalling and configuring SAP systems.\nManaging user access and authorizations to ensure security.\nMonitoring system health and performance to prevent downtime.\nManaging transports to move changes from development to production environments.\nPerforming upgrades and applying patches to keep systems up to date.\nIntegrating SAP with other systems using RFC (Remote Function Call) and other interfaces.\nHandling backups, restores, and disaster recovery to protect business data.\nSupporting database and OS-level operations for SAP environments.\n\n\nKey Features of SAP Basis\n\n\nSAP System Installation & Configuration\nSetting up new SAP systems (ECC, S/4HANA, BW, etc.) and configuring them to meet business needs.\nClient Administration\nCreating, copying, deleting, and maintaining SAP clients for different business purposes.\nUser & Authorization Management\nManaging user IDs, roles, and permissions to ensure data security.\nTransport Management System (TMS)\nMoving configuration changes and developments between SAP landscapes (Dev → QA → Prod).\nSystem Monitoring & Health Checks\nUsing transaction codes and monitoring tools to track system performance and prevent issues.\nBackground Job Scheduling\nAutomating processes like data uploads, reports, or batch programs.\nKernel & Patch Upgrades\nApplying system updates for new features, bug fixes, and security patches.\nRFC & Connectivity Management\nSetting up connections for data exchange between SAP systems or with external systems.\nDatabase Administration Support\nMonitoring and tuning the SAP database (including HANA) for performance.\nPerformance Tuning\nOptimizing memory usage, database queries, and response times.\nDisaster Recovery & Backup Management\nEnsuring business continuity by managing data backups and recovery processes.\nS/4HANA Administration\nPerforming HANA-specific tasks like memory management, delta merges, and system upgrades.\n\n\nWhat is SAP Basis Administration with S/4HANA?\n\n\nSAP Basis Administration is the technical administration of SAP systems — covering installation, configuration, user management, performance monitoring, upgrades, and troubleshooting.\nWhen we say “with S/4HANA”, it means that this administration is being done on SAP’s next-generation ERP platform — SAP S/4HANA — which runs exclusively on the high-performance SAP HANA in-memory database.\nIn other words:\nTraditional SAP Basis administrators managed SAP ERP systems running on various databases like Oracle, MS SQL, or DB2.\nSAP Basis with S/4HANA administrators manage modern SAP systems that run on HANA and take advantage of its speed, advanced analytics, and simplified data model.\n\n\nWhy It’s Different from Traditional SAP Basis\n\n\nHANA-Specific Administration Skills\nYou need to understand HANA database administration, memory management, delta merges, and in-memory optimization.\nNew Tools and Interfaces\nUse of HANA Studio, HANA Cockpit, and Fiori-based administration apps instead of only SAP GUI.\nUpgrades and Migrations\nKnowledge of S/4HANA version upgrades and migration from ECC to S/4HANA.\nPerformance Tuning on HANA\nDifferent tuning methods compared to traditional databases because HANA is columnar and in-memory.\n\n\nKey Responsibilities of an SAP Basis Administrator in an S/4HANA Environment\n\n\nSystem Installation & Configuration for S/4HANA environments.\nHANA Database Administration (monitoring, backups, recovery, memory optimization).\nSystem Performance Monitoring using HANA Cockpit and Solution Manager.\nS/4HANA Upgrades & Patching for both application and database layers.\nUser, Role & Authorization Management for Fiori and SAP GUI users.\nTransport Management in an S/4HANA landscape.\nRFC Connections & Integration Setup for cloud and hybrid environments.\nDisaster Recovery & High Availability setup for HANA-based systems.\nDaily Health Checks (CPU, memory, disk, jobs, database health).\n\n\nKey Features / Skills Gained in SAP Basis with S/4HANA\n\n\nEnd-to-End S/4HANA Installation (application + database).\nHANA Studio & HANA Cockpit Administration.\nMemory Management & Delta Merge Optimization.\nS/4HANA Version Upgrade & Migration.\nKernel & Patch Management for HANA systems.\nTransport Management System (TMS) in HANA.\nHigh Availability & Disaster Recovery for HANA.\nPerformance Tuning in S/4HANA

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP BW course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP BW (Business Warehouse) is an end-to-end data warehousing solution from SAP with multiple features and functionality. The emerging requirements for storage and use of huge and important data has resulted in great demand for certified SAP BW professionals.\nSAP BW is a data warehouse tool/application. In simple terms, it integrates data from different sources, transforms and consolidates, cleanse and stores data as well. It also includes data modeling, administration and staging area. The content-rich SAP BW sets a precedent for speed and ease of implementation and maintenance because it’s pre-configured with intelligence about a company’s business process, providing a faster return on information. SAP BW remains open to the different source systems and is known for its ease of introduction and maintenance.\nSAP Netweaver Business Warehouse (SAP NetWeaver BW) is the name of the Business Intelligence, analytical, reporting and Data Warehousing solution produced by SAP AG.

SAP BW supports better business decision-making and can be called a decision support system (DSS). Though the term SAP business intelligence is sometimes used as a synonym for competitive intelligence, because they both support decision making, SAP BW (Business Warehouse) uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors.\nOrganizations have different kinds of data such as finance, Human resource, customer, supplier data etc., which can be stored on different kinds of storage units such as DBMS, Excel sheets, SAP R/3 systems etc. Even the company's internal data is often distributed across many different systems and is not particularly well formatted. A Data Warehouse can help to organize the data. It brings together heterogeneous Data Sources which are mostly and differing in their details. Using BI Tools one can derive meaningful reports.\nThe demand from end user companies needing expertise in the integration of ERP data into corporate data warehouses is growing exponentially. Thus has resulted in great opportunities for certified SAP BW professionals in defining their career path.\nUplatz provides this end-to-end training on SAP BW module. This training will put you on the path to becoming a highly proficient SAP BI/BW Analyst.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP BPC 11.1 Embedded course by Uplatz.\n\n\nThe BPC model used in SAP BPC embedded is a model centered on Business Warehouse-Integrated Planning. The BPC embedded model is diverse from the Standard model. This model comprises of data access to all community employers. The data provided by this model is at various levels and it can lead the transactional data. The transactional data is provided from host EDW environment and can be accessed by the application. By using the embedded model in BPC user can easily access the transactional and master data within the host BW. This data is organized by the administrator group and can be shared with many other users. With integration in BPC it can provision the use of real- time info providers. It can also support the aggregation levels. In the BPC embedded model one can perform BW Queries into the SAP EPM for MS Office. The embedded model also runs audit functions which further permits to create audit reports.\nWith BPC embedded you can rapidly build a team and thus allows you to quickly scale a project. The embedded BPC also permits to run on a HANA Database that means Embedded planning functions run directly in the HANA database, as opposed to Standard functions.

And if the enhancement is not enough , we can do modification .\n\nWhat is modification ?, Modification in SAP is adding or modifying the logic of standard program by modifying SAP standard object. Actually the modifications to sap standard object is not recommended, but there are several modification that is allowed by SAP . one of them is user exit . And if the modification to sap standard object is not enough and there is no standard program to fulfill customers need, we can develop new z program or we usually say customer development .\n\nIn this tutorial we not only learn about the theory of enhancement & modification in SAP , but we also do real enhancement and modification to sap standard program such as adding screen exit in SAP Standard Purchase Order, Modifying the logic of SD Sales Order programs, adding fields to accounting document and so on .\nOK, Enjoy the tutorial .",

      "description": "You are interested in learning SAP BW and getting into the wide realm of prograing and intense Tech Entrepreneurship. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning SAP BW (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to program is \"to program\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP BW and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP BW. Even though SAP BW can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word \"SAP\" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).\nIn this course, I will walk you though SAP BW Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the program SAP BW, but also what the crux of programming is in terms of how we solve problems programmtically and harness the POWER of SAP BW.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP BW programming and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the most powerful language: SAP BW.",

      "description": "Logistics management is the part of the supply chain process that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective flow and storage of goods, services, and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption to meet customer requirement.  When done right, supply chain and logistics management ca be a harmonious symphony of vendors, truck and warehouses. All parts work together to ensure the product is delivered undamaged, on time and to the customer. On the other hand, an incoherent, poorly planned and ineffective supply chain can potentially deal a fatal blow to the average small and medium-size company. Products lost in transit, sent to the wrong location and unexplained charges on customer receipts can all cause angst that's strong enough to push customers to the competitor.\nThe principal purpose of logistics is to get merchandise from one location to another. However, beyond this basic goal, you must determine what your overarching business strategy and defined your logistics goals accordingly. Do you intend to offer the best delivery times in the market? Would you want to be the one that charges the least?\nWhat ever your target, there'll be a price to pay. The key is striking the right balance. For example, if you want faster delivery times, you'll likely need to spend above average on transportation. If you want to be the low cost provider, you'll have to identify non-core expenses to cut back on, even if this come at the price of longer lead times. Careful logistics management ensures greater customer satisfaction. Investing in the latest technology is critical for keeping your organization efficiency high. As technology improves it brings businesses new methods for streamlining logistics and completing processes faster.",

      "description": "You are interested in learning SAP SD and getting into the wide realm of programming and intense Tech Entrepreneurship. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning SAP SD (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to catch up is \"to work on it\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of SAP SD and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in SAP SD. Even though SAP SD can open the door to working with SAP HANA, SAP FIORI, and SAP BASIS and basically everything else with the word \"SAP\" attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced SAP (whether it be just programming logic...classes....backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Dictionaries).\nIn this course, I will walk you though SAP SD Installation, and you will learn about data structures (we hear a lot about data, but how do we store it?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to the program SAP SD, but also what the crux of programming is in terms of how we solve problems programmatically and harness the POWER of SAP SD.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of SAP SD finance and I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the SAP world with the most SAP Module: SAP SD.",

      "description": "SAP S/4Hana migration is done with enterprise architecture tools using the Greenfield, Brownfield, or combination of both approaches. The Greenfield approach means that companies abandon their existing ERP system and build a completely new one through migration.\n\n\nSAP S/4HANA Migration Options\nAlthough experts at SAP and other tech leaders can reel off quite a few ways of handling a switch to SAP 4/HANA, three are more commonly recommended than the others.\n1. Greenfield Approach\nOne option isn’t really a migration option. Instead, it’s an implementation of S/4HANA from the ground up.\n“Greenfield” is a term adopted from architectural and environmental engineering that means starting fresh on land that has no previous construction. For S/4HANA specifically, it means either migrating data only or no migration at all. You retire legacy customizations and work to streamline processes.\n2. Full Migration\nA full migration approach is a complete conversion of an existing SAP system to SAP S/4HANA, a method often referred to as “lift-and-shift.”\nThis scenario involves using SAP Software Update Manager with a database migration option for any enterprise not using SAP HANA as their database. To address application customization, enterprises can use SAP cloud and SAP partner development tools.\n3. Hybrid Migration\nIn a hybrid migration, organizations need to analyze the current SAP system and identify the customized applications, functionality, and interfaces that are not part of the core.\nBefore the migration, enterprises can use a low-code platform to develop the non-vanilla pieces and applications used by the system. By doing that work in advance, the SAP core is kept clean to make the migration easier.\nAfterwards, your business is using S/4HANA for what SAP does best—enterprise resource planning—and other apps for what it doesn’t do best.\nWhich Option Is the Best?\nThe answer to this question is that each option is best for particular types of enterprises and their current SAP systems.\nEnterprises With Decades-Old SAP Systems\nPrior to the pandemic, if enterprises had SAP systems that were 20 years old or more, greenfield was likely to be the best option due to the complexity caused by age and years of customizing. They could use the shift to technology as a springboard for redefining their processes from scratch.\nBut due to the issue of remote work, very few have embarked in lift and shift due to the increased risk of not having all the players in the same room to handle issues as they arise.\nIn addition to that, this approach also involved major investment in a brand new implementation and a complete, usually waterfall, analysis of the existing system and the processes to be reworked. So, although the greenfield option offers the possibility of running the old system while installing the new, business disruption of some sort is likely.\nOne-Stop Shoppers\nFull migration works best for “SAP houses” that invest in every SAP tool they can. These enterprises like having a full suite of SAP solutions for migration and partner solutions for creating modern applications at their disposal. Why go through the hassle of stitching together multiple vendor offerings and assuring data consistency if they don’t have to?\nThe downsides are vendor lock-in with no graceful way to exit if technology changes, last-mile UI customization, and narrow parametrization of workflow and data. Also, of the three options, this one has the greatest likelihood of business disruption.\nCompose Your New Future\nGartner says the future of ERP is composable meaning, monolythic ERP systems can’t easily meet the agility requirements of our now “new” normal. Breaking an ERP into composable “parts” gives customers new options who want to integrate best-in-class functions, applications, and datasets unique to their business to create perfect-fit solutions and amazing customer experiences. In this case, hybrid migration is best for them because they:\nDo not want to be locked into a single vendor;\nNeed to allot finite resources to innovation, not a major system implementation;\nWant the agility to respond to future changes in technology and the market.",

If they sell goods and send to consumers in another EU country, they need to register there and charge VAT at the rate applicable in that country.\nHowever, if they were selling to business B2B, they do not charge VAT – if the customer has a valid VAT number. The customer in this case has to account for the VAT on the transaction as if it had sold the goods himself, at the applicable rate in customer country. Normally, he will later be able to deduct this amount. Therefore, plant broad is relevant to B2C sales and it’s not required for B2B sales in other EU country.\nComprehensive configuration solution for companies in European Union where companies have plants in another European Nation.\nThis functionality helps to assign plants from different countries to one company code without a need of having sales organizations in the countries where plants are located and company needs to have Vat registration numbers in those countries where it is obligated to file Vat returns or European Sales Listing or Intrastat returns.\nThis can be activated to handle tax issues for companies that have Vat registration numbers in more than one country.\nActivation ensures that Vat registration number correctly gets printed on documents like sales, purchases, invoices, correct VAT registration numbers being used for right tax calculation, stock transfers between plants get captured for intra stat reporting correctly.\nThis functionality helps to process Tax returns for warehouses or sales and distribution centers abroad using domestic company codes. i.e. Tax returns to a foreign tax authority, EC sales list for another EU country.\nTo enable intra stat reporting and vat on foreign vat registration number.\nTo enable Intra company and cross-border stock transfer.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP Product Costing (CO-PC) course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP Product Costing (CO-PC) is a module provided by SAP and is used for planning costs and establishing material prices. It helps in estimating the cost of goods sold manufactured and COGS of each for each product unit.\nSAP Product Costing has two different types of material costing processes viz.\n1) Material cost estimate with quantity structure\n2) Material cost estimate without quantity structure\nMaterial cost estimate with quantity structure works in combination of BOM (Bill of Material) and Routing assigned to it.\n\n\nSAP CO Product Costing module is used to find the value of internal cost of products. It is also used for profitability and management accounting for production.\nWhile configuring Product Costing, it involves two areas for setting −\nProduct Cost Planning\nCost Object Controlling\nThe basics of Product Costing is Cost Center Planning. The goal of cost center planning is to plan total dollars and quantities in each Cost Center in a Plant.\n\n\nSAP CO-PC is one of the most important SAP components for the manufacturing companies. The main purpose of SAP CO Product Costing or CO-PC is to calculate and show costs appearing during production process. When costing with quantity structure is performed, the system uses master data from Logistics. Product cost planning function costs individual products precisely and provides various, flexible and quick analysis options.\nIn principle, the data for CO-PC are obtained from the PP module, through Bill of Materials and Master recipes.\nThere are three necessary preconditions for good and reliable operation of the CO-PC module:\nProperly defined master data structure (BOMs, Resources and Master Recipes)\nCorrectly defined CO structure (Cost centers and Profit centers)\nCorrectly defined structural parameters related to the way of monitoring costs\nThe following PP master data is necessary for Product Costing:\nPP parameters in Material Master Data\nPP Resources\nMaster Recipes with Bill of Materials\nThe following FI-CO master data is necessary for Product Costing:\nFI-CO parameters in Material Master Data\nActivity Types\nPrimary Cost Elements\nSecondary Cost Elements\nStructural parameters required for Product Costing define a method of calculating and analyzing production costs. There are nine major structural parameters:\nCost Components Structure\nProduction Overhead Costing Sheet\nCosting Type\nCosting Variant\nValuation Variant\nWIP costs\nProduction Variances\nCost Categories (Plan, Actual, Target)\nSettlement Profile\nCO-PC module covers an area of management of production costs, which technically covers three areas of work:\nCO-PC-PCP - Product Cost Planning\nCO-PC-OBJ - Cost object Controlling\nCO-PC-IS - Product Cost Info System\nEstimated cost of production is done prior to the start of production and as a result is a cost of making products and semi-finished products. The price comes on the basis of product structure, price of materials, the cost of activities and correct overhead keys, and cost analysis is done using the Cost components structure. The calculated price can be released to material master once per month. The difference compared to the previous price is posted to the special FI account.\nCost of PP orders are displayed as planned, actual and target costs:\nPlanned costs are calculated when a PP order is created\nActual costs are the result of the posting of materials and activities\nTarget costs are calculated as part of period closing procedure and represent normative costs for the actual quantity produced.\n\n\nReconciliation and Reporting\nDuring the period closing, the system calculates the Variances or WIP (Work in Progress), depending on whether the PP orders are completed or not. The Product Cost info system contains two types of production reports:\nReports on current costs of PP orders\nDrill-down reports based on specific data collection process after PP orders are completed\nReports on current costs include data on the basis of production posting\nThe value of the quantities produced\nThe value of the consumed materials\nProduction Variances\nDrill-down reports are based on a hierarchical basis. For them it is necessary to use specific tools for collecting data from PP orders after the completion of the closing period procedure. The collected data are analyzed on the basis of pre-defined data hierarchy.\n\n\nIntegration of SAP Product Costing with other SAP modules\nSAP Product Costing is integrated closely with various SAP modules:\nMaterials Management (MM) module for material master record / purchase info record\nProduction Planning (PP) module for Bill of material (BOM), routing and work center\nCost Center Accounting (CO) module as information of cost centers, its linkage of work center, activity types and activity wise cost centers help in determining conversion costs associated with manufacturing process\nIn a similar manner, the output and results obtained from Product Costing can also provide useful information for various SAP modules:\nMaterial Management (MM) module for material and stock valuation\nSales and Distribution (SD) module\nCost object controlling for calculating variances and WIP\n\n\nUplatz provides this detailed level training on SAP Product Costing (CO-PC) module covering the concepts and their application in SAP system including comprehensive explanation of the necessary configuration and management steps.\n\n\nSAP Product Costing - Course Syllabus\nCost Component Structure\nCosting Types\nDefine Costing Type\nCost Object Controlling\nWorking with the Controlling Area\nDefining Assignments\nWorking with the Settlement Profile",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the SAP HCM UK Payroll course by Uplatz.\n\n\nSAP HCM UK Payroll is an SAP module that manages the UK Payroll system including organizational management, different wage types, time management payroll, reporting HR, the configuration of master data, and more.\nPayroll in the UK can be run once-a-month, which is normal in the UK, or on a weekly basis if chosen. For running the payroll contains gathering UK payroll taxes from employees' salaries. Overseas employers need to consider both income tax and National Insurance tax. The UK holiday pay regime has been around for some time and most UK payroll managers, HR directors, and SAP Payroll administrators appear to be conscious of it. However, whilst some organizations use the novel designs, many employers still haven’t taken any action to change their processes or SAP payroll systems (Employee Central Payroll and on-premise SAP Payroll are affected in the same way). The reason for this is quite often that they are confused about the ambiguity of the court verdicts or that they are to come for SAP to provide a convenient solution that they can then just switch on.\nWith SAP UK Payroll one can avoid expensive and hard to manage procedures. SAP UK Payroll is an SAP component that achieves the UK Payroll scheme including structural management, different wage types, time management payroll, reporting HR, the formation of master data, and more.
