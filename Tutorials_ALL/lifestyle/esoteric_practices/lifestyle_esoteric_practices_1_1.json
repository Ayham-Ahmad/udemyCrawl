      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED & ACCREDITED\nFor those who are science-based learners, do not underestimate the power of this alternative healing method and session work. The world is a lot weirder than we think, and profound wisdom and healing can come from interesting experiences and unusual places. Keep an open mind. These 5 sessions come with session sheets in this course to direct each session and are priceless. I have seen people desperate to change nagging problems and blocks, fast track to healing and rediscovery of their self and life! It's amazing what I have seen.\nPleiadian Healing Method\nIn this course you will deepen your understanding of your connection to the universe, how light technology works, the work we must still do to awaken the biology and healing power within us that guides our life, themes of light and dark, charka work, study of reality, intuition, telepathy, telekinesis, listening, and, you will have access to conversations I had with my star guide, Euclytus.\nIf you are a healer, counsellor or therapist of any kid doing session work with others, this course comes with complete in-session worksheets to follow and use for your own clients if you are a healer! You will use them on yourself in this course.\nLike all my courses, I teach through conversation and stories. If you are looking for charts and graphs this may not be the course for you. This course will allow you to therapize yourself, so that you may serve as a guide to others. What you learn here you will apply first, and what you learn will be what you teach to others.\n\n\nMessage From Euclytus~ Star Guide, during the Pandemic\n\"Data blocks— physical blocks & confines are re-upping and dispersing tremendous power into elevating consciousness as concerned the “static” nature of the current human experience. The mass energy is coiled together in a singular experience in order to launch a new energetic program, if you will, into the consciousness of man. These energy frequencies will deliver a new propagation of thought, leading to mass, intrinsic dichotomy of the soul! A redirect and reconnect of soul purpose! During this time you will experience technology interference. Instead of frustration, say thank you, as the pause of busy-ness you experience is the launch of a new life! ~Euclytus\nAll Courses Are Accredited Through International Association of Therapists (IAOTH)\nSee you in class!\nSufi",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\n\"I was absolutely amazed at the difference I could make almost instantly for my pets applying Melissa's teaching\" Elisabeth\n\"Beautiful course! Melissa is a wonderful teacher and explained and demonstrated each part of the course well. Would highly recommend this course to anyone at whatever part of the Reiki journey you are on.\" Jules\n\"Melissa’s enpathy, love and care for animals shines through. It brought me great comfort to learn more about how to heal and nurture animals.\" Kylie\n\"This course has been such a delight! As a certified Usui Master Teacher since 2014, I have been assisting our furry, winged and scaled friends thru intuition. However, I really wanted to 'make sure' that I was 'doing it right'? So that their highest good was being represented. This wonderful course has demonstrated such helpful practices that I am sure that I will be able to incorporate animals into my healing scope of practice. Thank you, Melissa for making this so applicable, fun and informative! Blessings, Love, Light\" Shelly\n\"With this course I know that I am now fully prepared, and can go out there and help our little, or, big friends that so need some healing.\" Stuart\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nLearn to use energy healing (Reiki) from the Universal Life Force Energy to help heal pets and animals! You'll learn how to balance yourself to become the most efficient and loving healer you can possibly be!\nThis course includes everything you need to understand the basics of energy healing, learn what and where animal chakras are, how to perform an animal healing, be aware of other natural healing techniques, as well as how to deal with grief once your beloved pet or animal goes back to the light.\nI created this course in a manner to complement previous Reiki training as well as offer non-Reiki practitioners the chance to learn how to perform energy healing on their pets and animals!\nThis means you do not need any previous experience to effectively send loving and healing energy to pets and animals!\nWhat's more, this course is self-paced and completely digital, which means you can go as slow or as quick as you like.  The most important component here is to focus on your loving intention to help your friends in the animal kingdom.\n\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nOnce enrolled, you'll be able to download your course handbook, written by Melissa: Pets & Animals Reiki Course and More (PDF), within it includes helpful Practice Exercises for you to bolster your learning with.\nI've also provided you with the wonderful additional learning tools such as as a Dog Chakra Poster (PDF) and Cat Chakra Poster (PDF) not to mention some links to other helpful resources, too!\nFurthermore, I realise not everybody has an understanding support system in place to deal with the loss of a pet.  So whether it's for your own situation, someone else, or a client of yours, I've created an 8-minute long Support for Your Loss Audio (Video and YT link) to help you through the process. I even listen to it to help myself get through the feelings of loss with my own sweet kitty Twinkie, who went back to the light in December 2016.\nAs I'm sure you'll see, I've written this handbook from a place of love because I don't just want you to become an energy healer for pets and animals, but want to help you further develop your mind, body and soul.\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Pets & Animals Final Exam.  Upon successful completion, you'll receive either a beautiful Pet & Animal Reiki Certificate (PDF) OR if you're not a Reiki Practitioner, you can submit for my Pet & Animal Energy Healing Certificate (PDF).\nSome of the additional benefits of this course include being able to grow spiritually, be more centred and calm in your everyday life, and achieve and live at a higher level of energy - all of which will help you help other sentient beings.\nAlso, there is a special \"Outtakes & Bloopers\" video bonus with this course! Working with animals is so rewarding - and also a lot of fun! So watch some of the funny things that happen when I heal both domestic pets and farm animals!\nLastly, this course has been dedicated to my beloved kitty Twinkie (2001-2016) and in her honour, 10% of the net profits earned from this course will be donated to Edgar's Mission Farm Sanctuary (Australia) each month.",

      "description": "In this course I will share with you a technique to reach God-consciousness that was channeled from Archangel Michael.\nGod-consciousness\nSpiritual breakthrough is about God-consciousness. The goal is to reach a level of consciousness that allows us to be as aware of God as of ourselves. Imagine being as aware of God as we are of ourselves. This is the breakthrough we seek. But it is a difficult goal to realize.\nOne of the greatest seekers of God-consciousness, the late Edgar Cayce teaches: \"Remember there is no shortcut to a consciousness of the God-force. It is part of your own consciousness, but it cannot be realized by the simple desire to do so. Too often there is the tendency to want it and expect it without applying spiritual truth through the medium of mental processes. This is the only way to reach the gate. There are no shortcuts in metaphysics. Life is learned within self. You don’t profess it, you learn it\".\n\nCLAIRVOYANCE\nClairvoyant (clear vision) -- To reach into another vibrational frequency and visually perceive \"within the mind's eye\" something existing in that realm. A clairvoyant is one who receives extrasensory impressions, and symbols in the form of \"inner sight\" or mental images which are perceived without the aid of the physical eyes and beyond the limitations of ordinary time and space. These impressions are more easily perceived in an alpha state and during meditation, though many clairvoyants can obtain visual information regarding the past, present and future in a variety of environments.\nCLAIRAUDIENCE\nClairaudience (clear audio /hearing) -- To perceive sounds or words and extrasensory noise, from sources broadcast from spiritual or ethereal realm, in the form of \"inner ear\" or mental tone which are perceived without the aid of the physical ear and beyond the limitations of ordinary time and space. These tones and vibrations are more easily perceived in an alpha state and during meditation, though many clairaudients can obtain verbal and sound-related information regarding the past, present and future in a variety of environments. Most Channelers (also known as Mediums) work with both clairvoyance and clairaudience.\nCLAIRSENTIENCE\nClairsentience (clear sensation or feeling) - To perceive information by a \"feeling\" within the whole body, without any outer stimuli related to the feeling or information. An Empath is a person who can psychically tune in to the emotional experience of a person, place or animal. Clairempathy is a type of telepathy to sense or feel within one's self, the attitude, emotion or ailment of another person or entity. Empaths tune into the vibrations and \"feel\" the tones of the aura.",

      "description": "Astrology is an increasingly popular tool for self-improvement, empowerment, and personal development.  There are many different kinds of Astrology!  Are you curious about learning more about it, but feel a bit skeptical because of the confusion of postmodern New Age spirituality?  That is totally understandable!  Still,it is a shame that the meaning and self-awareness we can find in Astrology has been diminished by the watered down Popular Astrology.  I designed this course to provide an explanation of how Astrology works, without including the inconsistent, subjective bias of New Age spirituality.  I explain how the factual basics of Astronomy (Sun and Moon orbits, the Zodiac, the movements of the Planets through the sky, etc.) provide the spiritual off-shoot of Astrology.  With my Master's degree in Jewish Studies, I use the tradition of Kabbalistic Astrology as a grounded basis for understanding Astrology in a consistent and mindful way.  I also explain that there are many different types of Astrology, and that Western Astrology is not the only option. Understanding Astrology from an Academic perspective can show you how to find meaningful patterns and practices.  When you learn about Astrology from a purely fact-based perspective, you can decide for yourself what Astrology can mean for you.",

Bishop Long, a leading expert in this field, will discuss if he believes there is an increase in demonic activity lately. We will also talk about the topic of human spirits, the classification of angels, and we will define what a demon really is and what it is not. We will also discuss the three phases of demonic presence - infestation, oppression, and possession.\nJames Long is currently a Bishop of the United States Old Catholic Church and has devoted his entire life to the study of Demonology and serving others without charge. Over 20 years ago, he went public with his deliverance ministry and was the first Catholic Exorcist to publicly help the Paranormal Community. He serves as the Exorcist for the Church and has performed 30 documented Exorcisms on individuals who were validly possessed, and he has blessed countless homes/locations. He is a proud member of the Old Catholic Benedictines of Immaculate Mary and a member of the Order of Corporate Reunion.\nBishop James Long has the following earned degrees:\nDoctorate of Ministry\nMaster of Divinity\nMaster of Education\nMaster of Business\nBachelor of Journalism/Communications\nAssociate of Philosophy",

The Reiki attunement connects you to the source of healing energy which you can then start to channel. You can use this to help heal yourself and others around you. Your Chakras will be opened and you are connected to the Reiki Source. You will be able to channel Reiki through your hands to yourself or others. You will become gradually aware of what you need to do in regards to your healing. You may become more intuitive and psychic. This Reiki course is easy to follow covering Reiki Level I in shortest time possible with the absolute beginner in mind. The course covers all aspects of the Reiki Level 1\nReiki Level 1 is the foundation of the Reiki practice, where individuals are introduced to the principles, techniques, and energy system that form the basis of this healing modality. At this level, participants experience their first attunement, a sacred process conducted by a Reiki Master. The attunement opens the energy pathways in the individual, enabling them to channel Reiki energy for self-healing and healing others. This initiation is a profound step in connecting with the universal life energy that flows through all living beings.\nIn Reiki Level 1, the focus is primarily on self-healing and understanding the fundamental concepts of Reiki energy. Participants learn the history and philosophy of Reiki, gaining insight into how this ancient practice works to balance and harmonize the body, mind, and spirit. The teachings emphasize the physical application of Reiki, including how to place hands on oneself or others to promote relaxation, stress reduction, and energy flow.\nThrough guided practice, individuals develop a sensitivity to energy, learning to feel and recognize the subtle shifts that occur during a Reiki session. Reiki Level 1 also introduces the five Reiki principles, which serve as a spiritual foundation for personal growth and ethical practice. These principles encourage practitioners to live mindfully, cultivating gratitude, patience, and compassion in daily life.\nThis level of Reiki is designed to empower individuals to take responsibility for their own well-being. By regularly practicing Reiki on themselves, they can experience increased self-awareness, reduced stress, improved emotional balance, and a sense of inner peace. Reiki Level 1 does not require any prior experience or knowledge, making it accessible to anyone who feels called to explore this gentle yet powerful healing art.\nReiki Level 1 is the beginning of a transformative journey, providing tools to support physical health, emotional resilience, and spiritual development. It establishes a deep connection with the universal life force energy, opening the door to greater self-discovery and the potential to share Reiki’s healing energy with others. This level is often regarded as a gift to oneself, laying the groundwork for continued growth and understanding in the Reiki practice.\nREIKI LEVEL 2\nReiki Level II teaches you to perform distant or absentee Reiki. This means that you are able to send Reiki to yourself and others through space and time, anywhere, whenever you choose to.\nWith your First Degree Reiki class and attunement, you will learn self-healing hand positions, as well as hand placements for sharing Reiki with others. Once you have received the attunements you are a Reiki Practitioner. Whether you practice Reiki or not is your choice. Reiki will be with you for the rest of your life. Reiki Level 2 deepens the practitioner’s connection to Reiki energy and significantly enhances their ability to channel and work with this universal life force. This level, often referred to as the \"Practitioner Level,\" introduces powerful tools and techniques that expand the scope and effectiveness of Reiki practice. At this stage, participants receive a second attunement from a Reiki Master, which strengthens their energetic alignment and amplifies their ability to channel Reiki energy.\nOne of the most transformative aspects of Reiki Level 2 is the introduction of three sacred Reiki symbols. These symbols serve as keys to unlocking different aspects of Reiki energy, allowing practitioners to focus their intentions and direct energy with greater precision. The first symbol enhances the power of Reiki energy, making it more focused and intense. The second symbol works on emotional and mental healing, facilitating the release of deep-seated emotional blockages and patterns. The third symbol enables distance healing, allowing practitioners to send Reiki energy across time and space to individuals, situations, or events.\nReiki Level 2 also includes in-depth instruction on how to perform distant healing, an advanced technique that allows the practitioner to channel Reiki to people or circumstances that are not physically present. This is a profound tool for offering healing to loved ones far away, addressing past traumas, or sending positive energy to future events.\nPractitioners at this level deepen their understanding of energy work and develop greater sensitivity to the flow of Reiki energy. They learn to use the symbols effectively, incorporating them into their practice to address a broader range of issues, including emotional healing, mental clarity, and spiritual growth. Reiki Level 2 also emphasizes the importance of intention and visualization, as these elements play a critical role in guiding the energy to its intended purpose.\nThis level is often a gateway to professional practice for those who wish to share Reiki with others in a formal setting. It equips practitioners with the skills and confidence to offer Reiki sessions to clients, adhering to ethical guidelines and maintaining the highest standards of care.\nReiki Level 2 is a profound step in the practitioner’s journey, fostering a deeper connection to the universal life force and opening the door to new dimensions of healing and service. It strengthens the practitioner’s ability to facilitate transformation not only for themselves but also for others, marking a significant milestone in their Reiki path.\nReiki is one energy healing modality that can help you rebalance energies in the body, mind, and spirit. The energy, when received, works for the greatest and highest good of the recipient, which can be a person, place, object, animal, or situation. Reiki has its own essential intelligence and goes where it is needed to bring healing to the person, animal, place, object, or situation\nReiki II is the level where you are taught the first three symbols. With this comes the skill of being able to focus healing on mental and emotional problems, and distant healing those not physically present. Reiki II is the next exciting step in learning to use Reiki. It is commonly reported that with Reiki II comes an increase in the Reiki energy.\nThe Reiki understanding you will achieve from this course will allow not only help yourself but also all people around you including your friends, family and relatives. What are you waiting for? Let’s start learning about this beautiful healing energy Reiki\nREIKI MASTER LEVEL You will learn the Reiki Master symbol and will be able to teach Reiki to your own students. You will be able to attune others and start your own Reiki Teaching Classes. You will be provided with traditional and nontraditional Reiki Symbols and your energy will be more open.\nThe Reiki Master level represents the highest level of training and mastery in the Reiki practice, embodying both advanced techniques and a deeper spiritual connection to the universal life force energy. This level is often referred to as the \"Master-Teacher Level,\" as it empowers practitioners to not only channel Reiki at its fullest potential but also to teach and attune others to Reiki. Attaining the Reiki Master level is a profound commitment to personal growth, healing, and service to others.\nAt the Reiki Master level, individuals receive the Master attunement from a Reiki Master, which opens them to the highest frequencies of Reiki energy. This process deepens their connection to universal energy and expands their ability to hold and direct powerful healing energies. The Master level introduces advanced techniques and the Reiki Master symbol, which amplifies the practitioner’s energy work, enhances spiritual connection, and supports healing at the highest levels.\nPractitioners learn how to use the Master symbol in their personal practice and during sessions with others to deepen healing outcomes and support transformation on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels. The Reiki Master symbol also serves as a tool for empowerment, helping to dissolve barriers and align individuals with their highest potential.\nIn addition to advanced healing techniques, the Reiki Master level provides training in teaching Reiki and performing attunements for others. This includes learning how to conduct attunement ceremonies for Reiki Levels 1, 2, and Master, as well as gaining the skills to mentor and guide students on their Reiki journey. This teaching ability is a hallmark of the Reiki Master level, as it allows practitioners to share the gift of Reiki with the world, creating a ripple effect of healing and transformation.\nReiki Master training often involves deep personal and spiritual work. Practitioners are encouraged to cultivate a disciplined practice of self-Reiki, meditation, and mindfulness to maintain their energy, integrity, and alignment with the universal life force.

      "description": "Why this crystal course is different:\nMost crystal courses delve straight into the practicalities of using the stones on the body, on the chakras and in your home environment. This course is different because I want you to ignite your innate intuition, so you can truly learn how to heal YOURSELF. Take ownership of YOUR health and YOUR life!\nI'd like to explain how this course is different to most crystal courses in its approach, covering energy work in general first of all and then how energy work relates to crystal healing. Therefore, the bulk of this first course in the collection, is about energy, energy management and how it can be harnessed to heal using crystals. Crystals will be the consistent healing tool used to demonstrate energy work throughout the 3 courses in the collection and interspersed with other energy theory. (*Read more detail for course 1 further below).\nExpansive Learning: Crystals form a focal point in all 3 courses - but there is more:\nIn addition to crystal knowledge there is some very valuable life management information and techniques in all 3 courses, which I hope will enrich your life going forward. Essentially, you are getting more for your money - crystal healing within a wider context of energy work in general, also linking to the quantum field and heart coherence, taking this course to a deeper and wider level of learning.\nHow to gain full benefit:\nPlease note, if you wish to gain complete knowledge of how to use crystals for your own healing in life, you will need to work through all 3 separate courses in the collection 'Quantum Crystal Healing':\n(1) Ignite Your Healing Potential\n(2) Develop Your Intuitive Healing\n(3) Apply Deep Healing For Life\nYou are of course, able to select any of the 3 courses as stand alone learning, however you may find there are gaps in your knowledge in order to fully benefit from all the topics I talk about.\n*What I will cover in Course 1 ~ Ignite Your Healing Potential\nOnly once we truly connect with our intuition, can we choose the right healing method, tool or path for ourselves. This is because we are all unique. Yes we are all made up of energy, but the configuration of that energy is subtly different in each and every one of us. Edward Bach said 'Know Thyself' and that this unveiling knowledge is the key to health. Only YOU truly know what you need and I will teach you how to 'read' and 'trust' your inner guidance system during this first course. It sounds simple, but if you truly want to learn how to become a powerful healer for your own life, then you need to take this important step first. Then you can go forward in the knowledge that you have unlocked the key to your unique healing blueprint.\nI will cover theories and practices in this first course that will open your mind to another world of energy and quantum science. You will learn how to truly manifest what you want in your life (maybe even why the law of attraction hasn't worked for you until now) and how you can start to engage your intuition to guide you in the selection of the most powerful crystal stones that will help to heal YOU in your life going forward.\nFor those of you who have a questioning mind, I will explain why crystals heal and how they relate to personality and personality archetypes. You will start to recognise patterns in yourself, in your character and how those patterns and behaviours affect your life. With this knowledge you can start to attract what you want and not what you don't want! When you are clear on that, you will be best placed to attract the right crystals for healing that will form an essential part of your tool kit for life. Then we can build on that foundation of knowledge and experience during courses 2 and 3.\nI look forward to sharing this valuable life skills knowledge with you.\nBest Wishes,\nSonya :-)\nPlease Note: This course does not qualify you to apply crystals to others, however I do offer a crystal practitioner course for those who want to take the next step and become qualified as a crystal therapist.\nIn order to qualify for this practitioner level, you would need to complete all three courses in the 'Quantum Crystal Healing' collection and have emailed me with your Udemy 100% completion certificate so I can award you with my own official certificate vetted by Neya Academy (see below*). Please email me using sonya@mendipreiki-heaingarts.co.uk with your completion certificates and to register your interest in the practitioner level and I will then send you further information.\n*If you wish to gain a personal certificate of completion from me you will need to complete 100% of the course, email me at sonya@mendipreiki-healingarts.co.uk a copy or image of your Udemy certificate (which you should receive automatically on the system when you complete 100% of the course) and then I will email you my own Certificate of Completion accredited by the Neya® Academy.\nP.S. Apologies if the captions on this course are not accurate, Udemy can't always translate them perfectly!",

      "description": "Solution Based Hypnotherapy Practitioner Certification\nThis is your personal invite, from me to you, to come and join me on this fascinating journey into the world of Solution Based Hypnotherapy.\n\n\nThis Solution Based Hypnotherapy Practitioner Course is a clear, concise and practical guide into the world of Hypnotherapy. It will provide you with a simple to use, yet hugely effective process for guiding clients through the Hypnotherapy process that does not just include the hypnosis section but the whole process from starting with a client to closing out with a client.\nFollowing a practical and easy to use framework is the best way to help your clients and this course provides you with exactly that, no jargon, no fluff, just a practical guide to using hypnotherapy to help others. If you want a down to earth guide with practical training into the effective skills and techniques that hypnotherapy holds then you have found the right course for you.\n\n\n\"Trust your unconscious, it knows more than you do\" - Milton Erickson (one of the fathers of hypnotherapy)\n\n\nIf you don't need to read any more and you are ready to dive in then hit the \"Buy Now\" or \"Enroll Now\" button and let's get started!\n\n\nWhy Solution Based Hypnotherapy?\nToo many people are trying to solve issues by focussing on their problems and yet their problems never hold the answers they seek. When we help clients to make a shift from looking at and listening to their problems to focussing on the solutions we open up their options and give them greater perspective. With more options and greater perspective the chances of them resolving their problem is exponentially improved and when you can work on both the conscious mind and unconscious mind with hypnotherapy you can help them make powerful changes to their lives.\nAs you get started and follow through this Solution Based Hypnotherapy course you will discover practical steps that you can take to help your clients find that greater perspective. You can help them to dive into their unconscious mind and develop their options from the deepest part of themselves. Hypnotherapy has been proven to be effective in helping with many issues including (but not limited to):\n- Depression\n- Anxiety\n-Anger & Frustration\n- Stress\n- Over Eating\n- Smoking\n- Fears\n- and much, much more\nWhat an incredibly powerful tool to have in your toolbox to go out and help others with.\n\n\nWhat are others saying about this course?\nCO - 5 Stars - \"The contents were explained in the simplest, yet most effective way that anybody could understand. I would definitely recommend him if somebody would want to become a helping practitioner.\"\nDR. JS - 5 Stars - \"As normal with Graham's courses (I have fully taken 3 of His courses already): great learning, expansion, dynamics, genuine!\"\nRK - 5 Stars - \"Loving the work. The way its broken down and gives you room to absorb and develop. Useful reminders and points which are often forgotten but very important.\"\nCM - 5 Stars - \"Thoroughly enjoyed this course and the links with the NLP Accreditation I already have. Thank you\"\nNB - 5 Stars - \"I have taken several of Graham's courses and gained greater knowledge in subjects I have already studied in classes but Graham has a great way of explaining things but never felt able to use it now I feel confident to go and practice, Graham has a great way to help get the techniques to sink in. I have taken a course in hypnotherapy years ago but can honestly say that this one is far better than the one I took in person all those years ago. As always, extremely grateful for the chance to take many valuable courses\"\n\n\n\"It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is formed\" Tony Robbins\n\n\nThere is every chance you have looked at other hypnotherapy courses as there are so many available, right? You've maybe pondered back and forth about this one is best for you to take. There's a chance you've considered taking a live course but those are just so expensive these days and you have to travel whereas an online course means you can learn in your own time at your own pace. It's ok, you've found the course for you and you'll learn everything you need to so that you can use hypnotherapy to help your clients.\n\n\nSo now comes you moment of decision, all you have to do is say yes then click on the \"Buy Now\" or \"Enroll Now\" button and we can get started. We can go on this fascinating journey together and by the end you will know how to take a client from the very first moment you contact them, all the way through the hypnotherapy process and successfully out the other side to where their life awaits. Are you ready to say yes?\n\n\nFantastic, let's get going......... I can't wait to see you inside the course.\n\n\nMy Very Best Regards\nGraham\nP.S. If you want to check out the amazing information that you'll be getting then take a look at the intro video to the course, I've made it available to you so that you can understand all of the practical skills you'll be learning!\n\n\nGo on........ Click \"Buy Now\" or \"Enroll Now'....... I'll see you in there!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypnotherapy | Solution Based Hypnotherapy | Practitioner",

Past life therapy through hypnosis loosens the rigidity of the intellect and opens the door to a new experience of reality.\nTransformation becomes a process of coming to a place of peace and harmony within the self that is attained by experiencing the primordial essence from which we have become separated. Regression therapy touches the deepest part of our essence, the lost part of our soul that is redeemed through our love and acceptance.\nThis raises the level of consciousness to become centered in love and caring for others. Feelings of separateness become recognized as an illusion and one can experience the ultimate reality. Past life therapy is becoming recognized as one of the most powerful tools for inner transformation in psychology today.\nThis powerful tool for the transformation of human thought is our connection to the universe and will eventually raise the consciousness of everyone on the planet.\nThis course enables you to experience your own past life regression in the comfort of your own home.\n\nThis program provides you with video lectures as well as hypnosis audio programs which can enable you to tap into the unconscious and subconscious mind to help you uncover and heal past life memories. A past life regression with a hypnotist or hypnotherapist can cost hundreds of dollars! This program is a cost effective way of experiencing past life regression.....and getting results!\nYou also receive 2 bonus downloads for enrolling in this course. That is an additional one hour of content free.\nThe Journey-Music For Meditation\nPut on your headphones, close your eyes and get ready to be transported . The Journey has been composed to support deep states of relaxation and exploration into expanded states of awareness.\nYou will be gently guided from waking consciousness to deep theta relaxation on the first 4 tracks and brought back to waking consciousness on the 5th track. Your perfect musical companion for relaxation, meditation, self-hypnosis, reiki, reflexology, massage and other healing work. This music is tuned to 432hz which resonates and activates the heart chakra.\nWhen you emerge at the end of the program you will feel remarkably refreshed and renewed with energy.\n5 Tracks 43 Minutes in length-MP3 320 kbps\nRadiant Energy Meditation\nFeeling tired or drained energetically?\nMaybe you sense that you are carrying energy that is making you heavy or lethargic?\nWould you like to experience more \"lightness\" in your body, mind and emotions?\nExperience a voice guided, gentle, meditative journey to help you clear your aura, chakras and energy field.\nIn this program you will have the opportunity to clear your energy field and aura. You will learn how to connect with the universal healing energy to balance and align your systems. Releasing energy that is no longer serving you creates new space within both yourself and your life.\nSpace that can then be filled with only that which you choose.\nDuring this program you will work directly with the universal healing energy. You will align with your highest and best self leading to a complete renewal.\nProgram approximately 23 minutes in length.",

      "description": "Transformative Healing & Spiritual Awakening\nHoly Fire® III Reiki is a powerful and evolutionary form of Reiki energy, known for its ability to provide deep, transformative healing on all levels—physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Unlike traditional Reiki, Holy Fire® III Reiki is guided by a higher level of consciousness, offering profound experiences that lead to inner peace, personal growth, and spiritual enlightenment.\n\n\nAffordable Holy Fire® III Reiki Courses for Global Accessibility\nAt Deeply Rooted Journey Spiritual Academy™, I believe that everyone deserves access to high-quality spiritual education, regardless of their financial situation. Guided by my spiritual team, I offer Holy Fire® III Reiki courses at significantly lower prices than many other institutions. This is to ensure that students worldwide can experience the transformative power of Holy Fire® Reiki, even if they may not have the financial means to take this training elsewhere.\nBecause I am committed to offering courses at a price that anyone can afford, I am unable to provide students with an ICRT membership—the costs associated with that far exceed the course fees at my academy.\n\n\nWhat Sets Holy Fire® III Reiki Apart?\nHoly Fire® III Reiki differs from other forms of Reiki in several key ways:\nDirect Connection to Divine Energy: Holy Fire III connects you directly to the Source of Healing Energy, including the Christ Consciousness Energy, empowering you with a higher vibration of healing.\nPlacements, Ignitions, and Healing Experiences: Instead of traditional attunements, Holy Fire® III uses Placements and Ignitions to instill the Reiki energy. This process is more refined and works at a deeper level, offering powerful healing and a direct connection to the Holy Fire flame.\nPurification and Transformation: Holy Fire® III has the ability to purify deeply held emotional and mental blocks, transform unhealed wounds into wisdom, and bring about a state of inner wholeness.\nGentle Yet Powerful Energy: The energy of Holy Fire® III is both gentle and nurturing, yet incredibly powerful, guiding you toward inner peace and spiritual empowerment.\n\n\nHow Holy Fire III Reiki Benefits You\nWhether you choose to become a practitioner, a master teacher, or simply want to incorporate Holy Fire® III Reiki into your personal life, its benefits are profound and far-reaching:\nFor Practitioners: Holy Fire® III Reiki enables you to provide deep healing experiences for your clients, helping them release past trauma, emotional wounds, and physical pain. The direct connection to Holy Fire® energy elevates your practice, allowing you to work at a higher vibrational level.\nFor Master Teachers: As a master teacher, you will have the ability to pass on the Holy Fire® III energy to your students, empowering them to become healers and spiritual guides. You’ll lead Placements, Ignitions, and create life-changing experiences for those you teach.\nFor Personal Transformation: If you’re seeking to use Holy Fire® III Reiki for personal growth, it offers a profound path of healing, helping you to release limiting beliefs, fears, and past hurts. This energy supports you in elevating your daily spiritual practice, enhancing your connection to the Divine, and creating a life filled with peace, love, and clarity.\n\n\nUnlock the Power of Holy Fire III Reiki\nBy integrating Holy Fire® III Reiki into your healing journey or spiritual practice, you will unlock your potential to live a life of deep fulfillment and spiritual alignment. Whether you’re drawn to this energy for healing others or transforming your own life, Holy Fire® III Reiki is a profound tool for awakening your true self and stepping into your power as a healer, teacher, and spiritual being.\n\n\nSTUDENT TESTIMONIALS\nJunko Okano\nThis step by step learning reiki course is truly helpful for the beginners. The course materials/resources are so useful and the Quizzes are also helping me to make sure I fully understand the learning contents.\n\n\nDiane Mudle\nIt is a good recap of the Reiki origins and historical linage. I have had all my attunements to Reiki through William Lee Rand, and have the books, but I like the way this course presents everything in a written and audio form.\n\n\nCourtney Hardy\nI’m an Usui Reiki Master but I found a lot of base material covered in this course that I did not know or went further into detail with.\n\n\nUpgrading to Holy Fire III Reiki for Existing Master Teachers\nFor those who are already Reiki Master Teachers in other styles, upgrading to Holy Fire® III Reiki requires completing both Level 2 and Level 3 courses. While Level 1 is not mandatory at Deeply Rooted Journey Spiritual Academy™, many seasoned Reiki Masters have found it to be immensely valuable, offering rich insights into Reiki’s history and spiritual foundations that may not have been included in their prior training. These Master Teachers often express that the additional knowledge has deepened their understanding of Reiki and enhanced their personal and professional practices.\nThe Importance of Upgrading to Holy Fire Energy\nIn Holy Fire® III Reiki, several traditional symbols used in other Reiki styles are replaced by the Holy Flame Master symbol. This energy is of a higher vibration and allows you to work with pure, refined healing energy, offering a deeper level of spiritual healing for both yourself and your clients. By upgrading to Holy Fire® III, you will align your practice with the evolved energy of Holy Fire, giving you access to a higher frequency of healing power.\nWhich Symbols Are Replaced?\nIn Holy Fire® III Reiki, the following traditional Reiki symbols are replaced by the Holy Flame Master symbol:\nDai Ko Myo (Usui Master symbol)\nTibetan Dai Ko Myo\nFire Serpent\nRaku\nThese symbols, which are traditionally used in various forms of Reiki, are replaced by the Holy Flame Master symbol in Holy Fire® III Reiki. This upgrade allows practitioners to work with the refined Holy Fire energy, ensuring their practice is aligned with a higher vibrational frequency for more profound healing and spiritual transformation.\nHoly Fire III Reiki Has No Lineage\nUnlike other forms of Reiki that trace their lineage back through teachers and practitioners, Holy Fire® III Reiki does not follow a traditional lineage. Instead, the energy is directly received from the Source, bypassing any earthly lineage. This ensures that the energy remains pure, untainted, and always connected to the highest levels of consciousness, allowing you to work directly with Divine Healing Energy without any intermediary.\nBy upgrading your Reiki practice to Holy Fire III, you are stepping into a new realm of healing and spiritual development. This energy will support your teaching practice, as well as your own spiritual transformation, helping you to offer unparalleled healing experiences to your clients and students alike.\nFlexible and Accessible Learning with Our Courses\nAt Deeply Rooted Journey Spiritual Academy™, I prioritize providing an exceptional and flexible learning experience for my students and why I chose to partner with Udemy. My courses come with a range of features designed to support your educational journey:\nPrivate Student Dashboard: Each student receives access to a private student dashboard, which can be accessed anytime, from anywhere, on any device. This ensures that you can engage with your course materials at your convenience.\nDownloadable Resources: All videos and PDF materials provided in the courses are downloadable, allowing you to view them offline and revisit them whenever needed. This feature supports a more flexible learning experience, whether you're on the go or in a quiet space.\nLifetime Access: Enroll in our courses and enjoy lifetime access to all content. This means you can learn at your own pace, without any time constraints. Revisit lessons and resources as often as needed to fully grasp the material and integrate it into your practice.\nMy commitment is to ensure that your learning experience is both comprehensive and adaptable to your unique schedule and needs.

Then this Trance Healing course is the right course for you.\n\n\nWhat is Trance Healing?\nTrance Healing is a very powerful method of spiritual healing, because the healing energy comes directly from Spirit.\nTrance Healing is a form of Mediumship, and Mediumship is the ability to connect to the spirit world, like Spirit Guides, Helpers, Ascended Masters and Angels.\nA Medium is the “Middleman” between a person and the spirit world.\nIn Trance Healing, the Medium is basically just a channel for the Healing energy that comes from spirit guides, helpers, angels, and Ascended Masters.\n\n\nHow can Trance Healing help?\nA Trance Healing session can be supportive in times where we are out of balance, for example high stress or emotional problems.\nTrance Healing works on the emotional, mental and spiritual level more than on physical problems, but still includes this level as well if a physical problem is attached to emotional, mental or spiritual problems. This is actually often the case.\n\n\nHow does it work?\nBefore a Trance Healing session, the Medium goes into a deep meditation to reach a state of trance, and to link with their Spirit Friends, like spirit Guides and helpers.\nIn this process the energy fields of the Medium and their Spirit Friends will blend, and become as one. The healing energy is transferred from spirit through the aura of the medium to the client.\n\n\nWho can benefit from it?\nTrance Healing is perfect for spiritual Self Healing, but you can help your friends, or clients as well.\nI will guide you in this course step by step through powerful meditations, to become a Medium for Healing Energy.\nYou will learn, how to connect to your Spirit Guides, how to link with them, how to receive messages from the Spirit World, and how to perform a Trance Healing session for yourself, and others.\n\n\nMy name is Daniela, and I’m so honoured to share my knowledge with you.\nI created this course because I know that for lots of people, who feel that they want to develop their mediumship skills, have not the possibility to attend in a mediumship development circle, which is an important part of becoming a Medium. In fact, I had the same problem.\n\n\nThese following meditations are in included:\nInner Peace Meditation\nConnecting To Your Spirit Friends\nLinking With Your Spirit Friends\nA Message From Your Spirit Friends\nTrance Healing For YourSelf\nAttunement To Become A Trance Healer\nTrance Healing For A Friend\n\n\nBy the way, Trance is nothing mysterious, or even creepy. Trance is simply a state of consciousness, which everyone can reach through meditation, dancing, music or special breathing.\nPrerequisite: some experience with Meditation\nSo let’s get started.",

This Chakra focused course is for anyone that wants to learn about energy and chakras. Energy is truly everything and I share from my heart on how tuning into your energy field and chakras can revolutionize your health. You are more than a physical body as you have an energy body as well and this energy body determines how you feel, how people respond to you. The chakras are seven bodily energy centers which move from the base of the spine to the top of the head.

      "description": "Join Ireland’s renowned international bestselling author, Lorna Byrne, and New York Times bestselling author, Mike Dooley, for a course filled with insights on how to live better with faith and understanding, using your own spiritual powers and the abundant guidance from the angels who surround you with unconditional love and support.\nThis course was recorded LIVE in front of an audience, and has since become a World Tour. Mike Dooley and Lorna Byrne will be speaking together and delivering this information LIVE in Denver, Phoenix, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, Orlando, Philadelphia, and Toronto.\nLorna's been featured on CNN, NBC Today, The Economist, and many other media outlets.\nA Letter from Mike\nJambo Fellow Adventurer!\nYou believe in angels, right?\nThree years ago, I had the high privilege of having tea with renowned angel liaison, Lorna Byrne. Whoa! I do believe I know \"authentic\" when I meet \"authentic,\" and she is it! After this amazing stroke of fortune, I read her biographical book, Angels in my Hair, and literally could feel my worldview shifting. It was transformational to become acquainted with someone who genuinely lives with what most of us have wanted to believe is real our entire lives.\nDuring tea, I was able to ask the angels in our presence (they are always in your presence, too) questions about my own life and dreams, about reality in general, and questions on behalf of loved ones. Lorna's answers were at times both profound and lighthearted, and sometimes disappointingly truthful, for example, \"We are not permitted to tell you about that.\" My head was spinning with the legitimacy of the conversation, the strength of her answers, and the confidence of her replies. I felt very, very privileged.\nSince that pivotal afternoon, Lorna and I have stayed in touch, with the idea of bringing the same experience to more people in the most efficient way possible. Now, we are thrilled to announce the release of our Using All of Your Angels online course! Last year I traveled to Dublin, Ireland (Lorna’s home country) and we hosted this event live in front of 400 people. It was truly magical, and we recorded it!\nPlus, as a special gift from Lorna, everyone who signs up will be sent her Wings Unfurled Guided Meditation Album!\nPeace, love, and angels -\nMike Dooley\nBonus Gift: “Wings Unfurled” Angel Meditation Album\n\nAs a special bonus for signing up for a workshop or the online course this week, you’ll receive Lorna’s downloadable “Wings Unfurled” Meditation Album as a gift – featuring four deep meditations to help you connect with your angels!\nIn these four meditations, Lorna helps those of us who don't see or hear angels as she does to connect with our own guardian angels...\nFeel the presence of your guardian angel, start to hear it call you and learn what message it has for you today. (22 minutes)\nTake a walk with your guardian angel through your life to date and recognize the times when your guardian angel has been helping you. (22 minutes)\nInvite the healing angels into your life. (10 minutes)\nGo on a journey with your guardian angel to help you reduce stress and feel more joy in your life. (15 minutes)",

It was truly amazing.\" Annette\n\"I had a great experience, by the end of this course I had developed so much more sense in relation to the changes related to the nature's cycles. i have enrolled in more of your courses. your efforts are really great. thanks\". Aiman F.\nThe Moon can be a potent enabler in our lives - witchcraft and shamanic practices globally have always paid homage to the power of the cycling moon. By knowing how to harness the energies of each lunar phase and understanding how they affect us, we can then positively channel our intentions as we bathe in its light. The pure power of the Moon and its enchanting glow has long been associated with shamanic lore, witchcraft and magic rituals globally. For moon magic to be ceremonially useful and deep, it needs to be built on the knowledge of the nature and cycles of the Moon. Integral experience is key of any calling or Moon working. We will show you how to effectively work with the power of the moon\nThe Moon always reminds us that no matter what phase we are in that we are still whole. Ritual and ceremony will guide us into our core truth.\nThe Moon is always with us and accompanies and influences us in many ways, even if we can’t still perceive it.\nIn days long gone people were extremely sensitive to the lunar cycles and sensed the effect that the Moon and its phases were having on them. They worked with her phases.\nDiscover how to re-wild yourself and once more tune into the unique gifts of the Moon. We will show you how to use this information to make better decisions and expect better results in life matters. Join:\nJulian Jenkins, experienced and renowned psychic medium and\n\n\nSharon Ramel who will weave the shamanic pathway of direct revelation leading you to discover through your direct experience with spirit. Sharon is one of Udemy's top instructors and pioneered teaching shamanism online globally.\nHere's A Peek At Some Of What's Inside This Shamanic Mediumship Moon Offering:\nHow to do an Elemental ceremony, to re-wild and re-connect with the sacred elements\nHow to create your Moon altar\nMeet your Moon course guides, Julian and Sharon\nDiscover the Moons' magical pathway and mediumship phases\nHow to do an effective Moon meditation to empower your life\nLearn about the new moon and the dark moon, how to retreat, restore and renew your dreams\nDiscover Dadirri and how to effectively use moon manifestation to achieve stillness in your mind.\nThe Waxing Crescent Moon - how to work effectively with the silvery crescent moon\nDiscover how to do simple effective spells which are sprinkled throughout the course\nHow to balance and work effectively with the half Moon or First Quarter Moon.\nHow to do the Moon magic thirteen breath meditation to make space\nWork effectively with the Waxing Gibbous Moon, this is a high energy moment before the full moon\nHow to fully manifest with the Full Moon. It is the time to reap the opportunities from our new moon intentions\nReflect and see how to work with the Waning Gibbous Moon as it calls us to be grounded\nLearn about the Last Quarter Moon (Half Moon), it can sometimes be seen as the conflict moon\nHow to actively withdraw working with the Waning Crescent Moon\nWrapping up our Moon time together\nThroughout history, Witches have never 'tuned out' remaining well aware of the power of the Moon and her changing phases, they instinctively developed spells and rituals that adjust to take as much advantage of this beautiful moon energy as possible.\n“All who depart from the world of the body go to the moon. In the bright half, the moon delights in their spirits. In the dark half, the moon sends them on to be born again.\"  - Kawshitaki Upanishad\nShamanism is not a belief system nor is it a religion. It is a pathway of direct revelation. What you discover, you will do so through your experiences and through direct contact with the spirits. If shamanism is to live, it must work and be useful for your life.\nHow Can This Course And Shamanism Benefit Your Health And Well-being:\nIncreased vitality and power\nEnhanced ability to create desired life changes\nExpanded sense of wholeness and well-being\nGreater ability to release addictions and maintain change\nStronger connection to spiritual source and soul purpose\nStrengthened immune system\nHealing from emotional trauma\nChanges in negative thoughts and beliefs\nImproved self-confidence\nBetter relationships\nIncreased energy\nWhole-body connectedness (mind, soul, spirit)\nLessened depression and anxiety\nStronger immune system and ability to fight disease\nNew motivation to achieve goals\nRenewed gratitude\nBeing able to work with and harness the power of the moon is such a powerful spiritual tool, and when there is a real understanding of the phases, you can dig down into the many ways to amplify your mediumship and shamanic skills.\nFor me the ability to connect with yourself and spirit is very much the critical path to realising your spiritual goal and life's purpose, but if you add the ability to connect and build a humble relationship with the moon everything will increase tenfold.\nUnderstanding the different forms of meditation and practices will allow you to hook into the core phases and develop a relationship with your moon guides in a way that will resonate on so many different levels. Mediumship is a powerful tool to use to connect with spirit, but once we learn to amplify that connection with the power and beauty of the moon our spiritual toolbox opens allowing us to use all the wisdom, love and magic to help heal and raise the vibrations of those people who need it the most.\nI am proud and privileged to be working on this course with Sharon Ramel and together with our blended energies ensure that this course will truly help you advance along your spiritual pathway and get the spiritual results you so desire.\nKnow that, you are sheltered by the sky and the stars. Always there shining upon you.\nIf you're already a healer in any modality (eg. massage therapist, Reiki practitioner, etc) you'll be able to quickly apply and integrate these practices in your own life and work with them to provide healing to others.\nCertificates:\nWe offer you certificates in love and trust: They are a gift, not a right.\nPlease understand that NO personalisation requests will be considered.\nThe course name and images for my courses change semi-regularly - it is a way we instructors keep our courses looking fresh on Udemy.\nCourse certificates we issue will not necessarily have the exact wording or imagery currently on Udemy.\nThe only place to ask is through Udemy messages - I will not reply to external requests.\nIf you use a pseudonym on Udemy, you must request me first up to use your real name - otherwise, it stands as issued.\n#Shamanic #Psychic #Mediumship #Shamanism #MoonMagic #Manifestation",

These sacred tools will elevate your practice to new levels of insight and service.\nYou’ll also receive your attunement to the Karuna Ki Reiki Master Level through a guided meditation designed to align your energy field with the frequency of these higher vibrations. After the attunement, you'll be empowered not only to use the energy for healing but also to teach and attune others as a Karuna Ki Master Teacher.\nThroughout this course, you’ll find:\nStep-by-step lessons in simple, easy-to-understand language\nGuided meditations and practice exercises\nDownloadable resources, including a Karuna Ki Master Manual\nAttunement instructions and certification\nLifetime access and updates\nThis course is ideal for Reiki Practitioners who have already completed Usui Reiki Levels I, II, and Master/Teacher.

I did my first PLR session today. It was amazing! I followed your outline! After being a hypnotherapist since 2001, PLR got my client directly to the root cause of her issue even before I was done explaining the process and what is expected of her. My client informed me she has been in therapy for many years and this is the first time she was able to get such clarity. Thanks for creating this course and sharing your very valuable experience…\"\n“I have been involved in Hypnosis for more than 20 years, and Regressions for 15. I took this course kinda as a refresher. I was highly impressed with it's content, explanations, and insights. I Highly recommend this course for any looking or interested in Past Lives Regression! I truly feel it is an Excellent Course!”\n\"As a hypnotherapist I found this course very informative and a great addition to the work I already do. Having already completed a few other PLR courses, I have enjoyed and have gotten the most from this one. If you are a beginner and wanting to work with clients, you may also want to consider doing some other studies in hypnotherapy to increase your understanding and also to build upon the information in this wonderful informative and practical course.\"\n“I have been working with Quantum Healing and Hypnosis for a while, but I had a couple of unanswered questions...after taking this course I finally cleared all my doubts and am able to answer my client's questions without hesitation. Thanks for that.”\n“I am glad I purchased this course, the material is something that I have relied on to give a handful of others successful PLR sessions. The scripts provided are great and easy to adjust depending on the client. Highly recommend this course!”\nThis Udemy course comes with the Udemy Certificate of Completion.

Keep in mind that planets do not \"deliver\" something to everyone's house, only those who have the karma to get the supposed 'gift'.",

When used correctly, astrology provides a way of living with greater equilibrium and harmony.\nIt enables people to understand who they are. This can be a fascinating experience glimpsing into the essence of self.\nAstrology is a tool that leads us to develop a higher spiritual connection. It is a symbolic language.\nWe can say that the planets and additional aspects within the chart represents an individual’s, characteristics, traits, and talents. Think of a birth chart as a map, it represents the individual’s life and the person’s potential is represented by the place of birth, date, and time.\nWe all have a planet and sign that engages with the consciousness of the soul and with skilled interpretation, it can provide many answers to deeply rooted questions.\nA birth chart is unique, and it has the potential to tell them so much more about themselves. Think of an astrology chart as a blueprint.\nAstrology is complex and there is much to learn. The course is a combination of videos and an in depth training manual to cover all learning styles. There is a £15 admin fee (or your currency equivalent) if you wish to go ahead and have Karen’s certificate, which is different to the standard Udemy certificate - Details will be given in the course.\n\n\nOur easy to learn modules include:\nIntroduction to your Fully Accredited Astrology Foundation Certificate Course\nYour In depth downloadable training manual PDF\nWhat is Astrology?\nSun Signs\nRising Signs\nPlanets\nThe Aspects\nThe Houses\nFinal Summary & Assessment\nQualification & Accreditation\nAnd so much more!\nThis course is fully accredited by CTAA - Complementary Therapists Accredited Association & IHTCP - International Holistic Therapists & Course Providers.",

They are all outstanding! - Dave\nBeautiful course I learned so much. Especially about colors and chakras OMG!- Tamera\nI loved this course I have learnt so much - Renee\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nAs a qualified Massage Therapist (2012) and Usui Reiki Master Teacher (2014), I've been integrating my various energy healing techniques during my client massage sessions to produce profound outcomes on both a physical, emotional, and spiritual level.  As such, I have analysed and boiled down my key steps to create my very own Energy Healing Method technique!  I teach you how to do it in a simple format so you can integrate the steps into your own healing business!\nPlease keep in mind that whilst no experience in energy healing is required to take this course. However, I do expect that you are already trained and qualified in another healing modality - whether it's massage, chiropractic, physiotherapy, Reiki, and so on - so this means you understand the contraindications and professional requirements of your core service.\nBut keep in mind that my steps are so simple that any working healer can learn and benefit from using my Energy Healing Method!\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nThe PDF version of Melissa's The Energy Healing Method: Easy Integration Techniques for Massage Therapists & Professional Healers book (PDF)\nMelissa's Reiki-based Integration Steps Reference Poster (in the course book)\nA Human Chakra Poster (in the course book)\nChakra Guided Audio to use for Healing Sessions Script (in the course book)\nColour Healing Script (in the course book)\nMelissa's Guided Deep Calm Meditation Script ((in the course book)\nMelissa's Energy Healing Method Reference Steps Audio  Script (in the course book)\nOptional: Energy Healing Method Practitioner Certificate (PDF)\nOnce enrolled, you'll need to download my book: Energy Healing Method: Easy Integration Techniques for Massage Therapists & Professional Healers (PDF). The book has all the details and steps you'll need, and makes a great reference point during and after the course!\nAs you progress, you'll learn why I believe you're in the 'prime position' to make this world a better place, as well as the scientific fundamentals behind energy healing. From there you'll learn snippets of each of the techniques I use with my massage clients - then by the time you learn of all those - I'll teach you my entire Energy Healing Method steps!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, you'll have all that you need to start integrating my Energy Healing Method techniques with your core service! This means you'll be able to add more value - not just for your business, but to your client's overall well-being!\nFor existing healers, you'll be able to quickly apply and use these techniques with your current skills!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Energy Healing Method Final Exam.  Upon successful completion, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and a Digital Seal of Completion (JPG)!\nThe additional benefits of this course include making your own service more smooth and rewarding as well as being happier overall with yourself - which will in turn, further assist your desire to be successful while helping others heal!\nI hope you enjoy this exciting new journey sweet friend! #biglove",

      "description": "Reiki Course - Learn Traditional Japanese Reiki – 1st Degree (Beginners / Shoden)\n\n\nDiscover the 3 pillars of Reiki and receive a Lifetime Attunement to this amazing energy source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi and welcome to your course - “Traditional Japanese Reiki – 1st Degree (Beginners / Shoden)” course, here on Udemy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to learn the ancient art of traditional Japanese Reiki, by discovering it’s THREE Pillars and receiving a lifetime attunement to this amazing energy, so you not only benefit yourself from feelings of balance, connection, and clarity, but are able to treat and share this gift with friends and family, then this is the ideal course for you. Or as one student describes it:\n\n\n\"An interesting and exciting course on your journey through all aspects of Reiki. The course provides practical demonstrations on how to use the techniques you have learned. Watching the video demonstrations is both informative and relaxing to watch. An easy to follow course with follow up appointments and Attunement.\"\n\n\n· In this 3 hour, over 80 lecture training, I’ll be sharing with you…\n\n\n\n\n· The origins and journeys of Reiki, and your Reiki lineage.\n· Reiju, which will give you your lifetime attunement to reiki.\n· The Gassho Meditation, which helps you to create mental and emotional space.\n· The Gokai, which is the secret art of inviting happiness into your life.\n· Byosen, the technique for detecting and treating illness in the body.\n· Reiji Ho, the technique for tuning into your natural intuition.\n· Hatsurei Ho, the strengthening techniques for keeping your Reiki connection strong.\n· The Chakra system, the roadmap of subtle energy pathways in the body.\n\n\nWith this training, you will be able to…\n\n\n· Understand why there are so many different variations of Reiki teachings.\n· Connect fully with your soul journey, and achieve greater clarity of your life purpose.\n· Feel calmer and more aware of your emotions and thoughts.\n· Develop and practice the habit of happiness and focus on positive outcomes.\n· Perceive, detect, and treat illnesses daily, through the channelling of Reiki.\n· Ask yourself important questions and hear your inner wisdom in making personal decisions.\n· Strengthen your connection to Reiki, and Power-up treatments of yourself, friends, and family.\n· Detect blocks within your chakra system and bring balance to your subtle energy pathways.\n· Once understood and adopted, this will allow you to…\n· Effectively treat yourself, friends, and family by channelling Reiki.\n· Feel more confident, energized, and focused\n· Regain a sense of connection between yourself, your purpose, and the world around you.\n\n\nContinue your Reiki journey by enrolling in the next stage, Okuden initiation/2nd degree, after which you can offer your services to the public.\n\n\nUsing the teachings of traditional Japanese Reiki, and my practice as a Reiki Master Teacher, or Shihan, I’ve developed this course with the intention of teaching and empowering you to live life fully, through a deep understanding, and practical application of this amazing soul energy.\n\n\nThrough video training with me personally; workbooks, quizzes and training manuals for you to refer to after the course, I keep the science simple, the insight deep, and the practical application highly relevant. And it's not just valuable for beginners, or as Reiki Master and Teacher Jan Brocklehurst (USA) described it:\n\n\n\"Even though I am Master Reiki practitioner/Teacher the way it was taught in the West, I have learnt I feel for the first time exactly what Reiki energy is, explained so clearly. This has helped me feel more connected to my gift of Reiki.\"\n\n\nSo, simply click on the “Buy Course” button on this page, and you’ll be guided by me every step of the way from introduction through to completion and Attunement, and even beyond through on-line communication and regular updates, because I am committed to you not just learning, but benefiting from what you learn.\n\n\nYou see, I too was once at a point, where I was seriously lost and frustrated by the lack of purpose and progress in my own life, despite a deep desire to move beyond what I had created for myself through poor lifestyle choices and lack of self-care and love. Despite trying many philosophies and paths, it was Reiki that finally brought me the breakthrough I’d been desperately trying to achieve. It gave me a sense of compassion and understanding towards myself, and taught me the practices that delivered greater clarity, a stronger understanding of self, and the confidence to make choices that better served me on my life journey.\n\n\nI’m now blessed to have many private clients and students, who because of Reiki, are finally moving forward to happier, healthier lives. But, not everyone, through location or resources are able to attend my private classes, and through Udemy, I am now able to extend my reach, and touch many many more people in need of a breakthrough, or who seek to learn Reiki to treat themselves and/or friends and family, and learn to have a meaningful and compassionate relationship with themselves.\n\n\nIt's always great to be recognised for the quality and effectiveness of my work, as it allows me to adjust and refine so I can continue to improve this course. Travis Wade Mills, a Australian 18 year Reiki Course Veteran and Master himself says: \"I have been a Reiki Master for 18 years and have done many online Reiki Courses. This one by Jo is certainly at the top of the list for online Shoden (Reiki 1) training. A Simply stunning and informative approach to Reiki. I encourage all levels of Traditional  and Western Reiki to do this course.\"\n\n\nSo, if you’re willing to explore a new way of being, through an introduction to traditional Japanese Reiki, and are looking for a course that allows you to progress at your own pace, and still be supported remotely, that is designed to really deepen your understanding and connection…\n\n\nJust Click on the “Buy Course“ button on this page Now and let’s get YOU started on the road to a new and powerful journey!",

Get an inner clarity and connection that launches your healing path into action.\n* Are you an experienced healer at career crossroads, or a low point?\nDo you need to reconnect with your purpose as a healer, to get back the motivation, inspiration and confidence you once had?\nDo you need to disconnect from blocks that prevent you going up to the next level of creative and financial fulfillment?

And pre-talks to prepare for hypnotic inductions and guided meditations.\n1) Age Regression Hypnotherapy; to clarify the presenting issue and story in this life, that connects with past lives.\n2) Past Life Regression; to clarify the past lives causes, events and people, and begin to work with, or be at peace with, the karmic effects.\n3) Future Life Progression; to see how learning spiritual lessons effects our path into this life and the next, growing confidence, motivation and life purpose.\nCourse Highlights;\n- Case Study Exercises; guide you to write your own past life case studies, focusing on your journey as a healer over time.\n- Case Study Examples; from my past lives relating to healing, illustrating themes relevant to most healers.\n- Clarify your own goals with worksheets and interviews before sessions.\n- Understand each technique and key themes with pre and post session talks.\n- Experience three regressions to the Present, Past and Future lives.\n- Get therapeutic resolutions to enhance your core healing practice.\n* Your experiences can relate to my past lives connected to healing.\nIn this course, I will share details and spiritual themes of my past lives, including how they intertwine, teach lessons and resolve karma.\nOn my ‘Stages To Becoming A Healer,’ a set of connected lives all take place in India, but over 2,500 years in distinctly Buddhist, Hindu and British eras.\nOn my ‘The Healer’s Path’ we visit past lives to reconnect with abilities from the sleep temples of Egypt, remove blocks from a monastic life in Tibet, and find a soulmate from many lives who is vital to my progress as a healer in this life.\nThis Udemy course comes with the Udemy Certificate of Completion.

Spirituality is a core human need for personal development.\nWhat is this call to vision quest? What is the call of your spirit? Not your ego or personality! If you don't know right now, then breathe deep and listen. What the world needs more than ever before is people who are following their inner dreaming nature, calling spiritual healing into being. If your spirit is calling you to become a painter, plumber, pilot, or parent, that is correct. We are all asked to become warriors—fearless spiritual dreaming activists who listen rather than following for core self-development. This requires great courage, tenacity, and faith—faith in the natural world that is inside and around us. By using the concept of a vision quest you can discover all this and more. Once upon a time, you required to remove yourself to the wilderness for a multi-day fast - these days we can vision quest in many ways. I am here to show you how.\nHere you will learn how to reconnect with your shamanic dreaming heart, your vision quest will connect and ground you in your inner magic, gifting the messages of Spirit and spiritual healing for you and others. Improve your lifestyle the dreaming way.\nThis is true natural magic and is attainable by you.\nHow To Approach This Course:\nIt is ideal to commit to a schedule, add the same time into your calendar each week to watch one section at a time. Please complete all videos, read the PDF's and answer any assignments that help you to deepen your practice. Watch the video or listen to the audio, and practice the ceremonial aspects. Contemplate your growing practice. It is a great idea to review and to listen again and practice again from your emerging new awareness.\nWeekly is ideal. However, it may work better for you to take longer in between each section. The same is true of the opposite you may watch several parts at a time. This is your sacred journey.\nWhen a ceremony, teaching or practice touches you deeply or brings you to a new revelation or breakthrough, gift yourself an opportunity to pause and explore your experience\nI am one of the top Udemy Instructors in the Religion and Spirituality genre.

The majority of these are fake. We call them Certificate Mills. The only thing the “Mill” wishes to see from the instructor is money (ranging from 40 - 1500 dollars per course depending on the Mill) to pay for the process. They do not even wish to see 1 minute of any course nor any qualification an instructor may hold. You; the student is then sent to these places to pay them (more) money as the student. They commonly offer public liability insurance that you can get WITHOUT them and the fake fancy-looking Diploma.\nCertificates:\nI offer you certificates in love and trust: They are a gift, not a right.\nPlease understand that NO personalisation requests will be considered.\nThe course name and images for my courses change semi-regularly - it is a way we instructors keep our courses looking fresh on Udemy.\nCourse certificates I issue will not necessarily have the exact wording or imagery currently on Udemy.\nThe only place to ask is through Udemy messages - I will not reply to external requests.\nIf you use a pseudonym on Udemy, you must request me first up to use your real name - otherwise, it stands as issued.\n#VisionQuest #ShamanicJourneying #Shamanism #Meditation #Manifestation #Spirituality #Spiritual",

      "description": "Your Chakras are the energy centers of your body, mind and soul. You can't see electricity and chances are you can't see your Chakras, bun we know the power of electricity. We don't always understand our own power system.\nChakra healing and clearing is like changing the oil in your car, washing the sheets of your bed. If you don't look after your car, what happens? it breaks down. When those warm sheets come out of the dryer, what do you feel? That tonight, you are going to sleep in a nice, warm, comfortable bed.\n\nClearing your Chakras is like that. Every day, we are bombarded with tragedies on the nightly news Our boss or co-workers upset us. That car cuts us off. We walk in an electromagnetic soup that our ancestors couldn't dream of. Our food and drink choices aren't the best. All the trappings of modern life pollute our subtle energies.\nWe end up tired, depressed, obese, angry and lost.\nWhen you regularly clean your Chakras, you start reversing decades of abuse and begin tuning your body so it is a Lamborghini, instead of a 1960 Valiant, that hasn't had an oil change in 6 decades.\nIn this course, Jon will walk you through three sets of Chakra Healing exercises.\nThere are Seven Chakras:\nCrown\nEye\nThroat\nHeart\nSolar\nSacral\nBase\nThe exercises take short minutes and almost immediately, you will feel the blocked energies start to move in your body. Your friends and family will be asking you what you are doing as they will see the difference in you.\nAs you grow in knowledge and expertise through daily practice, you will tune into your body and start knowing which clearing and healing exercises you need right now.\nBe one of the first in the world to get lifetime access when you take this course today! You can count on me to answer every single discussion you post in the course and to do my best to help you to get through the challenges you are facing today in keeping your Chakras happily humming when you take this course today!",

      "description": "* Do some of your Past Life or Spiritual Healing clients;\nhave complex karmic issues, so it’s harder to come to a clean conclusion?\nhave multiple past lives, so each session raises more questions than answers?\nspontaneously go into a realm of unusually wise spiritual wisdom?\nhave a strongly spiritually orientated personality or presenting issue?\nIf so, these types of clients can benefit from an additional session or two of Between Lives Therapy (BLRT), that could also be called Advanced Past Life Regression Therapy (PLRT).\n* Are you interested in accessing spiritual wisdom, with a precise therapeutic structure and language?\nThis course can help put into words and focus your spiritual understandings, so it can be applied practically to help your clients spiritual insights and journey, and your own.\nA one hour audio session of BLR is included. You could use this to learn to be a therapist. Or you could take this course as an in-depth way of having your own online BLR session.\nCourse Highlights;\nGet a process to take clients through a session of Between Lives Regression Therapy (BLRT).\nGet a Script Book to use in session, and a Manual explaining many variations of response.\nGet a sixty minute BLRT audio session, to experience and learn to do BLR from the inside.\nGet two major case studies illustrating the entire BLRT process.\nLearn how to integrate BLRT with your Past Life and Hypnotherapy sessions.\nA Final Client Assessment form to ensure your clients and issues are appropriate for sessions.\nPast Life Regression (PLR) is a Prerequisite for Between Lives Regression Therapy (BLRT) - They Are Intertwined;\nBetween Lives is going Between the Present Life and the Past Lives. So most of your BLR clients will have already gone through past life, spiritual healing or hypnotherapy with age regression sessions before getting to BLR.\nSpiritual healers may find a background in past lives is enough, though extra formal therapeutic study may be helpful. If you are not already qualified in these areas, you can do my “Past Life Regression” and “Hypnotherapy with Age Regression” courses before doing this BLR course.\nBLR is a ‘Post-Requisite’ for PLR;\nBLR is the next logical and almost inevitable step to advance and deepen your Past Life Regression. Eventually in their career, PLR therapists will encounter BLR opportunities spontaneously, or get round to learning BLR.\nBLR and PLR Crossover;\nBLR and PLR are so closely related you could say BLR is more the other side of the coin to PLR, and less of a separate coin.\nIn PLR, we ‘break the bonds of time’, ’reframe’, and often manage karma implicitly. It is more efficient and easier for a newer PLR Therapist to use these straightforward techniques with most clients.\nIn BLR, we work with the next level of clients that benefit by addressing karma explicitly and deeply. It becomes more efficient to go to another level of wisdom that cuts to the core spiritual lessons.\nBLR’s Next Level;\nIn both PLR and BLR we meet the client's Spirit Guide for a life review. BLR extends the interaction with the Spirit Guide, and adds meetings with the Soul Group and the Soul Council. We have extended life reviews, and reviews of multiple lives that explicitly unravel complex karmic causes and affects. We add large sections on life previews and body selection. Crucially the therapeutic resolution now comes more from big picture spiritual lessons.\nCourse Structure and BLR Process;\nPreparation; Client Interview, Pre-Talk, Setting Expectations and Inductions.\nEntering BLR; BLR Deepeners. Past Life Regression to past death.\nSpirit Guides; Meeting guides. Life review. Personal karma.\nSoul Groups; Inner and outer. Interactive and collective karma.\nSoul Council; reviewing all aspects of BLR, especially reviewing past BLR, karma, life selection decisions and spiritual lessons.\nBody Selection and Spiritual Lessons; Explore the main purpose of BLR, and lessons learnt across multiple past lives and multiple life between lives.\nTherapy; Heal and take the therapeutic resolution into the present life.\nReviews For Between Lives Regression (BLR).\n\"Thank you for doing this course. After doing the hypnosis that you have recorded, I felt light headed and tingly. I asked my partner Christine Marie, and she confirmed energetically the changes. She told me my aura was getting lighter, and she then started working on my neck to permit the energy to flow through. Very thankful you offered this.\"\n\"High quality course, very thorough, amazing documentation, great tips... Thank you!”\n\"As a hypnotherapist and Author this is filling in some pieces of my life puzzle.\"\n\"Complete and well-structured course. It was very enjoyable to go through these lessons. Mark really knows his stuff, and is a very good communicator. I highly recommend this course for those interested in Life Between Lives Hypnotherapy.\"\n\"I have done all of Mark Beale's courses and they are just fantastic. I've learned a lot and I have had some amazing personal breakthroughs as well. Thank you Mark.\"\nReviews For “Past Life Regression (PLR)” - BLR’s ‘sister’ course.\n\"I'm amazed with this course. I'm already conversational hypnotist myself. Just listening to the audio I was able to view some of my past lives and benefit from it. Looking forward to take \"Life between life\" course. Thank you, Mark!”\n\"This was a very insightful and informative course! I am doing the Life between Lives course next! Thank you!\n\"This course was put together well. Was very well explained and easy to follow and I Love that there is a past life regression video at the end as well as various MP3s to download. Thank you”\n\"Very practical, very hands-on, I will know exactly what to do and what to say in a session as a therapist.\"\n\"As a hypnotherapist I found this course very informative and a great addition to the work I already do. Having already completed a few other PLR courses, I have enjoyed and have gotten the most from this one. If you are a beginner and wanting to work with clients, you may also want to consider doing some other studies in hypnotherapy to increase your understanding and also to build upon the information in this wonderful informative and practical course.\"\n\"This was a wonderful course explained in an easy to understand way. The tutor is so knowledgeable and covered everything you need to know about P.L.R and how to bring about healing. I liked that he was very spiritual. I am a newly qualified clinical hypnotherapist and spiritual Medium and healer and this course enlightened me as to how I want to work. Thank you.”\nThis Udemy course comes with the Udemy Certificate of Completion. There are no additional certificates from my Past Life Awakening Institute for courses taken on Udemy.\nCommon Thought; I’ve got my hands full learning and doing Past Life Regression - do I have to learn a whole new modality in Between Lives Regression Therapy?\nPersonally, I started off hesitant to learn another new modality in Between Lives Regression. When my clients experiences in session motivated me to learn, I was initially almost slightly disappointed with how similar Between Lives Regression was to Past Life Regression. But, then I became appreciative of how BLR did give me another unique tool so I could offer another valuable session type, and it made me better at PLR, I slightly regretted any delay in learning BLR. You could take this course as a way to give a new session type, or simply to enhance and advance current your Past Life Regression practice.",

This can occur during past life regression, hypnotherapy or many forms of spiritual healing like reiki and psychic sessions, or while doing psychic or mediumship work.\nNon-therapists to understand what is happening if they have spirit attachment issues, so they can do some simple releasement themselves, or seek out a therapist to help with a complex spirit releasement.\nUnderstanding SRT\nThe course focuses on identifying a range of spirits you can encounter in a therapeutic context, including Spirit Guides, Earthbound Spirits and Dark Force Entities (DFEs).\nWe then apply the appropriate initial releasement techniques, including help from the Rescue Spirits of Lights, Archangel Michael and the Spirit Guide of the client and therapist.\nThe means of spirit communication is mainly through the voice of your client, as spirits speak to your client. We cover therapy to heal the attachment, and ongoing therapy to go to the cause, and prevent future attachment.\nThe course uses a few teaching styles and includes;\nA Manual With Scripts And Dialogue; to use word-for-word in sessions.\nAudio Program - One Hour; a four part guided meditation to check for and release any simple spirit attachments.\nCases Studies; Major stories to illustrate the core techniques.

Thank you.\n\"An Amazing Course and great trainer. Now I will have the ability to help both client and spirit in my healing sessions.\"\n\"This course is really helpful when you are a naturopath and people with severe trauma related psychological problems come to your practice for help. The calm talking in his video lectures make the heavy stuff you get to learn nearly easy to digest. It makes it easier to distinguish between clients you have to send back to their GP in order to get a referral for psychological help, and those who can be helped with the knowledge from this course. So this course can lessen the anxiousness for getting heavy burdened clients in your practice.”\n\"After going right through this training for the second time its made me realize that the information provided is even richer in content than I first thought. It is also very clearly explained which has made it really easy for me to learn and integrate into my understanding. The audio and text resources are very useful and handy to refer back to if needed. I also like the neutral non-dual approach, this really resonates deeply with me. Excellent training Mark! Thanks so much :-)”",

      "description": "Hi and welcome to your “Traditional Japanese Reiki – 2nd Degree (Practitioner / Okuden)” course, here on Udemy.\n\n\nIf you are looking to develop your practice in the ancient art of traditional Japanese Reiki, by being given access to and using, THE THREE SACRED SYMBOLS OF OKUDEN practice, which will qualify you to offer these amazing energy treatments to the general public, so you not only benefit yourself from even greater feelings of balance and connection, but are able to create a thriving service, benefiting others with the same, then this is the ideal course for you.\n\n\nIn this personal and practice development training, that builds upon your learnings at 1st Degree / Shoden course, I’ll be sharing with you…\n\n\n· The original Japanese phrases and meanings specific to Okuden initiations.\n· Use of Kotodamas, the sacred sounds and chants of each symbol.\n· The meaning, connection and use of Choku Rei, which is the symbol and source of focus, power and strength.\n· The meaning, connection and use of Sei Heki, which is the symbol and source of emotional balance, memory and recall.\n· The magical formula, or Jumon, of Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen, which accesses our ability to transverse reiki through time and space.\n· Your personal Okuden attunement, scheduled at a mutually convenient time.\n· The basic requirements of setting up a professional Reiki practice, including legal, practical, administrative, and client attracting activities.\n\n\nWith this training, you will be able to…\n\n\n· Strengthen your own personal connection to Reiki even further\n· Strengthen your channelling of Reiki when giving treatments to others\n· Fully centre and ground yourself, reconnecting your sense of self to the world around you\n· Support the treatment of physical complaints such as cuts, burns and contusions\n· Provide deeper sense of emotional balance and peace to a troubled mind\n· Help to overcome unhelpful and unwanted habits and behaviours\n· Support clarity and focus in a busy mind, improving memory and recall\n· Direct Reiki to those in distant locations through remote transference\n· Support those moving on from past events, and provide strength in future endeavours\n· And most importantly, qualifies you to treat, and if so wish charge, members of the public.\n\n\nUsing the teachings of traditional Japanese Reiki, and my practice as a Reiki Master Teacher, or Shihan, I’ve developed this course with the intention of developing your ability to live life more fully, through an even deeper understanding, and refined practical application of this amazing soul energy.\n\n\nThrough video training with me personally, workbooks, quizzes and training manuals for you to refer to after the course, I keep the science simple, the insight deep, and the practical application highly relevant.\n\n\nSo, to enrol on this course, simply click on the “Buy Course” button on this page, and you’ll be guided by me every step of the way from introduction through to completion and Attunement, and even beyond through on-line communication and regular updates, because I am committed to you not just learning, but benefiting from what you learn.\n\n\nYou see, once I first started on my Reiki journey and committed to its practice, I began to see and feel the difference it made to me, and my life. Having then realised its potential, it just made perfect sense to deepen that practice and achieve even greater results.\n\n\nBut it wasn’t just about me! I realised that I was being given an opportunity to treat and serve others. And lifted by the love of helping others, I chose to follow this new path and become a Fully qualified Reiki practitioner, that allowed me to exchange my new gifts for donations and fees.\n\n\nYou don’t have to go that far of course, it’s entirely up to you whether you choose to apply this deeper understanding to yourself or create a thriving practice from it.\n\n\nI’m now blessed to have many private clients and students, who because of Reiki, are finally moving forward to happier, healthier lives. Some of them have followed in my footsteps and have become practitioners themselves, a few even becoming Reiki masters and Sensei’s, which I fully support. I love seeing that, because it just goes to show the power of Reiki in uncovering our true potential.\n\n\nBut, not everyone, through location or resources are able to attend my private classes, and through this On-line training, I am now able to extend my reach, and touch many more people in need of a breakthrough, or who seek to learn Reiki to treat themselves and/or friends and family.\n\n\nSo, if you’re willing to deepen your understanding and practice of Reiki, through a traditional Japanese approach, and looking for a course that allows you to progress to 2nd Degree Okuden, at your own pace, and still be supported remotely, that is designed to really maximise your skill and expertise…\n\n\nJust Click on the “Buy Course“ button on this page Now and let’s get YOU started on the next stage of this exciting and powerful journey!\n\n\nI'll see YOU again soon, on the inside of this training.",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\nThe clarity of explanation and selfless sharing of her knowledge is amazing. I enjoyed this class even more than the introductory hand mudras Melissa teaches. Namaste Melissa! – Greti\nAs always, I wish I could give Melissa 100 stars! – Vennita\nAnother great course from Melissa! I learnt so much from this course and found those hand mudras very practical :) Many many thanks – Wing Lun Liu\nMelissa does an amazing job, I have taken many of her courses and thoroughly enjoy all of them. She explains in detail for everyone to understand and very clearly. – Scott\nThis is an amazing course I wish I had of taken it much sooner. - Raven\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nAs the course name implies, you're about to discover a more varied series of healing hand gestures, most of which I consider more ‘advanced’ than what I teach in my introductory course, Learning the Power of Mudras: Energy Healing Hand Positions.\nBecause there are so many Hand Mudras which can aid in a multitude of ways (over 28 just in this course!), I’ve taken quite some time to correlate the hand positions with specific physical body systems, as well as emotional and energetic systems. I’ve done this to make future reference easier when you’re looking up which Mudra to use for a particular issue.\nWhat’s more, as you progress through the course, you won’t just build upon the catalogue of hand formations you can do. But will also learn to integrate healing crystals and powerful affirmations in conjunction with the Hand Mudras to make their efficacy even more profound.\nThis course will be your steadfast guide whether you’re doing a Hand Mudra for yourself, for a friend or client, or for your meditation or yoga group!\nPrerequisite note: To understand the contents of this course and be able to reference some of the more fundamental gestures I refer to in it, you must also have completed my introductory course: Energy Healing Hand Positions Mudra Course Certification.\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nOnce enrolled, you'll need to download the course book, written by Melissa: Advanced Hand Mudras (PDF). The book covers everything in great detail, including photos of the gestures for easy reference offline.\nAs you progress through this course, you'll learn the Hand Mudras for the physical body, emotional body, and spiritual body.  Then to help ensure you have everything you need to get the most out of this course, you'll learn a total of 29 Hand Mudras!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, you'll have all that you need to take your healing Hand Mudras to a whole new level, whether for yourself or for others!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Advanced Hand Mudras Final Exam.  Upon successful completion, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and a Digital Seal of Completion (JPG)!\nEnjoy your journey sweet friend. Big love!",

      "description": "What Is Energy Healing?\nEnergy healing is a method of restoring the harmonious flow of subtle energy in your body.\nModalities like reiki and Polarity therapy are positive albeit pricey methods of restoring the flow of subtle energy to your chakras or bio-field.\n\n\nBut There Are Other Ways\nSome methods requires you to contact angles and work with crystals.\nSome methods teach you how to attune each chakra one by one.\nSome use theta healing or pranic healing.\nAnd the then there are modalities that requires initiations. Although they call it attunements. (Think Reiki Certification 1, 2 and Master level) Those are initiations no matter how they try to re-word it.\n\n\nBut All These Paths Have One Thing In Common\nYou have to go inside your mind and activate some part of your energy body. Sounds easy enough but this is where most people fail. And the reason why is simple.\nThe Modern World is Hell Bent on keeping you distracted, stressed, tired and sick.  Our society doesn't play fair but that's ok.\n\n\nNeither Do We...\nSo what you're going to need is a direct connection to the living energy inside of you. Because if you can tap into that living energy it will be both your guide and power to change. And that’s what this course is going to show you how to do.\n\n\nBut Who Am I? And Why Should You Trust What Your Reading?\nMy name is Jayson Wiggins and I've been a practicing Reiki Master since 2014 but I don’t use Reiki except in name only. Because back in 2014 the woman who would attune me said to me\n\n\n“Why are you here there is nothing I can teach you?”\nAnd not to pick on Reiki I got a similar response when I was taking a class on Polarity Therapy back in 2011.\n\n\n“You already know what you’re doing Jayson”\nBut I didn’t know what I was doing. I wasn't a natural born clairvoyant or healer or anything else.\nBut years before I became interested in Energy healing. I had already tripped the secret to energy work. In fact, it was sitting on my computer desk I just didn’t realize it at the time.\n\n\nInstead, I Spent The Last Decade Going Down The Better Known Spiritual Paths\nI’ve studied and learned several meditation techniques.\nI’ve studied Massage therapy\nI learned Energy medicine including Polarity therapy and Reiki certification Master/Teacher\nI’ve also practiced ceremonial magic and was initiated into several esoteric orders.\nNow I’m not telling you this to impress you. But to impress upon you that I know what I’m talking about. And I know there is a faster better way to do Energy work.\n\n\nSo what's the Secret? The Secret is to use 4 well-known disciplines together making a system of learning that’s quick easy, and works every single time.  And in this course, I'm going to show you that system and you will learn it in one week.\n\n\nThat Sounds Nice Jayson But So What\nKindly tell me what will I (YOU) be able to do by the end of this course? (In 7 days)\n\n\nYou will know how to meditate in 7 minutes\nSo you can get all the benefits of meditation in less than half the time.\nYou will know how to recharge and balance your energy in harmonic resonance.\nSo you can Draw life-giving energy from the very air you breathe\nYou will know how to Construct Personal Energy Field (PEF)\nSo you can protect yourself from any negative energy or people you may come into contact with. You can also expand your energy field to send love and protection to whoever, whenever you want to.\nYou will know how to Release Restore and Revitalize your bio-electrical system.\nSo you can heal from past pain and draw the new energy back into you.\nYou will know how to Ask your inner intelligence about problem or situation and get the needed insight to deal with it and come out ahead.\nSo no question will go unanswered and no problem will go unsolved.\n\n\nYou're also going to get the research I did into how things like subtle energy, light body activation, frequency following response, biofeedback and like actually work.\n\n\nThis is an E-book worth of material by itself but it’s just as important that you get a feel for the work done in this field over the last few decades.\n\n\nAlso In The Bonus Section You Will Find Two More Interactive Meditations.\nAn Energy purification exercise to charge and cleans. And the other recording takes you in and out of expanded states of consciousness like a workout for your mind.\nSo let’s say you do nothing else but these two meditations on a regular basis like 3 times a week. Still even with just that bare minimum your abilities as a healer will improve by orders of magnitude without question.\n\n\nAnd we’re just talking about the Bonus Material!\n\n\nImportant Please Keep In Mind\nThis is an experienced based course. Which means that there is no theory or filler. No. This is about doing and learning by way of experience.\n\n\nBecause the point to all this is fueling and turning on the Starship. Also called Your light body Enregy Body ect..\nAnd once you have tapped into that live wire of living energy. You won’t find a better source of knowledge and power anywhere else on earth.\n\n\nAnd It's All Yours If You Can Get To It\nSo Let me show you How To Do Just That.\n\n\nI feel wonderful. I played your music in my office. I laid on my floor , closed my eyes and floated away. My brain feels like it had a massage. Wow. Thank you .\nThea,\n\n\nIf there is anything I can do to repay you for what your work has done for me please let me know. I am of modest means as I am a stay at home Mom but I am very grateful for the work you are doing.\nJoy Lee,",

        "You must have had some kind of experience with meditation and or energy work. Even if was a trial reiki session at a local community center. The point is that you have at least felt subtle energy in your body before."

I have paid hundreds of dollars for an in-person course for Reiki I and Reiki II, and honestly, I learned more in this course from Melissa than my other instructor.\" Maria\n\"I took a course in person with a Reiki Master for these 2 levels and paid a lot of money for them. I can honestly say that I actually learned MORE and in a more loving, precise way from THIS course than I did with my in-person teacher.\" Dawn\n\"I have learned so much more in this course than a course I took in person with another Reiki master! It's insane the amount of material that's provided here\" Rita V\n\"I have taken several courses through Udemy. You are the best teacher hands down.\" Betty Jo\n\"This was an incredible course!! The reiki coursebook alone is worth its weight in gold and is really easy to follow along and learn. I had done my reiki level 1 & 2 at an in-person workshop previously and I honestly learned more from this course with Melissa.\" Narelle\n\"I was not sure about the long-distance attunement at first, but it was very powerful and there was no doubt in my mind that I had received it.\"  Debbie\n\"I would give it 100☆'s if I could. Thank you\" Christine\n\"For me, this was a life-changing course ..this course is worth more than whatever you pay!\"  Michael\n\"I wish I could give this course a 10-star rating!\"  Amit\n\"If you take one Reiki course, take this one.

Teaching others comprises of so many other elements that it's been ‘broken’ it out into another course by Melissa Crowhurst called the Advanced Reiki Master Teacher course.

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY ACCREDITED & CERTIFIED\nIf you are a new students to POBA, Welcome!\nIf you are a returning student, Welcome Back!\nThis course is the perfect blend of both Charka Healing Education and Seichim Healing Education. The course seems almost literally broken into two halves and yet they pair so well together. Because Reiki is often the main source in which we come to know Seichim, yet so little is explained about Seichim, I found it necessary to go back to the roots of where it came from and understand how what happened to Patrick Zeigler in the pyramid, was integral to what Egypt understood about healing, humans, portals, dimensions and earths mysteries. So much of that is lost when it is paired with Reiki, and I did not learn that myself until I forced myself to separate them to understand what Seichim imparted to us uniquely from Reiki. In doing so, I learned a tremendous amount and the gift it awakened was paramount. This is what I wish to impart with you here. This course focuses on the awakening of healing and that it is being paired with Chakras, (Again, another pairing), lol, only this time they are literally separated from one another to show you their true nature, while also understanding how each nature of healing is similar because at its core it is about awakening into more of yourself as expressed in this and other realms. Some would even say, our natural state of being; energy!\nWhat you'll learn\nHow to Identify the First Seven Chakra's of the Body\nTo Know Zero Chakra\nTo Identify Spiritual & Galactic Chakra's\nTo Identify 24 Chakra's\nUnderstanding What the Chakra's Tell Us About Ourselves\nDiscussion on the Difference Between Reiki & Traditional Seichim\nUnderstanding Seichim Light Body Descriptions\nUnderstanding the Sacred Seichim Light Column Within and in Healing\nUnderstanding the Aura\nIntro to the Power of Sonic Healing (Sound & Vibration)\nDiscuss Megalithic Structures as Related to Ancient Knowledge of Energy and Sound Healing\nDiscussion on Ancient Mysteries and Communications Left Behind From Egyptian Hieroglyphs\nLearn to Use the Non-Tangible in Your Healing, Physically, Mentally and Spiritually\nBegin Your Sacred Awakening with the Knowledge of Ancient Magic, Portals & Dimensions\nUnderstanding the most important part of healing which is Awakening!\nWhat You Will Not Learn:\n· A Bodywork Session\n· Judgement of anyone’s way of practicing\n· Chakra & Seichim Healing Blended Together\nWho This Course Is For:\nAll Healers of Every Practice: Reiki Practitioners, Bodyworkers, Counselors, Therapists, Psychologists, Shamans, Ministers, Psychics, Energy Workers, Light Workers, Witches, Pagans, Wiccans, Other World Researchers, Chakra Healers, People on a Journey of Awakening, Those Studying Portals, Ancient Mysteries and Magic.

Yet, a recurring theme I've observed, especially in my mentorship programs, is a profound gap in connection, clarity, purpose, and awareness in the realm of spiritualism, especially psychic mediumship development.\nWhile many emphasize the final messages, the deeper essence of forging connections and nurturing relationships with both our inner selves and the spirit often remains unexplored.\nImagine a world where you're deeply attuned to your spiritual path, where nurturing your inner bond paves the way for a profound relationship with the spirit realm.\nI firmly believe that each of us possesses the innate ability to connect with the spirit. This course aims to demystify the journey, stripping away the complexities and misconceptions that have accumulated over time.\nI urge you not to let this opportunity slip by. Together, we can embark on a transformative journey, enabling you to emerge more grounded, enlightened, and in harmony with the universe. This course promises a paradigm shift in your spiritual perspective.\nWhile personal development courses abound on Udemy, the essence lies in choosing one that resonates deeply with your soul's calling.\nBut don't just rely on my words. Here are heartfelt testimonials from Ashley and Helen, showcasing the profound impact of this spiritual voyage:\nAshley Addison\n\"Julian, your teachings have been enlightening. A dear friend connected with me during the power meditation! The adage goes, 'When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.' I'm truly grateful to have found my guide in you.\"\nHelen Garofalo\n\"Julian's course is a revelation. His genuine, no-frills approach, devoid of gimmicks, is refreshing. His teachings, stemming from the heart, are lucid and impactful. The meditations he offers are transformative. Immense gratitude, Julian.\"\nEmbark on this spiritual odyssey today and witness your own transformative journey, akin to Ashley and Helen.\nWith love and light,\nJulian x",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\nAnother wonderful class from Melissa! I was looking for REIKI for specific physical issues to add to my sessions. This class came as a blessing from my favorite teacher Melissa! I love how clear, articulate and lovingly she explains each procedure. - Greti\nAmazing experience – Boski\nThis class is EXCELLENT! It took a few months to process as I experienced healing in every system. – Lori\nMelissa is such a wonderful teacher! I really appreciate her dedication to her students. She has guided me through so much, and if you have the chance, I would highly suggest taking her Reiki 1, 2 + Master and continuing your Reiki education with her. Melissa is the number one online Reiki teacher and I would venture to say the number one. Thank you, Melissa, for being a guiding light. – Melinda\nThank you Melissa for this eye-opening course! This definitely brought my Reiki learning experience to the next level. The method sets covered in the course were explained in great and clear details and they are all very practical. I thought it would be extremely helpful if you can add a summary table at a glance that cover the relevant hand placements, chakras and Reiki symbols for easy reference. Thanks again and can't wait to learn from you on another topic! Wing Lun Liu\n\n\n== WHAT TO EXPECT ==\nThere are countless options and techniques available to use when doing a Reiki energy healing session. And it’s exactly that – the extensive treasure-trove of possibilities – which makes the Reiki method so effective and appealing. However, it’s that same expansive catalogue of choices that makes deciding what to do a difficult thing.\nSo how does a Reiki energy healer decide what to do for a session? Well, you're about to find out!\nBringing together my decades of experience and knowledge, I answer this exact question - \"What should I do?\" - in this book. I'll even give you my step-by-step \"Method Sets\" as a guide for you to learn with, expand upon, and use across all the physical body systems. Add to that, you'll find this to be an invaluable reference guide and resource which will save you both time and energy for your sessions.\nThis is an Advanced Reiki Specialty course which specifically focuses on working with the 11 Physical Bodily Systems.\n\n*Prerequisite note: To understand the contents of this course, be able to go along with the practice sessions, and be able to obtain my accredited certification upon completion, you must already hold a verifiable Reiki Master qualification *before* you begin the course.\n== WHAT'S INCLUDED ==\nOnce enrolled, you'll need to download the course book: Energy Healing Through Reiki: Physical Body Systems Specialty (PDF). The book covers everything in great detail, including the step-by-step processes for easy reference offline.\nAs you progress through this course, I will provide deeply profound context as to how and why the Reiki (energy) healing method actually works.  Then to help ensure you have everything you need to get the most out of this course, you'll be able to download my Method Set Practice Worksheets (PDF) so it's easier for you to practice each one.  Furthermore, to help those working practitioners out there, I'll also provide my Method Set Practice Session Audios (on others) in MP3 format.\nThen after you've completed the entire course, you'll have elevated and evolved your skills well beyond what you ever thought you could - all while helping yourself and others in the process!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Reiki Healing Physical Body Systems Specialty Final Exam.  Upon successful completion, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and a Digital Seal of Completion (JPG)!\nEnjoy your journey sweet friend. Big love!",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\n\"Loved this course! Melissa is an amazing instructor. I have taken a couple of her courses & have purchased more already\" - Lisa\n\"Excellent teacher! I've always tried to read and learn about chakras, and she made it so easy yet comprehensive to understand! I loved the course!\" - Jana\n\"Another amazing and enlightening course from Melissa. Although the course is short it is packed full of all the information that is needed and presented beautifully.\" – Sarah\n\"Amazing experience\" - Carmen\n\"What an AMAZING course and instructor!\" - Robin\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nPerhaps you work long hours? Are a busy parent juggling a lot of tasks? A practicing healer looking for another way to amplify your efforts? Or just can't focus that easily on your own? Regardless of the situation, I created this course so anybody can learn, especially for those who don't have a lot of time to put towards meditation and self-reflection.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to identify the issues at hand, understand how they're related to blocked energy areas in your body, then be able to focus on clearing the associated Chakra(s), so you can feel better, fast! What's more, you don't need any experience to learn these simple techniques - and - they're quick and easy!\nPlease note that this is not an intricately 'in-depth' course on Chakras, it's a course to help you easily learn and quickly implement healing, be it on yourself or others!\n\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nThe course covers the basics about what energy healing is, teaches what chakras are and how they're connected to your physical being, and then guides you to use the in-course micro-meditations for each area in order to 'heal on demand'!\nAs with all my courses, I've designed this one to be self-paced and completely digital, so you can go as slowly or as quickly as you like. Using the tools I provide here, if you only have a few minutes every now and then, even that will do you a world of good!\nOnce enrolled, just download the course handbook, written by Melissa: Chakra Healing on Demand (PDF). The book is set up in a 'quick reference' style, so you can get right to what you need to do without having to 'dig' for the information! There is a Human Chakra Poster (A4 PDF) to download so you can quickly learn Chakra locations and then identify the areas of concern.\nThe true core of this course are the seven (7) lovely Chakra Micro-meditation. Once you listen to them (when needed) they'll be the key to helping you feel better fast! Even if you skip everything else and just use those meditation lectures, they're quick, easy (and relaxing!) and will guide you towards unblocking that specific location of concern.\nWhat's more, I provide you with the wonderful additional learning tools such as affirmations and healing scripts to use if you'd like to record your own meditation, or to use to read aloud to friends, family or your clients! You'll also be able to use my 5 Minute Guided Meditation (via a video lecture) to help relax in stressful times. And then to top it off - I've combined all the micro-meditations into a single, beautiful longer \"All Chakras\" meditation for when you're able to spend a little bit more time on healing yourself! The \"All Chakras\" meditation lecture can be used as a general healing tool, or just as an ongoing meditation - almost like 'maintenance' for your mind, body and soul!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Chakra Healing Final Exam  Upon successful completion, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and a Digital Seal of Completion (JPG)!\nSome of the additional benefits of this course include being able to create more 'mental space' in short periods of time, release stress, be more centred and calm in your everyday life, achieve more spiritual awareness and even be able to attract abundance into your life - and much more! Remember, if you (or your client) can feel better - even for a moment - that's one moment our glorious world is more harmonious than it was before!\nEnjoy the journey sweet soul, big love!",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\nMelissa is extraordinary in her teaching. Clear and concise explanations make it all come together just as easy as 1-2-3. And what can I say but \"thank-you, thank-you, thank-you - ever so much\". Mya-Lia\nThis definitely is not only an awesome course but an extremely important course, if you want to practice in the energy healing field. Protecting and restoring your own energy is CRITICAL, in order to be effective. I find that Melissa does an incredible and thorough job at explaining all you need to know. The practice and becoming an expert cannot be taught and is up to you. For anything to do with Natural Healing, I would 100% of the time always check what Melissa (Natural Healer) has to offer for learning before going anywhere else. Her courses are incredible and Energy Protection is a must. – Daniel\nI really enjoyed the course and saw the difference in my own energy and energy within my home. – Haleh\nI love the way Melissa teaches. Very easy to follow and informative. It has helped my life immensely. Energy work has greatly improved my overall well-being and understanding. This course has helped me to recognize what is depleting my energy and how to protect it. In just a short amount of time, I am feeling better. - Lorrie\n\n\nFor years I've been asked \"How do you protect yourself?\" energetically speaking, given the number of healing sessions and student attunement ceremonies I do each week. In response to that, I found myself explaining in bits & pieces here and there, and only to those who asked.\nWhilst I teach simple protection steps in most of my courses, it became apparent that I needed to look closely at my routine (which has just become second-nature over time), document it, and share it with others. I've not just done this \"deep dive\" into protection for my fellow Reiki practitioners and energy healers, but also for those who work in emotionally demanding jobs (such as healthcare workers) and for those who are really sensitive to the negative energy of others (such as empaths), so here we are!\nThese techniques are ones I use everyday in what I call Energetic Protection. In this course, you'll learn what energy is and how you fit into the Energy Field, how to engage and listen to your intuition, identify the source of the negativity,  how to use specific tools and techniques for protection, how to restore your energy, as well go through my step-by-step process in order to safeguard that beautiful energy of yours!\nTo help you learn all my energetic protection steps, your enrollment comes with a 100+ page handbook (PDF), plus a helpful worksheet example, and step-by-step protection techniques.\nBy the end of our journey together, you’ll be able to implement protection steps that help preserve and restore your energy levels so you can live your best life, every day.\nFor existing students and graduates, you'll see a little bit of 'cross-over' in some sections. But the protection material here goes deeper (with more detail) than any of my other courses - as well as includes a significant amount of new helpful content, too! In short, the skills you pick up from this course will be a wonderful way to safeguard your healing gifts!\nPlease note: Completing this course does not qualify the graduate in any particular type of healing modality  - it's purely a 'deep dive' into the energetic protection component of life. As such, it's a 'no experience required' course for everyone, but would be considered 'further learning' for those who are Reiki practitioners, energy healers, empaths, therapists, or healthcare workers.",

      "description": "Embrace Healing Through Family Constellations Therapy\n\n\nUncover the profound impact of generational imbalances that silently shape your life. Family Constellations Therapy delves into the depths of the past, seeking to restore balance by addressing unconscious family dynamics.\n\n\nUnlike conventional therapies, this approach offers swift transformation without dwelling on blame or resentment toward your parents. Instead, it empowers you to accept them as they are and chart a course towards your brightest future.\n\n\nFamilies, like intricate social systems, develop unique patterns and habits spanning generations to ensure their survival. Yet, the \"orders of love\" governing these systems can be disrupted. Such disruption leads to anxiety, illnesses, career setbacks, destructive relationships, and more—echoing across generations until harmony is restored.\n\n\nThese natural laws spare no one, dictating how we live and how we pass. When balanced, they usher in peace and unity.\n\n\nAs Bert Hellinger, the renowned psychotherapist and developer of this technique, observed, many pains stem from subconscious, deeply ingrained separations. These separations cast shadows, traumatizing entire families.\n\n\nExplore the undeniable truths:\n\n\nAbandonments\nAbortions\nAdoptions\nDeath of a Child\nDivorce\nMiscarriages\nMurder\nSuicide\nWars\n\n\nOur course is designed to catalyze immediate change in your life.\n\n\nBooking a Session:\n\n\nVisit my website, click \"Sessions for Students,\" select a date and time, and complete your payment. You'll receive a Google Meet link. Students enjoy a great discount.\nUnlock healing with my book:  \"Heal the Presence of the Past.\"\n\n\nInstagram - @systemictherapist\nMy website is christinabucherDOTcom",

Thus, both time is saved and the intensity of the healing energy increases.\n\n\nYOUR FREQUENCY RISES IN HEALING: With the Grandmaster stage, your energy level rises considerably.\n\n\nASTRAL TRAVEL: With the DAI SHO WA and DAI FA SHU symbols of the grandmaster stage, astral travel can be done more easily.\n\n\nWE CAN CREATE A CIRCLE OF DIVINE PROTECTION: With the Dai Fa Shu symbol, a circle of divine protection is created. With this circle of protection, everything can be protected from all negative energies, phenomena and events.\n\n\nThe Grand Master Reiki levels are said to be complementary and continuation of the Usui Reiki Master/Teacher level. It is not a continuation of Usui Reiki from Mikao Usui. In recent years, reiki masters are very powerful GrandMaster Reiki levels that they have stated that they are continuing various researches and continuation as a channel of the same energy.\n\n\nGrand Master Reiki levels are determined from level 5 to level 22.\n\n\nThe term Grandmaster is of course subjective and is used to imply that they are additional to the Reiki Master level, which is a prerequisite of working with the Reiki Grandmaster attunements. True mastery, of any endeavor, takes time, practice, patience and dedication. However, working with these levels is often an exciting and rewarding journey that may reveal many personal discoveries.",

      "description": "What is a Tarot Mystic?\nTo me, a Tarot mystic is someone who combines the meaning of the cards with a deeper level of spiritual understanding. We are spiritual beings living in physical form, and we are here to live inspired lives and to expand in consciousness. But the journey is not easy. There are lessons to learn and pitfalls to avoid, and the spiritual expansion comes from the wisdom we gain from all of our life experiences.\nUsing Tarot as a Tool\nThe Tarot is a tool that can help us walk through life with greater ease by clarifying what is really going on. The clarification can happen in two ways; by interpreting the meaning of the cards, or even better, by sharing your understanding of what each card means on a certain level of consciousness. The insight about this came to me as a Spirit download where I was shown how the Tarot is connects to the Chakras. Did you know that each card from 1-10 creates a story that shows what lessons we are here to learn? I'll tell you all about it in the course...\nThe Story of the Cards\nOnce you know the story of the cards, you'll never have to memorize them again, because the story will help you remember the meanings. If you wish, you can also combine the Tarot with oracle cards, as well as birth card combinations and primary life challenges. This is where you become the mystic. The Tarot mystic can reveal wisdom and insights that you don't normally get from an ordinary Tarot reading because the mystic has connected the dots and discovered the bigger picture.\nAchieve a New Level of Confidence and Skill\nIn this course I take you on a spiritual journey where the Tarot is your guide and the journey represents life itself. By the time you finish the course, you'll have all the tools you need to create unforgettable, one-of-a-kind readings for yourself and your clients. By learning the cards, asking the right questions and creating unique spreads for each client, you'll find that the Tarot is the perfect tool for reflecting the truth they are seeking. All we have to do is connect the dots, and this course will give you the confidence and skill to do exactly that. So dive in, and you'll discover a whole different side of the Tarot...",

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED\nFor students who are new here, welcome! For those of you returning to class, welcome back. There are several channeling courses I have online already. They are:\nCertified Resolution Therapist & Soul Provider| ACCREDITED\nCertified Channeler| Understanding the Process| ACCREDITED\nResolution is a step by step on how to take a client or yourself through a 5-week illumination healing to transform your life, and others to transform their lives. This comes with exact session guides.\nCertified Channeler is the beginning stage of watching me go through getting comfortable with the process I was not comfortable with at all and seeing me develop it and channel in front of you.\nThis new course dives deeper into the top three things that are the most important in channeling & the questions I receive the most.\nUnderstanding what channeling is\nHow to tap into the channel of channeling\nHow to trust yourself spiritually and what you receive\nFollowing these lectures are ancient, channeled messages from a light-being named Euclytus. These tapes were almost lost by outdated technology and were preserved so that more may hear these intense messages of wisdom throughout the ages, on topics such as:\nHow to deal with death, addiction and recovery\nThe Central Sun and Mt. Shasta\nThe luminous energy field & light technology\nSelf-protection and using weight to protect ourselves\nGeneral questions about life\nOur DNA and Reincarnation\nThe nature of time\nDiscussion about animals\nPast Lives\nCreating realities and the challenges of living on this energy grid and more\nThe world has begun to understand channeling more each day as we begin to understand our true nature is less physical than we have thought previously. As this world has begun to vibrate at a higher level, many are beginning to awaken and open themselves to understating the light wisdom coming through them and wish to engage it more. If you are a medium, energy worker, empath or someone who has struggled with taking on energy of others and the planet, you may have already been channeling and you most likely are a healer. Channeling not only helps you to tap into the beyond, but more importantly helps you tap in to the within and will help you in your healing practice of giving as well as receiving.\nSee you in class.\nLove & Light,\nSufi",

Thank you Marisa for making the quantum jump so easy. This is a must for all. Absolutely grateful. I am now reaching my greatness. I am so grateful to have this powerful magic tool. Thanking You Marisa for sharing with us..Xx \" Vicky Makris Melbourne, Australia\n\nDo you want to live a better life? Is there a better version of you in a parallel timeline? Fast track your life using the new, elevated earth energies for your Quantum Jump. Discover how to Quantum Jump to a Parallel Timeline of your choosing.\nYou create a new reality of your choosing:\nFinancial abundance\nSelf-love and confidence\nLoving relationships\nSoulmate connection\nHealth and vitality, etc.\nWhat is Quantum Jumping?\nQuantum Jumping is a process where you project a desired result or state of being that is different from your existing situation. By observing the new reality and changing your energetic state, this will initiate a shift into that alternate reality.\nTo catapult your jump/shift to a new reality, this Quantum Jump uses advanced energy techniques to bring coherence to the brain waves in gamma, beta, alpha, theta and delta for your desired outcome.\nThe idea behind quantum jumping is that you are living in a multiverse of parallel universes. Usually, these alternate realities have no connection to one another.\nConnecting to other timelines\nThe connection is so complete that you can walk into another place and time. Even though both of “you” still exists in the Universe, your awareness of the new reality merges in your current reality, often leaving the other out of reach, out of sight, and out of mind.\nThe jump can occur through a wormhole through time and space—this connection forms a bridge that allows you to experience a quantum jump to end up in another reality physically.\nTo experience positive and powerful quantum jumps, you must practice a conscious state of love and fearlessness while taking affirmative action in keeping with the reality of your desires.\nThis Quantum Jump includes an advanced healing protocol that energetically moves you to a different timeline of the things you want. You can decide which area of timeline you want to parallel jump.\nWhat type of energy is utilised in the Quantum Jump?\nThis Quantum Jump is designed so the changes occur safely without any healing crisis or adverse effects. It is intended to release only the right amount of energy to enter your energy field that will give flow and a positive outcome.\nThe Universal energy is directly accessed to gain assistance from the Guardians, enlightened beings, and ensures it contains the organic, source energy.\nAs Dr Joe Dispenza says “If you want to change a belief or perception, you have to first change your state of being. And changing your state of being means changing your energy because in order for you to affect matter, you have to become more energy and less matter, more wave and less particle.”\nConnecting to the right energy\nThe Quantum Jump is connected to the powerful energy of the Forensic Healing system which Marisa has spent years cultivating. Forensic Healing attracts the most amazing, powerful healers in the world.\nIn Forensic Healing community, we maintain a positive energy policy, so the energy stays in integrity and offers powerful life-changing experiences. It is necessary to ensure your energy is aligned more than 50% of your desired outcome, so it doesn't cause a healing crisis due to the contrast in energy.\nAs a healing crisis can be a side effect of healing, this Quantum Jump contains safety guards, so your transition occurs smoothly, without side-effects. The more you work through these processes, the more effective the changes will be.\nQuantum Jump to a Parallel Timeline includes:\nVideo 1 Introduction and explanation of the Quantum Jump\nThis video contains a brief introduction to Marisa Russo, the explanation of a quantum jump, and the energy used behind it.\nVideo 2 How the Quantum Jump works\nThis video describes/explains the statements and meanings in the Quantum Jump to a Parallel Timeline protocol.\nVideo 3 Quantum Jump Examples\nThis video is a brief snapshot of Marisa when she Quantum Jumps her clients to a new reality. It shows how people with decades of health problems can Quantum Jump into a new reality of well-being in minutes.\nVideo 4 Experience the Quantum Jump\nThis video contains the Quantum Jump to a New Timeline protocol for you to directly receive into your energy field.\nBONUS: This includes a copy of the Quantum Jump Protocol for yourself and a Quantum Jump Protocol if you are a practitioner. Plus an article on Quantum Jumping, the science behind it, types of Quantum Jumping and how to catapult your Quantum Jump\nVideo 5 Where to from here?\nThis explanation video provides the steps to continue your Quantum Jumping to a new Timeline.\nVideo 6 Morning meditation\nThis morning nine-minute meditation creates and infuses the right energy for your day to be amazing and positive to catapult the effects of the Quantum Jump.\nVideo 7 Bonus: Evening meditation\nThis video contains a twenty-minute evening meditation you can play before bed or play while you fall asleep to enter your consciousness to reprogram your mind for a new reality. This meditation is recommended that you use in conjunction with the Quantum Jump protocol to advance your results.",

Thank you so much, Astrid! \"\n\n\n\" I am really enjoying this course. So many questions answered and explained in an easy way to understand. I almost did not take it but decided to at the last minute. I have had several extensive courses on this subject, and they have been very pricey as well as hard to comprehend at times. This course by far is the most enjoyable one I have taken! \"\n\n\n\" Great match for me! I'm an energy worker, astrologer, witch, and intuitive guide so I have plenty of experience journeying, being in non-physical reality etc. I took this course because I have felt a calling to the Akasha for a while now and I've accidentally accessed it a few times so I wanted a more structured approach for me to be able to integrate in my practice. Astrid is the best! \"\n\n\n\" I have taken a few other course on the subject, and she delivers hours more worth of valuable information. Her calm demeanor, and humor along the way are a nice touch. I learned so much and feel confident. \"\n\n\n\n\nAstrid aka The Psychic Witch\nAstrid aka The Psychic Witch is an acclaimed Tarot reader, radio show host, and magician with over 10 years of experience teaching spiritual topics.\nCombining ancient knowledge with modern, edge psychology and coaching, she's creating easy-to-follow courses, offering deep knowledge that's explained without unnecessary complexity and occult bias.\nShe has experience teaching physical classes in London, as well as many years of sharing her knowledge online.\nShe worked as a spiritual advisor for renowned clients, such as Tower of London, Penguin Publishing House, Park Plaza Hotel Westminster, Sternberg Clarke Entertainment, and many others and her courses are continuously \"Bestselling\" on Udemy.",

Energy is truly everything and I share from my heart on how tuning into your energy field and chakras can revolutionize your health. You are more than a physical body as you have an energy body as well and this energy body determines how you feel, how people respond to you. The chakras are seven bodily energy centers which move from the base of the spine to the top of the head. There are seven main chakras, from top to bottom: the root chakra, the sacral chakra, the solar plexus chakra, the heart chakra, the throat chakra, the third eye chakra and the crown chakra.\nThe chakras are seven bodily energy centers which move from the base of the spine to the top of the head. The word “chakra” is derived from the Sanskrit word for “wheel”, The spinning wheel concept specifies that they are moving, active, vibrating energy points found in living Beings!\nThis is for everyone who are enthusiastic about developing self-mastery and inner healing abilities. You’ll learn about each chakra’s individual characteristics and the possible causes for energy blocks, as well as what happens to your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health when your chakras are in or out of harmony.\nThese seven primary chakras include:\n· Muladhara (root chakra): This chakra is at the bottom of the spine, between the anus and genitals. It purportedly influences the basic urges of sex, food, sleep, and self-preservation.\n· Svadhisthana (sacral chakra): Located at the pelvis, this chakra influences the regulation of emotions and desires.\n· Manipura (Solar plexus chakra): This chakra is just below the navel. Strength in this chakra aids digestion and the ability to process life’s experiences.\n· Anahata (heart chakra): This chakra is located at the heart, and its purpose is to help a person connect with unconditional love.\n· Vishuddha (throat chakra): Positioned at the pit of the throat, this chakra’s function is authenticity and personal expression.\n· Ajna (third eye chakra): Located between the eyebrows, this chakra is a seat of inner knowledge and consciousness.\n· Sahasrara (crown chakra): Located just above the top of the head, this chakra’s role is to promote a more enlightened approach to the world.\nThis course is an in-depth dive into one of the most practical systems of spirituality, and will explain how the health of your energy body affects every part of your life. This chakra course will empower you to heal blockages in your energy body, regain your balance in areas of your life that need attention, and gain a deeper appreciation for yourself and others around you.\nThe chakras are seven bodily energy centers which move from the base of the spine to the top of the head.

You’ll learn about each chakra’s individual characteristics and the possible causes for energy blocks, as well as what happens to your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health when your chakras are in or out of harmony.\nChakras store the energy of thoughts, feelings, memories, experiences, and actions. They influence and direct our present and future mindset, behavior, emotional health, and actions. The life force in each chakra can be processed, transmuted and released so that we consciously manifest what we want to call in, rather than experience more of the same. Chakra healing is the intentional practice of connecting with our stored energy, so we may understand how our past is influencing the present and the future. Prana informs us, and influences our actions and behaviors, determining our health, career opportunities, relationships, and more. The subtle body depicts how our inner reality creates our outer reality.\nThe Chakras of Matter\nEach chakra holds the beliefs, emotions, and memories related to specific areas of our life. The lower chakras are related to Earthly matters such as survival, sex, and power. The top three chakras are related to higher consciousness, truth, intuition, and purpose. In the middle, the heart chakra bridges the two worlds with empathy, love, and compassion.\nThis course is an in-depth dive into one of the most practical systems of spirituality, and will explain how the health of your energy body affects every part of your life.

The connection between glands and chakras represents a link between the energy points in your body to the physiological and physical functions. Another useful entry point for chakra healing is the nervous system which is connected to glands and organs in multiple ways and at multiple points. A chakra healing session is ideally begun by calming the nerves and then targeting a particular gland and/or chakra. By understanding the connection between chakras and the glands, you can use healing in different ways that will help you overcome physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual issues in your body and mind. Connecting the chakras and the glands will help in your overall well-being.\nCOLOR THERAPY COURSE\nColor Therapy: Improve Life with Color Therapy Certification Course\nUse the power of Color Therapy; work with colors, Color Therapy Certification Course!\nIn color there is life.

Everyone has a favorite. Everyone is also affected by colors, often more than realized. Color is intimately tied to all aspects of our lives. It has even become a significant part of our language. Colors are usually broken down into three categories. First, there are the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue. From a mixture of these three will come most of the other colors: secondary colors are formed from combinations of the primary colors; tertiary colors are formed by combinations of the primary and secondary colors. Colors are neither good nor bad. Each color has particular properties relating to physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual states of being. Colors can be stimulating or depressing, constructive or destructive, attractive or repellent. They affect us more profoundly than we realize, a factor that becomes evident in the language we use to describe sensations, emotions, and situations.\nColor Therapy is a harmonizing therapy which uses color to promote health and well-being and while it is used as a separate therapy, it is also a perfect therapy to aid standard treatments and to boost the healing process. This course is ideal to complement any existing therapy skills you already have or to incorporate it as a healing therapy itself.\nThis course has a very practical approach towards color therapy so you can start practicing it immediately after going through the lectures. Learn how you can begin enjoying the freedom found through a higher awareness of energy. Colors have already been used to heal and shelter mankind throughout the centuries. White, for example, has been used in hospitals and churches for its purity and cleanliness. Black has been used for mourning our deceased. Learn about the energy of each Color and how to use them in your life. Color is an important tool that we can use to complement healing. We all are surrounded by colors and using Color is an important element in your healing or in some other aspect of your life. You will be able to use color therapy to treat diseases, empower yourself and will feel much more relaxed and calmer.\nColor Therapy is a harmonizing therapy which uses color to promote health and well-being and while it is used as a separate therapy, it is also a perfect therapy to aid standard treatments and to boost the healing process. This course is ideal to complement any existing therapy skills you already have or to incorporate it as a healing therapy itself. I will also discuss about Chakras & Color Therapy in This Course!\nRed - Active, passionate\nYellow - Positive, happy\nBlue - Reflective, calm\nGreen - Natural, growth\nBlack - Strong, assertive\nWhite - Spiritual, pure\nThis course provides an in-depth exploration of Chakra healing and Color Therapy, blending these two powerful practices to support profound transformation and wellness. Rooted in ancient spiritual and healing traditions, the Chakra system and Color Therapy offer unique approaches to enhancing the body’s energetic and physical balance. Chakras, originating in early Hindu and Buddhist practices, are seen as the body’s primary energy centers, with each of the seven Chakras positioned along the spine. Each Chakra corresponds to different physical organs, emotional states, and spiritual attributes. When balanced, these Chakras allow life force energy, or “prana,” to flow freely, which is essential for mental clarity, emotional resilience, and physical health. In this course, students will learn how each Chakra connects to specific energies and how those energies influence every part of our lives, from our sense of safety and security at the Root Chakra to our sense of connection with the divine at the Crown Chakra.\nColor Therapy, which has roots in ancient Egyptian, Indian, and Greek cultures, involves using specific colors to influence mood, heal physical ailments, and promote emotional well-being. Each color vibrates at a unique frequency, which resonates with different energy centers in the body. Colors like red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet directly correspond to each of the seven Chakras, aligning with their unique vibrations. This course covers the therapeutic application of each color in the Chakra system, teaching students to use color’s vibrational qualities to enhance each Chakra's function and balance. For example, red is used in Color Therapy to stimulate and ground the Root Chakra, which governs our sense of safety, stability, and connection to the physical world. Green, associated with the Heart Chakra, is used to open up feelings of love, compassion, and emotional healing. By using Color Therapy, students can strengthen, unblock, or calm the Chakras as needed, creating a targeted approach to energy healing that allows specific physical, emotional, or spiritual imbalances to be addressed.\nThis course combines Chakra healing with Color Therapy in a practical and accessible way, providing tools that can be integrated into everyday life and professional practices. The benefits of learning to balance Chakras with Color Therapy are vast, and this course covers how specific colors can be used in different settings to foster specific emotional and energetic outcomes. Students will learn, for instance, how blue can help calm an overactive Throat Chakra, fostering better communication and emotional expression, or how indigo can be used to open and energize the Third Eye Chakra, increasing intuition and spiritual insight. Each Chakra-color combination serves a distinct purpose, and by the end of the course, students will know how to use colors to realign their energy and create balance across body, mind, and spirit. This dual approach offers a gentle, non-invasive path to healing, where color frequencies work with the Chakras to resolve issues from within, tapping into the body’s natural ability to heal itself.\nIn our modern, fast-paced world, Chakra healing and Color Therapy provide a meaningful way to cope with stress, anxiety, and imbalances. The resurgence of Color Therapy, now often used in interior design, marketing, and wellness centers, speaks to how deeply colors affect us. Colors are powerful psychological tools, and learning how they relate to each Chakra enables students to bring a new level of intentionality to their practice. In holistic health centers, Color Therapy and Chakra balancing are being integrated as complementary therapies alongside meditation, yoga, and mental health practices, offering clients a complete mind-body approach to healing. Through this course, students will explore how Color Therapy can be applied not only in personal spaces but also in therapeutic sessions, helping clients or loved ones achieve better energy flow, emotional harmony, and mental clarity.\nCertified in Chakra healing and Color Therapy through this course, students gain practical skills that they can use both professionally and personally. By understanding how color frequencies interact with Chakra energies, students will have the tools to create individualized healing plans, tailoring Color Therapy techniques to each Chakra’s needs. This approach can improve focus, lift mood, relieve stress, and boost physical health. Practitioners in wellness, mental health, or holistic health fields will find that combining Color Therapy with Chakra healing gives clients a transformative experience, promoting healing in a gentle, natural way. For personal use, the tools in this course will enable students to deepen their self-awareness, foster personal growth, and align their Chakras whenever they feel out of balance.\nUltimately, this course offers students a powerful entryway into understanding and practicing holistic wellness. They will leave equipped with a nuanced understanding of each Chakra and each color’s therapeutic properties, enabling them to support themselves and others on a path to balanced, vibrant health. By mastering Chakra healing and Color Therapy, students will gain insight into the subtler aspects of wellness, creating a profound connection with their own energy system and that of others. This knowledge of Chakra and Color Therapy isn’t just a set of techniques—it’s a lifelong toolset for enhancing the quality of life, restoring inner balance, and connecting deeply with the self and the world around them.\nIn modern times, the integration of chakra healing with color therapy has gained popularity due to its holistic benefits. Each chakra is associated with a specific color that corresponds to its energetic vibration. For example, the root chakra is linked with the color red, symbolizing grounding and stability, while the throat chakra is associated with blue, representing communication and self-expression. Color therapy works by using these specific colors to restore balance and promote healing within the corresponding chakras. By incorporating color into meditation, visualization, and environmental design, practitioners believe they can enhance the flow of energy and address blockages that may lead to physical, emotional, or spiritual challenges. The benefits of chakra healing and color therapy are extensive and profound. On a physical level, chakra healing is said to help alleviate symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, digestive issues, and sleep disorders by restoring energy flow throughout the body. When chakras are in balance, the body’s organs and systems are believed to function more harmoniously, leading to better health and vitality. Emotionally, chakra healing combined with color therapy can help release repressed emotions, reduce stress, alleviate anxiety and depression, and foster greater emotional resilience. For instance, the heart chakra (green) is associated with love and compassion, and working with this chakra can help heal emotional wounds and promote feelings of peace and acceptance.\nThe Following people will definitely  Benefit from this Course\nThis course is ideal for those who want to gain the physical & emotional benefits of Chakra clearing and Healing\nThis course is for those who want to practice Color Therapy for themselves\nThis course is for those interested in Color and how they affect a person\nThis course is applicable for all age groups interested in chakra healing and Meditation\nThose that are interested in learning about Colors!\nThis course is for open-minded people and beginners looking to learn color in an exciting, new, and intuitive way\nThis course is for anyone who is looking for healing and strengthening their body, mind, and spirit\nEnergy healers, Reiki practitioners, and wellness coaches looking to expand their practice with chakra and color healing techniques\nIndividuals interested in exploring alternative healing methods to balance energy and improve mental, emotional, and physical health\nTherapists, life coaches, and counselors who want to integrate chakra and color therapy into their therapeutic work\nPeople curious about the power of energy healing and color therapy to enhance personal growth and wellbeing\nThose seeking to enhance their spiritual and emotional health through a comprehensive, holistic approach\nProfessionals in wellness, massage, or alternative healing who wish to incorporate Color Therapy and Chakra balancing into their work\nPeople interested in learning how to use Color Therapy to enhance their understanding and practice of Chakra healing\nProfessionals in wellness, massage, or alternative healing who wish to incorporate Color Therapy and Chakra balancing into their work\nSpiritually, chakra healing encourages self-awareness, personal growth, and a deeper connection to one’s inner wisdom. It can promote greater intuition, mental clarity, and a sense of spiritual alignment. Color therapy enhances this effect by using color as a tool for transformation and healing. Each color has its own vibrational frequency, and it is believed that exposure to specific colors can help attune the body’s energy field, facilitating a greater sense of balance and spiritual awakening. For example, violet, associated with the crown chakra, is often used to deepen spiritual insight and promote higher consciousness.\nChakra healing and color therapy are increasingly integrated into modern wellness practices, including yoga, Reiki, and mindfulness. These practices offer a natural and non-invasive approach to healing, making them accessible to individuals looking to improve their overall well-being, relieve stress, and enhance their emotional and spiritual health. In today’s world, where many people are seeking alternative methods to address imbalances in their health and mind, combining chakra healing with color therapy provides a comprehensive, holistic approach to wellness. This approach is deeply rooted in ancient wisdom but continues to evolve, offering transformative benefits for individuals on their journey to balance, healing, and personal growth. This course is designed, keeping in mind that you don't have any prior knowledge and understanding for Color Therapy.

I created it specifically so anybody can learn and benefit from using colours and artist creation! For those existing healers though, this course is a great way to enhance your skills, and it's also a wonderful complement to my Reiki Master Certification course!\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nOnce enrolled, you'll need to download the course book, written by Melissa: Energy Healing with Colours & Art (PDF). The book has all the details and steps you'll need, and makes a great reference point during and after the course!\nAs you progress, you'll learn the basics of energy healing and its connection to colours, from there you'll learn a bit about the 7 Main Chakras and their colours.  I'll then teach you the different methods of using colours with energy healing, as well as learn the value of artistic expression. (Please note: while I do cover artistic expression, this is not an art course).\nAdd to that, I'll provide you with 7 Chakra Meditations to help you integrate colour into your energy healing efforts!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, you'll have all that you need to start proactively using colour healing in your everyday life, as well as be able to better release that pent up energy in a positive and loving way!\nYou'll be able to quickly apply and use these techniques with your current skills!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Energy Healing with Colour & Art Final Exam.  Upon successful completion, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and a Digital Seal of Completion (JPG)!\nSome of the additional benefits of this course include being able to kindly express yourself and general stress relief - as well as help improve your overall well-being! As you get used to using colours and expressing yourself in this loving way, it will become a welcome part of your way of life!\nI hope you enjoy this exciting new journey sweet friend! #biglove",

      "description": "Many people practice the metaphysical science of numerology, but never has a course been created on the ethics of this fascinating science. While it’s great to learn, internalize, and share the actual practice, there needs to exist a guide that provides structure, systems, and most importantly, ethics around the practice. Well, I saw the void and decided to fill it.\nLearn from Lloyd: The Do’s & Don’ts of Numerology is the third course in the Learn from Lloyd series created in partnership with the Queen of Numerology, Jacquii Leveine. In this course, Jacquii and I are sharing some tips and tricks that we’ve both compiled from our numerology practices throughout the years. This course is designed for people who use numerology on all levels, whether it’s beginning, intermediate, or advanced.\nWhat makes this course different from any of my other numerology courses is we’ll be teaching in a fusion of conceptual knowledge and wisdom that only comes with time and practice. We’re peeling back the layers and moving the curtains aside to show you what’s behind the science, so by the time you’ve completed this course, you’ll have a deeper understanding of how to approach your spiritual practice and be able to access some of the ancient texts that we, ourselves, use.\nBy course completion, you’ll be prepared to have a successful numerology practice, whether personal or professional, comprised of solid principles based on integrity, advanced techniques, and continued study.",

      "description": "Reiki Course - Learn Traditional Japanese Reiki –3rdDegree (Master Practitioner/Teacher)\nDevelop your Traditional Japanese Reiki Practice, by learning and becoming attuned to the Master Symbol, as well as becoming a qualified Reiki Master Teacher.\n\n\nHi and welcome to your “Traditional Japanese Reiki – 3rd Degree (Master Practitioner /Teacher)” course, here on Udemy.\n\n\nIf you are looking to develop your practice in the ancient art of traditional Japanese Reiki, by being given access to and using, THE MASTER SYMBOL, which will qualify you to practice as a Reiki Master, so you not only benefit yourself from even greater feelings of balance and connection, but are able to create a thriving Reiki Practice, benefiting others with the same, then this is the ideal course for you.\n\n\nIn this personal and practice development training, that builds upon your learnings at 2nd Degree /Okuden course, I’ll be sharing with you…\n\n\n· The Master Symbol, which will start to connect you to your inner master.\n· The Master Kotodama, the sacred sound and chant of the Master symbol.\n· Your personal Master attunement, scheduled at a mutually convenient time.\n· Both cleansing and programming techniques to cleanse and programme whatever you want for whatever you want.\n· Chakra balancing to bring harmony and balance to your and your clients unique chakra system.\n· You will learn techniques such as Psychic surgery, Aura Cleansing and Reiki Wraps to help to cleanse the Auric Field.\n\n\nYou will also learn many Japanese Reiki techniques to really qualify your Reiki practice.\n\n\nYou will learn how to teach students of your own, learning what to teach, how to teach and how to conduct a Reiju ceremony with all levels of Reiki\n\n\nWith this training, you will be able to…\n\n\n· Strengthen your own personal connection to Reiki even further\n· Strengthen your channelling of Reiki when giving treatments to others\n· Fully centre and ground yourself, reconnecting your sense of self to the world around you\n· Support the treatment of deeper seated issues\n· Provide deeper sense of emotional balance and peace to a troubled mind\n· Support clarity and focus in a busy mind\n· Balance the chakra system\n· And most importantly, it qualifies you to teach Reiki to the public\n\n\nUsing the teachings of traditional Japanese Reiki, and my practice as a Reiki Master Teacher, or Shihan, I’ve developed this course with the intention of developing your ability to live life more fully, through an even deeper understanding, and refined practical application of this amazing soul energy.\n\n\nThrough video training with me personally; workbooks, quizzes and training manuals for you to refer to after the course, I keep the science simple, the insight deep, and the practical application highly relevant.\n\n\nSo To enrol on this course, simply click on the “Buy Course” button on this page, and you’ll be guided by me every step of the way from introduction through to completion and Attunement, and even beyond through on-line communication and regular updates, because I am committed to you not just learning, but benefiting from what you learn.\n\n\nYou see, once I first started on my Reiki journey and committed to its practice, I began to see and feel the difference it made to me, and my life. Having then realised its potential, it just made perfect sense to deepen that practice and achieve even greater results.\n\n\nBut it wasn’t just about me. I realised that I was being given an opportunity to treat and serve others. And lifted by the love and gratification of helping others I chose to follow this new path and become a Fully qualified Reiki Master, that allowed me to pass on these teachings and practices to others.\n\n\nYou don’t have to go that far of course, it’s entirely up to you whether you choose to apply this deeper understanding to yourself, or create a thriving school from it.\n\n\nI’m now blessed to have many private clients and students, who because of Reiki, are finally moving forward to happier, healthier lives. Some of them have followed in my footsteps and have become teachers themselves. I love seeing that, because it just goes to show the power of Reiki in uncovering our true potential!\n\n\nBut, not everyone, through location or resources are able to attend my private classes, and through this On-line training, I am now able to extend my reach, and touch many more people in need of a breakthrough, or who seek to learn Reiki to treat themselves and/or friends and family.\n\n\nSo, if you’re willing to deepen your understanding and practice of Reiki, through a traditional Japanese approach, and looking for a course that allows you to progress to 3rd Degree Shinpiden, at your own pace, and still be supported remotely, that is designed to really maximise your skill and expertise…\n\n\nJust Click on the “Buy Course“ button on this page to enrol, and let’s get YOU started on the next stage of this exciting and powerful journey!\n\n\nI'll see YOU again soon, on the inside of this trading.\n\n\nKind Regards Joanna",

Instead of pure memorization, imagine if you could relate to each card personally and recognize their unique essence, almost as if they were individual personalities you knew in real life...\nFor example, what's the difference between the Eight of Cups and the Six of Swords? Both symbolize traveling or moving on, but how are they different?\n\n\nHere's how I'm going to REALLY teach you tarot reading:\n\n\nStart with the basics: so you don't get overwhelmed.\nSimilarities and differences: introducing some similar cards, so you don't get confused immediately.\nTiming is everything: learn how to read timing in tarot.\nMeet the personalities: Like speed dating, except with the tarot cards.\nHidden symbolism: Time to get out our magnifying glass and spot the hidden symbolism.\nMeanings by association: Let's group the cards together into different topics like love, teamwork and success.\nYes or No Questions: Master the art of binary questions!\nTarot spreads: How to choose the right card spread for your reading.\nExample readings: Let's do some readings together!\nTarot History: Understand the ancient stories behind decks and important cards!\nFinal Test: For your confidence, let's test your knowledge!\n\n\nThis is how I learned to read tarot - learning to read tarot cards should be fun!",

Chakras are the center points in the human body. They are swirling wheel carrying light energy, each ranging differently, and which had been discussed above. Sending and receiving universal energies, these charkas are the connection points through which we interact with our world. There are seven chakras point, but there are many minor chakras that are countless and relates to the well-being of mind, body, and soul. If all the chakras are healthy and they are moving with the right flow, then they bring the wellness to the overall human body, but the influence of the external energies sometimes disturb the energy flow of the chakras. Working with crystals and the body's seven chakras, or natural energy points, is one of the most powerful and ancient healing practices. Crystals are natural energy-boosters, which protect us by detoxifying our physical, emotional and spiritual systems from stress, promoting well-being and serenity.\nCrystal energy healing is an ancient practice that has been used for thousands of years across different cultures and spiritual traditions. The concept of using crystals for healing dates back to early civilizations such as the Egyptians, Sumerians, and Greeks, who believed that gemstones and minerals possessed unique healing properties. In Egypt, for example, turquoise, lapis lazuli, and carnelian were worn as amulets and used in burial rituals to ensure protection and promote spiritual well-being. The Greeks also utilized crystals like amethyst to prevent intoxication, believing that the stone could clear the mind and foster clarity.\nIn modern times, the practice of crystal healing has experienced a resurgence, particularly within the holistic wellness community. It has become a widely recognized complementary therapy used to support emotional, physical, and spiritual healing. Crystals are believed to work by harnessing the natural vibrational frequencies of the earth, which can interact with the body’s energy fields to promote balance and harmony. This is often referred to as the principle of resonance, where like vibrations attract one another. For example, amethyst is believed to calm the mind and reduce stress, while citrine is associated with prosperity and energy. The benefits of crystal energy healing are vast and varied. Physically, crystals are said to help with pain relief, boost the immune system, and support detoxification. By placing specific stones on certain areas of the body, practitioners believe they can alleviate ailments such as headaches, digestive issues, or inflammation. On an emotional level, crystals are often used to help release negative emotions, clear mental blockages, and foster a sense of inner peace. Crystals such as rose quartz are linked to love and emotional healing, while black tourmaline is used for grounding and protection.\nSpiritually, crystals are used to enhance meditation, intuition, and energy flow within the body. By connecting to a crystal’s energy, individuals can align their chakras, remove energetic blockages, and access deeper states of consciousness. Amethyst, for instance, is often used to enhance spiritual awareness and open the third eye chakra, while clear quartz is considered a powerful amplifier of energy that can help with clarity and manifestation.\nToday, crystal healing is often incorporated into various wellness practices, including Reiki, massage therapy, aromatherapy, and yoga. It is also used in crystal grids, where stones are strategically arranged to amplify energy for specific intentions. Cleansing and charging crystals are essential steps in maintaining their energetic properties, ensuring that they remain effective in their healing capabilities. This is typically done by placing the stones in sunlight or moonlight, using sound vibrations, or cleansing them with sacred herbs like sage or palo santo.\nOverall, crystal energy healing offers a natural, non-invasive approach to healing that works holistically, addressing the mind, body, and spirit. Whether used for personal well-being, emotional balance, or spiritual growth, crystals remain powerful tools in the pursuit of health and harmony.

      "description": "Classic, exoteric astrology begins from the moment we are born and ends the moment we die. It speaks volumes about this personality and this life but it falls short for those who are seeking a bigger picture view.\n\nEsoteric astrology explores us as spiritual beings with souls who are undertaking a spiritual journey of return. It recognizes past lives and gives us insight into patterns and baggage we may have carried into this life from previous incarnations. It gives us greater clarity on the present incarnation - why are we here and what karma are we working with? And it leads into the next life with hints of a next incarnation.\n\nThis is a more philosophical course than my previous astrology classes. It takes a more subtle approach to the houses, the planets and signs. It also introduces wisdom from the Theosophical Society and expands on their framework for exploring soul consciousness through astrology.\n\nIf your journey has led you beyond the personal and into the deeper water of finding answers for the big questions then this course is written for you.\n\nThe content builds directly onto the Introduction To Astrology and Advanced Astrology courses. If you have not completed these courses then please familiarize yourself with the content of both to ensure you are ready for the content ahead.\n\n\nCourse Reviews ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIt's been so good so far! I just love how the instructor is so clear, the video reinforces the learning and the content is just so compelling. If you are studying Astrology, you need to see this course.\nAdrienne Lidicky\n\n\nA very enjoyable and enlightening course. There is so much wrapped up in the first section and it's really helped me to get my head around a lot of concepts that come up again and again in spiritual circles. Karma, incarnation, reincarnation and most importantly given me a good read on the soul. In the other courses I found I wrote a lot of notes but I'm pausing often to reflect in this course and I like that.\nSonja Souter\n\n\nVery thought provoking and challenging course. It's very different to the others but I feel like I'm getting a much deeper more personal understanding of the houses, planets and signs. The meditations are excellent too for someone like me who has never meditated before. Easy to do and they put you in an amazing headspace to continue the course. Just amazing.\nKalinka Gosford\n\n\nThe information presented by the instructor was easy to understand and an excellent introduction to the course. Lays a good foundation for continuing the lessons.\nDondria Enberg\n\n\nThis is absolutely brilliant!! Loving this so much!!\nHermien Grove\n\n\nAs usual, Damian does a wonderful job of delivering his presentation. Concise but detailed in his language; easy to understand. Learnt a lot.\nJawaharlal Prasad\n\n\nthe instructor is very imformative and engaging.\nJoshua Bradford",

Dive into the world of Energy healing and harness the universal life force energy to restore balance and harmony within yourself and others. Whether you're a beginner or seeking to deepen your practice, I will guide you through the sacred teachings and empower you with Reiki Symbols. Embrace a journey of self-discovery, spiritual growth, and healing mastery.\n\n\nEmbrace the power of Reiki Ryoho and embark on a path of profound transformation today.\n\n\nIn the Andean Stellar Codes introduction sections, we will have the most complete compendium of my trajectory and research of spirituality and holistic therapies since 2008.\n**Andean Wisdom and Anthropology**\n\n\nIn this introductory course, we study the wisdom of the Andean peoples.\nThe Andean peoples have lived for centuries in harmony with their environment.\nThey know what it is to be a happy and fulfilled person, because they knew how to overcome the aggressive process of colonization and were able to remain integrated to their roots and cosmovision, being people in integration and complement with the universe.\nOur proposal is to study their wisdom in order to also find our roots and be in happiness and fullness.\n\n\n[This is the path of the warrior of the stars, of the eternal seeker of the cosmic light, in self-discipline and balanced with the earth.]\n\n\nUnlike the previous contents that I have done, in this course, I avoid using the word “shamanism” because I am not doing a generalized or superficial study of Andean practices (which many consider as shamanic practices), but rather I am delving into Andean practices with Anthropological studies where the term “shamanism” is not part of their culture.\n\n\nThis is the great differential of my course, which is not a general shamanism course, but an in-depth study of Andean wisdom that took me a long time to research and that made me rethink many of my ideas.\n\n\nThis course is based on my book: Andean Stellar Codes, available on Amazon.\n\n\nAccording to Masaki Nishina, Jikiden Reiki Master, Ph.D in physics and UK ITEC aromathearapist, there are many differences between Western Reiki and Japanese Reiki.\nThe war in Japan influenced the traditional Usui Sensei Reiki, it was spread to the US and it becomes a westernized practice.\nIn his book Reiki and Japan: A Cultural View of Western and Japanese Reiki, Nishina has explained the reason why the westernized Reiki is not the traditional Reiki Usui, he tells us that the Dai Ko Myo symbol didn’t exist in the Japanese Reiki both technically and culturally.\n\n\nIn this theoretical course, we follow important Reiki Masters references to approach the technique as near as possible to the traditional Reiki.\nUnderstanding that this practice has a strong base on Qi Qong, the Chinese practice that works with the physical body energy.\nThe chakras are an Indian practice NOT JAPANESE OR CHINESE PRACTICE that was later added to the westernized Reiki. Also, the Dai Ko Myo and the attunements where the Reiki symbols are implanted to the student’s chakras are a later addition.\n\n\nJoin our Reiki course where we demystify the myths that people have built over this technique.\nThis is a Reiki without myths and secrets!",

      "description": "Crystal Energy-Know how Crystal Healing works & Get Crystal Healing Certificate!\nThis is a Practical Guide to Crystal Energy & Healing to Increase Your Spiritual Energy, Balance Your Chakras and Expand Your Positive Mind Power to Heal Your Body and Soul!\nIn this Crystal Energy & Healing Certification Course, We will focus on how To Use Crystals to Heal the Body and Transform the Spirit! Crystals carry light and color to your overall aura and Human Body Chakras. The Basic Crystal Therapy is considered as the ancient art of laying on of stones. Stones, crystals and gems were laid on the body over the chakra points in ancient times. Every chakra resonates to a certain color and the chakras align and mix with one another. The basic belief behind crystal healing is that diseases take place when there is variation between divine energy and a person. This light or divine energy is the main groundwork of universal creation. Crystal Energy works on those and by balancing those energy differences, can make the person in a healthy condition\nWhat is Crystal Energy all about?\nCrystal Energy is a typical form of treatment that uses gemstones or crystals. The crystals are often placed on a certain area of the body called “chakras”. Chakra means spinning wheels of energy. There are 7 major energy centers in the body. Some healers place matching color crystals as the color of the chakras on the individual to develop the flow of energy. Crystals direct the energy flow to the person and bring balance to their energy. Mostly, they are used to cleanse the person from negative energy that is the reason to cause illness or disease. Removing the bad spiritual energy decreases the harshness of the physical condition. These crystals are also utilized for mental, physical, spiritual and emotional healing.\nHealing with Crystal Energy!\nTreating your body with crystals can be performed in many ways. You can get their fullest benefits through holding them when you are very ill or carrying them in your pocket. This type of healing can balance and heal your entire body. Specific crystals can be placed on your body chakras to draw out undesired energies and infuse the body with earth energy and universal healing. Most crystal healers use clear quartz in treatment process due to its color and shape. However, since chakras have distinct colors related to every area, they may place a certain color of gems or crystals on the same color chakras.. The crystal is also used to realign or to amplify human psychic through directing vibration energy. Keeping the crystal is important to maintain its cleanliness from environmental imbalance.\nWhat you will learn in Crystal Energy Certification:\nLearn why crystals are able to assist with healing\nKnow how Crystal Energy encourage healing\nChoose the precise crystals and identify where to place\nUse crystals to assist with healing\nUsing Stones And Crystals For Healing Chakras\nMaking the most of your crystal\nThings to Do for Effective Crystal Healing\nColors in Crystal Healing\nLearn to Program or charge your crystals\nHow To Take Care Of Your Crystals\nLearn to cleanse your crystals\nBecome a Crystal Healing Practitioner\nUnderstand how Crystal Energy works\nIdentify different crystal shapes\nKnow the 7 Major Chakras and their associated crystals!\nReceive a Crystal Healing Certificate!\nCrystal Healing as an Alternative Healthcare\nA lot of people are practicing crystal healing as an alternative medicine.

Do you remember? They remember you and though they still skip around you and exist with you, so many of us have forgotten how to connect with them. In this course we will reawaken your connection with the Crystal Fairy beings who exist as an aspect of kingdom of the Fae and the Crystal Kingdom. The knowledge contained in each crystal is accessed only through the permission of the crystal fairy who lives within.  In this course you will connect with 24 different Crystals and their Crystal Fairies and 4 Master Elemental beings  you will meet them all individually so that you can connect with their individual frequency and make a special heart connection with them. Each crystal fairy image and their wisdom has been channeled both in the artwork and in the reading.\n\n\nThese powerful beings, though called Fairy’s are not just twinkling around the sky with magic wands, they work with the very core of our being and our planet, they influence the elements themselves and by that very connection can support us with all aspects of our growth and development whether that is as a spiritual worker looking to open your psyche on a path to enlightenment or whether you are just curious about their world and want to connect with them.\n\n\nYou will learn techniques to use the Crystals and Crystal Fairy Cards to support healing and for prophecy, how to make a deeper connection with them in your daily life, how to create fairy circles, fairy crystal grids, how to give card readings and much, much more.\nAll Card Images Uniquely Designed For Us,  Are Provided For FREE In This Course You Do Not Need To Buy Anything\nI am joined on this course by Alexandra Gabriel, who like me has lived between the world of the physical and the world of spirit our whole lives. Nothing brings us greater happiness to support you to reconnect to the magical world of the Fae through this Crystal Healing with the Crystal Fairies Course. If you could see the fairies you would see they are dancing with excitement too!\nTwinkle, twinkle !!\nwith love\nTania and Alexandra",

Astrid explains everything so clearly, it really got me intrigued and invested in writing everything down and absorbing it all. I feel like I have a full understanding of the cards now that I didn't before. Highly recommend. Thank you! \"\n\n\n\" I LOVE THIS COURSE!!! She is wonderful in her explanations and I feel that I am learning so much about my own intuition. I am a total rule follower so I have done everything she has suggested and I am so grateful because I am seeing the evidence that my intuition is stronger than I realized. \"\n\n\n\" This course is worth the full price, I feel like I learned from the best. \"\n\n\n\" This was a very helpful course! i was having trouble with connecting with and remembering the tarot cards, especially the Minor Arcana but after taking this course i feel very confident. i can now look at a card and instantly understand the meaning, and in context. Everything was very well explained and the advice was very helpful in tapping into my intuition with interpretations, and thus helping me no longer rely on mechanical meaning of the cards, or struggling with connecting the cards together. I'm actually quit impressed with this course. :) thank you so much for providing it! \"\n\n\n\" This is one of the most practical and \"usable\" courses I've taken. Astrid has such a clear, simple way of reading cards. But don't be fooled, it can be VERY POWERFUL! \"\n\n\n\" Fantastic way to quickly grasp and read all cards. I didn’t realize how easy it was because of all the book I’ve read on tarot and this class clearly and easily offers lessons that stick with you and take you to a higher level than you would expect. \"\n\n\n\n\nAstrid aka The Psychic Witch\nAstrid aka The Psychic Witch is an acclaimed Tarot reader, radio show host, and magician with over 10 years of experience teaching tarot and spiritual topics.\nCombining ancient knowledge with modern, edge psychology and coaching, she's creating easy-to-follow courses, offering deep knowledge that's explained without unnecessary complexity and occult bias.\nShe has experience teaching physical classes in London, as well as many years of sharing her knowledge online.\nShe worked as a spiritual advisor for renowned clients, such as Tower of London, Penguin Publishing House, Park Plaza Hotel Westminster, Sternberg Clarke Entertainment, and many others and her courses are continuously \"Bestselling\" on Udemy.",

Not only can you listen to these video's for your own healing and removal of blocks, but if you are in the healing industry, have a current practice or starting a new one, you will be armed with a companion to help clients in addition to energy work, holistic healing, meditation, yoga, therapy, spiritual counseling, soul care therapy and all healing work in service of others.\nI have itemized this therapy with several different aims at healing. All sessions are geared to helping heal physical, mental and emotional issues, help a client or yourself see internal blockages to healing, focus life goals, focus life purpose, expand life journey, feel confident and empowered.\nThis is a fast track course and a perfect addition to Alternative Healing Therapist Course for more intensified session work).\nThis is also intended for those seeking healing work, as the videos are there for Guided Image Therapy. The sessions themselves are THE healing work. The PDF's are for live client session therapy readings. The live sessions are meant for the healer to take them through the questions in person and the videos allow you as a healer to learn pace, tone and demeaner. All questions with in-session clients must be followed up with open ended questions (not listed here) to unpack and resolve issues, to discuss what came up with the client and move them forward in healing. This course relies on your ability to know how to communicate compassionately with your clients. This course assumes a baseline understanding of how to spiritually counsel, or speak compassionately and deduce client issues. leading them to self governance and wisdom. You are not however, required to ever have all the answers or heal them. They heal themselves through your oracle ship. The Alternative Healing Therapist course will elaborate more on how to conduct a Soul Care Session once Guided Image Therapy is complete. This course is the perfect intended companion to Alternative Healing Therapist Course and all other modalities.\nAll Courses Are Accredited Through International Association of Therapists (IAOTH)",

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED & ACCREDITED\nShamanism has been around for thousands of years and is a rich practice and way of life for indigenous people around the globe. It is their culture and medicine they use to heal. Many people have no idea that urban doctors have discovered many medicines through their work with indigenous people, and have learned how they heal, what plants they use, and have brough them back to modern civilization to be mass produced in a lab. As modern people, we often lose touch with the roots of nature that are the driving force of our healing and what she, and her people that live with her in nature, have contributed to our healing process. In this course we honor the shamans that modern history often forgets.\nI realize that there are many mumbles out in the ether about courses that certify people to be shamans, so, you will be surprised to hear that I explain in great details how one becomes a shaman, and it is far more than a piece of paper that gives you that title. In essence, we all come to life with gifts and through this process and course, many may hear the ring of truth in their own gift and realize they have been doing the healing all along. One does not just become a shaman because of a course, one has been one all along not knowing what it was in many cases. Modern society has distracted us from truly knowing ourselves and in this course, it is a way back to yourself, to hear the ring of truth, to gain a better understanding of shamanism, what it is, who can be one, and learn all about sacred tools in healing and more.\nThis course focuses on the healing work of the Guarani shamans of the Rainforest in Brazil. Through the lectures, the 33-page workbook uncovering wonderful details about the Guarani and shamanism, and the recommended book with the rich beautiful music of the healing rituals, you will walk away with a better understanding of shamanism and your place in it.\nWe will also have great fun making sacred runes of the Guarani symbols, and you will learn about the sacred plume, headdress and bracelet of healing and so much more.\nI am recommending you follow this course up with further Shaman teachings of Deep Release Point Therapy and Soul Retrieval and if you have had no bodywork training, you take my Reiki 1 & 2 course.\nLearning is an exciting process. As an instructor I do not use pies, graphs or charts. If you need that I may not be the teacher for you. If you want to have fun while learning and feel like you are chatting with a friend and learning all her wisdom, well, you will enjoy this class and many others.\nAll my courses are internationally certified and accredited by IAOTH and at the end of this course I have attached a letter for you with the discount link as my student to accredit your business and practice. I receive nothing in exchange, the gift is all yours!\nSee you in class.\nSufi\n\n\n#wellness #healingandwellness #healthandwellness",

Whether you're a beginner or have some experience with energy work, this course will equip you with the knowledge and practical skills needed to become a certified Reiki and chakra healing practitioner.\nReiki, founded by Dr. Mikao Usui in Japan, is a gentle yet powerful form of energy healing that taps into the universal life force energy that flows through all living things. Reiki Level I is the foundation of this practice, teaching students how to channel energy through their hands to heal physical, emotional, and spiritual imbalances. This course emphasizes self-healing, allowing students to understand the energy within their own bodies and use Reiki to promote relaxation, relieve stress, and improve overall well-being. It also introduces the concept of healing others, providing the tools to perform Reiki sessions for friends, family, and clients.\nIn addition to Reiki, this course also focuses on chakra healing. Chakras are the seven energy centers within the body that are responsible for regulating physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Each chakra governs specific aspects of our well-being, and when they become blocked or unbalanced, it can lead to illness, stress, or emotional turmoil. Through this course, you will learn to identify and assess chakra imbalances and use Reiki to cleanse, align, and energize the chakras for improved health. You will also learn powerful techniques to balance the chakras, which can help relieve physical discomfort and emotional stress, enhance your intuition, and foster overall wellness.\nOne of the primary benefits of this course is the ability to heal yourself and others through the combination of Reiki and chakra healing. By learning how to channel healing energy into your own body, you can promote relaxation, alleviate stress, and bring balance to your energy systems. Chakra healing provides additional depth to your practice, helping you address the root causes of physical and emotional imbalances that may be affecting your life. The skills learned in this course can be used not only to improve your own well-being but also to offer healing support to others, whether friends, family, or clients.\nAnother significant advantage of this course is the opportunity to earn a certification in Reiki and chakra healing.

Note, you don't have to be a Master to enroll in this course, you're just required to be a Master for 6 months by the time you complete it. Also, as with all of Melissa's courses, this is self-paced and completely digital, which means you can go as slow or as quick as you like.

What's more when you vibrate at this high level of energy, life's synchronicities will occur more and more and even attract abundance into your life!\nMelissa also discusses different components for those who want to start their own Reiki Master Teacher business, from pricing and cashflow to marketing ideas.\nEnjoy this journey sweet soul!",

      "description": "The Ultimate Tarot Certification for Those Who Want More Than Just a Basic Understanding\nTarot is not just a tool for fortune-telling. It is a system of transformation, a universal map of human experience, and a profound way to unlock intuition, personal power, and professional success. This course is not just about learning Tarot—it is about mastering it in a way that allows you to read for yourself and others with complete confidence, accuracy, and clarity.\n\n\nFor over a decade, I have trained thousands of students in Tarot, guiding them through a journey that destroys limiting beliefs, eliminates reliance on guidebooks, and builds a deep, personal connection with the cards. This certification is designed to do something that no other Tarot course does: provide the fastest and most effective pathway to professional, high-level Tarot reading.\n\n\nWhile other courses stretch out information, leaving students feeling overwhelmed and lost, this course is streamlined, packed, and structured for real-world results. You will not just learn Tarot—you will own it.\n\n\nWhat Makes This Course Different from Every Other Tarot Course?\n\n\nYou Will Never Need a Guidebook Again. This course teaches you how to read any Tarot deck—traditional or modern—intuitively and with total confidence. You will develop a deep, natural relationship with the cards, allowing you to read fluently without memorization.\nThe Fastest and Most Efficient Method for Mastering All 78 Cards. Other courses take weeks or even months to cover the cards. This certification gives you the tools, structures, and techniques to internalize them faster than any other course available.\nThe Hero’s Journey and Storytelling Method. Most Tarot courses teach card meanings in isolation, leaving students struggling to connect them into a narrative. This course teaches Tarot as a storytelling system, making it easy to understand, easy to apply, and powerful to use.\nThe \"What If\" Method for Exploring Outcomes. Unlike basic Tarot reading techniques, this approach allows you to explore potential realities, shifting perspectives, and guiding people toward real transformation.\nProfessional-Level Training for Ethical, Powerful, and Career-Focused Tarot Reading. Whether you want to read Tarot for yourself, professionally, or as a coaching tool, this course provides the skills to handle any reading, any question, and any client situation with confidence and integrity.\n\n\nWho This Course is For\nThose who want to master Tarot at a high level, not just dabble in it.\nStudents who have struggled with Tarot in the past and need a clear, structured approach that makes sense.\nSeekers who want to use Tarot as a deep, transformational practice rather than just a party trick.\nProfessionals who want to integrate Tarot into their coaching, spiritual business, or personal development practice.\nBeginners and experienced readers alike who want the fastest, most effective way to understand Tarot deeply.\n\n\nThis is not just another Udemy Tarot course. This is the certification that will set you apart.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nMaster Tarot Faster Than Any Other Course. Learn all 78 cards without memorization, confusion, or overwhelm.\nDevelop Instant Confidence in Your Readings. You will be able to read for anyone, anywhere, without hesitation.\nUse Tarot as a Transformational Tool. This course moves beyond fortune-telling, teaching you how to use Tarot for self-discovery, personal healing, and coaching.\nRead Any Deck Like a Professional. Whether it’s a Rider-Waite deck, a modern oracle, or an indie Tarot deck, you will learn how to work with any system fluently.\nUnderstand and Work with Reversals, Astrology, and Multiple Spreads Effortlessly. Most courses make these topics confusing. This course simplifies them so you can apply them in real-world readings immediately.\nTurn Tarot into a Career. This course provides real, professional-level tools to build your Tarot business, work with clients, and create a successful practice.\nHandle Any Ethical Issue with Confidence. Learn how to navigate sensitive topics, challenging questions, and ethical dilemmas with professionalism and grace.\n\n\nThe Most Powerful Transformation You Will Experience in a Tarot Course\nMost students enter this course with doubt, second-guessing their intuition, relying on books, and unsure how to put everything together.\nBy the time they finish, they have completely transformed.\n\n\nThey can walk up to any Tarot deck and give an accurate, powerful reading on the spot. They trust their intuition, knowing they don’t need external validation. They can predict outcomes, explore possibilities, and offer real guidance.\nThey become the kind of Tarot reader that wows people—not because they memorized meanings, but because they understand how to channel insight, clarity, and wisdom through the cards.\nThis course destroys the outdated way of learning Tarot and replaces it with something that actually works.\n\n\nA Certification That Means Something\nUnlike other courses that offer a meaningless certificate, this certification is backed by the highest professional standards in spiritual training.\n\n\nI am an Approved Executive Member of the International Practitioners of Holistic Medicine (IPHM) and an accredited international training provider (Ref: IPHMNC3005).\nThis means that your certification carries real professional weight. It is recognized internationally and ensures that you have received training of the highest quality.\nTo receive certification, students will provide basic information (name and email) for verification purposes. This ensures that only those who complete the course successfully receive accreditation.\n\n\nYour certification is a powerful credential that sets you apart as a high-level, professional Tarot reader.\nThis Course is for Those Who Are Ready to Become More Than Just a Tarot Student—It’s for Those Who Are Ready to Master It.\nIf you are looking for a slow, drawn-out, overly complicated Tarot course, this is not for you.\nIf you are ready to master Tarot faster, deeper, and with more impact than ever before, this is the course you have been waiting for.\nThis is the only Tarot certification you will ever need.\nEnroll now and begin your initiation into true Tarot mastery.",

I have been learning and studying about witchcraft on and off for 40 years. The way she talks about intention, the importance of a clear intention, its role in a spell, and how to make sure you have a clear intention is something I have never heard (or read) explained this well before. Every unit in this course that I have done so far is a similar experience. The way she explains it all just makes it \"click.\" Excellent course. \"\n\n\n\" I loved the class, and I especially love the energy of the instructor she gives such a warm, friendly, and accessible tone to everything. I found it very helpful to go through a structured class like this as a beginner. When I buy witchcraft books, they just feel too chaotic or lean too far into one type of witchcraft or another. This truly covers the basics and would work for anyone, whether they think they'll end up an atheist witch, a Wiccan, or any other sort. Thanks for the class! \"\n\n\n\" Astrid is my first favorite teacher on Udemy. She is a good teacher. I like her energy and how she explain the material in the classes. Thank you, Astrid \"\n\n\n\" Wow an amazing course Astrid but together she really went above and beyond! 10 out of 10 i feel more comfortable about witchcraft she went into detail i love this course! Lots of knowledge an amazing witch. \"\n\n\n\" This is just what I needed. I was so lost before finding this course. Astrid is an amazing teacher. I hope to find more content from her. \"\n\n\n\" Astrid is an amazing instructor. I enjoyed her genuine teaching style and learned so much! Her compassion, authenticity and down to earth teaching style show through! Loved learning about the different types of rituals and how to create my own sigal! I learned also to follow your intuition, not be afraid to experiment. This is a great foundations course. I have dabbled a little in this practice but feel so inspired after finishing this class and cannot wait to see where it takes me. Thank you Astrid! \"\n\n\n\" Love, Love, LOVE\"\n\n\nAstrid aka The Psychic Witch\nAstrid aka The Psychic Witch is an acclaimed Tarot reader, radio show host, and magician with over 10 years of experience teaching spiritual topics.\nCombining ancient knowledge with modern, edge psychology and coaching, she's creating easy-to-follow courses, offering deep knowledge that's explained without unnecessary complexity and occult bias.\nShe has experience teaching physical classes in London, as well as many years of sharing her knowledge online.\nShe worked as a spiritual advisor for renowned clients, such as Tower of London, Penguin Publishing House, Park Plaza Hotel Westminster, Sternberg Clarke Entertainment, and many others and her courses are continuously \"Bestselling\" on Udemy.",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\n\"This course has had such an incredibly positive impact on my life and home. My home feels fresh, clear of any negativity and a much more supportive and postitive place to be. Sometimes in certain areas of my home I would feel anxious or groggy for no obvious reason, it turns out that all I needed to do was clear the space! I would feel completely confident to clear spaces as a career if I so wished after taking this course. Melissa was clear, thourough and I felt very supportive\" - Emma\n\"Thank you Melissa I have enjoyed this course as much as your other courses. I love [the bagua] prints and extra material you always provide.\" - Deborah\n\"This course is great and the teacher explains everything in much more detail. Life happens. Picking up energy is inevitable when under stress. This will allow me to clear my space much more effectively. I am grateful.\" - Betty\n\"I wanted to understand more about energy clearing and this class has met and exceeded my expectations!\" – Patricia\n\"I really loved this course and I was impressed how the energy shifted in my home after the clearing\" - Jessica\n\"It Works! Fast improvement. Actually very noticable change here. The best teacher!\" - Oddrun\n\"This course is absolutely brilliant\" - Anand\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nWhether it's your home, school, or workplace, ensuring the places you spend a lot of time in feel good to you can impact more than you realise. If you don't feel comfortable in a space, then you will - even at a subconscious level - reflect that uneasy energy.  And vice versa, if you emanate negative energy, you can impact the space you're in, too!\nAnd that's where Space Clearing comes in!  An energy healing technique which focuses on clearing out negative energy to then allow room for positive energy to come in - and influence you (and others!) in a wonderful way!\nThere are a lot of 'moving parts' to Space Clearing; but thankfully, I created this course in a manner to simplify the process without compromising on the depth of knowledge it takes to do it effectively!\nPlease keep in mind that no experience is required to take this course! I created it specifically so anybody can learn and benefit from using Space Clearing techniques! For those existing healers - including Reiki practitioners, this course is a great way to enhance your skills, and it's also a wonderful complement to my Reiki Level I, II, + Master Certification course!\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nOnce enrolled, you'll need to download the course book, written by Melissa: Space Clearing Made Simple (PDF). The book has all the details and steps you'll need, and makes a great reference point during and after the course!\nAs you progress, you'll learn the fundamentals including energy healing and the Energy Field. From there you'll learn a bit about what Space Clearing is, as well as learn the  'Anatomy of a Place'.  I'll then teach you different techniques, as well as learn about preparation tools as well as the steps to prepare for a clearing.  Of course, I then take you through the Steps to Space Clear as well as cover off what to expect afterward.\nAdd to that, I'll provide you with my own Space Clearing Worksheet (PDF) to help you actually perform a clearing session. There are also 2 different Life Situations Bagua Map examples to help you even further while you learn!   I also provide a Building Your Intuition Exercise Lecture to make the learning process even easier!\nFor those who want to offer Space Clearing to others, I provide a Space Clearing Client Intake Form example to make your job easier to do once you arrive at the location.\nOnce you've completed the entire course, you'll have all that you need to start positively influences spaces - for yourself and others!\nAt this point you'll be able to quickly apply and use these techniques with your current skills!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Space Clearing Final Exam.  Upon successful completion, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and a Digital Seal of Completion (JPG)!\nSome of the additional benefits of this course include being able to affect positive change in locations as well as alleviate stress - all which will help improve the space's - and the people in it - overall well-being!  As you get used to Space Clearing more and more, it start to become second nature and you'll even be able to make small changes everywhere you go to always feel comfortable!\nI hope you enjoy this exciting new journey sweet friend! Big love!",

      "description": "Join over 2,500 students on this comprehensive conversational hypnosis certification course.\nThis conversational hypnosis course isn't the same as many courses on conversational hypnosis or covert hypnosis. My view is that many courses over-complicate how to do conversational covert hypnosis. I have over 20 years experience with conversational covert hypnosis, I can talk using all the impressive hypnotic language, but anyone who has heard a conversational hypnotist speak using Ericksonian hypnotic language patterns will know that it doesn't sound very conversational, it sounds like you are doing hypnosis, or at least that you are 'talking funny'. I have an Ericksonian Hypnotherapy course that teaches these skills for those that want them, but there is no need to learn most of the language pattern skills to be able to do conversational hypnosis, and in fact for beginners it can prevent being good at conversational hypnosis because people can focus too heavily on using hypnotic language, so they stop sounding like they are having a 'normal' conversation and instead sound like they are doing hypnosis.\nConversational covert hypnosis doesn't need the use of lots of complicated language patterns, it just needs an understanding of certain principles. What is needed is an understanding of what hypnosis is, both the state people call hypnosis and the act of doing hypnosis, and an understanding of trance. Next people need to know what makes individuals go into trance states, and what deepens trance. Once you know these areas you know what you need to do to conversationally guide people into any trance state, not just hypnosis, but love, excitement, happiness, relaxation, or any other trance state you can think of. You will end up using many of the hypnotic language techniques, but these will be happening spontaneously and used in a natural way that fits with what you are saying.\nThis course on conversational hypnotherapy is structured into sections to help you get a good grounding to build on by learning about hypnosis, about trance. Learning the main hypnosis theories and models and a brief history about hypnosis. Then there is a section on the different ways trance and hypnosis are induced, and it is from learning about these different ways people naturally enter trance which allows you to know how to induce trance or hypnosis in others in a wide range of different ways, and in a variety of settings.\nAs I am a therapist I have made this course targeted mainly at those that are learning these skills for therapy, counselling or coaching, so there is a section teaching a range of hypnotherapeutic techniques, and a section on how to help clients transfer changes from therapy sessions into their everyday life and carry those changes on into the future, and near the end of the course I cover how to use disassociation, and association therapeutically, and about abreactions and what to do if someone has an abreaction.\nThis conversational hypnosis course is made up of video lectures with PDF notes and a quiz at the end of each section. During the section on different ways of inducing trance there are video lecture of inductions for you to follow so that you can experience being hypnotised using the processes described in the course as well as re-listening to those lectures intentionally not following along and allowing yourself to be hypnotised and instead focusing on analysing what is being done. The course can be completed in about ten hours, but you are likely to want to review lectures again as you practice what you are learning.\n(Different places in the world have different rules around who can practice as a hypnotherapist. My view is to practice as a hypnotherapist you should undertake extensive live classroom tuition (minimum 120 hours of classroom tuition and minimum 450 hours total training) which teaches therapy and then only work with those client groups you have been trained to work with. If you are totally untrained but have an interest in learning conversational hypnotherapy this course will teach you what you need to know, but I would recommend you shouldn't work as a hypnotherapist based just on taking this course. This course will still teach you advanced communication skills which can be helpful in a wide range of life situations. If you have trained in hypnotherapy, counselling, coaching, or NLP or other similar fields then conversational hypnotherapy should make great additional skills for your tool-box to use with clients you have been trained to work with, and this course should also give you a greater understanding about your use of language and other skills with clients even if you aren't doing hypnosis)",

Since then it has flourished and is used by practitioners in clinical settings as well as for self-treatments. Reiki addresses the body, mind and spirit and helps your body to highlight the areas that need to be balanced so your body can do the work it was intended to do. This course explores the essence of Reiki and what the founder Dr. Usui had originally intended his system be used for. You will learn centuries old techniques to help you explore your energetic body which is your root of balance.\nColour Therapy and the creative process of therapeutic art, can be incredibly helpful for a number of areas in our lives.\nAs well as the obvious advantages of facilitating relaxation and a sense of calm, it also offers us an opportunity to discover the many  facets of our personality and learn about ourselves in a whole new way.\nEven more significantly though, is the effectiveness of this expressive, creative form of therapy, when working through difficult or emotionally painful feelings.\nFrom a safe sanctuary, we are able to explore any negative energy,  giving us the confidence to  address and resolve issues from the past and present, and helping us to manage our feelings in a more positive  and productive way.\nThe therapeutic, creative process of self expression, will encourage and facilitate emotional and spiritual growth, promoting a happier and  healthier you.\nColour therapy as an alternative balancing technique has been used for thousands of years, helping to shift physical, mental and energetic imbalances and is holistic and non-invasive. You will explore various colour therapy techniques to explore the frequencies of colour and how you can use them to help you. You will then use this information as you practice seeing auric fields. You will learn Reiki techniques that will teach you how to scan auras and chakras and then clear them.\nYou may already be familiar with meditation and Reiki or have a practice such as yoga in place that brings you calm. We created this course so you could learn effective techniques that you can use anywhere, anytime to bring that peace. Have you ever met someone who claimed to be spiritually or energetically advanced yet in day to day activities behave in a manner that defies that? This course explores the heart and soul of Reiki which is to help you increase your frequency. This shift can be powerful and impact physical and mental well-being.\n\nIn this course we will explore how Reiki can help you on your path to enlightenment and change your energy levels. You will create a special place in your mind's eye with advanced tools you can use to help you access collective consciousness, gain clarity and insight, connect with others and balance yourself.\n\nYou will learn about Elements both outside the body and within and utilize these powerful forces. You will learn how you can perform Reiki self-treatments that focus on each element so you can address specific issues you are wanting to heal.\n\nYou will also immerse yourself in Sacred Geometry and connect with these powerful visual mantras. You will learn how to let Reiki guide you and provide you with information you are seeking.\n\nYou will learn about the Tree of Life and explore its prevalence across time and cultures. You will connect and create your own Tree of Life which will serve as a rich and powerful place where you can ground and connect. You will also have the opportunity to explore your dreams and their meanings.\n\nYou will also receive Reiju, an energetic blessing that Dr. Usui the founder of Reiki would perform with his students to help them on their  journey towards individuation and self-actualization. These techniques are meant to help you find peace within and bliss in the every day aspects of life.\n\nThe course is self paced and offers you complete flexibility. Choose to study at a time and place that suits you, safe in the knowledge that help is always at hand.

      "description": "STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO START WITH ASTROLOGY?\nDoes it feel sometimes like the entire Internet knows more about astrology than you do?\nLearning astrology online can be hard.\nMost astrology websites and Facebook groups assume that you know the basics. Trying to cover that knowledge gap can be confusing and can result in countless lost hours as you try to piece everything together enough knowledge to make a start. Wouldn't it be great to be able to lock down the foundations of astrology all in one go?\nThe great news is you can. This course will guide you through the core elements of astrology. Are you are taking those first steps toward self discovery? Or wanting to expand your service range as a tarot reader or health practitioner?

It's also well organized and even though it's not easy information, it is all perfectly explained so everyone can understand what's the topic about. I strongly recommend it.\n> Ruth C. Calvo Izazaga\n\n\n★★★★★ I have just started the course and I would like to say it is very interesting, the explanation is clear. The didactic material and videos are really well done. Thank you so much! I recommend this course. It is a good way want to discover the world of astrology.\n> Andrea Guariso\n\n\n★★★★★ This course was very easy to follow and informative. It is well thought out, and caters to many different learning styles. Mr.McKinnon is very knowledgeable and always responded to every activity and assignment. I highly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in learning about astrology at any level.\n> Bekah Osborne\n\n\n★★★★★ This course is an excellent introduction to astrology. The videos and the resources are extremely helpful and full of information. The assignments make you think and allow you to apply the concepts learned. I’d recommend this coursework anyone especially those who are new to astrology.\n> Tiffany Durham\n\n★★★★★ This laid the foundational knowledge for which I was looking - now on to analyzing my chart for deeper clarity. Thanks!\n> Tracey Whitehouse\n\n★★★★★ So much useful information and great resources out there to utilize!\n> Destiny Giebe\n\n★★★★★ absolutely stunning.\n> Adrienne Lidicky\n\n★★★★★ I am still overwhelmed in a very positive way! I was not expecting this load of information. Had to stop multiple times and literally live by my notes and get everything jotted. It is very precise and insightful. It pairs theory with practical examples, which makes learning way more effective and quick. Still feel I need to go over and over some sections just because I was not having any previous knowledge. I am confident this will provide me solid foundations to progress further and eventually get to understand how to read for others and see what's coming in more detail. I also really valued the huge effort on graphics (not all teachers do) and the content per se. I was amazed by the quality, consistency and professionalism across the video lessons and the manuals. The voice-over is steady, fascinating...no noises on the background therefore understandable and refined!\n> Elisa Reinaudo\n\n★★★★★ I am not familiar with how to read a birth chart, let alone create one so im looking forward to learning how to do that. I have basic knowledge now with the houses, signs, and planets.\n> Rebecca Rankin-Tremblay\n\n★★★★★ Very accurate and easy to follow. I highly recommend!\n> Angelica Loughrey\n\n★★★★★ It was a great experience. Entire course content was so self explanatory & elaborative that anyone who is having real interest in Astrology can learn lot of new things. Thanks Damian for helping me with this course and new knowledge.\n> Geetika Bhatia\n\n★★★★★ Really enjoyed the format of this course - so much ore interesting than just watching someone sit there and talk. Much more aligned to my learning style - signing up for the Modern Astrology Natal Introduction course based on this. Thank you!\n> Ruby Turner\n\n★★★★★ I really enjoyed this course! The course material was laid out in a very concise and understandable way, while the curriculum also was relatable and very easy to understand. I also liked that the instructor required students to engage with the material via interactive assignments. This really helps to make the information stick in your mind because you are called to apply it within the parameters that it is presented. I found that along with learning new concepts, my existing knowledge was also affirmed. This course made it easy for me to understand my own natal chart, thus helping me to answer some life long questions. My interactions with the instructor directly have also been very positive, I look forward to taking more courses from him in the future and am excited to open this new chapter in my learning. If you are interested in astrology for either personal or professional reasons, you definitely owe it to yourself to take this course!\n> Rachel Maii\n\n★★★★★ I got an understanding off different programs for astrology. I´ve been searching for it.\n> Sandra Bäckman\n\n★★★★★ I enrolled in this course after years of interest with the topic of Astrology, and I'm glad I finally did! I had my natal chart read by my aunt last 2014, and since then I was very curious as to how the stars aligned and how they gave the perfect explanation as to how I've become and more. This course is very thorough and broken down into 6 different section so you can understand and have time to absorb and internalize the vast topic of astrology. From the basic astrology (aka zodiac signs) to actual interpretation of a natal chart. Plus, Damian is quick to answer my questions and messages, and that didn't leave me in a puzzled or questioning state for something in the course that was personally unclear for me. He's an amazing teacher. Thank you Damian. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE to everyone who wants to know themselves better or know why they are in a certain situation. Gives an extra meaning to the saying \"we are all made out of stars!\"\n> Michelle Eleazar\n\n★★★★★ Engaging, interesting, informative, captivating are only a few words that can describe this amazing course. Overall the best course I have taken in Udemy, easy to follow, visually engaging, definatelly recommended!!!\n> Carlos Vega Cumberland\n\n★★★★★ Very enjoyable. There's a lot more to astrology than I expected but I am enjoying the training style a lot.\n> Lisa T\n\n★★★★★ I'm really enjoying this course. A great course delivery style in small and to the point packages rather than dragging monologues and I feel myself being drawn in and learning. Hope you do more!\n> Sonja Souter\n\n★★★★★ I was hoping for a lot from this course and I'm very happy with what it's delivering. Solid, structured but entertaining and interesting. A lot of what I've tried learning in the past is falling into place for me now.\n> Brett Wong\n\n★★★★★ A really good course - I'm enjoying the presentation and the video work is very entertaining - so much better than hours of watching someone talk which is where I lose interest with other courses. But more importantly I feel I'm really learning a lot. I spent last night and some this morning just going over the ebook on my iPad and it's really beautiful. I hope more courses from this writer are on the way.\n> Elgin Mors\n\n★★★★★ This is great. Exactly what i was looking for and taught in a way that I learn best!\n> Vincent Flores\n\n★★★★★ This course is excellent! Is has been challenging and informational. I feel like I've learned so much! I definitely need to go through it again to make sure I've got all of the details. I hope Damien comes out with more courses!\n> Dayan Morgan-Sylvaen\n\n★★★★★ I love the resources, the printable cards to use to study. The information is clear and concise. Great course!\n> Alisa DeHaan\n\n★★★★★ Very interesting and good summary of the main concepts. I was deeply impressed! Thank you so much!\n>  Marcela Roxana Farcasescu\n\n★★★★★ It is an excellent course to get introduced clearly into astrology principles. There are many examples, and it touches many aspects that are well put together at the end. The support material, exercises and communication with the facilitator were excellent.\n> David Laferrière\n\n★★★★★ I've gone through Sections 1 & 2 so far but felt compelled to leave my first Udemy review. Damian is an exceptional teacher, did a phenomenal job with the video edits, and explains things very well. I wanted to understand some basic astrology and he is delivering that in spades. This is a fantastic course.\n> Rachel Rofe\n\n★★★★★ The information is well edited and keeps moving,every engaging\n> Sheree Greek\n\n★★★★★ Easy to undetstand with the way he explains it is straight forward.\n> Michelle King\n\n★★★★★ I’m enjoyed the course, both the content and delivery style. I loved the fact that the author provided both narrative and written summaries – catering for various learning styles, and also used well known people as examples, which enabled the student to put their learning's into context . The resources were great too. I learnt so much, and some interesting things about myself (and others!!). I found it very easy to navigate. Astronomy is WAY more in depth that I imagined.\n> Lyn Heynen\n\n★★★★★ Very pleased with this course. It has an interactive approach which I really like and it covers a broad range of difficult to explain information in a really creative way. I've eager to learn more about astrology and this has given me a really solid start. Thank you!\n>  Jimmy Hedgeman\n\n★★★★★ I've just finished 10 of 77 courses... still fair bit to go but it's been great - learn lots of new things already. The facilitator has deep knowledge of the subject. I have no basic knowledge prior to this course but I found every content is delivered very well - make it easier for me to understand. Love the video and manual, developed thoughtfully, beautiful and informative. Looking forward for more. Thank you!\n> Dessi Sandi",

One of the unique aspects of this course is the creation of a sacred circle including all the course participants, giving a sense of community and love. I would highly recommend any course by Sharon Ramel\". Jennifer -\nShamanic journeying is the art of using intention and rhythm to enter an altered state of consciousness. Once here, we connect with the spiritual dimension of reality.

However, in our virtual sacred space, everything is possible.\nBy the end of this shamanic journeying course, you will know how to:\nAccess hidden dimensions, unseen allies and healing wisdom for your life and our world.\nHow to open your heart and expand your mind to experience the sacredness of life.\nHow to harness your ability to understand the underlying causes of physical and emotional illness — both in yourself and others — and to bring balance and maybe heal those imbalances at a spiritual level.\nHow to gain access to a team of helping compassionate spirits devoted to your healing, growth and evolution; they can provide information on navigating essential areas of your life — from career to love to fulfil your most significant purpose.\nSee your direct connection to your ancestors who walk with you, pouring blessings into you once you open to their wisdom.\nCultivate new capacities and virtues, from compassion to courage, empowered by your helping spirit allies.\nDiscover a skill that, once learned, could help you to live a magical, enchanted life – where you are connected to the universe and your sense of purpose.\nHow to leave behind negatively, struggling and thinking that life is hard.\nRadically transform how you hold power and connect through your heart.\n\n\n\n\nHow To Approach This Course:\nCommitting to a schedule and adding the same time into your weekly calendar to watch one section at a time is ideal. Please complete all videos, read the PDF and answer any assignments that help you to deepen your practice. Watch the video or listen to the audio, and practice the ceremonial aspects. Contemplate your growing practice. Reviewing, listening, and practising from your emerging new awareness is a great idea.\nWeekly is ideal. However, it may work better for you to take longer in between each section. The same is true of the opposite. You may watch several parts at a time.

      "description": "The World Needs More Healers — Are You Ready to Answer the Call?\nRight now, the Earth is crying out for genuine healers. Our societies, communities, and families are in desperate need of healing on every level. The healer’s time is now. Whether for the young or the old, in our homes or our neighbourhoods, we need compassionate, dedicated individuals to step forward and bring the change we all long to see.\n\n\nAre you ready to make a difference?\nThere are hundreds of healing courses out there. You may be wondering: Why choose this one?\nThis Course Will Transform Your Life and Your Work\nWhether you're a beginner or a seasoned healer, this course will take you to the core of healing. Yes, I cover energy healing, spiritual healing, Reiki - all the buzzwords - everything you’ve heard of and more. But this is not about attaching labels or learning surface-level techniques. This is about becoming the healing itself.\n\n\nTrue mastery goes beyond methods. It’s about embodying healing so deeply that every touch, and every moment becomes a powerful tool for transformation.\n\n\nWhat Sets This Course Apart?\nI’ve spent over 30 years healing over 23,000 people and animals. I’ve had clinics in major cities across the globe, including LA, Phoenix, London, Paris, Dublin and Madrid,  and have taught more than 2,100 healers who have gone on to professional success.\nWhat I offer in this course is unlike anything you've experienced before, regardless of your level of expertise.\nMy private students speak of the profound change this course has brought into their lives. It’s easy to follow but will challenge you in ways that create deep, lasting transformation.\nHealing Is Your Birthright\nI believe that everyone is born with the ability to heal. Yes, that means you. We all have the potential to create miracles—it's simply a matter of awakening it. I am just an ordinary person who learned to embody the healing. You can do it too.\nThis is your time. This is your opportunity to become the healer you were meant to be.\nLearn to Embody Healing — Not Just Techniques\nMany healing courses focus on methods, techniques, hand placements, and secret symbols. But what good are techniques if you don’t truly understand and embody healing? When you become the healing, you no longer rely on tools and techniques—you are the technique. When you become the healing, EVERYTHING is a technique\n\n\nI cannot emphasise this enough. And if you don't enrol on my course, please take away this one thing: Techniques of healing are for people who DO NOT KNOW HOW TO HEAL. Techniques are a third-rate substitute for healing ability. Techniques are a crutch. If you become the healing, anything you do will create a healing response. When you fully embody your natural healing ability you can just play with healing. And it will work!\n\n\nFree yourself from techniques. Embrace concepts. Be the healing.\nThis course will teach you to embody healing in every aspect of your life. From the basics to the most advanced concepts, we’ll dive deep into what it means to be a healer. There are no shortcuts, no gimmicks. Just the truth about what it takes to become a master healer.\n\n\nWhat You'll Learn:\nHow to manage the pressure and expectations of being a healer\nHow to think about the healing process and your role in it\nHow to deal with both failures and successes\nThe impact of your ego on your healing practice\nHow to protect yourself from burnout\nHow illness serves a purpose in the healing journey\nHow to understand the healer-client relationship and its impact on outcomes\n\n\nNo one guided me when I started. I made mistakes, and healing almost consumed me. I was unprepared for the pressures of healing hundreds of people each week. But through those experiences, I learned invaluable lessons. Let me share them with you so you don’t have to make the same mistakes.\nMy Experience, Your Gain\nI’ve healed some of the most famous people and animals in the world. I’ve survived attempts on my life, and I’ve seen both the light and the dark sides of healing. This course includes everything I’ve learned in over three decades of practice.\nAnd it doesn’t stop there—I will continue to update the course as I grow and learn more.\n\n\nWhy Am I Doing This?\nI can’t heal forever. I’ve given my life to this work, often working 90-hour weeks for years on end. But when I’m gone, I want to leave behind an army of healers who can carry on this work—not for me, but for you. Each person you heal sends ripples of transformation through their community. Together, we can change the world.\n\n\nTestimonials from Students\n\"I learned things with Adrian that I have never heard from any other healer or spiritual teacher. I have been healing for most of my adult life, and attending this course has changed everything. I cannot believe what I have learned, and how it has changed my work. It is transformational. Finally, someone who tells the truth and can walk the walk.\"\n– Joanne L. Harris\n\n\n\"The greatest healer I have ever met. Adrian can do everything he says and more, and he is humble, funny, and kind. A lovely man. I attended his course in Scottsdale and loved it. I am filled with love for this man and what he can do. He has a way of making it seem so easy. But when you follow his advice and try it, it really is easy. I have been healing for ten years and have attended many courses and seminars. But nothing like this. Wow. Just wow.\"\n– Carlos J.\n\n\n\"I loved this book. So full of wisdom and so clearly written from the heart. Many years ago I had the amazing experience of two sessions with Adrian when I had been diagnosed with polymyalgia - I was very quickly symptom-free and able to return to Australia. I've stayed in touch with him since then and regard him as the most exceptional and gifted person I have ever met. His books are brilliant.\"\n– Helen Earlam on Strong Medicine\n\n\n\"I love this book! Rogue Healer is truly gripping, I couldn’t put it down! It has changed the way I view the world forever. It made me laugh, cry, and gasp out loud... I felt outraged at both the evil people who tried to destroy him, and the nasty treatment he has experienced from people who should have known better! I will never understand how people can be so vindictive and evil! From the stories I have read in the book, I can see that Adrian is clearly a remarkable man, with a talent for healing that I’ve only previously seen from the white witches and wizards in fantasy films! You can feel through his writing that he is full of compassion and only has a desire to help people. I can’t wait to read the second one next... Honestly, read the book and prepare to be moved, shocked, and amazed!\"\n– Charlotte R. on The Rogue Healer\n\n\n\"Brilliant. Best autobiography I've ever read. It's honest, exciting, and completely moving. If you ever meet this guy, you will instantly recognize him as totally genuine and honest. He is also a great healer. Read this book, you won’t regret it. You don’t have to see it to believe it; you have to believe it to see it, and that is the truth!\"\n– Beth M. on The Rogue Healer\n\n\nThe Path to Mastery Starts Here\nIf you’re serious about healing—whether you’re just starting or have years of experience—this course will fundamentally change how you understand and practice healing. It will change EVERYTHING you know about healing.\nHealing has given me a life filled with extraordinary experiences and deep connections. Now, I want to pass this gift on to you.\n\n\nSubjects covered include:\n\n\nThe Foundations of Healing: Understanding Your Natural Abilities\nEmbodying Healing: Moving Beyond Techniques\nHealing as a Way of Life: How to Be the Healing in Every Moment\nManaging Expectations and Pressure as a Healer\nNavigating Success and Failure: Keeping Balance in Your Practice\nEgo and Healing: How to Recognize and Manage Its Influence\nProtecting Yourself from Burnout: Sustainable Healing Practices\nUnderstanding the Role of Illness in the Healing Journey\nThe Dynamics Between Healer and Client: A Transformational Relationship\nRecognizing and Handling Darkness: When Healing Attracts Unseen Forces\nDeveloping Confidence and Trust in Your Healing Work\nBuilding a Legacy: How Your Healing Ripples Through the World\nAre you ready to take the first step?\n\n\nJoin me on this journey. Together, we can create miracles.\n\n\nAnd finally, something from my website to hammer home the point:\n\n\nThe great American jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk has been quoted as saying, “A genius is one who is most like himself.” By that standard, Monk was an undisputed genius. He has long been revered for his unique improvisational style. He was decades ahead of most of his contemporaries. The musician's musician. For me, Monk was the first pianist who made me hear the space around the notes as well as the notes themselves.\nMonk was a musical genius almost beyond compare. And that's what I want for you. Don't follow the old path. Don't rehash. Don't copy. Improvise. I want you to see the space around the notes. I want you to be \"most like yourself\". You don't need to copy anyone. You DO need to embody the healing and become the healing, as Monk became the music. Be the notes, be the healing, and be the spaces in between.\n\n\nHear those spaces. Listen to the silence.\n\n\nHealing is found in the spaces.\nIt sounds terrifying. Where is the structure? Where are the techniques? Where are the rules? But remember, when you become the healing, everything is a technique. You make the rules. You break the rules. You are the healing. You are the genius.\nIf in doubt - be more Monk\nBe free\nTHAT is healing!\"\n\n\n*I want to dedicate this course to my friend Sheila, my very first student, all those years ago. Sheila was already a healer but knew there was more to learn. She dedicated herself to being my student and became a great healer, a great supporter and a wonderful friend. Sadly she passed away in 2023 at a very great age. She will be missed by many people.",

This is attained through a special breathing method. When using this breathing method you will free your mind, and when your body is dancing, your soul can travel to other worlds, where you can meet your shamanic ancestors, spirit animals, or spirit guides. There you can get answers to questions, and you can learn, heal, or even help your friends to heal on a spiritual level.\nHere are some Benefits of Shamanic Dancing:\nIt is for all ages, and keeps you fit and young\nIt will Increase your energy\nIt can help to bring back the joy of life\nIt helps you to let go of blockages\nIt increases your inner visions\nIt will ground you with mother earth\nIt will bring your Spirit back into your body\nIt will free your mind\nIt connects you with your essence, your higher consciousness\nAnd you can experience Spirit on a physical level, not just in your thoughts.\nShamanic Dancing can be practiced at home, alone, or with friends, or in a big group.",

( Alchemy is a magical programme of transformation)\n\n\nIn my sessions, I am working with high dimensional vibrations and frequencies, to shift your vibrations, to allow more light into your light bodies at this time.  My Courses, hold a sacred space for you, where you learn  your true gifts and find connection to your souls plan.\n\n\nThis first short course, is for those students who love the Atlantis work.  As someone who has now been working with the Atlantean energies for over five years, I love to share my passion of Atlantis, sharing how everyone is here incarnated to share their gift. In this session we work with the High Priestess Isis and her team.\n\n\nAtlantis was an Ancient Era, and many of us are now feeling very connected as healers. Our gifts and knowledge are being returned to us.  We now have the connection of the dragons, the unicorns and the dolphin realms.\n\n\nMy courses, will be using these etheric multidimensional light workers, who have returned to help humanity, at this present time. If you love a sacred space to work with your own soul then my courses maybe for you. This series will include many activations, symbols, and gifts that are returning to support your awakening.\n\n\nIn this short course, I will activate, and open further your third eye, with the help of the Priestess Isis.  Initiate you into the magic school of Alchemy and share with you a sacred symbol, for you to work with in your own healing.\n\n\nPriestess Isis is often regarded as one of the most famous dieties of the time. She incarnated following her time in Atlantis and used her mystic abilities to bring her murdered husband Osiris back to life. She has a number of aspects to her, that we can link into, to help us with our own soul work, one as a mother, and one as the high Priestess. She was full of passion, mystery and mastery. I know you will love her, as much as I do !\n\n\nPlease bring a paper, pen and a person to mind, who would love and be open to some healing or a reading.  We will work on your third eye healing skills.  Maybe ask their permission and see what feedback you get?  Practice, Practice, Practice is always the secret to the connection and any healing.\n\n\nIf you are a reiki practiotioner or a spiritual healer, add this to your practice, otherwise try this work on family and friends.\n\n\nIf you have a favourite crystal, please bring it to the attunement process.  A quartz is always a favourite of mine for attunements, or a herkimer diamond.\n\n\nI hope this session may resonate on a level to you, and I cant wait to guide you through this short course. It will be fun....\n\n\n\n\n* If you message with me, I am happy to send you a pdf Certificate of attendance for each part of this programme.\nIf you attend all in the series. You will receive the Gold Star Of  Atlantean Alchemy Certificate.  (Please note I do certificates on a set day, each month, so you may have a wait for the reply)",

This often misunderstood system was the basis for Haitian liberation and its subsequent domino effect throughout the Americas. Beyond revolution, Haitian Vodou is a catalyst for powerful individual and societal change.\nIn this dynamic course, Haitian-native Vodusiant Ritchy Thermidor and Dr. Asanee Brogan outline the inner workings and deep mysteries of this compelling spiritual system from the Haitian perspective. They present an enlightening profile of Haitian Vodou as they explain the essential elements of ritual work and sacred rites in this system. Both presenters are practitioners of voodoo and, as such, provide in-depth knowledge of this sacred spiritual system.\nThis course introduces students to foundational practices in Haitian Vodou. It outlines Haitian Vodou from a traditional perspective and how one can get started in this practice. It likewise covers rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices, and offerings commonly performed within this spiritual system. Learners also get a basic introduction to the Haitian Kreyòl language and an understanding of key concepts inherent in the Haitian Vodou culture. Topics include sacrifices, offerings, scarves, voodoo bottles, idols, icons, veve, candle work, and much more.\nEnroll now to gain exclusive insights and illuminating depictions of Haitian Vodou in this premier course.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This course includes depictions and discussions of animal sacrifice as part of the Haitian Vodou practice.

They are usually created in our matrix during our time in the womb, or in early childhood.\nWe have to take 100% responsibility to be able to identify them and to release them. They will be connected to specific beliefs, that are not serving our highest purpose.\nThey express themselves through :\n·      Fears\n·      Unease when expressing ourselves\n·      Shyness\n·      Depression\n·      The inability to enjoy life at 100%\n·      Sadness\n·      Lack of clarity\n·      Codependence\n·      Unhealthy relationships\n·      Difficult relationships with our mother, or father\n·      No desire to live\n·      Not feeling complete and whole\n·      Self sabotage\n·      Lack of motivation\n·      Blockages to successful manifestation\nIn this class, we will first learn how to identify these core beliefs through Self Observation and Kinesiologic Muscle Testing.\nYou will be able to see how specific beliefs, connected to your time in the womb trigger you and block you.\nYou will learn how to test the accuracy of statements and beliefs with your own body, with Muscle testing, in a clear way, so that you can go beyond your denial and listen to the wisdom of your subconscious mind and cells.\nAfter identifying the core beliefs that created these emotional barriers, we will go through 2 different kind of healings :\n·      EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) : this technique will be used in a really specific way to replace the negative beliefs we hold by their positive equivalent.\n·      Quantum Energetic Healing : use the power of your Heart, and receive a powerful download to release the thoughts forms that are not serving you anymore from your energetic structure and replace them by positive beliefs.\nYou will be guided through different processes to spot exactly what core issues you have, and how to release them.\nThese are efficient and simple tools, that you can apply to many other aspects of your life.\nYou will as well be able to use them for others, to support their own journey.\nAfter releasing these inappropriate beliefs from your field, you will open a new space for the Light ! You will be able to express yourself safely and easily, and you will embrace your life like never before !\nIt is time to unleash your true potential ! Time to shine and share your own Light !\nSo are you ready ? Then join us !!!",

The cross-over from various African Tradition Religions (ATR) is obvious and admittedly respected. However, there are huge differences in practices and dogma from the ATR.\nWe will touch upon these similarities and where appropriate cast distinctions. One distinction from the ATR’s like Santeria, Voodoo, Voudun, and Palo Mayombe, etc.. is that Hoodoo and Conjure do not require initiation into the Priesthood of a tradition. It’s for the lay-person to use.\nWe will be covering:\nCandle Magic – use of types, colors and “works” such as herbs, oils and powders within.\nMagical Herbs – herbal “remedies” that amplify intent of a goal (often found in the spice rack)\nPetitions – How to cast, or state your case with various entities or personifications.\n\n\nWe will also be offering step-by-step spells in:\nMoney\nCareer\nLove\nWe will also be going over cleansing, such as baths and spiritual colognes. Which is the most important part of this entire course.\nHoodoo and Conjure are the McGyver’s of the magical world. Simple items lying about, like nails, string, dirt, twigs and herbs can be combined in such a way, as to change the outcome of an event to your favor.\nThis is what you’ll learn, and give you the necessary knowledge to continue learning more spells or works, and understand how and why they work.",

      "description": "Welcome to this new class of Magic Vibrations Healing called Healing the 5 Soul Wounds.\nAccording to the author and psychologist Lise Bourbeau, each of us got imprinted in the first years of our life with traumatic imprints, called the 5 soul wounds.\nThere are Rejection, Abandonment, Humiliation, Betrayal and Injustice.\nAs we don´t usually remember our life before 5 years old, it is hard to access the memories of these early imprinted traumas.\nThis is affecting all aspects of our lives as we develop Ego strategies and masks to avoid further pain. These soul wounds are the original cause of many addictions, withdrawing patterns, sabotage, controlling patterns and coping mechanisms we developed along the way and that are not serving us anymore.\nIn this class, we explore in details these 5 soul wounds: how they express themselves in our lives and how they condition us.\nI created specific healing grids for each of these wounds. We will go through powerful healing meditations for each of them so that we can release the charge and the imprint of these traumas on our consciousness and psyche.\nThe grids I created use a technology called Gridmasters and are bringing many resources from the intelligences of Creation to support our own self healing.\nAfter clearing all these traumatic imprints, we will go through a meditation and grid of Self Love.\nAfter each of your processes, you can choose to run a grid of integration provided as well in the course.\nYou will be able to use these grids for yourself in the future, any time you feel the need to revisit these processes.\nAre you ready to bring more freedom from conditioning in your life?\nAre you ready to release these old patterns that are sabotaging your own happiness?\nThen you are in the right place.\nJoin us in this powerful healing journey!\nDemian Haye",

      "description": "Who is this course for?\nThis course is made for people who already know the meaning of the cards, so it is NOT suitable for complete beginners!\nWhen I learned the meaning of the Tarot, I quickly discovered that it is not always easy to interpret the cards in a layout. What if you get a positive card in a spot that represents a negative question, or visa versa? I used to find those situations very confusing. But, it doesn't have to be.\nSome people will tell you to keep pulling clarifying cards when you feel confused, and in some situations, that is perfectly ok. But, in most cases, you can simply read the cards exactly as they land in the layout if you just know how.\nI have developed a step by step method that makes the whole process pretty easy. I also use numerology to get a deeper understanding of what underlying energies we are dealing with. So when you are done with this course, you should be able to offer your clients professional readings with great confidence and deep insight.\n\nWhat's so special about this course?\nI didn't just want to teach you the meaning of the cards in a random layout; that would be way too boring! I wanted the layouts to have meaning in themselves as well so I picked layouts that are very specific to your journey as a Tarot reader. In these layouts, you can discover what your most unique talents are, what your calling and path is and how to break through creativity blocks and find a higher degree of alignment with Source.\nI used spreads that can help you discover your soul purpose, connect with your spirit guides and follow your dreams. Other layouts can help you manifest with the law of attraction, see things from a bigger perspective and learn to own your stuff. So, you'll learn a lot more than just how to interpret the cards.\n\nThe layouts are meant to give you answers that help you discover valuable aspects of yourself so you can walk your Tarot path with more clarity and greater wisdom.\n\n\nWhat are your Tarot super powers?\nTo me, every Tarot reader has super powers that they are here to share with the world. Your super powers are a unique combination of traits that help you understand what exactly you are here to share. We use specific layouts to discover what these traits are.\n\n\nThe deeper you go into the course, the more insight you will learn about who you are as a Tarot reader.\n\n\nI would highly recommend that you get yourself a Tarot journal before you start the course. Each layout can help you find valuable answers that you might want to write down.\n\nWhy should you learn from me?\nI'm a self taught intuitive bohemian Goddess with a strong connection to Spirit. I feel like Tarot is the perfect tool when it comes to sharing my wisdom, understanding and life experience with like minded seekers of truth. To me, Tarot is so much more than just party tricks and future predictions. It is a blueprint for the whole spiritual journey we are here to walk, and you'll learn things from me that you won't find anywhere else.\nMy approach is original, influenced by my inner guidance, numerology, life experience as well as my journeys to India. So if you are spiritually inclined and want a fresh, new take on how to read the Tarot, this course was made for you. I hope you feel inspired to sign up and I can't wait to connect with you on the other side. See you there...",

      "description": "For Whom Is This Course?\nThis course is a result of my decades of teaching astrology to many very different audiences. I am always looking for a way to make complex concepts as simple as possible, and here I am addressing the audience with no, or very little, previous knowledge of astrology.\nWhat's So Special About It?\nVery gently, carefully avoiding any unnecessary technicalities, I will introduce to you the main building blocks of astrology — signs, houses, and planets. As a result, after only a few lessons you'll begin to write competent astrological forecasts — something that would normally be only possible for a professional astrologer.\nWhat Should You Expect In The End Of This Course?\nBy the end of the course you will acquire not only all the knowledge that is necessary to write detailed popular astrological forecasts (so called \"horoscopes\", like those published in newspapers and magazines), but also a decent amount of experience — provided you'll do all the recommended homework.\nWhat's Inside The Course?\nThe course consists of 59 video lessons. Each lesson comes with a full transcript, which you can download and read at your convenience. Most lesson have a quiz to help you test your knowledge, and there are many different handouts: keywords, templates, and so on.\nThe Curriculum Looks Unusual. Why?\nThe approach to teaching I took in this course is unusual, innovative. Superficially, it looks like lessons follow in no particular order, but in fact this order was very well thought-through. My aim is to keep you interested and excited at every step through the course, so I give you something to do, and to start gaining confidence, in the very early lessons. I then gradually add carefully selected ideas in a way one would make a fire in a fireplace: first I add only small pieces of wood and make sure they burn brightly, then bigger and bigger ones, until finally I have a roaring fire — then I can throw in any logs, and they will burn easily and happily!\nDo You Have Questions?\nPlease feel free to ask me whenever you'll have any questions or doubts.",

Right Hand Path Reiki is a stand alone Reiki Style that utilizes the channeling of Universal Reiki Energy and Blending it with one's own Qi Life Force Energy to Harmonize the Aura and Chakra System through the Right Hand. The Left Hand is never used in touch as it is considered to be the receiving hand and has been known in the popular and often overlooked Two Handed Reiki Styles to create a closed circuit of energy between practitioner and receiver turning the practitioner into a filter for negative energy which could be harmful to both practitioner and recipients. Therefore, Certifying Right Hand Path Reiki one of the safest and most powerful forms of Reiki on the Planet!

Many have already done it and it's time you do it as well !\nIf you choose to activate your 12 DNA strands you will gradually become more psychic.\nMany other benefits are just around the corner. Here are some benefits you will gain by activating your 12 DNA strands:\nCleanse Your Aura\nClear the highest priority auric attachments you have picked up from people, places, times, things and events. Close openings in your auric field that absorb other people's negative energy, spill your Life Force away and cause you to feel tired and restless. Calibrate your chakras, remove discarnates and other foreign entities from your field.\nUnplug Your Mind From The Matrix\n\nClear unnatural seals, implants and DNA blockages that connect your mind to the matrix. Activate your 12 strand DNA to access higher aspects of your multidimensional awareness, embody your Soul's purpose and raise your frequency to attract a higher grid of people, places, times, things and events. Activate your Golden DNA to become a frequency holder for the ascension of Earth and humanity.\nCut All Cords of Attachment\n\nClearing cords of attachment is the first step to freedom. Stop other people from siphoning your energy and bring a resourceful completion to past unresolved events that keep being projected onto your relationships. Allow the spiritual ties between you and other people to blossom.\nTranscend Your Emotional Pain Body\n\nYour pain body is an energy vampire that takes over your mental and emotional bodies to feed from your discordant thought forms and the reactions of other people. The pain body loves to create drama and feed from pain. Clear the soul fragments and past painful events related to the SOURCE of your pain body and become more present, peaceful and centered.\nMaster Your Relationships\nClear all your past relationship baggage and painful experiences like: betrayal, abandonment, heartbreaks, rejection and abuse. Get out of relationship karmic loops, raise your frequency and manifest the relationship you have always envisioned with your current partner or a new relationship if you are single. Relationships are the greatest opportunities to grow, evolve and experience a higher giving love.\nAnnihilate All Your Fears\n\nFear is the only thing that can stop you from moving forward. Clear all the highest priority fears from this and all past lifetimes so you can embody a state of courage and take inspired action. Imagine how your life would be if you were free from the fear of failure, fear of death, fear of criticism, fear of not being good enough and the fear of not being loved. It is time to activate the ultimate sense of personal power and unleash your greatest potential!\nActivate Your Heart Chakra With Unconditional Self-Love\n\nClear all soul fragments related to resentment, betrayal, judgment, hatred, guilt, shame and trust issues that prevent your from fully opening your heart chakra and melting in unconditional self love. Experience the bliss of melting in Divine Love and let your mind surrender to your heart's intelligence and guidance.\nMaster Higher Self Healing\n\nMaster the connection to your Higher Self, read energy signatures and clear the SOURCE of any energetic blockage on yourself and other people. This energy healing technique will allow you to transcend both time and space to perform soul retrievals and heal soul fragments that were created in this and past lifetimes. Remove auric attachments, karmic imprints, shadow self archetypes, negative thought forms and energy blockages to any manifestation. Connecting to your Higher Self is the ultimate way to become sovereign and take control of your destiny!\nManifest Financial Abundance\n\nClear all energetic blockages like unworthiness, undeservedness, poverty consciousness, lack and limitation to finally get out of the scarcity karmic loop. Activate your DNA, chakras and auric field with the frequencies of financial and material wealth.",

To communicate and network with the rest of the body, they are connected to our meridian system, a circuitry in our etheric body. We have 12 pairs of main meridians and 8 marvelous vessels that supervise the overall network.\nIn this class, we will explore more than 80 DNA codes to purify and activate all our organs, meridians and marvelous vessels.\nThese DNA codes are phonic triggers, like sounds that you need to repeat aloud 3 times to activate some dormant energetic systems in your DNA that will purify and/or activate a specific part of your body.\nHere are the codes we will discover together:\nOur organs/body parts:\nEyes, Ears, Mouth, Gums, Tongue, Nose, Larynx, Brain, Lungs, heart, Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Bladder, Skin, Kidneys, Small Intestine, long Intestine and Gallbladder.\nOur 12 pair of main meridians:\nLungs-Long Intestine-Stomach-Spleen-Heart-Small intestine- Bladder-Kidneys-Pericardium-triple Warmer-Gallbladder- Liver\nOur 8 marvelous vessels:\nRen Mai-Du Mai-Chong Mai-Dai Mai-Yinwei Mai-Yangwei Mai- Yinchiao Mai-Yangchiao Mai\nThen we will explore other codes to boost our thymus gland, and combinations to boost considerably our all immunity.\nA meditation with Illahi Noor, the golden Ray energy will help us to reharmonize the communication between all our cells.\nYou will be as well introduced to testing to be able to determine the purity and vitality of each of your organs-meridians. And you will be able to track the improvements.\nSome general tips of herbal remedies, detox techniques and breathwork will be shared as well.\nIf you have already played with DNA codes from my other classes, then you know how efficient they can be. And if it is your fist class with these codes, then simply trust: your body has all the answers, all the power to restore health, harmony and joy.\nOur bodies are designed perfectly, to sustain the harsh environment where we live in.

This ancient practice of divination and omen interpretation, studied and integrated by dynasties and sages in India, China, the Mayan, Egyptian, Greek, and Roman Empires has morphed into the modern age's most profound and specific form of counseling and personal coaching.\nIn this course, you learn the fundamentals of the astrological language, with a focus on the meaning of each Planet. You will learn how the Planets are the \"teachers\" in astrology, instructing us in the \"lessons\" of the Houses and through the methods of the Signs.\nPlanets also act as \"characters\" in our soul: a force that compels us to act in a certain way. For each planet you will learn its core astrological meaning through learning its correspondences in terms of Tarot, Chakras, Archetypes and Gods. You will learn Indian Mantras for each planet as well as Affirmations. You will also learn what Sign each planet rules, and the signs that benefit or challenge each planet, called Essential Dignity. A key aspect of this course is learning how to \"read\" a Planet in a House, in a Sign, and in Aspect/Relationship to other planets.\nThis course is designed for different kinds of learners as well: You will be shown a portrait of the planet with images and Keyword associations. You will learn how a planet speaks its purpose through its Poetic Voice.\nBesides the standard planets, you will also learn about Chiron and the Lunar Nodes—essential elements of any complete chart interpretation.\nBy the end of the course, you will leave with a solid foundation and confident ability to read one of Astrology's most fundamental components",

As usual, Peter did it in a simple, easy-to-understand, and attractive way. I enjoyed each part and keep watching it multiple times. Thanks for such a wonderful course\"— Ossama Hakim\n\n\nWhat if the doorway to higher awareness was found in stillness, just before sleep?\nWhat if you could consciously leave your body—at will—and explore not just deeper layers of yourself...but even beyond?\n\nThis course isn’t just about escaping your body—it’s about returning with insight.\nThrough meditation, targeted techniques, and deep dream training, you’ll learn to initiate Wake-Induced Lucid Dreams (WILD) and conscious Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs). I’ll guide you to reach the elusive “mind awake, body asleep” state and unlock the vibration phase that signals you’re ready to cross the threshold.\n\nFrom there, the non-physical world opens:\nExplore vast dreamscapes, the astral world, reconnect with guides, revisit memories, and tap into the subtle body for healing and clarity.\n\n\n\"Peter's previous course helped me have my first lucid dream. This course continues my journey :)\"— Kryss Eamer\n\nWhat You’ll Learn:\nHow to induce OBEs from wakefulness or sleep paralysis\nThe critical moment of “separation”—and how to stabilize it\nProven WILD techniques: tactile methods, visualizations, hypnagogic surfacing\nNavigating the astral plane: doorways, dream logic, and realm transitions\nDream control: fly, phase through walls, summon guides or revisit past scenes\nHealing methods using dream imagery, energy work, and intention\nHow to move through blocks like fear, doubt, or mental noise\nHow to distinguish WILDs, OBEs, and Astral Projection\nHow to use powerful Dream Herbs, Neurochemical enhancers and Dream Masks.\n\n\nWhy Learn With Me?\nOver 1,000 documented lucid dreams, 15+ years experience\nInitiated in Tibetan Dream Yoga under Chögyal Rinpoche\nPGCE-qualified teacher and internationally recognized dream therapist\nFour best-selling courses with over 30,000 students\nKnown for blending science, soul, and story—with precision and depth\nThis isn’t just theory. Each concept is brought to life with custom animations, clear walkthroughs, and guided practices—designed to help you feel, not just think, your way into altered states of consciousness.\n\n\nWho This Course Is For\nThe curious. The restless. The sensitives and seekers.\nIf you’ve ever glimpsed something beyond waking reality—or felt the pull to explore inner dimensions—this course gives you the map and methods to go there consciously.\n\n\nWhether you're looking to access non-ordinary states for healing, insight, or spiritual development, this is a safe, grounded, and powerful path forward.\n\n\n\"My second course after Lucid Dreaming. Easy to understand with practical exercises. I liked all the different alternatives to accomplish an OBE. Highly recommended. You will enjoy it. A++!\"— Hector Manjarrez\n\n\nA Note from Me\nWhen I began these practices, I wasn’t chasing astral travel.\nI was chasing answers—to what consciousness is, to what happens when we sleep, and to who we are beyond the surface.\nNow, after 15 years of dreamwork and non-ordinary exploration, I offer this course as a path:\nA way to consciously step beyond the body—and return with something real.\n\n\nIf you’re ready, I’ll guide you through.\nEnroll today and begin tonight.",

I’ve been studying tapping to get certified for several months with another teacher but got stuck in the science and setup of it. Sal provides a very practical, hands on approach to tapping and then walks you through the process to use it in your own life. After watching the application video, I feel like I had a private session with her, in her office. The scripts were fantastic! For those put off by the psychic nature of the course, don’t be. The scripts can be easily be adapted for coaches like me who aren’t in the psychic field. The underlying principles and places we get stuff are very similar.

After completing all of the practical tapping sessions I feel great, my self confidence has risen even higher.. I started this course as a bit of a skeptic as far as Tapping was concerned ( I did a couple sessions previously with a friend and honestly did nothing for me) but Sal has once again opened up another path for me to follow.. Thank you Sal and I know there will be another course and more learning for me, this grandma isn't done yet.. :)\nLesley\n\n\nI have used the Tapping course a couple of times now and it made such a difference. I have unblocked areas that I hadn't realised were affecting me. My readings are clearer and my Reiki is working so much better as well. Thank you so much . Love and light.\nJulie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if you are serious about improving your psychic and healing abilities- and you confidence to become a professional healer and psychic sign up today and discover the quickest and easiest healing modality to release blocks to your psychic and healing gifts.",

      "description": "Learn how to access the energy of crystals in a practical way!\n\n\nCrystal Energy Basics is an introduction to using crystals and stones in your life as energetic support. Crystals have been used for centuries, and in the current times, we are learning to use their energy not only for computers, cell phones, and other technologies, but as a spiritual tool for personal growth. They are a vibrational support from Mother Earth that is here to support us in our mind, body, and spirit.\n\n\nAs we seek alternative methods of healing and finding calm in our lives, holistic healing methods can help us tap into the energies of crystals. We can use them as a meditation tool, for peace and calming, for energizing our water, and most importantly, for our own emotional and spiritual expansion. Using crystals can be in a grounded, practical manner (forget the over the top “woo woo” of waving a magic crystal wand around, it’s not happening here!) that works with your everyday life. Let’s dig in together to bring new awareness to your life.\n\n\nThis course includes:\nEasy to understand Video Instruction\nBonus PDF's or Articles in most lectures (the equivalent of 2 full E-books)\n\n\nIt includes over 2 HOURS of instruction and meditations, and is self-paced for you to complete as quickly or as slowly as you need to for your own schedule.\n\n\nCrystal Energy Basics is structured simply in short lectures of information, starting with the nuts and bolts of the practical aspects of using crystals, moving to sensing crystal energy, and finally the energetic properties of crystals that are great for beginners.\n\n\nLectures include:\nChoosing crystals for yourself\nClearing crystals for their optimal use\nCrystal shapes + what they mean energetically\nPendulum use to choose crystals\nSensing crystal energy\nWorking with Chakras + Crystals\n10 Beginner Crystal + Stone Properties\nSo much more!\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will feel confident with a basic understanding of how crystals work and ways they can help energize your life and spirit. If you are seeking new perspective or an alternative method for healing your emotions, changing your life, or simply looking to expand your knowledge, this original crystal course (the first ever on Udemy) will provide insight and ideas on bringing crystal energy into your realm of living.\n\nYour instructor Jennifer Salness is a Crystal Intuitive, Reiki Master Teacher, and Writer. Her passion for crystals and stones began at a young age and she has been working with them professionally for over 20 years. Through working with the crystals directly, she has developed her own style of teaching with practical, every day applications, and has a grounded and yet spiritually connected manner. She has written for multiple publications on crystals, has presented workshops in person, online, at expos and events around the US, and been a guest on radio shows and podcasts for many years. Jennifer is the founder of Crystalline Light.\n\n\n(DISCLAIMER: Crystals + stones are not meant as medical advice.

      "description": "All Card Images Uniquely Designed For Us,  Are Provided For FREE In This Course You Do Not Need To Buy Anything\n\nIn this enlightening course you will learn everything you need to know to give yourself, family and friends an Angel Oracle Card reading.\nIn ancient times an Oracle was a wise Priestess who would be consulted by Kings because of her spiritual connections to the Gods, it was said that the Gods spoke through her to man. So, in the same way that people travelled to consult the Oracle,\nYOU will learn to be the Oracle yourself, you will learn to connect your energy with the energy of the oracle cards and you will become a conduit for spiritual guidance, wisdom and knowledge.\nIn this course you will connect with 22 different angels and archangels and you will meet them all individually so that you can make a special heart connection with them.  More importantly, each angel will connect you with an aspect of Christ consciousness also called Buddha consciousness, to support you in your journey of enlightenment and your growth of your spiritual gifts and talents. As well as meeting the 22 angels you will learn 9 different types of card readings, you will learn an invocation/prayer for each one so that you can connect at any time to the energy of that angel and much much more.\nI am joined on this course by the amazing Alexandra Gabriel, whose unique connection to the angelic realm means she brings amazing insight from these realms. Alexandra channels the angelic realms through her voice, if you have taken my previous angel courses you will have been touched by her music.  Both of us will give our individual channellings on these angels and you will learn to recognise these angels and their energy with some unique perspectives.\n\nThe card designs provided exclusively for this course have been channelled by myself and Alexandra and they are breathtaking, you will be able to use them for your own use.\nThe 22 card images are provided for you to download for personal use as cards.\n\nThe course content is channelled by us from a unique perspective and if you want to know the source of the information it is the Universe, so dont expect references to it ! If another source is referred to apart from us then it is acknowledged with permission.\nFeatured Review\n\"Oh my goodness! I have to THANK YOU! 1) for this angel healing course I'm absolutely devouring. But also 2) for referring me to Alexandra Gabriel. This year has been a WHIRLWIND as I would imagine most spiritual awakenings are...yes? Or is it just me? Haha. Anyway, Kuan Yin (who I'd never even HEARD of before comes in for me so strong with such beautiful messages that she makes me cry happy tears of joy)! Just this morning I had an ego-based fear thought - \"What if I'm just making this all up and I'm kinda nuts?\" And then you mention Alexandra, so I look her up and Google takes me to an interview on YouTube where the very first song the interviewer plays is The Heart of Quan Yin!\" I almost fell out of my chair!! For a few reasons. One, her voice is INCREDIBLE, two, there's Quan Yin popping up again, three I've been collecting musical instruments (crystal singing bowls and a metal drum thingy I'm not quite sure what you call it) and wondering how this is all going to come together. I was born singing I think. LOVE it. But that part of me has been hibernating. I wasn't sure how to bring this all together UNTIL Alexandra. SO thank you dear Tania! I can't wait to get through the rest of this course and move on to the next ones which I've already purchased :D\"\n\n\nThis course is a labour of love and we hope you feel the angels and our love behind it.\nyours in the light\nTania and Alexandra",

We are talking about a free form chakra dance and meditation that reveals you to yourself! Coming home to your own body/soul sense. That deep knowing that you lost along the road we call life.\n“Dance? But, I have two left feet. I am not good at dancing. Meditate! I cannot sit still. I am no good. I have tried before\"\nWell listen up my friends, dancing is fun! Meditation is also fun and both activities are relaxing. It's not just about the steps or the technique. It's not just about the music, it's about the space you create. This course is a combination of moving your body - chakra dancing, stimulating your mind and enhancing your spirit. Learn engaging meditation to relax you and it is a great way to express your emotions. Balanced chakras bring new vitality to your life. Learn how to unload your chakras of the life long sludge!\n\nChakras are our life force or vital energy. Some call them “the spinning wheels of light\" located all over your body. Although we have thousands of them, there are seven major chakras located along our spine from the base to just above our head that we need to focus on. The role of the chakra system is to be able to regulate the flow of our energy force or what we commonly have known as the aura. Once our energy force is blocked due to the many challenges and emotional roller coaster we find ourselves in, it is not surprising that we get sick – not only physically, mentally, but also emotionally.\nThe chakras are wheel-like vortices of energy which connect the physical body to its subtle energetic counterparts. In this article, we'll take a look at the seven main chakras, which play a key role in energy reception and transmutation for self-development.\nThe chakra system has been extensively studied and described in Eastern systems of philosophy and medicine, although Western science remains sceptical their very existence. Nonetheless, awareness of the body as an energy system is increasing among forward-thinking scientists, and the chakras along with meditation continue to play an important role in a  variety of holistic healing disciplines for personal development.\nCertification and Accreditation: Some instructors offer “accreditation” via external official-sounding bodies. The majority of these are fake. We call them Certificate Mills. The only thing the “Mill” wishes to see from the instructor is money (ranging from 40 - 1500 dollars per course depending on the Mill) to pay for the process.

And with that, the discovery that everything in me that I long thought was missing, broken or in need of fixing, has been here all along, fully formed, beautifully and perfectly imperfect, and exactly right. And I cannot imagine a greater gift than that.\" Ash\n\n\"I have taken Reiki in a one on one instructor session and found the online course much better.  I can do the classes on my time, not the instructor's time.  It takes me a little longer to get grounded.  In the instructor session, he had a large amount of coursework to go through so I didn't even know what questions to ask and we were on to the next step. As a side note, I have done online courses with other academies. Your course curriculum and instruction are top notch.  I would recommend your courses for anyone interested in Reiki.\"Carolyn M.\n\n\n\"I just wanted you to know, if you ever wonder if your courses are changing people, they are; and not only me but everyone I touch (literally). I have already had some incredible healing experiences with my friends and family. Thank you Lisa for your course, your guidance and your light. Never did I dream a simple Udemy course would change my life so profoundly.\" Greg M.\nFollow your heart and if this course resonates with you, join us.\n\nImportant Note:\nStudents who wish to receive certification in this course will receive attunements to Levels I, II and Master Reiki which will require that they provide personal information (name, email) when they schedule these attunements.

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED & ACCREDITED\nThe Good Witch| Although this is intended as an introductory theological, historical look into witchcraft and paganism, the experienced witch and pagan will surely find useful and interesting information in this course. This ancient practice of witchcraft is a wealth of history and information that no one course could ever get to the bottom of and so with that being said it is non-exhaustive. I intend to continue to learn and add to this course and will notify you when I do. If I too am a witch by definition and practice, I am surely a happy witch, and with that being said, I bring joy and happiness to every lecture, per usual. This is not a dark arts course, but a magical healing arts course touching on history and your divine nature, with love & light! There are some very profound learning experiences in this course I'm excited to share with you.\nTheosophy in short is being in union with nature, the divine and your supernatural powers of intuition, needing no religion to achieve this state of spiritual ecstasy, other than the truth of your existence. This is not a strict adherence to the origins of this practice, but rather a way of incorporating this understanding and way of life, so similar to the beliefs of paganism, as a concept. I'm not much for following people's rules or doctrines, but rather, hearing the ring of truth and applying them to my life in a way that suits me to live a happy life. This is how it is discussed and taught here.\nLet's talk about what we'll cover in this course:\nTheological Historical View of Paganism & Witchcraft Introduction\nIntroductory Theosophy Discussion & Explanation\nWords As Spells, Sacred Sounds (Vibroacoustics), Healing Origins with PDF Guidebook\nWitch Trial Historical Study: Villain's, Victims & The Church (The Malleus Maleficarum)\nWho Were Pagans: Social Economic & Spiritual\nOfferings of Pagans/Witches and Why, Including Human Sacrifices\nAnswering the Question: Do Witches/Pagans Worship Satan\nExtensive Look at Satan the Devil & Satanism\nDiscussion of Aleister Crowley, Anton LeVay & Daughter Zeena LeVay Schreck (Now a Tantric Buddhist, Artist & Sethian)\nWicker (wicca) Man Ritual & Why\n11 Types of Witches (non-exhaustive and objective)\nBaphomet: The Most Misunderstood Symbol in History\nSacred Circle Explained\nWhy the Church Classifies All Esoteric Practices Evil (objective)\nMany Paths that Lead to Spirit and Harmony\nExternal Resources of Paganism/Witchcraft Documentaries\nExternal Resources of Satanism Documentaries, Satanist Interviews and Visit to a Satanic Temple (not scary at all)\n11-Page Sacred Sounds Guidebook (Intro Spell Work & Chanting Spells)\n11-Page \"The Witch Trials| The Forgotten Holocaust of Women\" History Workbook\nSacred Sounds External Resources & Quizes for Understanding\nI had a blast making this course and I hope you enjoy it.

The majority of these are fake. We call them Certificate Mills. The only thing the “Mill” wishes to see from the instructor is money (ranging from $40 - $1500 per course depending on the Mill) to pay for the process. They do not even wish to see 1 minute of any course nor any qualification an instructor may hold. You; the student is then sent to these places to pay them (more) money as the student. They commonly offer public liability insurance that you can get WITHOUT them and the fake fancy-looking Diploma.\nCertificates:\nI offer you certificates in love and trust: They are a gift, not a right.\nPlease understand that NO personalisation requests will be considered.\nThe course name and images for my courses change semi-regularly - it is a way we instructors keep our courses looking fresh on Udemy.\nCourse certificates I issue will not necessarily have the exact wording or imagery currently on Udemy.\nThe only place to ask is through Udemy messages - I will not reply to external requests.\nIf you use a pseudonym on Udemy, you must request me first up to use your real name - otherwise, it stands as issued.\nPlease Note: All students who enrol in this course also will receive periodic free and discounted access to my other top-rated current and upcoming courses.\n\n\n#Chakras #PalmChakras #chakrabalancing #Meditation #Manifestation #Spirituality #Spiritual",

      "description": "REIKI: Reiki Level I, II & Master Course\nThis course includes all three levels of Reiki that is Reiki Level 1, Reiki Level 2, and Master Level.\nI have explained all Levels of Reiki in a simple and easy way so that everyone understands it. My aim as a Reiki master is to bring clarity and understanding to all who take this course. Reiki energy is already present in everyone, you just have to discover it and I will help you to find your inner healing power. So learn about Reiki which is a universal energy that is being used positively all over the world to heal at different level of emotional, physical, mental & energetic imbalances. Reiki is present in all living things. Your imagination is the only thing that can set limitations on its uses.\nBecome a Certified Reiki Master\nLevel I of Reiki includes the hand positions used when doing Reiki on you and others, the Reiki principles, and history of Reiki. You will receive the attunements. Once you have received the attunements you are a Reiki Practitioner.\nLevel II of Reiki you will learn how to perform Reiki from a distance and this level includes the three Reiki Symbols (Focus, Harmony, and Connection)\nLevel III of Reiki you will learn about the Usui Master Symbol, its meaning and its application. This symbol completes the other three symbols taught at Level II.\nThe skills and techniques associated with Reiki are simple and easy to learn. Small children and adults can equally understand and combine this ancient form of healing into their lives. Regular contact with Reiki will bring your mind body and spirit into balance. It will also help prevent future creation of illness and disease.\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN IN THS COURSE ABOUT REIKI?\n· Perform Reiki on yourself\n· Perform Reiki on others\n· Principles of Reiki\n· History of Reiki and how Reiki can benefit people's lives\n· Using Reiki as a healing energy for your own benefit\n· conducting a Reiki treatment\n· distance attunement from a Reiki Master\n· ability to send Reiki to a distance\n· attune yourself with the Universal Life Force Energy\n· Reiki symbols to connect with your insightful self\n· Reiki Level 1\n· Reiki Level 2\n· Reiki Level 3\n· Learn about reiki 3 pillars\n· different methods for performing Reiki\n· How to perform Animal Reiki Session\n· Using Reiki Symbols\n· Send healings through distance to animals\n· Develop your skill to feel & send Reiki\n· Practice reiki every day to uncover the power of Reiki to help your animal’s companion\n· Use Reiki energy healing to help pets and animals\n· Understand Chakras, Aura & Meridians\n· Chakra Balancing Meditation\n· Obtain Reiki Level I, II and Reiki Master Status\n· Receive your Reiki Level I, II and Master distance attunements from a Reiki Master\n· Receive Reiki Master/Teacher Certification!\nREIKI LEVEL 1 is your first step along the reiki path. The Reiki attunement connects you to the source of healing energy which you can then start to channel. You can use this to help heal yourself and others around you. Your Chakras will be opened and you are connected to the Reiki Source. You will be able to channel Reiki through your hands to yourself or others. You will become gradually aware of what you need to do in regards to your healing. You may become more intuitive and psychic. This Reiki course is easy to follow covering Reiki Level I in shortest time possible with the absolute beginner in mind. The course covers all aspects of the Reiki Level 1\nREIKI LEVEL 2\nReiki Level II teaches you to perform distant or absentee Reiki. This means that you are able to send Reiki to yourself and others through space and time, anywhere, whenever you choose to.\nWith your First Degree Reiki class and attunement, you will learn self-healing hand positions, as well as hand placements for sharing Reiki with others. Once you have received the attunements you are a Reiki Practitioner. Whether you practice Reiki or not is your choice. Reiki will be with you for the rest of your life.\nReiki is one energy healing modality that can help you rebalance energies in the body, mind, and spirit. The energy, when received, works for the greatest and highest good of the recipient, which can be a person, place, object, animal, or situation. Reiki has its own essential intelligence and goes where it is needed to bring healing to the person, animal, place, object, or situation\nReiki II is the level where you are taught the first three symbols. With this comes the skill of being able to focus healing on mental and emotional problems, and distant healing those not physically present. Reiki II is the next exciting step in learning to use Reiki.

We all deserve to heard and understood.\nMaster the art of communicating with animals.\nAlthough the popularity to sentiently communicate with animals has appeared absent in recent decades, it is now revived and more important than ever.\nThousands are becoming more awakened to the intelligence of all species and desire a closer relationship with each other.\nThe advantages of being able to be sentient with animals are so great, that we need to dismiss the concept that we are superior at communicating, in any form.\nFirst and foremost, it's a great opportunity to learn about and bond with a different species; this has incredible implications for all people who love animals. That's fantastic.\nSince the beginning of life on earth, animals have been able to communicate with one another. Animals have relied on this innate ability to develop deep attachments with one another, and humans have done the same in our professional and personal interactions. You can reacquaint yourself with this innate talent.\nAnimals communicate with one another on a two-way street. In addition to honing your communication skills, you will expand your awareness via guided meditations and other practices that facilitate profound and meaningful connections with all sentient beings and with yourself.\nStarting from the very beginning, this course will teach you the fundamentals of natural animal communication, including the whys and hows.\nSo Who Can Take this Course?\nAnyone from complete novices with animal communication, to those with some experience in the field. all can benefit from this course.\nWhat is involved?\nThrough both theoretical and practical activities, you can learn and revisit the lectures and material and solidify your experience.\nYou will be introduced at the beginning, to building presence with animals in the first section. Thereafter, you'll move on to activities and theory, designed to hone your skills and understanding.\nLastly, you will apply all you have learned by engaging in authentic exercises involving animal communication.\nThe animals will communicate well, providing you learn the groundwork and explore the presence and theory.\n\n\nThis all-inclusive course will teach you:\n\n\nEngage in more of the organic means by which our forebears communicated with wildlife.\n\n\nExercises to heighten your awareness. Your familiarity with the spirituality and science of communicating with animals.\n\n\nPresentation of a masterclass\n\n\nDetailed procedures and guided exercises.\n\n\nCultivate your personal authority, purpose, and presence.\n\n\nComprehensive study of interspecies animal communication.\n\n\n\"This comprehensive course allows you to go at own pace, able to revisit sections and make notes. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring all the different aspects to the animal world, and our energy/heart connection, and examples. The foundation is set and now it is down to my discipline of putting it all into practice -having a routine is helpful. Thank you Helen for your care and efforts in creating this course.\" Charity R.\n\n\nI have crammed all the information you need to enhance your comprehension and innate talent of animal communication into hours of video content.\nFor a long time, I journeyed over the globe, trying to decipher the mysteries of nonverbal animal communication. I will guide you step-by-step. We will discuss the scientific evidence for animal consciousness and the more emotional experiences of animals' transition to the next dimension.\nI've poured a lot of time into gathering all the relevant information and distilling it into the most practical and useful format for online learning. You will enhance your skill and experience the same profound connection to the animal realm as my students have via their personal lessons and experiences.\nThe field of animal communication is unbelievably vast and complex. The following are some of the SCIENCE & PHILOSOPHY subjects covered in these lectures: if animals lie, how to deal with an animal's spirit going away, building trust, and distant or remote communication.\nAuthentic anecdotes and further meditations are part of the supplemental materials you'll receive to help you retain the information you've learned in this course. I've given you everything you need to rediscover your natural ability to communicate with animals through telepathy.\nI have my credentials from the IICT as a professional trainer and I'm a retired adult education specialist and Arthur Findlay Tutor and course organiser. Official external approval from the IICT has been obtained for this course.\nBecome an animal communicator today! Learn about the biggest conversation, happening right now!\nIS EVERYONE READY?",

      "description": "Soul Retrieval\nHow to do a Shamanic Journey to help your friends or clients\nStudents in my beginner course: “How to do a Shamanic Journey to find and bring back your Power Animal” asked me if I could teach them how to do a Shamanic Journey for friends and clients, and especially how to do a Soul Retrieval.\nSoul Retrieval, also called Soul Hunting, is a shamanic method to find and bring back parts of the soul that were lost.\nIn many cultures, worldwide, we find the belief that sickness and suffering happens because important fragments of our soul have gone missing. This is called “Soul Loss”. It is believed that a Soul Loss often happens because of a shock or trauma, which we experienced in the past, especially in childhood.\nThink about it like this: at the moment of a painful experience a part of yourself leaves your body. This is a survival mechanism of your soul. In this case it’s saying to itself: “This is too much, I don't want to experience this. I’m getting out of here now.” And this part of your soul, that is leaving the body during the trauma or shock, is not just leaving for a moment, it wants to hide, because it doesn't want to experience something like that again.\nSo if you, or your friends or clients suffer in some way, or feel that something is missing, or they don’t feel like themselves, then you might want to look for the missing pieces of the soul. Soul Retrieval has been practiced for thousands of years from Shamans around the world, yet for many people it is still not very well known. Let’s change this!\nMy name is Daniela, and I have learned shamanic methods back in 2001, when I lived in Germany. I had a wonderful teacher who taught me professional aura balancing, trance dance, shamanic journeying and soul retrieval.\nIn my beginner course you have learned how to visit the Middle World, Under World, and the Upper World. You have also learned how to find your Power Animal, to bring it back, which symbolically means bringing back your Personal Power. Now in this course you will learn how to do a Soul Retrieval.\nIt’s important that before you enroll in this course, you hopefully enrolled already in my beginner course “How to do a Shamanic Journey To Find And Bring Back Your Power Animal”, because you should already be familiar with journeying, and you need to have found your own Power Animal, before you do a journey for someone else.\nThe reason for this is because your Power Animal will normally go with you on your journey to guide you, regardless of whether you are doing a journey for yourself or for someone else.\nSo, are you ready to learn more about Shamanic Journeying? Do you want to help your friends and clients to bring healing to their souls?If you are ready for advanced journeying, then simply enroll in my advanced course: How to do a Shamanic Journey for your Friends and clients.\nSee you in the course.",

      "description": "Mercury Retrograde is a very special astrological factor in a number of ways. First of all, it is very simple and easy to observe: the dates of the periods of retrograde motion of Mercury can be listed for many years into the future, as well as into the past. Second, it is based on a specific, well known astronomical phenomenon, there is nothing nebulous or mystical about it.\nRetrograde motion of Venus and Mars happens less frequently but isn't less important to take into account — in fact, it is more important in the areas of life related to Mars and Venus.\nIn this course, I am going to share with you an original approach to understanding the retrograde motion of Mercury, Venus and Mars that was introduced by my teacher of astrology and further developed by myself. You will learn that the periods of retrograde Mercury, Venus and Mars can be very important and useful, they can bring you wonderful ideas and tremendous insights — but you need to know how to navigate these periods. Otherwise you might end up tired and frustrated, simply because you didn't know how to accept the gift the Universe tried to deliver to you.\nI will also tell you about the special talents of those who were born when Mercury, Venus and Mars were retrograde. Sometimes, people think that being born with a retrograde personal planet is like a curse but that is not true. Many of the world's geniuses were born with retrograde Mercury, Venus and Mars, and I will give you several examples. I will also explain the benefits of being born with retrograde Mercury, Venus and Mars.\nDid you know that over the years the status of your retrograde planet can change: if it was retrograde, it will become direct, and vice versa? I will explain this too, in detail and with examples.\nI hope you will find this course very useful and illuminating — see you inside!",

In addition, you'll learn about the planetary days, the higher level construct built from the hours, and the planetary years, a still higher level construct. They too can be meaningful in certain ways.\nThe important piece of knowledge that was mostly forgotten in the contemporary practices is that planetary hours can be more or less potent depending on the current condition of the ruling planet, and this course will restore the justice by thoroughly explaining what this means, and how to use this knowledge.\nFinally, you will learn about the significance of the planetary hour (and the planetary day), when a person was born, and how to use this knowledge both in healing and for better psychological understanding.\nWelcome to the course, I hope you will enjoy it and find it very useful!",

Animals have emotions just as humans do, and they are empathic enough to sense the emotions of others. Animal Reiki balances the energy patterns, calms the emotions and strengthens the animal's natural healing ability. Animal Reiki encourages the unity of mind, emotions, body and spirit. When we give Animal Reiki to an animal, we usually receive immediate validation and gratification, which helps our personal confidence to grow\nThe Animal Reiki Practitioner Course offers a transformative approach to healing and supporting animals through the gentle, powerful practice of energy work. Animal Reiki has its origins in the traditional Japanese Reiki healing system developed by Mikao Usui in the early 20th century, which was initially practiced with humans in mind. As Reiki spread globally and evolved, practitioners began to recognize its potential benefits for animals, adapting techniques to meet their unique needs. Animal Reiki has since become a popular holistic healing method for pets, farm animals, and even wildlife, grounded in the understanding that animals, like humans, have energetic centers—often likened to Chakras—that influence their health and emotions. Through the practice of Animal Reiki, we connect with these Chakras, addressing energetic imbalances that may be contributing to stress, anxiety, physical discomfort, or behavioral issues in animals.\nThe benefits of Animal Reiki are vast, not only for the animals themselves but also for their caretakers. By learning to work with an animal's Chakras, practitioners can help alleviate various issues that animals face, such as trauma, anxiety, and physical pain. Animal Reiki sessions often involve a calming, non-invasive approach, making it ideal for animals that are sensitive, stressed, or otherwise resistant to traditional handling. Through Animal Reiki, practitioners can focus on each animal’s Chakras to help restore balance, resulting in improved mood, increased relaxation, and even enhanced vitality. For example, working with the Heart Chakra may help an animal heal emotionally from past traumas, while balancing the Root Chakra can provide a sense of security and grounding for animals dealing with stress or fear. Animal Reiki also empowers caretakers to create deeper connections with their animal companions, offering a way to communicate love, trust, and support on an energetic level.\nIn modern times, Animal Reiki is increasingly integrated into various animal care settings, from veterinary offices and shelters to sanctuaries and even private homes. Many veterinarians, rescue organizations, and animal behaviorists recognize the potential of Animal Reiki to complement medical treatments, offering a supportive modality that does not interfere with conventional care. As people become more aware of the mental and emotional well-being of animals, Animal Reiki’s popularity continues to grow. This practice is valuable not only for household pets but also for animals experiencing high levels of stress or trauma, such as shelter animals or animals in rehabilitation. Animal Reiki practitioners use gentle hand placements or even distant Reiki methods to direct energy toward an animal’s Chakras without forcing interaction, allowing the animal to choose how much energy they wish to receive. This respect for the animal’s boundaries is a key aspect of Animal Reiki, aligning with the principle that animals, like humans, have a say in their healing journey. This Animal Reiki is for those who Are\nAnimal lovers who wish to know more about Animal Reiki\nThis course is for Reiki Students\nThis course is for people interested in Reiki healing for animals\nThis course is ideal for those who want to learn how to connect with energy healing for their pets and animals\nThis course is for people interested in Animal Reiki healing\nThis course is for all animal lovers who are seeking to connect deeper with their animal\nIf you love animals and want to learn a way to connect with them and help them to heal themselves\nAll those who volunteer in associations in defense of animals\nAnimal caregivers, such as shelter staff and rescuers, interested in using Reiki and Chakra healing to help animals cope with stress\nThis course provides students with a thorough foundation in Animal Reiki, helping them understand the nuances of working with animals’ Chakras to support a range of physical, emotional, and behavioral needs.

In today’s world, where animals are increasingly viewed as part of the family, Animal Reiki serves as a bridge to support their well-being in a natural, balanced way.

      "description": "Animal Reiki - Animal Reiki Certification Course!\nThis Animal Reiki Course is About Animal Reiki where you will learn to use the power of Reiki to heal yourself, others, your pets and animals around you. You will explore the deeper meaning of animal Reiki and begin helping your animal’s companion\nAnimals are good for our soul. They keep us physically active. They help us to relieve stress, sadness, put a smile on our face. They teach children and adults about love, compassion, responsibility, respect. Reiki is a wonderful way to give back to our animal friends. As with humans, Reiki supports the animal body’s natural ability to heal itself on the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual levels. Animals are very open and sensitive to the Reiki energy. They know exactly how much they need and where they need it.\nSo, if you want to support your Pets and Animals around you then this course is for you! Use Animal Reiki; a simple, non-invasive substitute therapy to support animals balance on their physical, mental and emotional state.\nMany people mistake Reiki as something you do. But Reiki isn’t something you do; it’s something you learn with the intent of helping others. It’s not a tool to fix problems and rid one from disease or physical pain. Reiki is aid through your own energy points to help heal animals and people alike. Along with the many benefits Reiki has on people, it also has the same benefits on animals.\nThe Difference Between Reiki and Animal Reiki The benefits of using Reiki Healing are not restricted to humans. The Reiki that is given to humans is precisely the same Reiki that is provided to creatures. The Universe has all types of animals that can go through from sickness, anxiety, and grief. While we decide to apply the energy given by the Universe, animals are not very fortuitous. Humans can support other humans with Reiki healing through sending levels of energy to another if they are willingly accepting. Their systems are constructed to obtain communications of the mind that deal with emotions and discomfort. Animals only experience that they hurt and that they are doomed to experience.\nAnimal Reiki Practitioner Code of Ethics\nGuiding Principles:\n• I believe the animals are equal partners in the healing process.\n• I honor the animals as being not only my clients, but also my teachers in the journey of healing.\n• I understand that all animals have physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects, to which Reiki can bring profound healing responses. •\nI believe that bringing Reiki to the human/animal relationship is transformational to the human view of the animal kingdom.\n• I dedicate myself to the virtues of humility, integrity, compassion and gratitude in my Reiki practice.\nAnimal Reiki The Animal Protection Reiki works to surround animals, pets, and endangered species of animals with protection. Your attunement to Animal Reiki connects you to universal energies of the Creative Source for healing and protection of animals.

Rooted in the Japanese healing tradition developed by Dr. Mikao Usui in the early 20th century, Reiki involves channeling universal life force energy to restore balance, reduce stress, and encourage healing. Animal Reiki takes this gentle approach further, adapting Reiki specifically for animals by considering their unique energy systems, instincts, and natural boundaries. Animals, much like humans, experience physical, emotional, and even spiritual challenges, and Animal Reiki offers a way to connect deeply with their energy to promote natural healing. This course explores how Animal Reiki can alleviate a range of issues animals might face, including anxiety, trauma, stress, and even physical discomfort, making it a valuable complement to traditional veterinary care. Animal Reiki is a compassionate, non-invasive practice that enables animals to receive healing energy in a way that is comfortable and beneficial to them, allowing them to release emotional or energetic blocks at their own pace.\nOne of the foundational principles of Animal Reiki is respect for the animal’s energy and autonomy. Unlike traditional human Reiki, where direct touch is often used, Animal Reiki frequently involves practicing from a distance or using hands-off techniques to honor the animal’s comfort levels and instincts. This course will teach students the importance of creating a safe, supportive space for animals during Reiki sessions, where they are free to interact with the energy on their own terms. The course covers different techniques that can be adapted based on the animal’s temperament, needs, and environment. For instance, Animal Reiki for a household pet may involve a close, calm presence, while working with rescue or shelter animals might require a gentler, hands-off approach. By focusing on the subtleties of animal behavior, students will learn how to \"hold space\" for animals, offering them healing energy without imposing any expectations, thereby fostering a sense of trust and allowing the animals to relax fully. This understanding of animal energy fields helps practitioners to respond more intuitively and compassionately to each animal’s unique personality and needs.\nIn modern animal care, Animal Reiki has gained recognition for its ability to support animals in a variety of challenging situations. Veterinary practices, rescue organizations, and even zoos have started to integrate Animal Reiki as a complementary therapy to enhance the well-being of animals in their care. Animal Reiki has proven effective for animals recovering from surgery, dealing with behavioral issues, or adjusting to new environments, such as rescues and shelters. Many professionals find that Animal Reiki helps animals release stored tension and fear, promoting relaxation and improving their ability to connect with people and their surroundings. In shelter settings, where animals may have a history of neglect or abuse, Animal Reiki offers a pathway for these animals to regain a sense of safety and self-assurance. By the end of this course, students will be equipped to work with animals in high-stress environments, providing calm and healing that can help animals become more receptive to human companionship and adoption.\nAnimal Reiki is also becoming a valuable practice for pet owners who want to offer a natural, holistic method of support for their beloved pets. This course teaches students to address a range of everyday concerns, from separation anxiety in dogs to stress-related behaviors in cats, using gentle Animal Reiki techniques. Many animals experience fear or unease due to sudden changes in their environment, new family members, or trips to the vet, and Animal Reiki can help ease these transitions, fostering a stronger, more harmonious relationship between the animal and its human family. By learning Animal Reiki, pet owners gain tools to help their pets feel safe, loved, and understood, improving their pets’ overall quality of life. Through the course, students will practice both remote and in-person Animal Reiki techniques, allowing them to offer healing whether they are physically present with the animal or working from a distance. This versatility is especially helpful for those looking to support animals in shelters, rescues, or even wildlife settings, where in-person access may not always be possible.\nAs part of this course, students will receive certification in Animal Reiki, empowering them to use these skills both personally and professionally. Students will leave the course with a well-rounded understanding of how Animal Reiki can benefit animals, how to adapt their techniques to different environments, and how to communicate energetically with animals to sense their needs. Animal Reiki also offers a profound way to connect with the animal kingdom on a spiritual level, recognizing and honoring animals as beings with their own energy, emotions, and wisdom. This course is not only about learning techniques but also about cultivating a compassionate and respectful mindset that celebrates the deep bond between humans and animals.\nAnimal Reiki is a transformative practice that helps animals feel seen, supported, and healed in ways that go beyond conventional approaches. By working with the subtle energy of animals, students learn to provide care that respects each animal's nature, temperament, and boundaries, creating a healing environment that benefits both the animal and the practitioner. In an age where holistic practices are increasingly valued, Animal Reiki offers a meaningful, impactful way to make a difference in the lives of animals everywhere. This course empowers students to become compassionate healers, bringing comfort, peace, and balance to animals in need and fostering a sense of interconnection with the animal world that is both grounding and enlightening. Through this journey in Animal Reiki, students will acquire skills that allow them to contribute positively to animal welfare, making a lasting impact on the animals they care for and the communities they serve.\nGet enrolled now in this awesome course and have self-reliance of performing Reiki on yourself, others and the animals around you. I am teaching Reiki for many years now. All of them are satisfied and are using reiki energy to heal themselves and their animal companion. So now let’s get started with the course.\nSee you in the course Lectures\nGood luck!\nNOTE:\nAfter completing this course, you will receive an Animal Reiki Practitioner Certification! from my side, which you can share with your family, friends, relatives, co-workers.

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED\nAbout the Spiritual Advisor Certification Course\nMy journey in healing and spirituality started over 21 years ago. It's been a very long journey of learning, growing and exploring. In this course you will benefit from a long pilgrimage to understand life, spirituality, God and wisdom, crossing into many modalities, tools and spirit knowledge. This course was designed for those seeking truth, meaning, understanding of their abilities as a medium, clairvoyant, psychic or empath, about the other-side, ghosts, spirit guides and demons, how to develop certain abilities that already reside within, or have revealed themselves, and understand certain complicated teachings from my perspective, to then help others on their journey. In this course I share many tools of the trade in spirituality and development to help you acquire what you need to read the symbols you receive, I give references to use and how to use them in practice, discuss how to choose reference guides and tools, and act as a mentor to teach you what I know, as a teacher for you on your spiritual journey. This is in no way exhaustive, and I say this because spiritual growth never ends, and there are practices out there I am sure I have never heard of. But certainly, what you learn in this course, can be applied to all things that cross your path.\nThis course is very story oriented, conversational and intimate,  talking to you and sharing my experiences with real life clients, house clearings, seeing ghosts and talking with spirit guides, while educating you through stories and real life situations.  What this course is not is a course teaching you how to read the future, be a psychic, read tarot cards or certification in a specific modality. This course is not a chart/graph course loaded with PDFs, although there are some, as well as practice videos and a telepathic game guide. This is a certification in development of your specific gifts, in spiritual development, and you interpret how to translate them into your life and needs. From there you will feel confident in advising others on their own spiritual journey. See the course curriculum for specific teachings.\nAbout Me\nI come from a family of healers, with those who see & hear spirits, commune with nature and animals, do card readings, astral travel, talk with dead loved ones, channel beings, trance write,  talk with the dead for others, and translate numerology. Talking about these things is as natural to me as talking about the weather. When I told my sister the course curriculum she said, \"How cool to have it all in one place.\" That was my sentiment exactly in making as much knowledge as I can available to answer questions, expose you to things you may not know, clear up confusing teachings and simply give you things to think about and help you in your personal development as a medium, clairvoyant or psychic (sorry if I left out a title).\nKeep in mind that I implore everyone to be open to taking in the information, but in the end, encourage you to do what feels natural for yourself. With this course you are given my personal email and I will remain a spiritual mentor to you for life if you wish.\nAll Courses Are Accredited Through International Association of Therapists (IAOTH)\nSee you in class!\nSufani\nInstructor\n#Healingandwellness #healthandhealing #spiritualhealing",

You are more than a physical body as you have an energy body as well and this energy body determines how you feel, how people respond to you. The chakras are seven bodily energy centers which move from the base of the spine to the top of the head.\nA chakra is a spinning vortex of life force energy within the subtle body. This is a hidden field of life force energy, emotions, beliefs, and imprints that make your specific life force energy. Your chakras are positioned in the spine and open and close much like a flower. There are seven main chakras in the system and each chakra is connected to seven nerve ganglia branching out from the spinal column. The word chakra means wheel or disk in Sanskrit. Chakras are spinning wheels of life force energy when they are functioning correctly in the body. This energy has also been referred to as chi, prana, or life force energy. We can think of the chakra wheel as the drive inside of the computer or as part of the software that helps your body maintain your health. Since everyone is different, each person has different needs and health care problems. The same is true when it comes to the chakra system and determining which chakra needs to be balanced. If you can open your chakras and determine which ones need to be unblocked, then you are able to manifest and align your soul’s imprint with your life purpose. You will find different questions to help you determine your strengths and weaknesses in your chakra system.\nThere are seven main chakras, from top to bottom. All seven chakras affect each other and are interactive; much like any high quality, fine-tuned instrument, so it is important that proper balance be maintained. I will discuss them in detail one by one.\n1. Root chakra\n2. Sacral chakra\n3. Solar plexus chakra\n4. Heart chakra\n5. Throat chakra\n6. Third eye chakra\n7. Crown chakra\nThese seven primary chakras include:\n· Muladhara (root chakra): This chakra is at the bottom of the spine, between the anus and genitals. It purportedly influences the basic urges of sex, food, sleep, and self-preservation.\n· Svadhisthana (sacral chakra): Located at the pelvis, this chakra influences the regulation of emotions and desires.\n· Manipura (Solar plexus chakra): This chakra is just below the navel. Strength in this chakra aids digestion and the ability to process life’s experiences.\n· Anahata (heart chakra): This chakra is located at the heart, and its purpose is to help a person connect with unconditional love.\n· Vishuddha (throat chakra): Positioned at the pit of the throat, this chakra’s function is authenticity and personal expression.\n· Ajna (third eye chakra): Located between the eyebrows, this chakra is a seat of inner knowledge and consciousness.\n· Sahasrara (crown chakra): Located just above the top of the head, this chakra’s role is to promote a more enlightened approach to the world.\nThis course is an in-depth dive into one of the most practical systems of spirituality, and will explain how the health of your energy body affects every part of your life. This chakra course will empower you to heal blockages in your energy body, regain your balance in areas of your life that need attention, and gain a deeper appreciation for yourself and others around you.\nThe chakras are seven bodily energy centers which move from the base of the spine to the top of the head. The word “chakra” is derived from the Sanskrit word for “wheel”, The spinning wheel concept specifies that they are moving, active, vibrating energy points found in living Beings!\nThis is for everyone who are enthusiastic about developing self-mastery and inner healing abilities. You’ll learn about each chakra’s individual characteristics and the possible causes for energy blocks, as well as what happens to your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health when your chakras are in or out of harmony.\nChakras store the energy of thoughts, feelings, memories, experiences, and actions. They influence and direct our present and future mindset, behavior, emotional health, and actions. The life force in each chakra can be processed, transmuted and released so that we consciously manifest what we want to call in, rather than experience more of the same. Chakra healing is the intentional practice of connecting with our stored energy, so we may understand how our past is influencing the present and the future. Prana informs us, and influences our actions and behaviors, determining our health, career opportunities, relationships, and more. The subtle body depicts how our inner reality creates our outer reality.\nThe Chakras of Matter\nEach chakra holds the beliefs, emotions, and memories related to specific areas of our life. The lower chakras are related to Earthly matters such as survival, sex, and power. The top three chakras are related to higher consciousness, truth, intuition, and purpose. In the middle, the heart chakra bridges the two worlds with empathy, love, and compassion.\nThis course is an in-depth dive into one of the most practical systems of spirituality, and will explain how the health of your energy body affects every part of your life. This chakra course will empower you to heal blockages in your energy body, regain your balance in areas of your life that need attention, and gain a deeper appreciation for yourself and others around you.\nThis is for everyone who is enthusiastic about developing self-mastery and inner healing abilities.

The connection between glands and chakras represents a link between the energy points in your body to the physiological and physical functions. Another useful entry point for chakra healing is the nervous system which is connected to glands and organs in multiple ways and at multiple points. A chakra healing session is ideally begun by calming the nerves and then targeting a particular gland and/or chakra. By understanding the connection between chakras and the glands, you can use healing in different ways that will help you overcome physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual issues in your body and mind. Connecting the chakras and the glands will help in your overall well-being.\nThis course delves deeply into the ancient and transformative practices of Reiki Energy and Chakra healing, providing students with an immersive journey into the art, history, and benefits of these healing modalities, and empowering them to harness this energy for personal and professional use. Reiki Energy, a powerful Japanese healing method originating from Dr. Mikao Usui in the early 1920s, is grounded in the concept that a universal life force, also known as \"ki,\" flows through all living beings. This life force is not only essential to our existence but also can be harnessed to promote deep healing and balance. By channeling Reiki Energy, practitioners learn to become conduits for this life force, directing it to areas of physical, emotional, and spiritual need. This course will teach students to tune into and effectively channel Reiki Energy, allowing them to strengthen their ability to heal and harmonize both themselves and others.\nAlongside Reiki Energy, the Chakra system is fundamental to understanding how our energy flows within the body. Rooted in ancient Hindu and Buddhist traditions, the Chakra system is composed of seven main energy centers, each located along the spine and associated with specific aspects of our being, from our basic sense of security at the Root Chakra to our sense of connection to the universe at the Crown Chakra. When our Chakras are in alignment, energy flows freely, creating balance across all dimensions of our lives. However, when a Chakra becomes blocked, it can lead to emotional stress, mental fog, and even physical ailments. This course will provide an in-depth exploration of each Chakra, examining its location, color, characteristics, and corresponding physical and emotional functions. By combining Reiki Energy with knowledge of the Chakra system, students will learn how to clear blocks, restore alignment, and promote healing on a deep level.\nIn the context of today’s fast-paced, stress-laden world, Reiki Energy and Chakra healing offer a gentle yet highly effective approach to achieving holistic well-being. Through this course, students will not only learn to perform Reiki treatments on themselves and others but also understand how to work with the Chakra system to target specific areas in need of healing. For instance, Reiki Energy can help open the Heart Chakra to foster self-love and compassion, while the Root Chakra can be grounded to create a sense of security and stability in life. With an emphasis on hands-on practice, students will learn to sense energy shifts, feel for blockages in the Chakras, and apply Reiki techniques to bring each Chakra back into alignment. Reiki Energy flows are intuitively guided, and students will be trained in how to recognize and respond to the subtle cues that indicate whether a Chakra is open, balanced, or in need of attention.\nModern applications of Reiki Energy and Chakra healing have expanded to include use in hospitals, mental health settings, and wellness centers worldwide. Practitioners are finding that integrating Reiki with Chakra knowledge is especially beneficial for managing stress, anxiety, and even chronic pain. Reiki Energy has been recognized for its ability to reduce stress and promote relaxation, while Chakra balancing supports emotional healing and spiritual growth. This course will explore how Reiki Energy and Chakra work can complement traditional therapies, allowing students to bring holistic benefits to clients, patients, or loved ones. By gaining certification in Reiki and Chakra healing, students not only acquire practical skills but also open doors to professional opportunities as wellness practitioners, adding a deeply rewarding skill set to their careers.\nThrough this course, students will develop a profound understanding of Reiki Energy and the Chakra system, enriching their lives and opening pathways to help others in a meaningful, impactful way. Reiki Energy and Chakra healing are not simply techniques but are lifelong practices for growth, healing, and transformation. As students progress, they will build a toolkit of Reiki Energy practices to apply whenever and wherever needed. This journey into Reiki and Chakra healing is a powerful step toward holistic wellness that can enhance physical health, emotional resilience, and spiritual connection for a lifetime.\nThe Chakra system is a holistic entity that suggests that when the one chakra is interrupted, the energy circulation of the whole system is affected. An unbalanced Chakra system causes an unbalanced life; it causes poor physical, psychological, psychological, and spiritual wellness.\nNOTE:\nAfter completing this course, you will receive 2 Certificates! I-e A Reiki Practitioner certificate & Chakra Healing Certificate, which you can share with your family, friends, relatives, co-workers. Certificates of completion help demonstrate your accomplishments. Plus you will also receive another certificate from Udemy\nLove & Peace . Good Luck!",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\n\n\nAbsolutely amazing! I use some of the mudras with my Tutor Group in school. They are fascinated and love trying the different hand positions with me as I practice. This course has taken my meditation journey to the next level. I knew many mudras before but this course has helped to connect the dots. -- Rachel\nAs always, Melissa delivers excellence! I am feeling so much more prepared for this new energy healing venture I am on to heal others. I wish I could give her 100 stars for all of her courses! -- Vennita\nI really enjoyed this course. Melissa’s delivery of the course was fantastic. Her personality truly shines. Thank you.\" --  Kimberly\nThis was a well made/produced course. Mellissa has wonderful energy and presence. Audio and video quality are fantastic! I have already used this knowledge in a meditation/yoga class I taught. People have really responded well to the mudras and can feel them activate! Great class for any instructor, healer, or practitioner in wholistic wellness field! I cant wait to take her other courses. --  Chelsea\nThanks for another great course, Melissa! I have always been fascinated by the mudras and the amazing wisdom of the Indian yogis. This course was fun and very interesting, with great explanations about the chakras as well. I have been using the energy charging chakra daily and it works splendidly. --  Nella\nShe is a gifted instructor in this respect (i.e., facilitator of learning) as well as in the clear passion and energy she has within herself for this subject. This has been a useful, beautiful and horizon-broadening course. Thank you so much!  – Cynthia\nI hadn't heard or seen much of this healing technique before finding Melissa on Udemy, but from using the mudra's personally while going through the course I have found them to be extremely effective. I highly recommend this course! -  Alexandra\nA 10-star course - Manoliu\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nThe word Mudra is Sanskrit for \"gesture\", and in this course I specifically focus on Hand Mudras (so, \"hand gestures\"). Hand Mudras are a way of enhancing our energetic power within ourselves to help heal a specific area of concern. What's more, they're very easy to do and anybody can do them!  This course is designed to introduce newcomers to the world of Hand Mudras, as well as be a great additional learning resource for those who practice energy healing, meditation, and yoga.\nKeep in mind that no experience is required to take this course because I created it in a way so anybody can learn and benefit from Hand Mudras! However, it's a brilliant further learning course for other loving healers, or as complement to my Reiki Master Certification course!\n\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nOnce enrolled, you'll need to download the course book, written by Melissa: Energy Healing Hand Positions - A Short Course in Mudras (PDF). The book covers all that you need to know to get started with Hand Mudras - be it for yourself only, or if you're learning in order to help others!\nAs you progress through this course, you'll learn what got me so interested in Hand Mudras, as well as the basics of energy healing and Chakras, and then a bit about why Hand Mudras actually work from a more scientific standpoint. I'll then teach you what I consider the 7 Main Chakra Hand Mudras are, as well as a further 7 Additional Hand Mudras that I personally use on a regular basis.\nOnce you've completed the entire course, you'll have all that you need to start using Hand Mudras - and to even help others learn to do it!\nFor existing healers, you'll be able to quickly apply and use these techniques with your current skills!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Energy Healing Hand Mudras Final Exam.  Upon successful completion, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and a Digital Seal of Completion (JPG)!\nSome of the additional benefits of this course include fast headache relief and stress relief - as well as help raise your self awareness and intuition! As Hand Mudras become more and more part of your everyday life, you'll wonder why we aren't taught these in school!\nEnjoy your journey sweet friend #biglove",

It requires an openness, but it is in no way mysterious as it once was, now that we have scientific data as to why it works. In this course, level 2, I will get deeper into how to send distance healing, talk more about the symbols and why the symbols are used, we will talk about the psychic arts, the spirit realm, intuitiveness and development of skill and so much more.\nI share with you my experiences and there is a 30-page workbook in the resources for you to follow along, although, I go off script (because that is how I teach-through stories and sharing real life experience). My intention for my students is to give you a head start in understanding and making connections that usually would take decades if you had not had a mentor to share the real-life stories with you of how it really is in the field.\n\n\nI have been practicing Reiki for over 20 years and its practices have healed my own migraine issues and provided me with an understanding of my own energy and a way to regulate the state of my own body and healing needs and an understanding of when I have reached my stress limits. The body communicates with us, and Reiki has helped me tap into the inner hearing and understanding. Once I learned this for myself, I could not keep it to myself.\n\n\nMy parents and sisters are Reiki Masters brought in through my lineage and we live the Reiki principles of healing and love. I also performed Reiki in hospitals with patients and helped one I am most humbled by, as one of her many alternative healing therapists, come home from a semi coma. I hope you enjoy every level.

Whether you're persuading your buddies to see an action movie instead of a SciFi flick or selling a million dollar product to a fortune 500 executive, being able to easily and effortlessly persuade others to accept your ideas is essential.\nIn this guide, you'll learn the basic concepts and language patterns of conversational hypnosis, which will allow you to conversationally and secretly slip your ideas into their mind.\nThey will not only accept and agree with your ideas, but they'll do so for their own reasons, meaning you'll face very little resistance. You can use these powerful patterns in all settings. Social, sales, romance, anywhere!\nThis course includes some grammar terminology, but it will all be explained as we go along. You'll learn the basic structures of human communication, what vague language is, and how to use it more effectively get your ideas across.\nThis course is perfect for anybody who needs to communicate with others and get theirs ideas accepted without resistance. Perfect for salespeople, parents, couples, anybody that uses language and needs to convince others of anything.\nThis course also includes a worksheet that will let you practice the individual patterns to gain proficiency.\nThis course will take about an hour total to go through, however, the more you practice these patterns on your own, the more skilled you'll become at the art and science of covert hypnosis and persuasion.\nEven if you never intend on selling anything to anybody, the language patterns you'll learn in this course will help you to more easily get your ideas across to others in way that they'll get accepted.\nThis course is ideal for salespeople, and anybody interested in increasing their social confidence and charisma.",

      "description": "Transformative Healing & Spiritual Awakening\nHoly Fire® III Reiki is a powerful and evolutionary form of Reiki energy, known for its ability to provide deep, transformative healing on all levels—physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Unlike traditional Reiki, Holy Fire® III Reiki is guided by a higher level of consciousness, offering profound experiences that lead to inner peace, personal growth, and spiritual enlightenment.\n\n\n*** *This Course does NOT provide an ICRT Certification or Membership\nAffordable Holy Fire® III Reiki Courses for Global Accessibility\nAt Deeply Rooted Journey Spiritual Academy™, I believe that everyone deserves access to high-quality spiritual education, regardless of their financial situation. Guided by my spiritual team, I offer Holy Fire® III Reiki courses at significantly lower prices than many other institutions. This is to ensure that students worldwide can experience the transformative power of Holy Fire® Reiki, even if they may not have the financial means to take this training elsewhere.\n\n\nWhat Sets Holy Fire® III Reiki Apart?\nHoly Fire® III Reiki differs from other forms of Reiki in several key ways:\nDirect Connection to Divine Energy: Holy Fire III connects you directly to the Source of Healing Energy, including the Christ Consciousness Energy, empowering you with a higher vibration of healing.\nPlacements, Ignitions, and Healing Experiences: Instead of traditional attunements, Holy Fire® III uses Placements and Ignitions to instill the Reiki energy. This process is more refined and works at a deeper level, offering powerful healing and a direct connection to the Holy Fire flame.\nPurification and Transformation: Holy Fire® III has the ability to purify deeply held emotional and mental blocks, transform unhealed wounds into wisdom, and bring about a state of inner wholeness.\nGentle Yet Powerful Energy: The energy of Holy Fire® III is both gentle and nurturing, yet incredibly powerful, guiding you toward inner peace and spiritual empowerment.\n\n\nHow Holy Fire III Reiki Benefits You\nWhether you choose to become a practitioner, a master teacher, or simply want to incorporate Holy Fire® III Reiki into your personal life, its benefits are profound and far-reaching:\nFor Practitioners: Holy Fire® III Reiki enables you to provide deep healing experiences for your clients, helping them release past trauma, emotional wounds, and physical pain. The direct connection to Holy Fire® energy elevates your practice, allowing you to work at a higher vibrational level.\nFor Master Teachers: As a master teacher, you will have the ability to pass on the Holy Fire® III energy to your students, empowering them to become healers and spiritual guides. You’ll lead Placements, Ignitions, and create life-changing experiences for those you teach.\nFor Personal Transformation: If you’re seeking to use Holy Fire® III Reiki for personal growth, it offers a profound path of healing, helping you to release limiting beliefs, fears, and past hurts. This energy supports you in elevating your daily spiritual practice, enhancing your connection to the Divine, and creating a life filled with peace, love, and clarity.\n\n\nUnlock the Power of Holy Fire III Reiki\nBy integrating Holy Fire® III Reiki into your healing journey or spiritual practice, you will unlock your potential to live a life of deep fulfillment and spiritual alignment. Whether you’re drawn to this energy for healing others or transforming your own life, Holy Fire® III Reiki is a profound tool for awakening your true self and stepping into your power as a healer, teacher, and spiritual being.\n\n\nSTUDENT TESTIMONIALS\n\n\nRainy\nJenn stands out as an exceptional Reiki instructor, and her expertise in the realm of Holy Fire Reiki is unparalleled. Under her guidance, I've transformed into a master practitioner, a testament to her comprehensive teaching approach. My journey with Jenn was a stark contrast to my previous experience with my first instructor where even the foundational principles were overlooked. What sets Jenn apart are her meticulously designed courses that prioritize both education and attention to detail. Every session with her was a deep dive into all the nuances of a Holy Fire Reiki practice, while ensuring a holistic understanding as well. I wholeheartedly endorse Jenn's courses and am grateful for the profound impact she's had on my Reiki journey.\n\n\nSharon S.\nI've been practicing Reiki since 2012 and became a Usui Reiki Master in 2016. I completed all Jennifer's three Holy Fire III courses, as I've been interested to receive the Holy Fire Reiki ignitions and to learn more about this upgrade to Reiki. Jennifer's course was thorough and an excellent experience.\n\n\nAmanda C.\nI don’t write reviews, but Jen is such a beautiful conduit for this work. I was semi-skeptical about doing this online. I had no reason to doubt—this is a sacred and beautiful work, and it’s added more to my life that I can express in a review. So much love and so many blessings to you, Jen. Thank you so much.\n\n\nUpgrading to Holy Fire III Reiki for Existing Master Teachers\nFor those who are already Reiki Master Teachers in other styles, upgrading to Holy Fire® III Reiki requires completing both Level 2 and Level 3 courses. While Level 1 is not mandatory at Deeply Rooted Journey Spiritual Academy™, many seasoned Reiki Masters have found it to be immensely valuable, offering rich insights into Reiki’s history and spiritual foundations that may not have been included in their prior training. These Master Teachers often express that the additional knowledge has deepened their understanding of Reiki and enhanced their personal and professional practices.\nThe Importance of Upgrading to Holy Fire Energy\nIn Holy Fire® III Reiki, several traditional symbols used in other Reiki styles are replaced by the Holy Flame Master symbol. This energy is of a higher vibration and allows you to work with pure, refined healing energy, offering a deeper level of spiritual healing for both yourself and your clients. By upgrading to Holy Fire® III, you will align your practice with the evolved energy of Holy Fire, giving you access to a higher frequency of healing power.\nWhich Symbols Are Replaced?\nIn Holy Fire® III Reiki, the following traditional Reiki symbols are replaced by the Holy Flame Master symbol:\nDai Ko Myo (Usui Master symbol)\nTibetan Dai Ko Myo\nFire Serpent\nRaku\nThese symbols, which are traditionally used in various forms of Reiki, are replaced by the Holy Flame Master symbol in Holy Fire® III Reiki. This upgrade allows practitioners to work with the refined Holy Fire energy, ensuring their practice is aligned with a higher vibrational frequency for more profound healing and spiritual transformation.\nHoly Fire III Reiki Has No Lineage\nUnlike other forms of Reiki that trace their lineage back through teachers and practitioners, Holy Fire® III Reiki does not follow a traditional lineage. Instead, the energy is directly received from the Source, bypassing any earthly lineage. This ensures that the energy remains pure, untainted, and always connected to the highest levels of consciousness, allowing you to work directly with Divine Healing Energy without any intermediary.\nBy upgrading your Reiki practice to Holy Fire III, you are stepping into a new realm of healing and spiritual development. This energy will support your teaching practice, as well as your own spiritual transformation, helping you to offer unparalleled healing experiences to your clients and students alike.\nFlexible and Accessible Learning with Our Courses\nAt Deeply Rooted Journey Spiritual Academy™, I prioritize providing an exceptional and flexible learning experience for my students and why I chose to partner with Udemy. My courses come with a range of features designed to support your educational journey:\nPrivate Student Dashboard: Each student receives access to a private student dashboard, which can be accessed anytime, from anywhere, on any device.

This course is the most comprehensive course on Reiki that you could find anywhere. With its carefully prepared lessons and handouts as well as a 387 page manual, you will have the tools you need to start using Reiki on yourself and on others in professional level.\n\n\nIn this course, while you can take the time you need to work through the material on your own pace, you will have lifetime access to course materials and any updates that are made. Having the opportunity to go with your own pace, means you can take your time to thoroughly study and practice the material and techniques until you feel yourself competent. Also, you can always ask questions to your master/teacher during and after the course.\n\n\n'Weekly Distant Empowerments' that this course offers is a unique and priceless opportunity. In Original Reiki, empowerments are given on a continuous and regular basis, over and over for decades. Since after each empowerment, the people's energy taking capacity increases, in next empowerment they are able to take much more energy than before. Therefore, regular and continuous empowerments is a must, in order to create really competent Reiki healers. A single or a couple of empowerments during the short span of the time of a course is far from being enough. This course simulates the original way of giving regular Reiki empowerments with Weekly Distant Empowerment Broadcast by your master/teacher, Mehmet 'Tenzin' Cesmeci, Ph.D. In this course you will have the opportunity of receiving regular empowerments during and after the course without a time limit.\n\n\nOne of the most important advantages of taking this course is that this course has an exceptionally outstanding energy lineage (the most important factor in Reiki practice). The lineage is the most important factor that must be taken into consideration in selecting a Reiki course or a Reiki Master.",

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED\nD.R.P. Therapy & Soul Retrieval, is a combination of many therapies and healing techniques included into one inspirational way to heal the body and soul.\nDRP was influenced and adapted in inspiration of healing methods of Incan Indians, African shaman healing techniques, incorporating aura dusting, nature’s healing crystals, shaman extraction techniques dealing with the luminous energy field, out of the box Western Medicine thinking, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chakras, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Spiritual Counseling and Science. This modality can be used to release stored negative emotions and thought patterns manifesting illness and disease in life, that are blocking spiritual evolution.\nCounselors, Therapists and Ministers may find this a unique way to arrive at the roots of where things went wrong and assist their clients and patients to make change to get better beyond just feeling better temporarily. Bodyworkers will have a new set of Q&A and techniques to add to their healing sessions.\nBecause stress, negativity and emotional thought patterns are linked with physical manifestations of illness and disease, this modality and way of life focuses on removing the negativity and blocks of an old story, in order to move on with life. The intention of this training is to help others really live, see themselves by taking the shaman journey of Rivers and Questions, understanding the luminous energy field and how to heal their energy and bodies strategically and wholly on an ongoing basis.\nThis course assumes you have some knowledge already of energy work and the energy body; however, you may begin here and move on to get that training afterwards to deepen your understanding.\nIf you are new to POBA, welcome to class! If you are a returning student, you know how much I love you! :) Sufi",

      "description": "Numerology is a study of numeric patterns surrounding people in their lives and of the traditional keys helping to understand those patterns.\nContrary to some other definitions, numerology isn't belief-based. Most people come to it as a result of their practical experience. They feel that this world isn't as chaotic and senseless as materialistic science tells us, that there is some order and purpose to it, and numerology confirms their feeling and gives them the tools helping to make sense of their lives.\nNumerology can be very simple, and this course will give you all the necessary information to start using it for yourself, for your friends and relatives. We are going to learn:\n* The symbolism of numbers, including special cases, such as Master Numbers and Karmic Numbers.\n* The rules for numerological calculations.\n* The five main numerological parameters, and how to make sense of them taken together.\nThis course is based on my decades of experience with numerology, and in some respect it will differ substantially from what you'll find in other courses and books on numerology. The main approach is Pythagorean, but I was influenced to some degree by Eastern schools of numerology, and so incorporated into my system some of those schools' ideas.\nI've developed a special software that implements all the concepts taught in this course, and it is freely available on the web.",

(although I would suggest for enrolling this course to get the most out of it, to have some previous experience in doing hypnosis sessions.) Great course!\nKlara Koren Palata.\n\n\nIf you have ever wondered how stage hypnotist and street hypnosis rapid or Instant Hypnosis Inductions work, in this Hypnosis Course you will learn a step by step approach for success using a rapid hypnosis induction.\nRapid hypnosis inductions are not used by most hypnotists because of fear of failure they mostly use progressive relaxation techniques or indirect Ericksonian Hypnosis Inductions and even though hypnotist have great success using these types of inductions most would like to be able to do rapid hypnosis or handshake inductions made popular by Richard Bandler.\nBut it is the fear of failure that holds them back, however they would not need to have this fear once they understand all the steps that must be in place for success every time.\nSome may say that is a big claim to say to have success every time you do a rapid hypnosis induction but just like any good recipe for bread once all the ingredients are added  you get fresh bread every time.\nThe demonstration video for this course breaks down every tiny step needed for you to have success Hypnotizing people.\nI have also added other rapid hypnosis induction videos with complete transcripts that you can download so that you can study what I am doing from what you will learn from the demonstration video.\nIt is also very important to have a positive intention or outcome for doing rapid hypnosis inductions as you will be subconsciously subcomunicating your intentions and your confidence level to the person and this may have a impact on whether you are successful or not.\nIf the person you are hypnotizing is happy and feels safe being hypnotized by you you will easily hypnotize them with a rapid hypnosis induction once you follow all the steps I am going to teach you in this easy to follow course.\nWhat you will learn\nAll the steps required for a successful rapid hypnosis Induction\nAll the steps required to use the Zonk hypnosis Induction\nHow to perform the Zonk Rapid hypnosis Induction with full PDF transcript\nHow to Perform the magic point Rapid hypnosis Induction with full PDF transcript\nHow to perform the hand drop Rapid hypnosis Induction with full PDF transcript\nHow to perform the Elman Hypnosis Induction with full PDF transcript\nHow to Perform the short Elman Hypnosis Induction with full PDF transcript",

Thanks Arnov!\" - Todd\n-----------\nLucid Dreaming: The Art of Becoming Aware That You're Dreaming.\n\nSimply put, lucid dreaming is the art of developing awareness in your dream.  When you realize you’re dreaming, your dream reality becomes much clearer. Colors come to life. It’s like you switch from 360px video quality to 2048px HD video quality.\n\nThe term “lucid” in itself, means clarity. With greater clarity, and the awareness of the fact that you’re dreaming, you realize that this is YOUR platform for creation.\nThere are no rules here. You make the rules. Anything is possible. And naturally, like a child that steps into his or her favorite playground, you’re ecstatic!

I went on to have my best career season, which culminated with a more than  20-0 record before the national championships…I’ve since used lucid dreaming to accelerate skill acquisition, reactivate forgotten languages in less time, cultivate zen-like present state awareness and decrease needless stress.”\n\nTim Ferriss\n#1 NYT Bestseller of The 4-Hour Workweek, The 4-Hour Body, and The 4-Hour Chef\n\n----------\nLucid Dreaming: Scientifically Proven In 1975\n\n\nSince Dr. Keith Hearne proved that lucid dreaming was a real phenomena in 1975, there have been numerous studies that have used EEG and fMRI data to confirm lucid dreaming to be a verifiable state of human consciousness.\nIn the Introduction video of this course, you will learn about an interesting experiment that demonstrates how lucid dreaming is 100% real and proven in the laboratory.\n----------\n\nThe Benefits & Uses Of Lucid Dreaming\nSo imagine this – you're in a world where everything feels just as “real\" as you know it to be now, and you're in complete control.\nYou're not limited by any natural rules or scientific laws like gravity.\nWhat would you do?\nBy discovering the art of lucid dreaming through the Dream Hacking step-by-step system in this course, you will be able to go to sleep every night with the ability to:\nFeel the exhilarating thrill and freedom of flying\nSummon dream characters for sexual journeys\nHave conversations with celebrities, personal role models, and personal heroes\nTravel to exotic locations\nDiscover your true purpose in life\nOvercome obstacles, fears, and phobias\nEliminate negative habits to lose weight, decrease stress, quit smoking, etc.\nPractice and improve your real life skills\nGive rise to your buried creative potential\nLive out your future visions, goals, and dreams\nEliminate recurring nightmares\nAnd much, much more…\n----------\n\"This course is an overall great lucid dreaming resource. Every piece of content has meaning and is applicable to lucid dreaming. The instructor is clearly experienced and knows what he’s taking about. I really liked how everything is reviewed at the end and the instructor provides his intentions and goals behind the course. This inspires students to go out and actually apply what hey have learned not only to help them lucid dream, but to make lucid dreaming more relevant to the waking world. At the end of the day, this is a fantastic course for anyone interested in lucid dreaming. Wether you’re a beginner or a seasoned dreamer that needs a refresh, this course is well worth the value.

I'd say that this course is very valuable to anyone interested in learning about lucid dreaming, but wants a practical approach to achieving results in a relatively short period of time. I'm appreciative of the hard work you've put into designing the course, and especially grateful that it has virtually NO fluff because in my opinion there are too many bogus courses out there which only waste your time and tell you things you likely already know or could have learned by reading a short article.

Once you know how to do it, you will be able to lucid dream for the rest of your life.\nThe hard part is getting over the psychological barrier to attempt it in the first place.\nWhen you were first learning how to ride a bike, training wheels helped make it easier to learn.\nThis Dream Hacking course will give you your lucid-dreaming training-wheels.\n----------\n“I have been obsessed with lucid dreaming for the past year now and I have bought almost every course and book that I could find...This dream hacking course is by far the most detailed and in-depth resource that I have found.

The material is well presented with high-quality, aesthetically pleasing images, slides, and background music that fit the subject matter. The instructor's extensive experience with lucid dreaming, the breadth of his study of the literature on the topic, and his enthusiasm for the subject matter are obvious, and the course is very thorough. In addition to the lectures, the instructor provides detailed PDF notes on each section that are very useful for quickly reviewing the subject matter. He also provides quick and very thoughtful answers to students' questions. In addition, this course includes three binaural-beat audio recordings to enhance lucid dreaming, sleep, and meditation, respectively, as well as a list of the books the instructor has found most useful on lucid dreaming. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in lucid dreaming, as well as those interested in experiencing an example of a thorough, well-done course.

      "description": "REIKI: Reiki Level I, II & Master Course\nThis course includes all three levels of Reiki that is Reiki Level 1, Reiki Level 2, and Master Level.\nUSUI REIKI IS A SIMPLE and natural system of touch healing that originated in Japan through the discovery of a Zen Buddhist named Mikao Usui. The history and healing techniques used in Reiki are continuously passed down from teacher to student through a unique attunement process. I have explained all Levels of Reiki in a simple and easy way so that everyone understands it. My aim as a Reiki master is to bring clarity and understanding to all who take this course. Reiki energy is already present in everyone, you just have to discover it and I will help you to find your inner healing power. So learn about Reiki which is a universal energy that is being used positively all over the world to heal at different level of emotional, physical, mental & energetic imbalances. Reiki is present in all living things. Your imagination is the only thing that can set limitations on its uses. Reiki is a spiritual type of healing because it promotes self-awareness and a connection with all things, because we are all connected through the universal energy of the world, and the energy that we carry in ourselves. We are, in essence, connected to all things through this universal energy. Because it involves the invisible energy, life force energy, which makes up this world and us, Reiki is not just a healing method, but also a guideline to be healthier, happier and to be more aware of yourself and your purpose, as well as connecting better to others, promoting goodwill and kindness. Reiki promotes unity, peace, and love; love for yourself, love for others and love for the world. Reiki helps achieve harmony to both those who practice it and those that receive it as treatment. Believing in the existence of universal energy, Reiki helps you see the beauty in the world as it promotes harmony and peace within yourself and in the world.\nBecome a Certified Reiki Master\nLevel I of Reiki includes the hand positions used when doing Reiki on you and others, the Reiki principles, and history of Reiki.

Small children and adults can equally understand and combine this ancient form of healing into their lives. Regular contact with Reiki will bring your mind body and spirit into balance. It will also help prevent future creation of illness and disease.\nWhat are some of the benefits of Reiki? Reiki is a great way to reduce stress and promote calmness. Reiki is a relaxation method as well, and it can help overcome insomnia by creating an aura of peace. Another benefit of Reiki is the restoration of the mind/body balance and with that comes self-confidence, self-control, and increased self-esteem. Reiki helps with pain, including finding relief from chronic pain and other physical ailments that have manifested. Reiki has five basic principles that were developed by Dr. Usui, a founder of modern Reiki\nTop Ten Benefits of Practicing Reiki\n1.

The pace and concise explanations were just right, so I wouldn't change it in any other way. I would love to be able to heal all animals from suffering and as we have several pets at home with old age ailments, I can practice on them (unless they freak out!) I'll have to keep watching the video's several times, so I guess I'm going to be busy for a while. Thank you for making these lessons available, I'm looking forward to starting.\nIan Jones\nAnyone can learn to be a Energy healer and this course was created to offer everyone an experience of healing energy and how they can work with it.\nI want to share with as many people as I can that anyone can be a healer and how they can use the passing of hands to lift the energies of another person and help improve their health or speed recovery time.\nI am not teaching this so that people will stop taking prescribed medication that must always be discussed with their doctor first. Because by helping someone lift their energy the medication may work quicker and this is about offering more energy to a person so that their physical body can speed up the healing process as an adjunct to whatever they need to do to return to optimum health.\nSo by lifting someone’s energy we are giving the best chance of a speedy recovery this is not to say that at times you will see magically quick recoveries before someone has even sought their doctors help but it is important to always use whatever means that are at your disposal for healing to happen.\nThere are many types of energy healing Reiki, Chios. Qigong, Spiritual Healing, Yoga, Meditation some are very disciplined others need specialized attunements sometimes just a kind word at the right time can promote healing.\nYou are not going to need any of these disciplines or attunements for to be a healer all you will need is a few basic hand positions and moves plus the use of your imagination and intention.\nIntention will be one of the most important factors for this healing to work because when you place your intention or attention somewhere ( Where attention goes energy flows )\nA simple example of how intention and energy work is when you think of someone and the phone rings and there they are either you have picked on their intention to ring or they have picked on you thinking about them either way you both are on the same frequency or wave length\nIn this course  ( Healing Hands of a healer - anyone can learn to be a healer ) I will show you how to connect with another person’s energy so that you are working at the same energy frequency\nWelcome to this Energy Healing course\nEnergy Healing Certificate Of Completion View\nConnecting to and opening the energy field to begin a healing session\nScanning the energy field at the front\nConnecting to and opening the energy field at the back\nScanning the energy field at the back\nClear energy in front\nClear energy from a specific area down the arm\nClear energy from a specific location\nAdd energy to the head and crown chakra\nAdd energy to the forehead and third eye chakra\nAdd energy and clearing the spine\nAdd energy to the heart chakra chest and back\nAdd energy to a specific area\nAdd positive energy to the whole energy field\nSmoothing and closing the energy field\nHow to jump start the energy system\nEnergy Healing demonstration\nHealing demonstration No.2\nFinal instructions before you start using Energy Healing to heal\nBonus Downloads\n1.

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED & ACCREDITED\nIn this course I focus on the most common difficult emotional issues we face as human beings, and I strive to give each problem a workable blueprint to follow to begin to change the way we process difficult feelings, or how we deal with others in times of conflict. The blueprints are to help you respond and not react in an unconscious way. Although there are many strategies in this course, at the core is knowing thyself! We cannot solve matters of the soul when we do not know our soul.\nThis course is meant to be comfortable, vibey, and soft, so that we can delve into hard topics in a non-stressful way.\nThe conversations here cover topics we suffer in life as human beings, and instead of viewing ourselves as something broken, we need to fix, it is simply showing the universality of our suffering that makes us not unique in our suffering, but uniquely human because of it. This is a break from the norm that see's suffering as something that we are not supposed to feel, a negative that means something is wrong with us. Sadly, in life, in all our training and early schooling as we grow, there is no training whatsoever from educated people who have studied the human mind and emotions, to train us how to intelligently process our emotions. Because of this, we suffer greatly. Some of us may be gifted with a wise parent who has done much study on themselves, most do not have that luxury. So, in this course, the training begins or continues into emotional maturity and healing.\nFor those of you who are students, welcome back! For those of you who are new, welcome.  I teach through telling stories, so if you are one that needs charts, pies, or graphs, I may not be the teacher for you. Most people get used to it rather quickly and find it a fun way to learn!\nSee you in class!\nSufi\nIf you searched any of these topics, you will like this course: Counselor certification, mental health counselor, career counselor, grief counselor, spiritual counselor, addiction counselor, peer counselor, dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), certified life transition counselor, certified spiritual counselor and psychological empath, certified resolution therapist, psychology, positive psychology, social psychology, marketing psychology, clinical psychology, diploma in modern applied psychology, energy psychology, educational psychology, spiritual psychology, mental health coach, mental health, mental health counselor, occupational therapy, mental health and well-being, becoming a mental health first aider, certified mental health counseling practitioner, mental health ambassador, mental health healing and well-being, spiritual healing practitioner and coach",

      "description": "Welcome to our transformative DMT-like Meditation course, where we delve into the realms of shamanic practices and the expansion of consciousness through the heart system. While Ayahuasca offers transcendental experiences by inhibiting neurons and generating DMT, our course focuses on the heart chakra, the pivotal connection point between the human and transcendental realms.\n\n\nThrough meditation, we stimulate the evolution of your energy system, activating the heart chakra for profound well-being and heightened awareness. Unlike the temporary effects of Ayahuasca, our practices lead to lasting evolution, empowering you to evolve into a more conscious state. Join us on this transformative journey today.\n\n\nIn the Andean Stellar Codes introduction sections, we will have the most complete compendium of my trajectory and research of spirituality and holistic therapies since 2008.\n**Andean Wisdom and Anthropology**\n\n\nIn this introductory course, we study the wisdom of the Andean peoples.\nThe Andean peoples have lived for centuries in harmony with their environment.\nThey know what it is to be a happy and fulfilled person, because they knew how to overcome the aggressive process of colonization and were able to remain integrated to their roots and cosmovision, being people in integration and complement with the universe.\nOur proposal is to study their wisdom in order to also find our roots and be in happiness and fullness.\n\n\n[This is the path of the warrior of the stars, of the eternal seeker of the cosmic light, in self-discipline and balanced with the earth.]\n\n\nUnlike the previous contents that I have done, in this course, I avoid using the word “shamanism” because I am not doing a generalized or superficial study of Andean practices (which many consider as shamanic practices), but rather I am delving into Andean practices with Anthropological studies where the term “shamanism” is not part of their culture.\n\n\nThis is the great differential of my course, which is not a general shamanism course, but an in-depth study of Andean wisdom that took me a long time to research and that made me rethink many of my ideas.\n\n\nThis course is based on my book: Andean Stellar Codes, available on Amazon.",

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED & ACCREDITED\nPAIR WITH ANY MODALITY\nMINI MASTER CLASS\nIn life we have many stressors. We walk through life on a daily basis filled with anxieties about many things. We have good days and bad days. But some stresses are more present and continual. These are what I call mortal stressors that we all share as human beings, and therefore are the most common things we feel stress over on a continual basis. Mortal anxieties and fears have a way of becoming long-term fears and anxieties that we just live with, vs work through. Consciousness is the name of the game.\nAs many of you know, I teach through storytelling and sharing. This is not a course with graphs, pie charts and pdf sheets. If you need all of that, I may not be the teacher for you. I truly believe that when you listen and learn first to heal yourself, you become the most effective healer, teacher, parent, friend, you can be. You become not only informed and strategic in how to help others, but you are more compassionate, detailed and observant. You are relatable because you have been in the hot seat and know yourself, fears and anxieties. When you listen to others after taking this course, you will identify with your clients, family or friends and be able to share some of your fears as I do mine in this course, for the educational value of those I (we) are serving. People bond more with those they feel they can trust, those who are not selfish with their being and who are willing to share a little, to get a little. The most important thing in a client or bonding session or relationship is rapport. I teach you by not only giving you information you can relate to, and therefore the information sticks, but the actual course itself is a lesson in how to do it, by simply role modeling what you just witnessed from me. A healing conversation. It's that simple.\nLearning does not have to be boring or complicated to be effective and potent. Learning also does not have to be long to effect change. Most soulful truths are short and sweet.\nSome of you will find this course very peaceful and meditational as we cover some important topics, due to tone, music and my intention to create a peaceful space while talking about life's stresses.\nThis course discusses:\nMortal anxieties and fears, which is different than other anxiety's\nDiscussion in this course can also be applied to how to process everyday anxieties\nHelps you to identify your own anxieties and fears\nDiscusses strategic ways to process through the anxieties and why you have them\nDiscusses anxiety and fears of life in a world that has become very dangerous\nDiscusses political fears and anxieties in a spiritual healing and non-political way*\nDiscusses fears and anxieties of the environmental, and ever-changing world\nDiscusses the fear and anxieties around loss through, death, divorce, breakup and so on\nOur personal fears and anxieties as a common thread\nDiscusses the power of mindset and our personal life lens\nThe culmination of all these discussions leads to greater peace and coping strategies\nThis course is also very calming and peaceful throughout\nIf all of this sounds intriguing, I will see you in class. Instructions on how to receive your POBA Certificate will be included in the course at the end.\n\n\n*There are no political discussions or beliefs in this course\nIf you searched any of these topics, you will like this course: Counselor certification, mental health counselor, career counselor, grief counselor, spiritual counselor, addiction counselor, peer counselor, dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), certified life transition counselor, certified spiritual counselor and psychological empath, certified resolution therapist, psychology, positive psychology, social psychology, marketing psychology, clinical psychology, diploma in modern applied psychology, energy psychology, educational psychology, spiritual psychology, mental health coach, mental health, mental health counselor, occupational therapy, mental health and well-being, becoming a mental health first aider, certified mental health counseling practitioner, mental health ambassador, mental health healing and well-being, spiritual healing practitioner and coach",

To get the most out of this training it is recommended that you take time to absorb and learn from each lesson by going and practising with friends, family and like-minded people, as well as going and observing people and reading books from the recommended reading list to broaden your knowledge. Curiosity is the key to developing mastery and success. It is also good to ask questions and interact with others in the discussion areas of the lectures to get others understandings and views and experiences on different elements of the training.\nCurrent students on the course have describe it as:\nValuable, easy to comprehend information\nVery high-level teaching and thorough information, you won’t find any course or certification out there like this\nEasy to understand and well presented\nTeaches what is usually complicated material in an easy and comfortably way to help with solid acquisition and retention\nTaught in normal, down-to-Earth language\nInformative and interesting\nGreat information I can immediately implement in my practice\nThis course is ideal for:\nThose that are new to hypnosis and keen to learn about how to do hypnosis\nThose with experience with hypnosis who perhaps use hypnosis scripts or structured inductions and just suggesting problems away, that want to develop their skill and knowledge at being able to do hypnotherapy with people without the need for structured inductions and just the use of suggestion therapy\nIt is also ideal for hypnotherapist that perhaps don't have much knowledge or experience with Ericksonian Hypnotherapy and want to take a course for continued professional development (CPD)\nLife-Coaches, NLP Practitioners, Coaches, Counsellors and other therapists that want to learn about Ericksonian Hypnotherapy to add this skill to the therapy or coaching you already offer\n(Different places in the world have different rules around who can practice as a hypnotherapist. My view is to practice as a hypnotherapist you should undertake extensive live classroom tuition (minimum 120 hours of classroom tuition and minimum 450 hours total training) which teaches therapy and then only work with those client groups you have been trained to work with. If you are totally untrained but have an interest in learning Ericksonian hypnotherapy this course will teach you what you need to know, but I would recommend you shouldn't work as a hypnotherapist based on just taking this course. This course will still teach you advanced communication skills which can be helpful in a wide range of life situations. If you have trained in hypnotherapy, counselling, coaching, or NLP or other similar fields then Ericksonian hypnotherapy should make great additional skills for your tool-box to use with clients you have been trained to work with, and this course should also give you a greater understanding about your use of language and other skills with clients even if you aren't doing hypnosis)\nAutistic Hypnotherapy instructor Dan Jones, is one of the UK's leading experts on Ericksonian Hypnotherapy with over 20 years experience. He has also authored and contributed to many books and articles on the subject.",

Are you ready to integrate the spirituality of ancient indigenous earth wisdom of faery shamanism into the modern world and walk a path of sacred respect, healing, personal development and love?\n\n\nThen know that I am here for you, actively working with you, serving and guiding your pathway to self-acceptance. This is a unique course on shamanism based on my pathworking days from Avalon through to Edinburgh, which allows us to explore the pathways of the Faery Shaman gently or if you prefer, Faery Witch. Enter the realms through incantation, invocation and ritual, seeking the magic within and around. It is time for us to anchor into the pulse that all of life beats with - the one we have tuned out from for far too long.

She taught me to trust and to see, to speak with the Fae of their terms, to respect above all the guidance they freely grant - for those whose hearts are true. Above all, she taught me to trust my own spirituality and dare to live by it.",

I learned a lot and really appreciate the time and effort to put this course together. Our auras tell so much about us! Thank you! \"\n\n\n\"  Great course. I enjoyed every bit of it. Very thorough and there was a lot to learn and the teacher kept it engaging. I have read a few books on auras, but this course took it to another level. The teachers experience on the subject is something that you cannot find in a text book. Her tips on reading auras as a profession is quite helpful. I am so glad I found this course. Keep up the excellent work. \"\n\n\n\" I learnt about chakra many times but not aura and didn't know exactly what it was except that its a light radiating around the body. Through this course, I finally understood what I felt energetically from others is actually their aura. And aura can change its shade, thickness, etc. I found it really fascinating and enjoyed the course. After few practices, I can now see my aura - bright light radiating from my fingers in the dark room.

      "description": "Q. Ever tried to learn tarot from books and found yourself more confused than when you began?\nMy aim with this course is to make learning the tarot as easy as possible.\nThe course is designed for the complete beginner but beneficial to those with some experience with the tarot.\nThe course teaches you the skills to become a professional tarot reader but it's really up to you how far you want to take it.\nIn the course:\n- I share with you 2 or 3 meanings for each card that have worked well for me, including course notes in PDF format.\n- Learn an easy astrological system for working with the court cards and minor arcana.\n- Learn 3 different layouts and create your own.\n- Learn how to deliver information in a professional manner.\n- Watch some sample readings.\n- I discuss important aspects of being a professional tarot reader, including,\n- How to protect yourself.\n- Ways to develop your intuition.\n- Charging a fee.\n...and much more.\nOne thing I hear a lot from potential students is;\nI feel drawn to the cards but I'm not psychic...\nA psychic is different to a tarot reader. A tarot reader reads the cards, conveying one or more potential meanings to the client in relation to the positional meanings.\nYou will however find that your intuition will develop. Everyone is born with the ability to be intuitive and just like a muscle it will get stronger the more you use it.\n\nI am a practical person and this method of reading the cards has worked well for me for many years and it can work for you too.\nIf a simple, common sense, responsible approach to reading the cards appeals to you then I invite you to join me on a wonderful journey that is The Tarot!\nDisclaimer:\nTarot readings are for entertainment purposes only.\nIn various parts of this course, card meanings are discussed that may indicate Illness, whether physical or psychological, physical pain, pregnancy or patterns of abuse. This is for the information of the tarot reader alone. If a client expresses that they are unwell and asks you what is wrong with them, advise them to seek the advise of a health care professional. The tarot does not and the tarot reader should never diagnose or treat any form of medical condition.\nSimilarly, if a client asks you for legal advice or advice on how to spend/invest money, advise them to seek the advice of an industry professional in an appropriate field. No guarantees of any kind are meant to be implied regarding a reading. The client has the free will to decide whether or not they will follow the guidance offered in a Tarot reading.\nThe instructor/creator of this course accepts no responsibility for any loss, damage or harm arising from the actions/advise given to clients by students who take this course.",

I will also give you Earth Job savvy and some things to contemplate along the way as you are working with others in business, while developing your own. Working with others while developing your own thing is a great way to get free leadership masterclasses if you are paying attention. Learn the do's and don'ts from watching others do it and how people are responding to them.\nThis course, as with all my courses, do not contain graphs, charts, percentages and things you may see in other business courses. I teach through storytelling and sharing my experiences. I am positive and set realistic expectations for you, while sharing the things I and my husband learned in business ownership with over 20 years of experience in the trenches.

      "description": "Transformative Healing & Spiritual Awakening\nHoly Fire® III Reiki is a powerful and evolutionary form of Reiki energy, known for its ability to provide deep, transformative healing on all levels—physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Unlike traditional Reiki, Holy Fire® III Reiki is guided by a higher level of consciousness, offering profound experiences that lead to inner peace, personal growth, and spiritual enlightenment.\n\n\n*** *This Course does NOT provide an ICRT Certification or Membership\nAffordable Holy Fire® III Reiki Courses for Global Accessibility\nAt Deeply Rooted Journey Spiritual Academy™, I believe that everyone deserves access to high-quality spiritual education, regardless of their financial situation. Guided by my spiritual team, I offer Holy Fire® III Reiki courses at significantly lower prices than many other institutions. This is to ensure that students worldwide can experience the transformative power of Holy Fire® Reiki, even if they may not have the financial means to take this training elsewhere.\n\n\nWhat Sets Holy Fire® III Reiki Apart?\nHoly Fire® III Reiki differs from other forms of Reiki in several key ways:\nDirect Connection to Divine Energy: Holy Fire III connects you directly to the Source of Healing Energy, including the Christ Consciousness Energy, empowering you with a higher vibration of healing.\nPlacements, Ignitions, and Healing Experiences: Instead of traditional attunements, Holy Fire® III uses Placements and Ignitions to instill the Reiki energy. This process is more refined and works at a deeper level, offering powerful healing and a direct connection to the Holy Fire flame.\nPurification and Transformation: Holy Fire® III has the ability to purify deeply held emotional and mental blocks, transform unhealed wounds into wisdom, and bring about a state of inner wholeness.\nGentle Yet Powerful Energy: The energy of Holy Fire® III is both gentle and nurturing, yet incredibly powerful, guiding you toward inner peace and spiritual empowerment.\n\n\nHow Holy Fire III Reiki Benefits You\nWhether you choose to become a practitioner, a master teacher, or simply want to incorporate Holy Fire® III Reiki into your personal life, its benefits are profound and far-reaching:\nFor Practitioners: Holy Fire® III Reiki enables you to provide deep healing experiences for your clients, helping them release past trauma, emotional wounds, and physical pain. The direct connection to Holy Fire® energy elevates your practice, allowing you to work at a higher vibrational level.\nFor Master Teachers: As a master teacher, you will have the ability to pass on the Holy Fire® III energy to your students, empowering them to become healers and spiritual guides. You’ll lead Placements, Ignitions, and create life-changing experiences for those you teach.\nFor Personal Transformation: If you’re seeking to use Holy Fire® III Reiki for personal growth, it offers a profound path of healing, helping you to release limiting beliefs, fears, and past hurts. This energy supports you in elevating your daily spiritual practice, enhancing your connection to the Divine, and creating a life filled with peace, love, and clarity.\n\n\nUnlock the Power of Holy Fire III Reiki\nBy integrating Holy Fire® III Reiki into your healing journey or spiritual practice, you will unlock your potential to live a life of deep fulfillment and spiritual alignment. Whether you’re drawn to this energy for healing others or transforming your own life, Holy Fire® III Reiki is a profound tool for awakening your true self and stepping into your power as a healer, teacher, and spiritual being.\n\n\nSTUDENT TESTIMONIALS\nDavid Henningsen\nThis course is so well structured and filled with a very loving and very healing energy. It is very in-depth, so after completing the course, you are confident in practicing healing and energy work. Holy Fire is a very important part of Reiki, as Holy Fire takes us back to the roots of Reiki, not as an intellectual knowledge of the history of Reiki, but takes us back to the very deepest Source of Love and Healing of the Universe itself. Jennifer Lynn White is doing the work of an angel in making Holy Fire accessible to many people on this learning platform.\n\n\nShari Renee Smith\nThe instructor is knowledgeable and presented in a well organized format that's easy to follow. The Ocean Love experience is very powerful. I am a Reiki Master who wanted to expand my knowledge base.\n\n\nRobin J. Shelp\nSo much information here, everything to become a practitioner and start a practice is covered. The meditations and the music included are beautiful and Jenn is a wonderful teacher. This truly was a fantastic course!\n\n\nUpgrading to Holy Fire III Reiki for Existing Master Teachers\nFor those who are already Reiki Master Teachers in other styles, upgrading to Holy Fire® III Reiki requires completing both Level 2 and Level 3 courses. While Level 1 is not mandatory at Deeply Rooted Journey Spiritual Academy™, many seasoned Reiki Masters have found it to be immensely valuable, offering rich insights into Reiki’s history and spiritual foundations that may not have been included in their prior training. These Master Teachers often express that the additional knowledge has deepened their understanding of Reiki and enhanced their personal and professional practices.\nThe Importance of Upgrading to Holy Fire Energy\nIn Holy Fire® III Reiki, several traditional symbols used in other Reiki styles are replaced by the Holy Flame Master symbol. This energy is of a higher vibration and allows you to work with pure, refined healing energy, offering a deeper level of spiritual healing for both yourself and your clients. By upgrading to Holy Fire® III, you will align your practice with the evolved energy of Holy Fire, giving you access to a higher frequency of healing power.\nWhich Symbols Are Replaced?\nIn Holy Fire® III Reiki, the following traditional Reiki symbols are replaced by the Holy Flame Master symbol:\nDai Ko Myo (Usui Master symbol)\nTibetan Dai Ko Myo\nFire Serpent\nRaku\nThese symbols, which are traditionally used in various forms of Reiki, are replaced by the Holy Flame Master symbol in Holy Fire® III Reiki. This upgrade allows practitioners to work with the refined Holy Fire energy, ensuring their practice is aligned with a higher vibrational frequency for more profound healing and spiritual transformation.\nHoly Fire III Reiki Has No Lineage\nUnlike other forms of Reiki that trace their lineage back through teachers and practitioners, Holy Fire® III Reiki does not follow a traditional lineage. Instead, the energy is directly received from the Source, bypassing any earthly lineage. This ensures that the energy remains pure, untainted, and always connected to the highest levels of consciousness, allowing you to work directly with Divine Healing Energy without any intermediary.\nBy upgrading your Reiki practice to Holy Fire III, you are stepping into a new realm of healing and spiritual development. This energy will support your teaching practice, as well as your own spiritual transformation, helping you to offer unparalleled healing experiences to your clients and students alike.\nFlexible and Accessible Learning with Our Courses\nAt Deeply Rooted Journey Spiritual Academy™, I prioritize providing an exceptional and flexible learning experience for my students and why I chose to partner with Udemy.

      "description": "Welcome to this new offering of Magic Vibrations Healing with Demian Haye!\nIn this class, we will learn how to make a clear and complete energetic diagnostic of yourself or someone else. using energy testing techniques.\nAwareness is the first step in Healing. “If you can name it, you can heal it!” says the master. That is what this teaching is about: learning more about who we are and about what needs alignment and healing.\nBut the art of making good diagnostics is a difficult one! You need first to understand how perfect health looks/feels like and then see where the blockages are creating some level of distortion or misalignment. Healing is easy once you know what requires attention!\nWe will explore together:\n· The subtle anatomy of our energetic being (subtle bodies, chakras, energy axis…)\n· How to check the purity of our subtle layers, our chakras, our meridians, organs and glands.\n· The level of Soul Embodiment and alignment.\n· Our ancestral lineage purity.\n· How our karma can influence us.\n· All the different kind of blockages that we can encounter (entities, emotional blockages, mental thought forms, karmic memories, implants, vows, family secrets, holes, poisoning, curses…)\n· How to tune with someone efficiently and to read their informational field.\n· How to scan yourself.\n· How to scan others.\n· How to create a full energetic check up from A to Z.\nYou will learn how to work with testing charts (11 charts are provided) to facilitate your investigation and to end up with a clear “picture” of the energetic health of someone.\nThis class uses Energy testing techniques. So, if you don’t know how to test (muscle testing, bio-resonance, dowsing or any kind of psychic testing), I recommend you take first my Energy Testing techniques class on Udemy.\nI share here my 17 year’s experience as a healer with you, so that you can learn many efficient tricks to tune easily with someone (with heir permission of course) and retrieve precious information that will help them (or yourself) to focus their healing awareness.\nThis class is not about healing techniques. It is about Awareness.\nLearning more about ourselves, finding out how our traumas and past stories shaped our energy field, to be able to transform ourselves consciously.\nThe healing comes naturally when we are aware of what is blocking the flow of life within us. When we are aware, we are ready to let go and to embrace a higher definition of ourselves.\nAre you ready to dive into the Mystery of the human energetic structure?\nAre you ready to reveal the unconscious limitations and blockages that are holding you back?\nAre you ready to become a more conscious being?\nThen this journey into deep awareness is what you need.\nDemian Haye",
