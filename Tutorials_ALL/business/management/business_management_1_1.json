      "description": "This course now includes two complete ebooks, Getting to Lean and Team Kata, more than 670 pages of case studies, exercises, and illustrations.\nMastering lean leadership and lean culture is essential to your success as a manager and your company's success. There are two major principles of lean: Respect for People and Continuous Improvement. This course, based on years of field experience, shows you how to implement both principles in your organization. Lean is eliminating waste and the disciplined method of optimizing value to customers. It is creating a culture that brings out the best in all employees. If you do this... you will succeed as a leader in your organization!\nThe instructor has been engaged in implementing lean culture and leadership for more than forty years, working with companies like Honda, Toyota, Shell Oil Company, Corning, Merck and dozens of others. This course is based on his practical field tested knowledge of lean culture and leadership. The course introduces the history of lean, the essential principles and practices, and the important functions of the lean leader. It also presents the two critical paths to lean implementation: first, the redesign of processes, systems and structure to create the foundation that enables teams to engage in continuous improvement; second, it presents the essential habits of teams and team leaders engaged in problem-solving and continuous improvement.\nSome comments from previous students:\n\"Amazing everything makes so much sense... I loved it, wasn't expecting it to be that powerful ... Thank-you for spreading your knowledge :)\" Waleed Mousa\n\"Love how this guy communicates. Love the course so far!\" Ren Cooper\n\"Excellent! Larry Miller is the teacher everyone would love to have. Knowledgeable, laid back, funny. Real anecdotes and experiences from Toyota and the companies that later embraced the Lean philosophy. If you wanna understand the right attitude of a leader this course is the right stop. If you wanna know the House of Lean and how to live it properly look no further. Plenty of additional material available, including two of his books I would buy again with NO hesitation. I will check asap also the other courses and resources from the same author because this was high quality content Well done Larry! greetings from Melbourne!\" Antonino\n\"Great Professor, Great Course!\" Fabiano Bonomini\n\"Very good course for any manager. This was my first course and I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised but how much knowledge I did gain. I am a first time manager at my company. We had a zoo in here. People coming in late all the time, music blasting, very disorganized. By implementing items slowly it did turn things around and I know I have the respect of all the employees here. Larry is fun and has a lot of experience.\" Kevin Mohammed\n\"I really like the short and to the point lectures; the diagrams are great for the visual learners (me!) as well the sheet for identifying your clients, goals will be useful. This was round one as I find reviewing these programs more then once helps in establishing a game plan for my work place.\" Sherry Jackson\n\"I have had the pleasure of working with and learning from Larry Miller. This course was very informative and has given me some great ideas and tools to strengthen my coaching abilities.\" Jane McDonald",

The true cost of meetings is often hidden. But not anymore. As well as showing you how to facilitate meetings, it gives great protocols for the whole team and for all types of meetings.\nThe principles have been tried and tested in classroom training courses in UK, Scandinavia, Iceland and North Africa, in a mix of global businesses.\nThe short summaries give you the basics, literally, in minutes.

Over the past two decades, I have worked in the cybersecurity and information technology realm, fighting for my projects to be funded. Early in my career, I didn't understand why certain projects would be funded and executed, while others wouldn't. What I learned, is that it all came down to Risk Management by our executives and managers.\nYou will learn the terms used by executives and managers in discussing Risk Management, and how to apply the concepts of Risk Management to your networks, systems, and projects. This course is not an operational or tactical course that focuses on how you will secure your networks, but instead focuses on the mindset of managers and teaches you how to think like they do. Once you master these concepts, it is much easier to build your business case for your projects and justify your budgetary needs.\nThroughout this course, we will discuss what comprises Risk (assets, threats, and vulnerabilities), providing numerous real-world examples along the way. We will also cover Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Measurements, showing how you can calculate the risk of an uncertainty due to vulnerabilities and threats.\nThis course also includes two case studies of what happens when risk management fails, as demonstrated by the Amazon Web Services outage and Equifax data breach that both occurred in 2017. You will learn to better understand these scenarios, what caused the outage/breach, and why managers may have made the decisions they did that led up to them.\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will earn 3 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",

Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\n\n\n\n\nWhether you...\nRun your own business\nHave a management position\nAre an executive in a Fortune 500 company\nAspire to lead in any of these ways\n...there are certain qualities and capabilities you need in order to succeed as a leader.\nEvery skill imaginable is available at your fingertips—all you have to do is download an app, enroll in an online course, read a book, or hire a coach. If everything you need to learn to be a great leader is out there, available to everyone, why, then are some leaders---and the organizations they run—so much more successful than others?\nWould your answer be:\nBecause some leaders put more time and effort into learning the necessary skills\nBecause some leaders are just more naturally talented than others\nYour answer to THIS question is the greatest predictor of your future success as a leader—not your degrees, experience, innate abilities, personality, current position or how many of the top qualities great leaders have that you already possess.\nWhether you believe your success as a leader depends on you being more talented than others or you believe your success as a leader depends on your willingness to learn and develop the needed skills—this distinction is what determines EVERYTHING.\nIn our society, and especially in the hierarchical structure in the corporate world, there is a prevailing belief that some people are simply smarter or more talented than others and that this difference is what accounts for a person’s success or failure. However, in industries like sports where natural talent is highly coveted, over and over again the athletes who initially showed lower levels of raw talent are the ones who come out on top.\n\n\nLet us tell you a little story...\n\nIn a famous example, Michael Jordan—the most revered basketball player of all times—was cut from his high school basketball team. Other players may have had more natural ability, but Michael surpassed them all. Why? Because he out-worked every single one of them. He developed his abilities, whereas the players who though they were already talented and didn’t have to try so hard, didn’t.\nBut it wasn’t the hours of extra time Michael put into practicing every day that allowed him to, literally, leap above his competitors. What enabled him to become the best in history was his belief system—his mindset—the belief that he was CAPABLE of improving his ability.\n\nIt’s not a person’s talent that makes them successful—it’s the belief that they can IMPROVE—and then the action they take to do so.\nWhat the most successful leaders have that others don’t is a GROWTH MINDSET. They believe that they will become the best leaders they can be through EFFORT, LEARNING, and GROWTH. They believe they, and everyone they work with, are capable of improving. Without this underlying belief, they will not put the time and effort into learning those needed skills because, well, why bother? You either have the talent and intelligence to be a leader or you don’t, right?\nThis course was created to help you identify the differences between a fixed mindset leader and a growth mindset leader so that you can become the latter.\nThis course will help you develop a growth mindset, starting with the good news that regardless of what you previously thought, the truth is that your talent and intelligence is not fixed—you can develop your abilities in any area.\nThen, you can take what you learn and teach the growth mindset to your staff. And because you believe in the human potential to learn and grow you can coach employees to reach their potential. The result is that your employees will improve and your teams, projects, or department will thrive.\nLastly, you’ll learn how growth mindset organizations operate differently, why they outperform and outlast fixed mindset organizations, and how you can take make these changes in your organization.\nAnd, you’ll receive a proven blueprint for setting growth-oriented goals so that you can implement the exciting new strategies you learn for developing yourself as a leader and inspiring your staff and organization to embrace their potential.\nSo, are you ready to transform your life, career, and business? If so enroll now, we look forward to seeing you in the course!\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.\n\n\nSo, who are we?\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera.

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nExcel is the most often used first-choice tool of every business analyst and consultant. Maybe it is not the fanciest or most sophisticated one, yet it is universally understood by everybody especially your boss and your customers.\nExcel is still a pretty advanced solution with countless features and functions. One of the most useful Excel tools is the Pivot Tables which help you do fast and efficient data analyses. In this course, I will show you how to use the full potential of Pivot Tables during consulting projects. This course is organized around the 80/20 rule and I want to teach you the most useful (from a business analyst/consultant perspective) features of Pivot Tables as fast as possible. I want you also to acquire thanks to the course good habits in Excel that will save you loads of time.\nIf done properly, this course will transform you in 1 day into a pretty good business analyst who knows how to use Pivot Tables Excel in a smart way. It is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting companies and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest companies from FMCG, SMG, and B2B sectors that I worked for.  On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 business analysts who now are Investment Directors, Senior analysts, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, many others\nI teach step by step on the basis of Excel files that will be attached to the course. To make the most out of the course you should follow my steps and repeat what I do with the data after every lecture. Don’t move to the next lecture if you have not done what I show in the lecture that you have gone through.\nI assume that you know basic Excel so the basic features (i.e. how to write formulas in Excel) are not explained in this course. I concentrate on intermediate and advanced solutions and purposefully get rid of some things that are advanced yet later become very inflexible and useless (i.e. naming the variables). In the end, I will show full-blown analyses using Pivot Tables that use the tricks that I show in the lectures.\nFor every lecture, you will find attached  (in additional resources) the Excel files shown in the lectures. In this way, as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nI have done several courses showing you how to analyze data in Excel. Yet, I have noticed that some students lack fluency in operations in Excel, especially when it comes to Pivot Tables. This course is designed to fill in the gap and help you fully appreciate my other courses for business analysts and consultants. It can be used also as a standalone course that will help you to be smart with Excel Pivot Tables. I recommend it, especially to people who have to work in Excel for 2-3 hours a day or want to become management consultants.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you do the analyses using Pivot Tables as well as the quality of the conclusions coming out of available in your company data. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to use Pivot Tables in practice?\nHow to calculate things directly in Pivot Tables\nHow to draw conclusions from analyses – chosen examples of analyses\nHow to improve the look & feel of Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts\nHow to use Pivot Charts to present the data & conclusions\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course\nBasic Usage of Pivot Tables. In this section, I will show you the most important features of Pivot Tables that will drastically increase the speed of your data analysis. We will discuss how to build Pivot Table, Pivot Chart, and how to replace Pivot Tables with some other functions. We will also go through an example of an analysis done using the Pivot Table\nCalculation in the Pivot Tables. Quite often you want to do a lot of calculations on the basis of the original data. You can do it in the original table or directly in the Pivot Table. In this section, you will learn how to do it in the Pivot Tables. We will discuss the calculation field, the “show as…” option, and many others.\nOther useful pre-defined options. Pivot tables have many predefined options such as sorting, filtering, changing source data, adding new variables, etc. We will discuss them in this section and will show you some examples of how to use them in practice.\nImproving the look and feel of the table. In this section, I will show you how to improve the look and feel of the Pivot Tables.\nPivot Charts. In this section, I will go into details when it comes to Pivot Charts. I will also show you how to create a Dashboard using Pivot Charts and slicers.\nExamples of analysis using Pivot Tables. Here I will show examples of real-life data analyses using Pivot Tables.\nWe will be adding new sections in the coming months\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nYou will master the most crucial functions and features of Excel Pivot Tables\nUnderstand the main challenges in analyzing data with Pivot Tables\nDo calculations directly in the Pivot Table without impacting the original data set\nPerform the analyses in a very effective manner\nBuild Dashboards using Pivot Tables and Charts\nWho should take this course?

You will have the chance to learn from somebody who has been in the industry and who has actually seen AI & data science implemented at the highest level.\nYour instructor, Danielle Thé, is a Senior Product Manager for Machine Learning with a Master’s in Science of Management, and years of experience as a Product Manager, and Product Marketing Manager in the tech industry for companies like Google and Deloitte Digital.\nFrom security applications to recommendation engines, companies are increasingly leveraging big data and artificial intelligence, including cutting-edge tools like ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs), to enhance operations and product offerings. In just the past few years, organizational adoption of AI has surged by 270%, driven by breakthroughs in natural language processing and machine learning. As businesses race to implement these technologies, there is a growing demand for skilled professionals who can manage AI and big data projects. In this context, a product manager plays a crucial role, bridging the gap between business goals and the technical expertise of data scientists and AI specialists.Organizations are looking for people like you to rise to the challenge of leading their business into this new and exciting change.\nThe course is structured in a beginner-friendly way. Even if you are new to data science and AI or if you don’t have prior product management experience, we will bring you up to speed in the first few chapters. We’ll start off with an introduction to product management for AI and data. You will learn what is the role of a product manager and what is the difference between a product and a project manager.\nWe will continue by introducing some key technological concepts for AI and data. You will learn how to distinguish between data analysis and data science, what is the difference between an algorithm and an AI, what counts as machine learning, and what counts as deep learning, and which are the different types of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning). These first two sections of the course will provide you with the fundamentals of the field in no time and you will have a great overview of AI and data science today.\nThen, in section 3, we’ll start talking about Business strategy for AI and Data. We will discuss when a company needs to use AI, as well as how to perform a SWOT analysis, and how to build and test a hypothesis. In this part of the course, you’ll receive your first assignment – to create a business proposal.\nSection 4 focuses on User experience for AI & Data. We will talk about getting the core problem, user research methods, how to develop user personas, and how to approach AI prototyping. In section 5, we will talk about data management. You will learn how to source data for your projects and how this data needs to be managed. You will also acquire an idea about the type of data that you need when working with different types of machine learning.\nIn sections 6,7,8, and 9 we will examine the full lifecycle of an AI or data science project in a company. From product development to model construction, evaluating its performance, and deploying it, you will be able to acquire a holistic idea of the way this process works in practice.\nSections 10, 11, and 12 are very important ones too. You will learn how to manage data science and AI teams, and how to improve communication between team members. Finally we will make some necessary remarks regarding ethics, privacy, and bias.\nThis course is an amazing journey and it aims to prepare you for a very interesting career path!\nWhy should you consider a career as a Product Manager?\nSalary. A Product Manager job usually leads to a very well-paid career (average salary reported on Glassdoor: $128,992)\nPromotions.

      "description": "You got tapped by your boss to join a project focused on a new idea that will take your company to new heights. You will be working with people from across the organization to ensure the idea has a leg. You should be excited, but you only feel a pit in your stomach as you worry about how to successfully collaborate across teams. Ugh!\nDon’t worry, I’m here to help you through it! I created this practical Udemy course to prepare you to lead or participate in a cross-team collaboration. This course includes step-by-step guidance about what to do before, during and after a cross-team collaboration. In my course, I am sharing the same frameworks and protocols that helped me successfully navigate my years working with companies including: American Express, Lexus, Marriott, Fidelity, and Fast Company. What’s more, by the end of this course you will understand why strong collaboration skills can help build your professional network, expand your business knowledge and fuel your career growth.\nSpecifically, this course will show you how to:\nDesign comprehensive goals and performance measures for your collaboration\nDevelop a communications and reporting protocol\nSolicit participants and experts for your collaboration\nEstablish a timeline and progress markers\nInvite and engage senior leaders in your project\nCreate a strong team culture for your collaboration\nKeep track of the team’s roles and responsibilities\nCommunicate clearly with stakeholders invested in your project\nSet clear goals and expectations for the team\nWrap up a collaboration for maximum impact\nSuccessfully collaborating with others has never been more important than right now. Combatting the COVID-19 global pandemic has required businesses of all types to bring people and resources together to solve challenges threatening lives and livelihoods. We are clearly better together.\nBut even before the pandemic, The World Economic Forum and Deloitte cited collaboration and partnership as critical success-drivers in business. Forward-thinking organizations are seeking professionals with more “human skills” such as: critical thinking, creativity, initiative, persuasion and negotiation. These are the skills that cut down on political-posturing, land-grabbing and other patterns that destroy organizations.\nCollaboration with others is an excellent way to strengthen your “human skills” and in turn, build your career and marketability.\nThis course is filled with personal anecdotes from my decades of experience building strategic partnerships between Fortune 500 companies. I also provide clear guidance on what to do before, during and after a cross-team collaboration project and practical exercises that you can implement in your next group project.\nEnroll today to elevate your collaboration acumen — the leadership skill of the future!",

      "description": "Do you want to know how the best managers generate and re-generate exceptional talent? Are you ready to learn how to lead from the best of the best? If so, The Superboss Playbook for Managers is your opportunity to learn the best practices used by top industry leaders to shape unconventional, creative, and high-performance talent.\nSo what is a superboss? In short, a superboss is a leader who creates other leaders. They have particular characteristics and leadership styles that help them develop talent in ways unlike your average manager. Superbosses are always at the top of their industries and aim to get the best out of the people that work for them, in turn producing other industry leaders. You may recognize the names of some famous superbosses, such as Ralph Lauren, Lorne Michaels, and Larry Ellison, but you don't need to be a household name to be a superboss. ANYONE CAN BE A SUPERBOSS, and this course gives you a step-by-step playbook to adopt the most important superboss practices.\nMy name is Sydney Finkelstein, and I've been a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College for 25 years. My book Superbosses: How Exceptional Leaders Master the Flow of Talent was the result of a 10-year research project into the secrets of the superboss. I interviewed hundreds of individuals, spanning many industries, but superbosses all have one thing in common - they spawn top-tier talent. I've created this course to give you insight into how these managers work with their employees to achieve phenomenal success and how you can too.\nSpecifically, this course will cover:\nWhat a superboss is, including the characteristics and types of superbosses\nHow to determine the superboss traits you currently have and those you can develop\nRecruiting exceptional (and often unusual) talent\nEnergizing and motivating your team using high expectations and an uncompromising vision\nUnleashing creativity by embracing change, taking risks, and learning from mistakes\nEmbracing your role as a teacher and developing your employees using a master-apprentice relationship\nBuilding collaborative and competitive teams and lucrative employee networks\nI've also included activities in every section to help you put these lessons into practice immediately within your teams. While the lectures are meant to give you insight into how other superbosses have succeeded, the activities are your chance to start establishing your own superboss identity. Use the activities as stepping stones to figure out which superboss practices work well for you and your team.\nI know that this course will not only introduce you to how the best managers lead their teams and industries, but will provide you with actionable tips to start leading like a superboss today. If you're ready to take your leadership and talent management to the next level, please join me in this course!\nCPE (Continuing Professional Education)\nLearning Objectives\nDescribe the characteristics of a superboss.\nList the three different types of superbosses.\nRecognize what superbosses look for in the people they hire.\nExplain why superbosses are attracted to untapped talent pools.\nState how superbosses motivate their employees.\nDescribe why vision is important.\nDescribe how superbosses unleash the creativity of the people around them.\nDefine the term “opportunity spotter.”\nRecognize what superbosses do differently than other bosses when it comes to developing talent.\nDescribe why superbosses value their networks so much.\nFor additional information, including refunds and complaints, please see Udemy Terms of Use, which is linked from the footer of this page.\nFor more information regarding administrative policies, please contact our support using the Help and Support link at the bottom of this page.",

      "description": "What is ISO/IEC 27001 and why it matters?\nISO/IEC 27001 is the world's most popular standard for information security management. Certification to this standard is highly sought after as it demonstrates an organization’s ability to safeguard information with robust security controls, ensuring trust and reliability.\nGlobal leaders like Google, Apple, Adobe, Oracle, and countless other tech corporations, financial institutions, healthcare providers, insurance companies, educational institutions, manufacturers, service companies, government agencies, and businesses of all sizes have implemented and certified Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) according to ISO/IEC 27001.\nThis showcases their commitment to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information they handle.\nCourse Overview\nMy course delves into the management system requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2022, along with the information security controls from the standard's annex (Annex A).\nThis comprehensive guide will help you understand how to implement an ISMS, meet the necessary requirements and achieve compliance.\nThe course is structured into 6 sections:\n- the first section is an introduction to the concept of information security and to this standard, ISO/IEC 27001. Among other aspects the introductive part addresses the following subjects: what represents an ISMS (Information Security Management System), what is the purpose of ISO/IEC 27001 and what is the structure of this standard or what are other standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family that can be of interest for an information security professional.\n- the second section of the course is about the management system requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2022. The course follows the structure of the standard, covering all the requirements in each clause and sub-clause. The context of the organization, the scope of the ISMS, information security risk assessment and risk treatment, the information security objectives, the documentation of the ISMS, the internal audit of the ISMS, the management review, the information security policy or the management of nonconformities are among the subjects covered by this second section of the course.\n- the third, fourth, fifth and sixth sections are all about the information security controls from Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001:2022. There are 93 controls divided into 4 themes: Organizational controls (section 3 of the course), People controls (section 4), Physical controls (section 5) and Technological controls (section 6). The information security controls to be discussed cover, among others, subjects like incident management, supplier relationships, network security, business continuity and ICT readiness, equipment maintenance, storage media, the development of software and systems, the use of cryptography, authentication information, the screening of candidates for employment, the disciplinary process, change management, backup and redundancy, malware protection and technical vulnerability management, logging and monitoring, information security awareness and training, requirements for user end-point devices, capacity management, access privileges, protection against environmental threats, cabling security or secure coding.\nIf you are interested in the certification to ISO/IEC 27001 for organizations and individuals, there is a video dedicated to this subject at the end of the course.\nAfter going through all the videos of this course you will have a good understanding of what are the requirements for an information security management system and how an organization can apply such a system and claim conformity to ISO/IEC 27001:2022.\nThe information will be very useful to you if you:\n- work as a consultant helping organizations apply standards and implement management systems;\n- participate in audits (internal or external audits) in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022;\n- work in a company that applies or intends to apply an information security management system;\n- have an interest in information security management in general;\n- are looking to build a career in information security.\n\nIf none of the options above suits your profile you can use the information in my course for awareness on information security and you will have a good image of the requirements that many organizations around the world have decided to adopt.\n\nThis course provides 7 hours of condensed information that you can revisit anytime you need and once you finish it you can prove your knowledge in the field of information security management with the certificate issued by Udemy.\n*The course is updated to account for the 2024 Amendment to ISO/IEC 27001:2022 about climate change.",

Thus, your career success has a lot to do with properly navigating these change situations. One of the biggest challenges in this area is how leaders help their employees embrace difficult changes. Change causes confusion and worry and your job is to help them find their way back to clarity, positivity, and productivity.\n\n\nIn this course, I’ll show you how to manage relationships and resources to ensure your team successfully embraces change. We’ll cover aspects of your behavior, relevant communication tactics, how to deal with adverse change reactions, how to help them shift and adapt when needed, and much more.\n\n\nStudents will learn:\n\n\nHow to own your role in change that is impacting your team\nTactics for effectively listening to your team’s needs\nWays to successfully collaborate\nHow to shape productive perspectives for your employees\nWhat to do with difficult reactions to change\nHow to support positivity and wellness\n\n\nPlease note: I am a world-class leadership and success expert who wants to get you moving forward quickly. Success is knowing the small number of things that, if done correctly, really drive your growth. That’s why there is no wasted time or excess hours included in any of my courses. I strictly focus on the essentials and how to act on them immediately.\n\n\nMy courses are different for a few very specific reasons. I hold a world-class Ph.D. in Organizational Behavior. I am a former award-winning professor who taught MBA students for over a decade. My clients include Google, IBM, ExxonMobil, Kraft Heinz, and hundreds more. I’ve delivered several TEDx talks and have created many online courses enjoyed by millions of learners at the world’s top companies and universities. I combine elite expertise, with a professional speaker’s ability to communicate, and a highly practical approach that makes learning actionable.\n\n\nSpeaking of action, I always include a few useful activities to make the learning come to life. This course contains two (addressing how to build perspective and ways to listen to the team effectively). When you start to apply what we’ll talk about – that’s when learning sticks.\n\n\nWhen you take this course I will expand your knowledge, help you feel more motivated, and make you ready to move your career forward.",

      "description": "I have worked to make this course a truly comprehensive course on team leadership, participation, employee involvement and hybrid organizations with remote teams. You will find little or no academic theory in this course. All the lessons here are derived from my forty-five years of implementing teams in dozens of manufacturing plants, health care and other settings. It is all based on practical application.\nNote: the course now includes three complete ebooks -\nTeam Kata - The Habits of Continuous Improvement which describes the functions of teams and team leaders in our modern organization.\nThe Lean Coach which presents a model of positive coaching, improving personal and team performance.\nGetting To Lean - Transformational Team Management which is a complete guide to the design of a team based organization, defining its processes and structure. This is a book about strategic change in the culture and capabilities of an organization.\nPlus a dozen articles, case studies, 70 downloadable papers and assignments on the implementation of teams.\nThe Challenge:\nTo succeed as a manager, entrepreneur, or executive, you must have the skills of team leadership. This course provides those skills. It provides the skills of facilitation, communication, problem solving, conflict resolution, process improvement and managing human performance. It is based on the principles and practices of lean management and culture (Toyota Production System) and the instructors forty years of experience implementing team management and lean culture.\nAction-Learning:\nThis course is structured to facilitate the relationship between the team leader, his or her team, and a coach who may assist in applying the lessons. There are fourteen exercises that ask the student to put the lessons to work with their team or practice with their coach. The instructor employs an \"action-learning\" model, recognizing that the best learning occurs from applying the lessons to the student's real work situation, and from receiving feedback from a coach. It is intended as a comprehensive model and curriculum for team leaders.\nRecognition and Celebration:\nWhen you complete this course, you will receive a certificate of completion from Udemy. However, this is a demanding course and you are asked to demonstrate competence in managing people, teams and processes. The instructors believes that you deserve more recognition. If you complete the assignments and send a portfolio of completed assignments to the instructor you will be recognized with a Green Belt certification by the Institute for Leadership Excellence; and, the author will send you ebook copies of his three most recent books on coaching, team leadership, and developing lean organization and culture. You deserve it!",

      "description": "Making sense of who you are in the world involves a good level of self-awareness; knowing your values and how your strengths and weaknesses can support you or limit you in your life.\nHow you manage yourself - your thoughts and your feelings - depends upon how you well you understand your emotions, how control them and how use them as you make your way through life.\nUnderstanding your self-awareness is one of the ways that you use your emotional intelligence.  The course covers the awareness part of how you manage your inner world of being.\n\nThis course is a stand alone course for anyone interested in understanding themselves better and determining their core purpose, vocation or destiny in life.  It forms part of a comprehensive course that explores emotional intelligence in more depth.\nEmotions are not about being soft and fluffy, they are vital in help you to make hard, direct management decisions. Managing your emotions well can mean managing your life with more influence and impact.\n\nIn this course, we will explore the way that you manage your emotions and how this drives your self-confidence, your beliefs about yourself, and how you work with your life goals.\nWithin the course, you will discover how the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) can be used to develop your self-awareness.  Personality preferences are investigated, discussed, and correlated with various leadership situations involving people. Additional, specific study methodologies and assessment techniques are shared so that you can build upon this, if you are interested in taking this further.\nYour behavioural preferences linked to the MBTI are explored to determine your personality type.  This will give you more self-awareness, a better understanding of yourself and others and will help you to make sense of who you are in the world.\nYou'll receive all the information that you need and will be coached using loads of practical hints that you can use straight away.\nThe course is made up of a series of lectures and contains downloadable resources.

      "description": "Welcome to 'Emotional Intelligence Training: Emotional Intelligence in the Workplace'. My emotional intelligence course is specially geared to understanding emotional intelligence in the workplace. There will be plenty of opportunities for you to practice your EI skills.\nThe focus is on Ability EI, which is one construct of Emotional Intelligence, or in other words, it is one way to think of/and measure EI. Please watch the whole introductory section of this course so you can appreciate the different ways that EI is/can be measured, and so you can also appreciate why I chose to focus on Ability EI.\nThe goal of the course is to help organizations increase their sales, workplace mental health, and reduce stress by understanding, developing, and applying emotional intelligence!\nThe concept of Emotional Intelligence became popularized in 1995 when Daniel Goleman wrote a book titled 'Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ'. Since then, organizations have attempted to apply EI principles to improve organizational outcomes.\nWe look at how emotional intelligence can increase job performance and leadership ability, and offer practical advice and tips on how to develop and use it. Quizzes and assignments test your understanding of the material.\nThe course is designed to be concise, have short lessons, and present the information directly. Your time is valuable, and I want to jam in as much relevant information as possible in the least amount of time. Therefore, I hope you choose my course for your emotional intelligence training.\n\nQuestions and Discussions are encouraged in the Q&A.\nThere is no risk as Udemy offers a 30-day money-back guarantee!\nEnroll today!

      "description": "Hello!\nI'm Ron Wehrens, a pharmacist from The Netherlands. My professional journey spans more than three decades, during which I've been deeply involved in the world of pharmaceutical and medical supply management. What makes my experience unique is a focused commitment: I've dedicated myself exclusively to enhancing pharmaceutical supply for the public sector and humanitarian projects in low and middle-income countries.\nAcross > 40 countries (Mostly in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe), I've undertaken > 190 consultancy missions that have given me a direct understanding of the fundamental barriers many encounter: limited resources, lack of reliable data, the pressing need for proper staff training and motivation, and the complex requirements imposed by donors.\nHands on tasks I have handled included running a pharmaceutical warehouse in Uganda, setting up antiretroviral reporting and replenishing systems in Vietnam, conducting tailored trainings on managing HIV or Tuberculosis supplies in remote corners like Mongolia and Tajikistan.\nI have also done procurement auditing (which often revealed significant instances of fraud and corruption). Beyond that, I've operated at higher strategic levels, consulting for the World Health Organization (WHO) and international humanitarian organizations. I've also served as an advisor to national ministries of Health, contributing to the entire process from planning and budgeting to the delivery of medical supplies.\nSo, why share this with you? Because these experiences—they're the bedrock of this course. Together, we'll explore these experiences, drawing from real-world involvement. At the heart of this course is a practical approach to supply management, where product availability, calculated quantities, thoughtful budgets, transparent procurement, and vigilant storage and distribution are key. This framework is what we'll build together.\nThis course is not only valuable for professionals in middle and low-income countries. The concepts and principles we'll delve into have a universal essence. They are relevant to those in high-income countries seeking to improve supply management strategies or even individuals dealing with non-pharmaceutical supply management. After all, the core principles often remain remarkably similar across different contexts.\nMy dedication is to empower all who aspire to make a difference. Many of you deserve to attend comprehensive international logistics courses, but constraints such as time and finances often make that difficult. This is where this concise yet impactful 4-hour Udemy course comes in. It serves as a bridge, offering swift and effective retraining, igniting motivation, and enabling those eager to drive positive change in various aspects of pharmaceutical supply.\nOur mission is clear: to enhance access to essential medicines and make a tangible difference in real lives.\n\n\nRon",

Resilient teams are adaptive, collaborative, and innovative. Resilient leaders achieve organizational goals, even when faced with overwhelming challenges.\nTo maintain a resilient organization that is ready for anything, leaders need to do more than focus on their own resilience; they must become Resilience Leaders. Resilience Leaders model behaviors that build resilience, and by doing so, encourage their employees to do the same. They recognize when employees are struggling and have supportive conversations that demonstrate that they care. They help employees find solutions and a path forward. Resilience Leaders actively foster their teams' resilience so that groups of employees become more capable than any one individual.\nWhile Director of the State Department's Center of Excellence in Foreign Affairs Resilience, I designed this course for U.S. Ambassadors and other senior leaders across the foreign affairs community. I saw first-hand how successful Resilience Leaders are despite working in challenging and dangerous environments. I'm pleased to introduce you to these same skills and tools so you can inspire high performance in your team.\nIn this course, you will:\nDefine resilience and explain why resilience is essential in the workplace;\nIdentify common characteristics of low resilience in yourself and others;\nEngage in activities and use skills/tools that build your resilience;\nModel resilience skills and tools in your workplace;\nSupport and mentor employees with low resilience;\nEvaluate your team’s resilience;\nFoster the 7Cs of team resilience; and\nConduct an exercise to identify your team’s resilience strengths and weaknesses.\nLet's get started!",

You will gain a different perspective of yourself as a leader in relation to your MBTI Personality Type.  Personality preferences are investigated, discussed, and correlated with various leadership situations involving people.  Additional, specific study methodologies and assessment techniques are shared so that you can build upon this, if you are interested in taking this further.\nThe course, also, covers emotional intelligence coaching and how to manage and resolve situations where conflict arises.\nThis course is a standalone course for anyone interested in understanding how work to more effectively with others as a leader.  It compliments other courses that explore emotional intelligence in more depth.\nYou'll receive all the information that you need and will be coached using loads of practical hints that you can use straight away.\nThe course is for you if you want to develop as a leader to improve the way that you interact with other people, the way that you make decisions and the way that you manage performance.\nThe course contains some challenging quizzes around real-life workplace leadership scenarios that will make you think.  There are a series of interactive exercises that involve some activity with other people and some reflection.\nThe course material makes up a one to two day workshop so is equivalent to 8 -12 hour's training.

This course will help you to become a successful coach who can help others achieve their own version of greatness.\nThis course is focused on coaching current leaders or managers within an organization to improve performance, develop new habits, and contribute to a culture of continuous improvement. Every great athlete has a coach. Every great musician has a coach. And, within great organization, like Toyota, every manager has a coach. The cost of external coaching is too great. This course is designed to prepare managers to coach both their own team members and to coach peer managers.\nThis course will provide a seven step model for coaching that focuses on a challenge to achieve organization goals. The coach helps the client then establish short term targets for improvement and then breaks key skills down into pinpointed behaviors to be practiced and become the habits or skills of high performance.\nThis model is one that enables organizations to maximize coaching opportunities within the organization and develop internal coaching skills.\nThe instructor has more than forty years experience training both external consultants and internal coaches in companies like Shell Oil Company, Corning, Merck, and dozens of others.\n\"I really like the short and to the point lectures; the diagrams are great for the visual learners (me!) as well the sheet for identifying your clients, goals will be useful.

We call this the Golden Thread, the connection that runs through every stage from vision to task. Without this connection daily activities can begin to feel misguided, unnecessary, and even debilitating.\n\nThe second topic will save you a massive headache by teaching you how to measure and monitor effectively. We must measure progress towards targets, but measuring and monitoring in the wrong areas could cause skewed or even false results, not to mention the wasted time and effort involved. Get to grips with multiple potential measures, and understand what key areas you should be measuring in order to recoup clear accurate, and useful data.\nThe final topic in this course is managing performance. Through our lessons you will learn ways of adapting your approach to performance management to meet properly individuals needs. Using our will vs skill matrix you will discover a formula for prescribing an approach based upon your staff members current competence and attitude.",

Change can be difficult. Technological advances now mean that we have even more change to contend with, not just in our personal lives but also at work. If you are a manager or team leader implementing changes at work then you are faced with not only coping with your own feelings about change but also those of your colleagues and team members.\nBecause of my own personal experiences of change but also implementing change projects in organisations I decided to create a course covering the fundamentals of understanding change, focusing in particular on the people side of change.\nThis course helps managers and individuals get to grips with understanding the emotional impact of change and how people can make or break a change process. In addition the course will help you to understand why people respond to change differently – some getting on board with the change project straight away whilst others digging their heels in not wanting to change.\nThis is a short course giving you the “nitty-gritty of just what you need”, including useful tips and information so that you are ready for action with your next change project.\nIn many ways this short course is the only course you will need to understand and implement change. With every change project you work on you will build experience on top of this foundation of knowledge.\nWhat students say about this course\n“Enjoyed this course - very good recap of some basic change must-knows delivered in a friendly, positive way.” (Ian)\n“Excellent course. Especially enjoyed the section on change avoiders and change chasers. Thanks !” (Varun)\n“I got strong realisation towards my own experiences and emotional response to any change in work or personal life. Very useful indication on anatomy of change, team collaboration skills and things to consider when rolling out complex changes.” (Sandeep)\nThe course is made up of short videos, exercises and downloadable handouts. In addition to this you have access to me via messages and discussions. Once you joined the course, you will get all updates and new lectures free of charge in addition to supplementary material.

      "description": "Cybersecurity is now a required skill for every job, from Accountants, Doctors, Lawyers, or CEOs. To take the next step in your career, you'll need to understand how to protect yourself, your company, and your community. Understanding cybersecurity is important, but this course will help you make security easy by making it a habit, and will show tailor your approach to security to fit your unique personality and to fit your life the way you live it.\nYou’ve probably already taken some kind of cybersecurity training in your career and if you’re like most people, you probably hated it or thought that it was a waste of time because it wasn’t specific to your situation or the way you work. In this Masterclass, I will be your cyber security coach and help you develop a personal training plan to identify and improve habits that affect your cybersecurity.\nAs a CISO, I’ve helped Fortune 500 companies, non-profits, startups and individuals become more cyber aware and secure. And I have good news. You don’t need a degree in computer science or advanced computer skills to be more secure, because security is innate. It is a survival mechanism we all have. It is in your DNA! All you need to do to become cyber secure is to utilize these self-preservation instincts to develop behaviors and habits that make you more secure.\nThis Masterclass will focus on the nine cybersecurity habits described in my award winning book, Well Aware: Master the Nine Habits to Protect Your Future. We all have our own unique strengths when it comes to security, and we will learn from what other successful leaders did right so we can emulate their success rather than focusing on what others did wrong.\nAll these leaders had one thing in common – none of them started out as cybersecurity experts. Which means you, whatever your career path is, can be well aware of cyber security and as a result, become truly cyber secure.\nIn short, we will develop your strengths to help supercharge your cybersecurity.",

      "description": "In today’s work environment, the lines between our professional and personal lives are blurred more than ever before. Whatever is happening to us outside of our workplace – whether stressful, painful, or joyful – follows us into work as well. We may think we have to keep these realities under wraps and act as if we have it all together. However, we can work better, lead successfully, and be more engaged and inspiring if – instead of trying to hide who we are – we show up fully and authentically.\nI'm Mike Robbins, a speaker and executive coach, and your instructor for this course. I've spent more than 20 years researching, writing, and speaking about leadership, teamwork, and high-performance. My clients have ranged from Google to Citibank, from the US Department of labor to the San Francisco Giants. From small startups in Silicon Valley to family-owned businesses in the Midwest. From what I've seen and studied over the past two decades, I believe that for us to thrive as leaders and to have the kind of impact we truly want to have on others, it’s essential to lead with authenticity.\nAuthentic leadership is about acknowledging that we’re all vulnerable, imperfect human beings doing the best we can. It means having the courage to take risks, speak up, have compassion, ask for help, connect with others in a genuine way, and allow ourselves to be truly seen.\nIn this course, I outline the five key principles from my book, Bring Your Whole Self to Work, that we can use to approach our own work in the spirit of openness and humanity, and to help the people we work with feel safe enough to do the same, so that the teams and organizations we’re a part of can truly succeed.\nIn this course, you will:\nIdentify what authenticity truly is and why it’s so important in building trust\nDiscover the importance of psychological safety and how to create it for your team\nExpand your ability to operate with authenticity\nRecognize the essential difference between recognition and appreciation (and why appreciation drives higher performance)\nTap into appreciation as a fuel for productivity, loyalty, and engagement\nEnhance your emotional intelligence in order to connect more deeply with your team\nFoster a growth mindset to help your team embrace change and learning\nCreate a championship team by focusing on team culture and dynamic\nI encourage you to complete the activities and action steps in this course to put the ideas you're learning into practice immediately.\nIf you're ready to lead with authenticity and courage, join me in this course!",

Someone shouldn't call themselves an ally, though. Only the person who benefits from an ally’s work should award this designation. Consider the word ally to be a verb. It’s not who someone is, but what they do.\nAn ally is someone who:\nUses their power and status...\nTo support and advocate for...\nSomeone who doesn’t share a key part of their identity. For example, male allies for women, white allies for People of Color, straight allies for LGBTQ+ individuals, and so on.\nIn this course, you will learn the unique roles allies and the people they serve (who I refer to as \"partners\") need to play to advance inclusion and equity at your company.\nIn section 1, you'll be introduced to the concept of allyship, why it matters, and what makes for the best ally partnerships between people across difference\nIn section 2, you'll do the necessary inner work required for successful ally partnerships, including checking your bias and leveraging your privilege for good\nIn section 3, you'll learn strategies for connecting and communicating across difference\nIn section 4, you'll learn how to navigate tough conversations and how to lay the groundwork for ongoing, systemic change\nIn section 5, you'll learn about the specific actions allies and partners take\nAnd in section 6 you'll receive a quick summary of what was covered and encouragement to continue this work moving forward\nThis course comes with an Allyship Playbook with reflection exercises, tools, and assessments you can use to help you in your ally partnership. Use this playbook as many times as you need for different ally relationships, whether you're in the role of the ally or the partner. We also included comprehensive course notes with lots of great resources and additional materials to help you learn more about allyship.\nThere is no time like the present to start working towards a fairer, more inclusive world through allyship, so enroll today!",

How to manage team conflict with Learoy Tonight will provide you with the skills and knowledge to understand what drives culture and what you can do to create and foster the one that's right for you.\nIf you thought you were living in a world where conflict never exists, well I'm about to burst your bubble, because it does. If you already knew that but thought, 'Hey, my team members are adults – they'll figure it out themselves', then guess what? They won't.\nThe reality is, when you avoid conflict, it doesn't go away. It just bubbles under the surface, festers and creates divides. Between two individuals, it can likely become a situation whereby each person recruits on either side. This causes rifts across the whole team. In most cases, if you don't deal with it early, you'll be managing many of the symptoms before you ever get to the real cause.\nEach lecture in this course has been carefully selected for you to explore how to implement relevant and meaningful strategies to support you as a leader and culture driver now and in the future.\nThis course will provide you with many tips and tricks you can utilize inside and out of your workplace, it will encourage and motivate you to really understand and support the environment you're trying to create.\nLearoy Tonight is a fresh business with interesting and modern ideas towards education. Many people take part in creating these courses – from subject matter experts, to researchers and designers – to ensure you are provided with the best learning experience and the most up to date information. We are excited about education and want to give you the opportunity to be the best you can be.\nThis course will take you approximately 30 to 45 minutes to complete and will cover ways you can tackle conflict head on, and embrace positive team conflict at work.

Here are three reasons why this one is different\n\n\nReason #1: Tactics, not just strategies\nMost courses about virtual teams focus on high-level strategies and theories.\nVery few actually give you the tactics that you need to implement those strategies.\nIn this course, I'll show you how to apply the management tactics to your own situation. You'll get step-by-step techniques and scripts that will save you a lot of time in managing your virtual team.\nIn other words, you will get answers to both those questions:\n-What do I need to do?\n-How do I do it?\nMoreover, every video also has a “Summary of Actions\" slide at the end that summarizes the course lecture for you, and tells you exactly what you need to do as a next step. Basically, you'll learn everything about virtual team management in simple steps.\n\n\nReason #2: Proven Science-based Research\nFor the course, I did a ton of science-based research about powerful psychological and productivity studies in the areas of influence and management.\nSome of the research references include studies from the Harvard Business School, Kelley School of  Business, and McKinsey Global Institute.\nI also reference studies from international bestselling books such as “Influence: The Science of Persuasion,\" “Made to Stick,\" and “The Tipping Point,\" among others.\nI've tested the findings from those references myself and selected what works and what doesn't in virtual teams.\nSo you will get the absolute best of the best concepts that work for you and your team.\n\n\nReason #3: Practical insights that work (not just theory)\nI've been managing virtual teams for over 15 years, both as an entrepreneur and as a program manager.\nIn fact, I still work as a remote leader, and my full-time job is to manage virtual teams across the world to deliver highly complex projects (note: I work for Cisco Systems, but all views are my own and not those of Cisco).\nUnlike most courses that are taught by professors who have studied this space from a purely theoretical view, you'll be getting a unique perspective on how to manage people remotely from someone who does this for a living.\n\n\nIn short, the course will help you:\nCommunicate more effectively and build trust with your team\nStop worrying about being caught up in pointless day-to-day details\nSave valuable time spent on useless meetings and back & forth emails\nChoose the right technology tools and techniques for effective team collaboration\n\nInfluence  your team to be accountable for getting tasks accomplished\n\n\nNOTE for Project Management Professional (PMP) certification holders\nThis course qualifies for 3 Professional Development Units (PDUs) under the Project Management Institute's (PMI's) \"Education\" requirement. After you're done with the course, you will get a \"Certificate of Completion\" from Udemy, which you can use as evidence for PMI. All 3 hours can be claimed under the \"Leadership\" category.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Testimonials:\n★★★★★ \"I've been managing virtual teams for three years and still found some great gems in this course! I especially liked the first three modules (Communication, Behavior Change, and Persuasion) as well as the Trust module. They added some theory and words to tactics that I'd been using in the past, and condensed some useful tips into easy actions - like the trust formula and the \"good\" way to answer a question.\" - Nina Wroniak\n★★★★★ \"I'm doing my MBA online, and although group projects feature prominently, the university gave no guidance on how to conduct virtual teamwork. I'm really glad to have taken Hassan's course, and have recommended it to other students in my program to make our group work more productive. \" - Astrid Tiefholz\n★★★★★ \"This course was great because it really explained the evidence behind the tips he was giving. Each section was developed in a clear way and a clear connection to the larger goal. I am excited to implement the things I’ve learned on the team I work with.\" - Joy Anderson\n\n\n\n\n30 Day Money Back Guarantee\nIf you are not satisfied with the course for any reason, you may return the course within 30 days of the purchase date.\n\n\nReady to Enroll?\nClick on the \"Buy Now\" or \"Enroll Now\" button in the top right corner of this page and start learning how to effectively manage and influence your virtual team today.\n\n\nCPE (Continuing Professional Education)\nLearning Objectives\nRecognize the different levels of the Pyramid of Communication.\nUnderstand the four main power principles of behavior change in virtual teams.\nList and explain Robert Cialdini's six principles of influence.\nRecognize the best practices for scheduling virtual meetings.\nDefine the formula for building trust in virtual teams.\nDescribe email tactics that help get things done.\nFor additional information, including refunds and complaints, please see Udemy Terms of Use, which is linked from the footer of this page.\nFor more information regarding administrative policies, please contact our support using the Help and Support link at the bottom of this page.",

      "description": "Giving employees or team members feedback is an essential skill for every manager or team leader. If you do this well, your team members will perform well. Their success is your success. That is the purpose of this course.\nFeedback should be a primary learning activity, welcomed as an opportunity for growth by the recipient. Unfortunately, very often feedback is viewed as punishment, a source of anxiety that inhibits one's ability to learn. The purpose of this course is to help you develop the skill of giving feedback in a way that reduces anxiety and maximizes the opportunity for learning and continuous improvement on the part of the individual.\nThis course is intended to be very concise and direct, focused solely on this important skill of both giving and receiving feedback.\n\"This is a fantastic course, as a refresher for someone like me, or for anyone new to the subject. It brought back many of the lessons I had forgotten. This is a vital skill for any manager, so take this course and gain the wisdom and knowledge that Larry has to offer. He shares everything you need to know. You won't be disappointed!\"  James Steele\n\"As a self employed person, my business rests on the way I interact with people. Lawrence's descriptions of common interpersonal problems which impact business (and personal lives) ring true. The course is well produced and thought through and the delivery is engaging.\" Eve Williams MMus\n\"Great and the focus early on about having courage to speak up and 'straight talk' is brilliant. Have courage people.\" Stefan Bard\n\"Miller's course provides positive perspectives and strategy on what many managers view as a difficult and sometimes unpleasant part of their job. Making feedback a positive component of employee development and improvement, and positioning it as a collaborative, data-driven process should help any manager with developing themselves and their team.\" Patrick Francis",

      "description": "This course is not like anything else out there. 80-90% of the material will cover leadership, organizational culture, and best practices for leading and implementing projects. If you only want to learn process mapping, this might not be the course for you.\nLeadership, building influence, and learning how to work with others effectively are the core of real and sustainable process improvement. Thus 80% of the course focuses here. The remaining 10-20% covers diagramming techniques because if you don't get the culture and leadership skills right, you won't succeed in process improvement. I've built this course to reflect life.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWhen was the last time that someone wanted to pay you more for doing the same thing? Never.\nThe problem with being someone who maintains the status quo is that you aren't delivering value to your organization.  If you want to earn more and grow faster, you need to find ways to identify problems and then lead teams to implement solutions.\nThis course will transform your role and teach you how to identify opportunities, understand them fully, work together with your team to create solutions, and then implement them.\nThis course will teach you how to deliver value to your organization so your company will be thrilled to pay you even more.\nBusiness Process Improvement (BPI) is a critical skill that is always in demand.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWhat will I learn in this course?\nThis course is designed to teach you how to:\nAnalyze problems and effectively implement solutions by conducting process interviews.\nMaster the soft skills and influence dynamics critical to project success.\nHow to diagram processes,\nConduct process interviews,\nReview procedures,\nIdentify solutions,\nImplement solutions,\nImplement controls in your processes.\nCourse Sections: (over 5.5 hours of content!)\nWelcome- Business Process Improvement\nLaunching a Business Process Improvement Initiative\nStakeholder Management\n4.

I've watched an endless number of webinars, read most of the relevant books on the subject, and networked with many other professionals in the area.\nI then blended the best parts from each of these sources to make the content for this course.\nThe most exciting thing that I've discovered is that everyone has what it takes to learn this in-demand skill. Even better, I'm just like you, not a consultant or armchair thought leader. I work as an employee in organizations to identify and drive real and measurable change. Everything I teach is based on practicality.\nJoin me as I cover everything you need to know and walk you through two real-world examples of process improvement projects.\nIn this course, I provide many custom-created downloadable resources to aid your learning experience and to help you in your career.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWhy Am I Teaching This Course…\nI have developed expertise & leadership in the process improvement space at various public & private equity-backed companies over 10 years. I am a certified PMP (Project Management Professional)- the highest credential in the field.\nI have completed in-depth research on current methodologies and borrowed each approach's best pieces.\nI am passionate about helping other professionals improve their processes and work lives.\nWhat This Course Is…\nA strong understanding of the process mapping tools and techniques available today.\nA process investigation-driven approach to solving problems.\nA tool that allows you to make an impact at your job immediately.\nWhat This Course Is Not…\nThis is not a primer course designed to upsell you.\nThis course is the complete package you need to begin making an immediate impact.\nThis is not a course focused on statistical approaches.\nStatistical approaches distract from the human side of process improvements.\nUtilization of alternative methods of measuring problems and tracking results.\nStatistical requirements lead people to overlook problems where the data does not fit into the specific model and boxes cannot be checked.\nThis is not BPM. BPM is a much more technical approach that requires understanding a complex model.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDownloadable Resources Available with This Course:\nA complete and in-depth business simulation with exercises explained.\nUdemy Excel Workbook: includes separate sheets for all of the individual resources listed below.\n7 process improvement tools\n10 Commandments of Continuous Improvement\nDetailed Process Map\nDMAIC\nFishbone\nPDAC\nProcess Interview Checklist\nProcess Mapping Tools\nRelationship Map\nSMART\nStakeholder diagram\nSwimlane\n\n\nAnd TONS more!

Highly recommended for entry-mid career folks who want to learn the details of how successful managers in their companies get things done!\"\nKim Hamlin- 5 Stars\nI've been naturally drawn to process improvement for my whole career - sometimes successfully, and sometimes not so much, depending on how well I could get everyone on board. I'm heading into a job where I'll be doing this full-time. This course was the perfect resource to pull all of my experiential learning back into focus and provide a great set of tools and information to help position any process improvement initiative for success. If you are experienced or a complete beginner, this is a really well-organized resource for learning or continuous improvement of your process improvement toolbox. GREAT course!!!\nEthel Walker, MBA, CPCC- 5 Stars\nThe course was very well organized, and I learned a lot. A real value add. I appreciated the delivery approach in giving face time to introduce the topics and to wrap up the topics with a walk-through of the worksheet. I especially appreciated the walk-through on the actual LinkedIn screens so that I could translate the instruction to the LinkedIn application. Nice job.",

      "description": "How effective are you at processing information from your environment and using emotion to drive your decision making?\nHow rational and objective are you in problem solving and decision making?\nFrom the decision to rise in the morning to the decision go to close your eyes and go to sleep at night, you are constantly solving problems and making decisions.  Throughout each day you are confronted with a variety of problems and decisions that require a rational, thoughtful response underpinned with good emotional awareness.\nThis course is about proactively working towards solutions that help you to make timely decisions as you solve work problems to bring value to your company and your customers. In addition, the skills, processes and tools taught in this course can bring value to other aspects of your life.\nGood decision making means that you can grasp problems and mindfully devise effective solutions. It means that you can deal realistically with situations as they arise and manage emotions and impulses that may disrupt effective decision making.\nBoth creativity and mindfulness form a basic part of solving problems along with intuition. Intuition is a decision making process that is often overlooked in business. Applied in a mindful way, and used well, it can add richness and speed to developing realistic solutions to problems.   Critical thinking to work in an emotionally intelligent manner forms a major component of the skills of decision making to overcome unconscious bias.  This is covered in detail within the course.\nThe course is based around the Decision Making component of Reuven Bar-On's comprehensive assessment of emotional intelligence.  You do not need any knowledge of this model or about emotional intelligence to take the course.  (It is important for me to stress that I have no commercial affiliation with Reuven Bar-on and the EQ-i 2.0 assessment.)\nThis course is a standalone course for anyone interested in understanding how to solve problems and make good quality decisions more effectively.  It forms part of a comprehensive course that explores emotional intelligence in more depth.\nThe course covers the ways to stimulate creativity and looks in detail at the fashionable business technique of mindfulness.  Within this course, mindfulness is applied to decision making.\nYou'll receive all the information that you need and will be coached using loads of practical hints that you can use straight away.\nThe course is made up of a series of lectures and contains course notes. There are a series of interactive practical activities that involve some interaction with other people and some reflection.\nThe course material makes up a one to two day workshop so is equivalent to 8 -12 hour's training. It forms part of our advanced emotional intelligence course endorsed by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\nBy completing this course, you will be able to\nIdentify how to make better decisions through critical thinking and creative problem solving\n\n\nRecognise and remove barriers to creativity to foster an innovative work environment producing practical solutions\n\n\nDiscover ways to move beyond familiar ways of thinking and seeing the world\n\n\nInvestigate new ways of listening, leading, responding, and innovating\n\n\nUse mindfulness to evaluate all attributes of the different options available and make more informed decisions\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE - This course is NOT for you if you are not prepared to work through the practical activities that make up a fundamental part of the course.  Your decision making cannot be developed just by watching the video lectures.  It requires you to do some reflective thinking, to get some feedback and to discuss your development with others.  I'm afraid that you won't get the best from the course unless you are prepared to do this.\nThere are EIGHT practical activities included within the course that are designed to help you to develop your decision making capabilities.  These are\nReflecting about the Emotional Intelligence Course\nAssess your Decision Making\nUnderstanding your Reality\nProblem Solving with SCAMPER\nImpulses and Gratification\nMindfulness: What Affects your Energy?\nAn Exercise in Critical Thinking\nLearning Review\nFor example, by completing the practical activity \"Problem Solving with SCAMPER\" you will enable to come up with new ideas when you're trying to develop or improve a product or service.\nThis course is being continually refined and updated to ensure it remains current and relevant.\n\n\nThe course contains a series of Lightbulb Moments resource cards, which have been created to provide you with handy reminders of key points around topics covered within the course.\nAll PDFs can be completed online and are Section 508 / ADA Accessibility compliant.\nAll videos are High Definition recorded in 1080p.\nAll videos have grammatically correct English captions.\nLatest update - May 2025",

      "description": "The Covid pandemic forced almost every company to require or encourage remote work. It is becoming increasingly clear that this change in where we do our work is becoming the norm. One of the great miracles of the twenty-first century is the declining importance of borders and distance. The internet has made knowledge universal and is enabling talent to be developed in every corner of the globe and country without prejudice. This means that any company can bring talent together in virtual teams to develop products and plans and accomplish shared goals regardless of their location. But, enabling these teams to work well together is a skill that every manager needs to develop to succeed in the new world of virtual collaboration.\nLeading Virtual or Remote Teams is designed to build the skills of virtual collaboration and teamwork. It covers issues around the use of virtual meeting technology, including a comprehensive survey of meeting software, user advice and recommendations. But, the primary focus of this course is on the human side, the skills of facilitating and participating in virtual teams. While it is important for all team leaders and facilitators to develop good meeting facilitation skills, there are unique challenges when team members are not co-located. This course addresses those challenges and provides advice based on the available research and the instructor's many years of experience facilitating virtual meetings.",

      "description": "Explore how your emotional intelligence influences how you perform, build relationships and make good quality decisions based on emotions.\n\n\nWhat is it to be the best human being that you can be?\nEmotional intelligence is an aspect of you as a whole person affecting your work life and your personal life.\nYour emotional intelligence is your ability to combine your thinking with your feelings in order to build good quality relationships and to make good authentic decisions. It is managing who you are in the moment to meet your emotional needs through conscious choice and is fundamental to leading a full, rich and rewarding life.\nEmotional intelligence is different from IQ - cognitive intelligence, and offers a different perspective on success and performance at work.  There are many parts to emotional intelligence - it predicts effectiveness and can be changed and developed.\nResearch suggests that emotional intelligence and cognitive intelligence (IQ) are unconnected: you can have a high level of emotional intelligence but a low level of cognitive intelligence, and vice versa.\nYour emotional intelligence is your responsibility!  How you react and respond to events is governed by your emotional intelligence.  You can work to develop your emotional intelligence, but this is not easy.\n\nThis course explores little known ways that emotional intelligence can be used in the workplace by investigating what it is and what it is not. It covers the main models of emotional intelligence and what they mean but more importantly how they can be practically applied at work.\nThe course resolves any confusion you may have around some of the terminology used in various emotional intelligence courses, such as what is the difference between EI and EQ?  You'll get to understand why EI is a broader term that covers emotional intelligence in much more depth.\nPeople often talk about positive and negative emotions.  This is not that helpful as emotions cannot really be labelled in that way.  The course also covers the myths around positive and negative emotions and why this terminology is not appropriate when working to understand emotions and emotional intelligence in the workplace.\nThe course investigates the advantages and disadvantages of emotional intelligence, ways it can be improved and some do's and don'ts of working with emotional intelligence in the workplace.  It will test your emotional intelligence!\nChanging the way that you work with your emotions and working with your emotional intelligence is not easy.  This course will give you some insights BUT developing your emotional intelligence will take you time and a lot of effort, and even then you are not going to get it right all the time!!  Emotional intelligence is about improving performance, engagement and well being in a sustainable way, so that it sticks.\nBy completing this course, you will be able to\nIdentify what emotional intelligence is and what it is not\nExplain what emotional intelligence is and why it is important\nExplain the difference between Emotional Quotient (EQ) and Emotional Intelligence (EI)\nDescribe how emotional intelligence differences from other intelligences\nRecognise how and why emotions are important\nList some emotional intelligence competencies that can be developed\nThe course contains narrated videos, quizzes and some fun material to download - including a series of complementary resource cards.\nThe course contains some insights from one of the key researchers in the field of emotional intelligence - Dr. David Caruso from Yale University Center for Emotional Intelligence.  He shares his views on the subject and some insights into emotional intelligence as an ability.\nThe course material makes up part of a one day workshop endorsed by the Institute of Leadership and Management.  It is equivalent to about 8 hour's CPD  training.\nPLEASE NOTE - This course is NOT for you if you are not prepared to work through the practical activities that make up a fundamental part of the course.  Emotional intelligence cannot be developed by learning some techniques through watching a few video lectures.  The course requires you to do some reflective thinking, to get some feedback and to discuss your development with others.  I'm afraid that you won't get the best from the course unless you are prepared to do this.\nThis course is being continually refined and updated to ensure it remains current and relevant.\nThere are THREE interactive practical activities included within the course that are designed to help you to develop your emotional intelligence.\n1. Reflecting About This Course\n2. Assessing your Emotional Intelligence\n3. Three Good Things\nThese activities involve some interaction with other people and some reflection outside of the course.  They are designed to help you find out how you are using your emotional intelligence in the workplace, how you view your emotional intelligence and how others view your emotional intelligence.   You will be guided on what and how you need to change.  The emotional brain learns from doing things and through activity.  Repetition and rehearsal over weeks will embed in changes.\n\n\nEvery learner taking the course has the chance to win a valuable prize, access to podcasts, a magazine on emotional intelligence and access to many other resources to develop emotional intelligence.\n\n\nThe course contains a series of Lightbulb Moments resource cards, which have been created to provide you with handy reminders of key points around topics covered within the course.\nAll PDFs can be completed online and are Section 508 / ADA Accessibility compliant.\nAll videos are recorded in High Definition 1080p.\nAll videos have grammatically correct English captions.\nLatest update - October 2025\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nRecognise the importance of understanding the emotions that you experience\nDifferentiate between emotions and feelings\nAscertain the data or information in emotions and ways to use this effectively\nExamine how to practise and learn how to develop emotional intelligence\nDiscover how to improve your relationships and performance by gaining insights into the emotions of other people\nIdentify why you react to situations with a particular focus on how your feelings and emotions impact upon your performance\nFor additional information, including refunds and complaints, please see Udemy Terms of Use, which is linked from the footer of this page.",

      "description": "This engaging course outlines the concept of Emotional Intelligence, explains why it is important for personal and professional development, and describes how to apply the ideas to assess and improve your own confidence and performance by developing your EI.\nAs the different aspects are explained via our video lectures, each section is supported by downloadable exercises and other resources to help you revise and consolidate the learning.\nWe all know what intellectual intelligence is, and we also know it can be misleading because that sort of intelligence doesn’t accurately reflect how well someone functions and manages at work or in life.\nWe also all know of highly intelligent people who don't handle themselves very well; they are not good in social relationships, for example, or that have difficulty communicating.\nJust as important as conventional IQ – the sort of intelligence that gets measured in those tests many of us did in school – is Emotional Intelligence.\nEmotional Intelligence is a set of aptitudes which determine how well you handle yourself in life, and how well you are able to understand and get on with others.\nIn an ever-more complex and demanding world, technical expertise – knowing how to do your job – is not enough. We are all experiencing higher demand, more stress, and more fluid working relationships. Now we can all do with being more proactive, engaging with others, and learning how to manage our own energy levels, our relationships, and other people.\nThe skills of Emotional Intelligence show you how to do these things and how to develop the insight and confidence to handle your own and others' expectations and emotions effectively.\nThis course features easily learned elements supported by practical exercises, all clearly explained by Barry Winbolt, lecturer and psychotherapist, based on his 30 years' experience of helping people to improve workplace relationships and performance in many different settings and cultures.\nIn a series of engaging videos, he explains the strengths of Emotional Intelligence and why we should develop them in ourselves and others. He shows you how to make the skills part of your repertoire. He then provides a comprehensive toolkit for creating positive working relationships, and managing yourself, as well as the increasing demands of the workplace.\nBy the end of this course, you'll have a better understanding of Emotional Intelligence, which will help you become more confident in your decisions and your working relationships. It will place you ahead of the pack; Emotional Intelligence is a key component in effective management and leadership.\nEmotional Intelligence is based on a set of learnable skills. It is backed up by a huge body of research which shows that these skills can help you:\nGet on better with others\nCommunicate more effectively\nMake better decisions\nHandle stress and pressure\nMotivate yourself\nReduce anxiety\nManage others more effectively.\nYou’ll also learn why EI is now seen as the defining characteristic among successful managers and leaders.",
