Well today, Generative Adversarial Networks are making the impossible possible.\nDive into this course where I’ll show you how easily we can take the fundamentals from my High Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks course and build on this to accomplish this impressive feat known as Super-resolution. Not only will you be able to train a Generator to magnify an image to 4 times it’s original size (that’s 16 times the number of pixel!), but it will take relatively little effort on our end.\nJust as in the first course, we’ll use Python and TensorFlow 2.0 along with Keras to build and train our convolutional neural networks. And since training our networks will require a ton of computational power, we’ll once again use Google CoLab to connect to a free Cloud TPU. This will allow us to complete the training in just a few days without spending anything on hardware!\nIf this sounds enticing, take a few minutes to watch the free preview of the “Results!” lesson. I have no doubt that you will come away impressed.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Deep Learning Foundation course by Uplatz.\n\n\nDeep Learning is fundamentally a type of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge. Deep Learning can basically be considered as a subset of Machine Learning, which on the other hand is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is a general term that refers to techniques that enable computers to mimic human behavior. Machine Learning represents a set of algorithms trained on data that make all of this possible.\nDeep learning is an important element of data science, which includes statistics and predictive modeling. It is extremely beneficial to data scientists who are tasked with collecting, analyzing and interpreting large amounts of data; deep learning makes this process faster and easier. At its simplest, deep learning can be thought of as a way to automate predictive analytics. While traditional machine learning algorithms are linear, deep learning algorithms are stacked in a hierarchy of increasing complexity and abstraction.\nDeep Learning, on the other hand, is just a type of Machine Learning, inspired by the structure of a human brain. Deep learning algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structure. To achieve this, deep learning uses a multi-layered structure of algorithms called neural networks.\nThe design of the neural network is based on the structure of the human brain. Just as we use our brains to identify patterns and classify different types of information, neural networks can be taught to perform the same tasks on data. The individual layers of neural networks can also be thought of as a sort of filter that works from gross to subtle, increasing the likelihood of detecting and outputting a correct result. The human brain works similarly. Whenever we receive new information, the brain tries to compare it with known objects. The same concept is also used by deep neural networks.\n\n\nDeep Learning Methodology\nComputer programs that use deep learning go through much the same process as the toddler learning to identify the dog. Each algorithm in the hierarchy applies a nonlinear transformation to its input and uses what it learns to create a statistical model as output. Iterations continue until the output has reached an acceptable level of accuracy. The number of processing layers through which data must pass is what inspired the label deep. Deep learning simulates the human brain, enabling systems that learn to identify objects and perform complex tasks with increasing accuracy, and this is all without human intervention.\n\n\nDeep learning is an advanced part of machine learning in which multi-layered neural networks - modeled to work like the human brain and learn from large amounts of data. Within each layer of the neural network, deep learning algorithms perform calculations and make predictions repeatedly, progressively 'learning' and gradually improving the accuracy of the outcome over time.\nIn the same way that the human brain absorbs and processes information entering the body through the five senses, deep learning ingests information from multiple data sources and analyzes it in real time.\n\n\nApplications of Deep Learning\nDeep learning drives many artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. Deep learning technology lies behind everyday products and services (such as digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, and credit card fraud detection) as well as emerging technologies (such as self-driving cars).\nDeep learning is commonly used across apps in computer vision, conversational AI and recommendation systems. Computer vision apps use deep learning to gain knowledge from digital images and videos. Conversational AI apps help computers understand and communicate through natural language. Recommendation systems use images, language, and a user’s interests to offer meaningful and relevant search results and services.\nDeep learning has led to many recent breakthroughs in AI such as Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo, self-driving cars, intelligent voice assistants and many more. With the advanced GPU-accelerated deep learning frameworks, researchers and data scientists can significantly speed up deep learning training, that could otherwise take days and weeks to just hours and days. When models are ready for deployment, developers can rely on GPU-accelerated inference platforms for the cloud, embedded device or self-driving cars, to deliver high-performance, low-latency inference for the most computationally-intensive deep neural networks.\nDeep learning differs from traditional machine learning techniques in that they can automatically learn representations from data such as images, video or text, without introducing hand-coded rules or human domain knowledge. Their highly flexible architectures can learn directly from raw data and can increase their predictive accuracy when provided with more data.\n\n\nUplatz provides this comprehensive course on Deep Learning Foundation to help you get started with Deep Learning. This Deep Learning course covers an extensive explanation of the Deep learning concepts, introduction to neural networks, the Deep learning models, advanced Deep learning models, and the platforms & libraries used in Deep learning.\nIf you are aiming to become a Deep Learning Engineer or a Machine Learning Architect, then this Deep Learning Foundation course is an appropriate course for you. This course will also help you understand better the implementation of Deep learning in practical scenarios as well as it will form the basis of Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow courses.\n\n\nKey Benefits of learning Deep Learning and its Career Impact\n\n\n1. High Demand Across Industries\nDeep Learning skills are in high demand across tech, healthcare, finance, automotive, retail, and more. Companies need experts who can build models for image recognition, NLP, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and autonomous systems.\n2. Core to AI and Innovation\nDeep Learning powers cutting-edge AI applications such as self-driving cars, voice assistants, facial recognition, and generative AI.

      "description": "Artificial Intelligence has become prevalent recently. People across different disciplines are trying to apply AI to make their tasks a lot easier. For example, economists are using AI to predict future market prices to make a profit, doctors use AI to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign, meteorologists use AI to predict the weather, HR recruiters use AI to check the resume of applicants to verify if the applicant meets the minimum criteria for the job, etcetera. The impetus behind such ubiquitous use of AI is machine learning algorithms. For anyone who wants to learn ML algorithms but hasn’t gotten their feet wet yet, you are at the right place. The rudimental algorithm that every Machine Learning enthusiast starts with is a linear regression algorithm. Therefore, we shall do the same as it provides a base for us to build on and learn other ML algorithms.\nBefore knowing what is linear regression, let us get ourselves accustomed to regression. Regression is a method of modeling a target value based on independent predictors. This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out the cause and effect relationship between variables. Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\nWant to learn more about regression?

With the proper optimization of the models, it is possible to create mathematical representations of our data in order to extract the information that is hidden inside our database and use it for making inferences and predictions.\nA very powerful use of supervised machine learning is the calculation of feature importance, which makes us better understand the information behind data and allows us to reduce the dimensionality of our problem considering only the relevant information, discarding all the useless variables. A common approach for calculating feature importance is the SHAP technique.\nFinally, the proper optimization of a model is possible using some hyperparameter tuning techniques that make use of cross-validation.\nWith this course, you are going to learn:\nWhat supervised machine learning is\nWhat overfitting and underfitting are and how to avoid them\nThe difference between regression and classification models\nLinear models\nLinear regression\nLasso regression\nRidge regression\nElastic Net regression\nLogistic regression\nDecision trees\nNaive Bayes\nK-nearest neighbors\nSupport Vector Machines\nLinear SVM\nNon-linear SVM\nFeedforward neural networks\nEnsemble models\nBias-variance tradeoff\nBagging and Random Forest\nBoosting and Gradient Boosting\nVoting\nStacking\nPerformance metrics\nRegression\nRoot Mean Squared Error\nMean Absolute Error\nMean Absolute Percentage Error\nClassification\nConfusion matrix\nAccuracy and balanced accuracy\nPrecision\nRecall\nROC Curve and the area under it\nMulti-class metrics\nFeature importance\nHow to calculate feature importance according to a model\nSHAP technique for calculating feature importance according to every model\nRecursive Feature Elimination for dimensionality reduction\nHyperparameter tuning\nk-fold cross-validation\nGrid search\nRandom search\nAll the lessons of this course start with a brief introduction and end with a practical example in Python programming language and its powerful scikit-learn library.

      "description": "Let me tell you my story. I graduated with my Ph. D. in computational nano-electronics but I have been working as a data scientist in most of my career. My undergrad and graduate major was in electrical engineering (EE) and minor in Physics. After first year of my job in Intel as a \"yield analysis engineer\" (now they changed the title to Data Scientist), I literally broke into data science by taking plenty of online classes. I took numerous interviews, completed tons of projects and finally I broke into data science. I consider this as one of very important achievement in my life. Without having a degree in computer science (CS) or a statistics I got my second job as a Data Scientist. Since then I have been working as a Data Scientist.\n\n\nIf I can break into data science without a CS or Stat degree I think you can do it too!\n\n\nIn this class allow me sharing my journey towards data science and let me help you breaking into data science. Of course it is not fair to say that after taking one course you will be a data scientist. However we need to start some where. A good start and a good companion can take us further.\n\n\nWe will definitely discuss Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sk-learn and all other most popular libraries out there. In this course we will also try to de-mystify important complex concepts of machine learning. Most of the lectures will be accompanied by code and practical examples. I will also use “white board” to explain the concepts which cannot be explained otherwise. A good data scientist should use white board for ideation, problem solving. I also want to mention that this course is not designed towards explaining all the math needed to “practice” machine learning. Also, I will be continuously upgrading the contents of this course to make sure that all the latest tools and libraries are taught here. Stay tuned!",

Big data engineers provide organizations with analyses that help them assess their performance, identify market demographics, and predict upcoming changes and market trends.\n\n\nAzure Databricks:\nAzure Databricks is a data analytics platform optimized for the Microsoft Azure cloud services platform. Azure Databricks offers three environments for developing data intensive applications: Databricks SQL, Databricks Data Science & Engineering, and Databricks Machine Learning.\n\n\nAnomlay detection:\nAnomaly detection (aka outlier analysis) is a step in data mining that identifies data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a dataset’s normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch, or potential opportunities, for instance a change in consumer behavior. Machine learning is progressively being used to automate anomaly detection.\n\n\nData Lake House:\nA data lakehouse is a data solution concept that combines elements of the data warehouse with those of the data lake. Data lakehouses implement data warehouses' data structures and management features for data lakes, which are typically more cost-effective for data storage .\n\n\nExplainable AI:\nExplainable AI is artificial intelligence in which the results of the solution can be understood by humans. It contrasts with the concept of the \"black box\" in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.\n\n\nSpark structured streaming:\nStructured Streaming is a scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine built on the Spark SQL engine. .In short, Structured Streaming provides fast, scalable, fault-tolerant, end-to-end exactly-once stream processing without the user having to reason about streaming.\n\n\nCI/CD Operation :\nCI and CD stand for continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment. In very simple terms, CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably.",

Companies worldwide are using Python to harvest insights from their data and gain a competitive edge.\nThe term used for extracting data from the web or internet is referred to as web scraping. You will Learn what web scraping is and how it can be achieved with the help of Python's beautiful soup library.\nWeb scraping is an important technique that is widely used as the first step in many workflows in data mining, information retrieval, and text-based machine learning.\nIn this course, Extracting Data from HTML with BeautifulSoup* you will gain the ability to build robust, maintainable web scraping solutions using the Beautiful Soup library in Python.\nBeautiful Soup is a pure Python library for extracting structured data from a website. It allows you to parse data from HTML and XML files. It acts as a helper module and interacts with HTML in a similar and better way as to how you would interact with a web page using other available developer tool.\n\n\nIn the time when the internet is rich with so much data, and apparently, data has become the new oil, web scraping has become even more important and practical to use in various applications. Web scraping deals with extracting or scraping the information from the website. Web scraping is also sometimes referred to as web harvesting or web data extraction. Copying text from a website and pasting it to your local system is also web scraping. However, it is a manual task. Generally, web scraping deals with extracting data automatically with the help of web crawlers. Web crawlers are scripts that connect to the world wide web using the HTTP protocol and allows you to fetch data in an automated manner.\nWhether you are a data scientist, engineer, or anybody who analyzes vast amounts of datasets, the ability to scrape data from the web is a useful skill to have. Let's say you find data from the web, and there is no direct way to download it, web scraping using Python is a skill you can use to extract the data into a useful form that can then be imported and used in various ways.",

It's the most preferred software for academicians and research professionals. However, most of the users of SPSS remain confined to the basic features of SPSS and end up doing what everyone else is doing. That's why you see most of the research articles report the most common statistical tests like correlation, regression, factor analysis, and some basic forms of group difference tests like ANOVA  and t-test. This devoids research to methodological diversity, and neither it appeals to a genuine pursuit of knowledge.\nThe purpose of the SPSS Powerclass is to take the knowledge of SPSS to the next level. This course offers in-depth coverage of advanced features of SPSS, like:\nAdvanced data import methods in SPSS\nHow to work with SPSS in Workbook mode?\nAdvanced Descriptive Statistics in SPSS\nRatio Statistics in SPSS\nTURF Analysis in SPSS\nAdvanced-Data Visualization in SPSS\nand many more!\nPedagogy:\nStep-by-step coverage offering an explanation of all options of a test\nCoverage of basics and underlying concepts in each test\nManual calculation of tests, wherever relevant offered\nProbelm-based teaching, where each test is explained by taking practical problems\nEasy to understand language.\nI am sure this course will help you in taking your SPSS skills to the next level!\nBecome a power user of SPSS!!\nJoin SPSS Powerclass today!!",

By using SSMA for Oracle, you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate database objects to SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure Synapse Analytics, and then migrate data to SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure Synapse Analytics. Note that you cannot migrate SYS and SYSTEM Oracle schemas.\n\n\nThese days lot of customers are looking to save on their technology costs. Adopting economical technologies and software that are equally capable and powerful to fulfil requirements is one of the ways to achieve cost optimization.\nDatabases are one of the tiers which customers spend a lot of money as part of license and support fees.

A substance in chemistry is defined as a type of matter with a fixed composition and distinct properties. These substances can be classified primarily into elements and compounds. Elements consist of only one type of atom and cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Examples include oxygen, hydrogen, and iron. Compounds, on the other hand, are made from two or more elements that are chemically bonded in fixed ratios, such as water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).\nThe behavior and interaction of substances are governed by their physical and chemical properties. Physical properties, like melting point, boiling point, density, and state of matter (solid, liquid, gas), do not change the identity of a substance. In contrast, chemical properties involve a substance's ability to undergo chemical reactions and transform into new substances. For instance, the ability of iron to rust when exposed to oxygen is a chemical property.\nmastering substances in chemistry requires a clear understanding of their types, properties, compositions, and interactions. This foundational knowledge not only helps in recognizing how matter is structured and behaves but also sets the stage for exploring more complex chemical processes and reactions that shape the natural and industrial world.",

      "description": "You just downloaded datasets online. They came in a zip file. The first thing you do after downloading it, you extract the data with your favorite unzipping software such as WinZip or WinRar. Then you proceed with reading the data in with your analysis software (hopefully R). OK! Where is he going with this, you may wonder.\nYou are starting a project in R and realize your files are scattered in different paths on your computer. Your immediate reflex is to open the folders involved (say with windows explorer) and proceed to gather those files in one place before starting R. Wait, what's wrong with that? Hold that thought.\nYou visit a website frequently. This website is full of data—numbers, downloadable documents, and pictures alike. It may or may not have occurred to you that you can access the data programmatically and visualize it differently. Perhaps you had ideas about it but didn’t know how to get it done. Hold this thought also.\nThere is nothing wrong with unzipping files with a WinZip or WinRar. Still, it can be beneficial to do unzip files within R. After downloading a dataset or any zip files; you can go directly into R and manage your files there before your analysis. You ever thought about unzipping, copying and pasting, deleting files within R? This course will show you examples of that.\nOne of the goals of this course is to implant in you the thought of scraping data with ease. I want you to think you can scrape data and visualize it differently and doing so promptly. I will show you the commonly used web scraping techniques in R.\nWith APIs, you go a step further than scraping. In this course, I teach you how to retrieve data using HTTR and jsonlite packages. Specifically, use the GET function to retrieve data and the POST function to update your account. All this without logging onto your account. I use the peer-to-peer lending platform Lending Club to showcase the use of an API. The API, therefore, allows you to interact with your account programmatically. Combining this with a scheduler can prove highly efficient. A well-thought-out algorithm can be automated and handle repetitive tasks that would otherwise be routine.\nThis course will also introduce you to the version control system Git. You will learn the power of R Studio combined with Git and GitHub. I teach how to keep different versions of your script with Git and push files, including R scripts, datasets, and other files to the GitHub platform. You will also learn how to revert to previous versions of your code if you make mistakes in later versions. When you master this, you will no longer have to save different versions of your scripts in your directory.\nTo become an efficient data analyst, you have to be skilled at one or more programming languages. Why not R? This course should also serve as a barometer. If you feel comfortable with the material in this course, you should understand most R scripts you will encounter.\nThis course will not teach you how to hack into servers. The intent here is not to sway you towards criminal activities.",

Access free GPUs and a huge repository of community-published data & code.\nKaggle is a platform where data scientists can compete in machine learning challenges. These challenges can be anything from predicting housing prices to detecting cancer cells. Kaggle has a massive community of data scientists who are always willing to help others with their data science problems. In addition to the competitions, Kaggle also has many tutorials and resources that can help you get started in machine learning.\nIf you are an aspiring data scientist, Kaggle is the best way to get started. Many companies will give offers to those who rank highly in their competitions. In fact, Kaggle may become your full-time job if you can hit one of their high rankings.\n\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\n\n\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\n\n\nWhat is Kaggle used for?\nKaggle is a website for sharing ideas, getting inspired, competing against other data scientists, learning new information and coding tricks, as well as seeing various examples of real-world data science applications.\n\n\nIs Kaggle free to use?\nDoes Kaggle cost anything? The Kaggle Services may be available at no cost or we may charge a monetary fee for using the Services.\n\n\nWhat are typical use cases for Kaggle?\nKaggle is best for businesses that have data that they feel needs to be analyzed. The most significant benefit of Kaggle is that these companies can easily find someone who knows how to work with their data, which makes solving the problem much easier than if they were trying to figure out what was wrong with their system themselves.\nWhat are some popular competitions on Kaggle?\nThere are many different types of competitions available on Kaggle. You can enter a contest in everything from predicting cancer cells in microscope images to analyzing satellite images for changes overtime on any given day.\nExamples include:\nPredicting car prices based on features such as horsepower and distance traveled\nPredicting voting patterns by state\nAnalyzing satellite images to see which countries have the most deforestation\n\n\nIs Kaggle good for beginners?\nDespite the differences between Kaggle and typical data science, Kaggle can still be a great learning tool for beginners. Each competition is self-contained. You don't need to scope your own project and collect data, which frees you up to focus on other skills.\n\n\nHow does Kaggle work?\nEvery competition on Kaggle has a dataset associated with it and a goal you must reach (i.e., predict housing prices or detect cancer cells). You can access the data as often as possible and build your prediction model. Still, once you submit your solution, you cannot use it to make future submissions.\nThis ensures that everyone is starting from the same point when competing against one another, so there are no advantages given to those with more computational power than others trying to solve the problem.\nCompetitions are separated into different categories depending on their complexity level, how long they take, whether or not prize money is involved, etc., so users with varying experience levels can compete against each other in the same arena.\n\n\nWhat type of skills do you need to compete on Kaggle?\nYou should be comfortable with data analysis and machine learning if you're looking to get involved in competitions.\nData science is a very broad term that can be interpreted in many ways depending on who you talk to. But suppose we're talking specifically about competitive data science like what you see on Kaggle. In that case, it's about solving problems or gaining insights from data.\nIt doesn't necessarily involve machine learning, but you will need to understand the basics of machine learning to get started. There are no coding prerequisites either, though I would recommend having some programming experience in Python or R beforehand.\nThat being said, if competitive data science sounds interesting to you and you want to get started right away, we have a course for that on Duomly!\n\n\nHow does one enter a competition on Kaggle?\nThe sign-up process for entering a competition is very straightforward: Most competitions ask competitors to submit code that meets specific criteria at the end of each challenge. However, there may be times when they want competitors to explain what algorithms they used or provide input about how things work.\n\n\nWhat are some Kaggle competitions I could consider solving?\nSuppose you want to solve one of their business-related challenges. In that case, you'll need to have a good understanding of machine learning and what models work well with certain types of data. Suppose you want to do one of their custom competition. You'll need to have a background in computer science to code in the language associated with the problem.\n\n\nHow do Kaggle competitions make money?\nMany companies on Kaggle are looking for solutions, so there is always a prize attached to each competition. If your solution is strong enough, you can win a lot of money!\nSome of these competitions are just for fun or learning purposes but still award winners with cash or merchandise prizes.\n\n\nWhat tools should I use to compete on Kaggle?\nThe most important tool that competitors rely on every day is the Python programming language. It's used by over 60% of all data scientists, so it has an extremely large community behind it. It's also extremely robust and has many different packages available for data manipulation, preprocessing, exploration to get you started.\nTensorFlow is another popular tool that machine learning enthusiasts use to solve Kaggle competitions. It allows quick prototyping of models to get the best possible results. Several other tools are used in addition to Python and Tensorflow, such as R (a statistical programming language), Git (version control), and Bash (command-line interface). Still, I'll let you research those on your own!\n\n\nWhat is the main benefit of using Kaggle to solve problems?\nKaggle aims to give you the tools necessary to become a world-class data scientist. They provide you with access to real data in real-time so you can practice solving problems similar to what companies face around the world.\nThey're constantly updating their site for you to have the most up-to-date learning.\n\n\nHow would a beginner benefit from using Kaggle?\nKaggle gives beginners a way to learn more about machine learning and will allow them to utilize their skills no matter where they're at.\nUsing Kaggle allows beginners to see what's going on in the industry, keep up with trends, and become an expert with their tools as things change.\nIt also offers free training material for those just starting out or those who want a refresher course on specific concepts or who need help getting started.\n\n\nWho would be interested in using Kaggle?\nWith many tutorials and datasets readily available, Machine Learning enthusiasts would be very interested in Kaggle.\nIt is an excellent place to learn more about machine learning, practice what they've learned, and compete with other data scientists.

Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed upon the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that has resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing a variety of different tools for programmers suited for many different tasks.\nDo you know data science needs will create 11.5 million job openings by 2026?\nDo you know the average salary is $100.000 for data science careers!\n\nData Science Careers Are Shaping The Future\nData science experts are needed in almost every field, from government security to dating apps.

This course is expertly designed to teach everyone from complete beginners, right through to professionals ( as a refresher).\n\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\n\n\nWhy we use a Python programming language in Machine learning?\nPython is a general-purpose, high-level, and multi-purpose programming language. The best thing about Python is, it supports a lot of today’s technology including vast libraries for Twitter, data mining, scientific calculations, designing, back-end server for websites, engineering simulations, artificial learning, augmented reality and what not! Also, it supports all kinds of App development.\n\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning a-z is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\n\nDoes Machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning data science without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it\n\n\nWhat is the best language for machine learning?\nPython is the most used language in machine learning using python. Engineers writing machine learning systems often use Jupyter Notebooks and Python together. Jupyter Notebooks is a web application that allows experimentation by creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and more. Machine learning involves trial and error to see which hyperparameters and feature engineering choices work best. It's useful to have a development environment such as Python so that you don't need to compile and package code before running it each time. Python is not the only language choice for machine learning. Tensorflow is a popular framework for developing neural networks and offers a C++ API. There is a complete machine learning framework for C# called ML. NET. Scala or Java are sometimes used with Apache Spark to build machine learning systems that ingest massive data sets.\n\n\nWhat is a Kaggle?\nKaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners.\nHow does Kaggle work?\nEvery competition on Kaggle has a dataset associated with it and a goal you must reach (i.e., predict housing prices or detect cancer cells). You can access the data as often as possible and build your prediction model. Still, once you submit your solution, you cannot use it to make future submissions.\nThis ensures that everyone is starting from the same point when competing against one another, so there are no advantages given to those with more computational power than others trying to solve the problem.\nCompetitions are separated into different categories depending on their complexity level, how long they take, whether or not prize money is involved, etc., so users with varying experience levels can compete against each other in the same arena.\nWhat is a Pandas in Python?\nPandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.\nWhat is Pandas used for?\nPandas is mainly used for data analysis and associated manipulation of tabular data in DataFrames. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, Parquet, SQL database tables or queries, and Microsoft Excel.\nWhat is difference between NumPy and pandas?\nNumPy library provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, whereas Pandas is capable of offering an in-memory 2d table object called DataFrame. NumPy consumes less memory as compared to Pandas. Indexing of the Series objects is quite slow as compared to NumPy arrays.\n\nWhat are the different types of machine learning?\nMachine learning is generally divided between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. In supervised machine learning, we train machine learning models on labeled data. For example, an algorithm meant to detect spam might ingest thousands of email addresses labeled 'spam' or 'not spam.' That trained model could then identify new spam emails even from data it's never seen. In unsupervised learning, a machine learning model looks for patterns in unstructured data. One type of unsupervised learning is clustering. In this example, a model could identify similar movies by studying their scripts or cast, then group the movies together into genres. This unsupervised model was not trained to know which genre a movie belongs to. Rather, it learned the genres by studying the attributes of the movies themselves. There are many techniques available within.\n\nIs Machine learning a good career?\nMachine learning python is one of the fastest-growing and popular computer science careers today. Constantly growing and evolving, you can apply machine learning to a variety of industries, from shipping and fulfillment to medical sciences. Machine learning engineers work to create artificial intelligence that can better identify patterns and solve problems. The machine learning discipline frequently deals with cutting-edge, disruptive technologies. However, because it has become a popular career choice, it can also be competitive. Aspiring machine learning engineers can differentiate themselves from the competition through certifications, boot camps, code repository submissions, and hands-on experience.\n\nWhat is the difference between machine learning and artifical intelligence?\nMachine learning is a smaller subset of the broader spectrum of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence describes any \"intelligent machine\" that can derive information and make decisions, machine learning describes a method by which it can do so. Through machine learning, applications can derive knowledge without the user explicitly giving out the information. This is one of the first and early steps toward \"true artificial intelligence\" and is extremely useful for numerous practical applications. In machine learning applications, an AI is fed sets of information. It learns from these sets of information about what to expect and what to predict. But it still has limitations. A machine learning engineer must ensure that the AI is fed the right information and can use its logic to analyze that information correctly.\n\nWhat skills should a machine learning engineer know?\nA python machine learning engineer will need to be an extremely competent programmer with in-depth knowledge of computer science, mathematics, data science, and artificial intelligence theory. Machine learning engineers must be able to dig deep into complex applications and their programming. As with other disciplines, there are entry-level machine learning engineers and machine learning engineers with high-level expertise. Python and R are two of the most popular languages within the machine learning field.\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

      "description": "The most appealing characteristic of Python is that it is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages are the programming languages that do not need to be compiled to run. An interpreter can run python code on any kind of computer, by itself. This means the programmer can quickly see the results, if or when they need to modify the code. On the flip side, this also means that Python is slower than a compiled language like C. And that is because it is not running on a machine code directly.\nBecause Python is an interpreted language, testing small snippets of code and moving them between different platforms is quite simple. Since Python is compatible with most of the operating systems, it is used universally, in a variety of applications.\nPython is considered a beginners’ programming language. As it is a high-level language, a programmer can focus on what to do instead of how to do it. This is one of the major reasons why writing programs in Python takes less time than in other programming languages.\nBecause Python is similar to English, many find it easier to learn than other programming languages. Developers can read and remember the Python syntaxes much easier than other programming languages.\nSince Python supports scripting as well, it can be used to build large, commercial applications. The main factor behind Python’s popularity in the IT world is its reliability. Being a high-level programming language, Python lets the user focus on the core functioning of the application. Meanwhile, the common programming tasks are handled by the language itself.\nNow you can probably see why Python is one of the most favored programming languages by developers, data scientists, software engineers, and hackers! And the key factors behind its diverse userbase are flexibility, versatility, and object-oriented features. This is also why Python is used in complex fields like Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS).\nIn This Course, We Are Going To Work On 25 Real World Projects Listed Below:\nProject-1: Image Editor Application With OpenCV And Tkinter\nProject-2:  Brand Identification Game With Tkinter And Sqlite3\nProject-3: Transaction Application With Tkinter And Sqlite3\nProject-4: Learning Management System With Django\nProject-5: Create A News Portal With Django\nProject-6: Create A Student Portal With Django\nProject-7: Productivity Tracker With Django And Plotly\nProject-8: Create A Study Group With Django\nProject-9: Building Crop Guide Application with PyQt5, SQLite\nProject-10: Building Password Manager Application With PyQt5, SQLite\nProject-11: Create A News Application With Python\nProject-12: Create A Guide Application With Python\nProject-13: Building The Chef Web Application with Django, Python\nProject-14: Syllogism-Rules of Inference Solver Web Application\nProject-15: Building Vision Web Application with Django, Python\nProject-16: Building Budget Planner Application With Python\nProject-17: Tic Tac Toe Game\nProject-18: Random  Password Generator Website using Django\nProject-19: Building Personal Portfolio Website Using Django\nProject-20: Todo List Website For Multiple Users\nProject-21: Crypto Coin Planner Gui Application\nProject-22: Your Own Twitter Bot -python, request, API, deployment, tweepy\nProject-23: Create A Python Dictionary Using python, Tkinter, JSON\nProject-24: Egg-Catcher Game using python\nProject-25: Personal Routine Tracker Application using python",

      "description": "Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on a new problem. It is currently very popular in the field of Deep Learning because it enables you to train Deep Neural Networks with comparatively little data. In Transfer learning, knowledge of an already trained Machine Learning model is applied to a different but related problem.\nThe general idea is to use knowledge, which a model has learned from a task where a lot of labeled training data is available, in a new task where we don't have a lot of data. Instead of starting the learning process from scratch, you start from patterns that have been learned by solving a related task.\nIn this course, learn how to implement transfer learning to solve a different set of machine learning problems by reusing pre-trained models to train other models. Hands-on examples with transfer learning will get you started, and allow you to master how and why it is extensively used in different deep learning domains.\nYou will implement practical use cases of transfer learning in CNN and RNN such as using image classifiers, text classification, sentimental analysis, and much more. You'll be shown how to train models and how a pre-trained model is used to train similar untrained models in order to apply the transfer learning process even further. Allowing you to implement advanced use cases and learn how transfer learning is gaining momentum when it comes to solving real-world problems in deep learning.\nBy the end of this course, you will not only be able to build machine learning models, but have mastered transferring with tf.keras, TensorFlow Hub, and TensorFlow Lite tools.\nAbout the Author\nMargaret Maynard-Reid is a Google Developer Expert (GDE) for Machine Learning, contributor to the open-source ML framework TensorFlow and an author of the official TensorFlow blog. She writes tutorials and speaks at conferences about on-device ML, deep learning, computer vision, TensorFlow, and Android.\nMargaret leads the Google Developer Group (GDG) Seattle and Seattle Data/Analytics/ML and is passionate about helping others get started with AI/ML.

Neural Engineering is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with many other areas including neuroanatomy, electrophysiology, circuit theory, electrochemistry, bioelectric field theory, biomedical instrumentation, biomaterials, computational neuroscience, computer science, robotics, human-computer interaction, and neuromuscular rehabilitation. This course is designed around the central idea that Neural Engineering is the study of transferring electromagnetic information into or out of the nervous system. With this framework, the course is divided into three broad segments: neurorecording, neurostimulation and closed-loop neuromodulation. The neurorecording segment includes: invasive and non-invasive recording techniques, signal processing, neural feature extraction, biological and artificial neural networks, and real-time control of robotic devices using neurorecordings. The neurostimulation segment includes: invasive and non-invasive stimulation techniques, signal generation, physiological responses, safety analysis, and real-time stimulation for haptic feedback and for reanimating paralyzed limbs. The closed-loop neuromodulation segment features hands-on student-led projects and a review of various neurotech companies. Example applications include bionic arms controlled by thought that restore a natural sense of touch, or neural-links that can decode a person’s thoughts to reanimate a paralyzed limb.\nThe course provides students with fundamental articles from the field and dozens of quizzes for students to assess their understanding and reinforce key concepts.

      "description": "A novel approach has been proposed to achieve human detection in photos, videos, along with real-time detection using the system webcam and via the external camera. We will gradually learn and build the entire project. I will cover everything step by step so that it will be easy for you to build your own machine-learning model.\nIn this python project, we are going to build a Human Detection and Counting System through Webcam. This is actually an intermediate-level deep learning project on computer vision and TensorFlow, which can assist you to master the concepts of AI and it can make you an expert in the field of Data Science.\nSo, for your easy understanding, the course has been divided into 14 sections. Then, let us see what we are going to learn in each section.\nIn the first section, we will learn about Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Object Detection Models, Computer Vision Library, TensorFlow, TF API, and its detailed specifications and applications along with appropriate examples.\nIn the second section, we will learn about Human Detection Model and then we’ll understand how to install software and tools like Anaconda, Visual Studio, Jupyter, and so on. Next, we will learn about the IDE and the required settings. Later, this will help us to understand how to set up python environments and so on.\nTesting small programs separately in a jupyter notebook will give you clarity about the functionality and the working principle of jupyter notebook. So, in the third section, we will learn about setting up jupyter notebook and workspace.\nThe fourth section begins with importing dependencies, defining and setting paths for labels, real-time demonstrations, and source code.\nIn the fifth section, we will get to know about the computer vision library and how to capture images using OpenCV. We will understand the script step by step and then proceed further with real-time demonstration and image labeling tools. Thereafter, we will learn about Annotations and their types. And finally, we’ll start making annotations.\nIn the sixth section, we will start with the Human Detection Model. Then, we’ll learn to customize our own model. Thereafter, we will proceed with pre-trained models, script records, label maps, and so on. After that, we’ll start working with the workspace.\nThe next section will teach us about TensorFlow Model API and Protocol Buffers. Here, we’ll proceed with Model Garden, WGET Module, Protoc, and the verification of the source code. Then we’ll learn here how to download pre-trained models from TensorFlow Zoo.\nAfter that, in the 8th section, We’ll work with models. Here, we’ll learn how to create a label map, how to write files, and so on. Then, we’ll learn about model records like training and test records, copying model config into the training folder along with real-time demonstration.\nIn the 9th section, we’ll proceed with pipeline configurations, where we’ll learn about checkpoints. Next, we’ll go ahead with configuring, copying, and writing pipeline config. And at last, we’ll do the verifications.\nIn the 10th section, you will understand how to train and evaluate Human Detection Model. Here we’ll proceed with Training Script, commands for training, and verifications. This is the most important section where we’ll build our Human Detection Model. And, we’ll have to be very careful at this stage, because, “Training” may take long hours or a day, if your system doesn’t have any GPU and has used higher training steps. After completion of training, the model evaluation step comes. So here, we’ll understand about model evaluation, mean average precisions, recalls, confusion matrix, and so on.\nThe 11th section will take you to the trained model and checkpoints. Here, we’ll learn about loading pipeline configs, restoring checkpoints, and building a detection model. And then, we’ll understand the source code.\nIn the 12th section, we will get to know, how to test Human Detection Model from an image file. Here, we’ll import recommended libraries, and then learn about category index, defining test image paths, and so on.\nThe 13th section will get your hands dirty. You will do real-time detections from a webcam and will get to know, how the model performs.\nFinally, in the 14th section, we’ll understand about freezing graphs, TensorFlow lite, and archive models. This is the last section, where we’ll save our Human Detection Model by using the freezing graph method. Then we’ll learn how to convert Human Detection Model into the TensorFlow Lite model.\nFinally, we’ll end this project by archiving our model for future editing.\nDon't let errors hold you back! Our dedicated technical support team is here to assist you every step of the way. Whether you have a question or concern, simply post in the Question and Answer section and one of our experts will get back to you within 24 hours. They are available from Monday to Saturday, ensuring you complete satisfaction for all the errors you encounter.\nApart from that, your money is 100% safe as the course comes with a 30-days, no-questions-asked Money Back Guarantee. For any reason, if you are not happy with the course, the entire amount will be refunded back to your bank account.\nSo at the end of the day, you have nothing to lose.

Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn.\nNumpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Moreover, Numpy forms the foundation of the Machine Learning stack.\nNumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray , it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.\nNumPy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. With this power comes simplicity: a solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant.\nWith this training, where we will try to understand the logic of the PANDAS and NumPy Libraries, which are required for data science, which is seen as one of the most popular professions of the 21st century, we will work on many real-life applications.\nThe course content is created with real-life scenarios and aims to move those who start from scratch forward within the scope of the PANDAS Library.\nPANDAS Library is one of the most used libraries in data science.\nYes, do you know that data science needs will create 11.5 million job opportunities by 2026?\nWell, the average salary for data science careers is $100,000. Did you know that? Data Science Careers Shape the Future.\nIt isn't easy to imagine our life without data science and Machine learning. Word prediction systems, Email filtering, and virtual personal assistants like Amazon's Alexa and iPhone's Siri are technologies that work based on machine learning algorithms and mathematical models.\nData science and Machine learning-only word prediction system or smartphone does not benefit from the voice recognition feature.

It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.\nWhat is Pandas used for?\nPandas is mainly used for data analysis and associated manipulation of tabular data in DataFrames. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, Parquet, SQL database tables or queries, and Microsoft Excel.\nWhat is difference between NumPy and pandas?\nNumPy library provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, whereas Pandas is capable of offering an in-memory 2d table object called DataFrame. NumPy consumes less memory as compared to Pandas. Indexing of the Series objects is quite slow as compared to NumPy arrays.\nWhy do we need pandas in Python?\nPandas is built on top of two core Python libraries—matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code.\nIs pandas easy to learn?\nPandas is one of the first Python packages you should learn because it's easy to use, open source, and will allow you to work with large quantities of data.

      "description": "Each innovation had its followers, which, when applied, transformed different industries. The PC changed the way we manage physical documents, CAD sent the drawing tables to the wineries; email became the default method of formal communication. All of them ended up following globally accepted standards – at least, from the perspective of the provider. The transformations in the previous digital revolution added value to geographic and alphanumeric information, which individually helped boosted modern businesses. These transformations all relied on global connectivity; that is, the “http” protocol that we still use today. The new initiatives took advantage of the information, the inter-connected world and turned them into new businesses like Uber, Airbnb, Udemy and Netflix that have become a p[art of modern culture.\n#AulaGEO\nBut today, we are at the doors of a new digital revolution, which will change all this.\n\n\nNobody can guarantee the shape of the new digital landscape – industry leaders suggest a mature, pragmatic approach will stand us in good stead.. There will be opportunities for those with vision and scope to take advantage of this revolution. Governments, always mindful of re-election, may also move with an eye on the short-term. But, in the long term, it is, ironically, common users, interested in their own needs who will have the last word.\n\n\nAnd although the new environment may offer better coexistence, with free code living side by side with private coding according to sustainable standards resulting from a consensus; nobody guarantees that actors such as government and academia will live up to their role in good time. Nobody can predict how it will happen, we only know it will happen.\n\n\nDigital Twin - The new TCP / IP?\n\n\nSince we know it will happen, even if we do not perceive the gradual changes, we need to be prepared for change. We know acting with cuation will be necessary for those who understand the sensitivity of a globally-connected market where added value not only appears in the stock market indicators but also in the response of increasingly influential consumers with regards to the quality of services. Undoubtedly, the standard will play a role in ensuring balance between industry’s supply of creativity and the demands of the end users.\n\n\nThis course offers a vision from the author (Golgi Alvarez) perspective, and includes segments of Geospatial World, Siemens, Bentley Systems and Enterprise Management as representative leaders of the Digital Twins approach.",

      "description": "Analyzing data and building machine learning models is one thing. Packaging these analyses and models such that they are sharable is a different ball game altogether.\nThis course aims at teaching you the fastest and easiest way to build and share data applications using Streamlit. You don't need any experience in building front-end applications for this. Here are some of the things you can expect to cover in this course:\nPython Crash Course\nNumPy Crash Course\nIntroduction to Streamlit\nIntegrating Matplotlit and Seaborn in Streamlit\nUsing Altair and Vega-Lite in Streamlit\nUnderstand all Streamlit Widgets\nUpload and Process Files\nBuild an Image Processing Application\nDevelop a Natural Language Processing Application\nIntegrate Maps with Streamlit\nImplement Plotly Graphs\nAuthenticate Your Applications\nLaying Out your Application in Streamlit\nDeveloping with Streamlit Components\nDeploying Data Applications\nWhy Streamlit\nThere are several other libraries that can be used for building data applications. That said, why should you consider Streamlit:\nNo front-end experienced required\nWrite everything in what you already know — Python\nEasy to weave in interaction with widgets such as sliders\nQuick and easy to deploy\nCompatible with most data science frameworks\nNo front-end experienced required\nIf you were to build a data app with Flask and or Django, then knowledge in front-end tools such as HTML & CSS as well as Javascript is a must. However, in Streamlit, all this is done using Streamlit widgets. For example, a drop-down can easily be achieved using the selectbox widget. Other HTML tags such as input boxes and buttons are also achieved using simple Streamlit widgets.\n\n\nPython Scripting\nWhen building data applications in Streamlit, you never leave your Python editor. This is because is scripted in Python. It is, therefore, very advantageous since you keep working in a language that you are already familiar with. If this was done in other Python frameworks, then writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript code would be unavoidable.\nInteractivity\nAdding interaction to Streamlit applications is very simple. Streamlit provides widgets that one can use to weave interactivity to your application. For example, one can use the date input widget to filter their data. Select boxes and sliders can also be used to achieve the same.\nDeployment\nSharing Streamlit applications is very easy. One can easily deploy to the likes of Heroku and AWS. However, one can also deploy their app on Streamlit Sharing by the click of just two buttons. All you have to do is to request access. Your Github email address will then be linked to Streamlit Sharing. Once this is done, you can deploy any Streamlit project available on your Github account.\nCompatibility\nStreamlit is compatible with the most popular data science libraries. For example, you can perform visualizations in Streamlit with the tools that you are already used to. The visualizations libraries supported include:\nMatplotlib\nSeaborn\nAltair\nPlotly\nBokeh\nYou definitely need to perform data cleaning and wrangling before visualizing your results. Pandas and NumPy are supported so that you can achieve this.\nWhen it comes to machine learning, you can deploy models built with the popular libraries that you are already used to. This is because Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are supported out-of-the-box.\n\n\nStreamlit Components\nIn the event that you need a functionality that is not supported by Streamlit the first place to look is the Streanmlit Components page. Streamlit Components are third-party functionalities that have been built by the community. The components can be installed via pip and used immediately in your project.\nStreamlit Components\nThe beauty of it is that you can also write your own components and share them with the community.\n\n\nAt the end of the course, you will have built several applications that you can include in your data science portfolio. You will also have a new skill to add to your resume.\nThe course also comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Enroll now and if you don't like it you will get your money back no questions asked.",

      "description": "Programming Statistical Applications in R is an introductory course teaching the basics of programming mathematical and statistical applications using the R language. The course makes extensive use of the Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation using R (spuRs) package from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The course is a scientific-programming foundations course and is a useful complement and precursor to the more simulation-application oriented R Programming for Simulation and Monte-Carlo Methods Udemy course. The two courses were originally developed as a two-course sequence (although they do share some exercises in common). Together, both courses provide a powerful set of unique and useful instruction about how to create your own mathematical and statistical functions and applications using R software.\nProgramming Statistical Applications in R is a \"hands-on\" course that comprehensively teaches fundamental R programming skills, concepts and techniques useful for developing statistical applications with R software. The course also uses dozens of \"real-world\" scientific function examples. It is not necessary for a student to be familiar with R, nor is it necessary to be knowledgeable about programming in general, to successfully complete this course. This course is 'self-contained' and includes all materials, slides, exercises (and solutions); in fact, everything that is seen in the course video lessons is included in zipped, downloadable materials files. The course is a great instructional resource for anyone interested in refining their skills and knowledge about statistical programming using the R language. It would be useful for practicing quantitative analysis professionals, and for undergraduate and graduate students seeking new job-related skills and/or skills applicable to the analysis of research data.\nThe course begins with basic instruction about installing and using the R console and the RStudio application and provides necessary instruction for creating and executing R scripts and R functions. Basic R data structures are explained, followed by instruction on data input and output and on basic R programming techniques and control structures. Detailed examples of creating new statistical R functions, and of using existing statistical R functions, are presented. Boostrap and Jackknife resampling methods are explained in detail, as are methods and techniques for estimating inference and for constructing confidence intervals, as well as of performing N-fold cross validation assessments of competing statistical models. Finally, detailed instructions and examples for debugging and for making R programs run more efficiently are demonstrated.",

      "description": "Embark on a journey through the fascinating world of computer vision and deep learning with our comprehensive course designed to equip you with the skills to master Video Object Tracking, Vehicle Speed Estimation, Object Detection, Object Segmentation, and Pose Estimation using Python. This course offers a blend of theory and practical application, providing you with the knowledge to build sophisticated systems that can interpret and understand visual information from the world around us. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to refine your expertise, this course will pave the way for you to excel in the dynamic field of computer vision and deep learning. Let's briefly go through the computer vision and deep learning tasks that you will learn in this course..\n\n\nObject Tracking with Python: •Object tracking in the realm of video analytics is a critical task that not only identifies the location and class of objects within the frame but also maintains a unique ID for each detected object in the video. It involves identifying and monitoring the movement and behavior of specific objects over time, often in dynamic or complex environments.  For object tracking, you will be using two famous object tracking algorithms:\n1. BotSort: The BotSort algorithm employs a combination of techniques, including feature extraction, clustering, and tracking, to identify and track objects within a video frame or sequence.\n2. ByteTrack: ByteTrack leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and optimization techniques to efficiently track objects in video sequences while maintaining robustness and accuracy.\nVehicles Speed Estimation with Python:  Speed estimation is the process of calculating the rate of movement of an object within a given context, often employed in computer vision applications. Using Ultralytics YOLOv8 you can calculate the speed of object using object tracking alongside distance and time data, crucial for tasks like traffic and surveillance. The accuracy of speed estimation directly influences the efficiency and reliability of various applications, making it a key component in the advancement of intelligent systems and real-time decision-making processes.\nPose Estimation with Python: Pose estimation is a task that involves identifying the location of specific points in an image, usually referred to as keypoints. The keypoints can represent various parts of the object such as joints, landmarks, or other distinctive features. The locations of the keypoints are usually represented as a set of 2D [x, y] or 3D [x, y, visible] coordinates. The output of a pose estimation model is a set of points that represent the keypoints on an object in the image, usually along with the confidence scores for each point. Pose estimation is a good choice when you need to identify specific parts of an object in a scene, and their location in relation to each other.\nObject Segmentation on Custom Dataset:  Object segmentation is a computer vision task to detect and segment individual objects at a pixel level. Instance segmentation goes a step further than object detection and involves identifying individual objects and segment them from the rest of the region. The output of an instance segmentation model is a set of masks or contours that outline each object in the image, along with class labels and confidence scores for each object. Instance segmentation is useful when you need to know not only where objects are in an image, but also what their exact shape is.\nObject Detection on Custom Dataset: Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying the location and class of objects in an image or video stream. The output of an object detector is a set of bounding boxes that enclose the objects in the image, along with class labels and confidence scores for each box. Object detection is a good choice when you need to identify objects of interest in a scene, but don't need to know exactly where the object is or its exact shape.\nObject Classification: Object classification is a computer vision task that involves classifying an entire image into one of a set of predefined classes. The output of an image classifier is a single class label and a confidence score. Image classification is useful when you need to know only what class an image belongs to and don't need to know where objects of that class are located or what their exact shape is.\nBy enrolling in this course, you will not only gain a wealth of practical skills in Video Object Tracking, Vehicle Speed Estimation, Object Detection, Object Segmentation, and Pose Estimation, but you will also join a community of like-minded individuals driven by innovation and success. Don’t let this chance to transform your career and shape the future of technology pass you by. Embrace the challenge, enroll now, and start crafting your path to becoming a leader in the field of computer vision with Python.\nSee you inside the class!!",

is where data science comes in Data science python uses algorithms to understand raw data The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction Python data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data\nIt draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends Data science using python includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data It draws from many scientific fields, and as a python for data science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn\nPython's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization\nThe core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks\nWhat is NumPy?\nNumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning is being applied to virtually every field today That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use\nMachine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions\nWhat is NumPy is used for?\nNumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant It is an open source project and you can use it freely\nWhat is the difference between NumPy and Python?\nNumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically) Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory\nWhat is NumPy arrays in Python?\nA numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension\nWhy NumPy is used in Machine Learning?\nNumPy is a very popular python library for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing, with the help of a large collection of high-level mathematical functions It is very useful for fundamental scientific computations in Machine Learning\nWhat is NumPy array example?\nIt is basically a table of elements which are all of the same type and indexed by a tuple of positive integers The dimensions are called axis in NumPy The NumPy's array class is known as ndarray or alias array The numpy array is not the same as the standard Python library class array\nWhat are the benefits of NumPy in Python?\nNumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types This allows the code to be optimized even further\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nWe have prepared this course in the simplest way for beginners and have prepared many different exercises to help them understand better\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nIn this course, you need no previous knowledge about Python or Numpy\nThis course will take you from a beginner to a more experienced level\nIf you are new to data science or

      "description": "Welcome to the course \"Python: Solved Interview Questions on Algorithms and Data structures\".\nThis course is from a software engineer who has managed to crack interviews in around 16 software companies.\nSometimes, life gives us no time to prepare, There are emergency times where in we have to buck up our guts and start  bringing the situations under our control rather then being in the control of the situation.  At the end of the day, All leave this earth empty handed. But given a situation, we should live up or fight up in such a way that the whole action sequence should make us proud and be giving us goosebumps when we think about it right after 10 years.\nWe would have observed the fact that though most of us are developers, only few would get a chance to work on certain advanced programming stuff like Data Structures, Linked Lists, Trees. The rest of us get to spend time in Bug fixing, resolving Maintenance issues during our work hours. Though this work doesn't help us much in improving our learning curve, it certainly feeds us and our families. So, Keeping this in mind, at the work place, We don't have any option but to work honestly.\nBut, the real trouble starts when we start attending interviews and suddenly somebody asks us to provide an optimal algorithm or a program which separates zeroes and ones in a array or somebody asks us to provide an efficient algorithm which will get the diameter of a tree. There can also occur a situation where in we think twice or get confused when we try to connect previous and next nodes while inserting a node between two nodes in a single or double link list.\nMost of the times, the interviewer feels happy if we give him/her an optimal solution for a problem. It might so happen that, though we have around 8 to 10 years of software development experience, we still feel shaky and confused while literally tracing or debugging a recursive algorithm. The problem is though we know the solution, We will not be able to present it conveniently as we would have lost touch with the fundamentals of programming due to our day to day office routine, the work processes which are in place.\nSpeaking of this course, here we have tried to cover majority of interview questions on algorithms and data structures in python along with the basics of data structures. We have literally traced/debugged most of the algorithms for several interview questions. We have explained the solutions for several interview questions for the following content:\nStacks, Linked Lists, Trees, Arrays, Searching and Sorting.\nThe course content is around 9 hours. Kindly check the preview for 30 mins. If you are interested, Kindly take up the course. The respective programs are attached with the sessions.  Kindly note that, We have focused more on explaining the optimal logic of the program rather then discussing the notations like Big O of the algorithms.\nKindly adjust the talking speed in accordance to your convenience (Please set the course narration speed on your convenience.). The concepts are presented in Neutral English.\n\n\nThe below are the interview questions explained in the course:\n\n- write a program to implement stacks using lists\n- write a program to implement

But they have limitations, especially if you want to make something more complex and personalized. Because of that, I'm showing you how to use state-of-the-art NLP libraries and combine them to get a more advanced possible use of a chatbot.\nAfter this course, the amazing thing won't be that the chatbot responds, but the entire process you're able to create and the possibilities that become available.

      "description": "GIS and Drone Technologies are both powerful tools for assisting people in analyzing the world we inhabit. Whether you are someone with GIS skills looking to add drones to your toolbelt, or a drone pilot who wants to level up their deliverable products, you are in the right place. Both these skills require very similar mindsets, such as an attention to detail, focus and accuracy. If you can do one, you can do the other, so why not do both!\nThis course is best for those who have some familiarity with either GIS concepts or drone mapping, or those that are comfortable in learning new software packages. The course is perfect for those who have drone data that they have collected and want to analyze it beyond running it through Drone Deploy and the like. Using your DEM data, you will learn to create elevation contours, calculate the terrain's steepness and which way the sun is hitting the ground. You will also learn the skills to go online and acquire existing data layers such as town boundaries, watershed areas, and streams and overlay them atop your orthomosaics. From there, you add professional borders, titles, scale bars and your logo and produce professional client deliverables, thereby surpassing your competition.\nAnd possibly saving the best for last, this course includes a treasure trove of GIS data from the FAA. In the lecture resources section, you will find a Geopackage and QGIS Project file with over a dozen pre-symbolized layers including labeled Classed Airspace polygons (B, C, D, E, E to Surface, MOAs, Restricted and Prohibited Airspaces, etc.) and airport locations. You will learn how to overlay these shapes atop dozens of basemaps, including aerial photos, open street map data, and Sectional Charts. Just the ability to produce custom, titled, scaled, centered Sectionals is worth the modest investment. Your deliverable game is about to take off!\nIf you are a GIS professional with an interest in drones, or a drone pilot with an interest in producing better deliverables, this course is for you!",

      "description": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is at the forefront of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to NLP, covering both foundational linguistic concepts and advanced deep learning techniques. Through a hands-on approach with PyTorch, students will learn to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models for a variety of NLP tasks.\nThe course begins with an Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), exploring key applications such as machine translation, chatbots, and text summarization. Following this, students will dive into Text Preprocessing Techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization—essential steps for preparing textual data for machine learning models.\nNext, we will explore fundamental NLP applications, including Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification, using traditional machine learning approaches before advancing to deep learning-based methods. Students will also work with Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging, essential for information extraction and linguistic analysis.\nTo understand how machines interpret textual data, we will cover Word Embeddings and Semantic Similarity, including Word2Vec, GloVe, and contextual embeddings from modern models. This leads naturally into deep learning fundamentals, starting with an Introduction to Neural Networks, Perceptrons and Feedforward Networks, and Backpropagation and Gradient Descent, which power most deep learning models.\nA key focus will be on Activation Functions and Optimization Algorithms, helping students fine-tune their models for improved performance. The course then explores sequence-based deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), which are critical for processing sequential text data.\nModern NLP relies on Transformers for NLP Tasks, including the groundbreaking Transformer architecture behind BERT and GPT models. We will then introduce PyTorch and its Ecosystem, equipping students with the tools to build, train, and deploy deep learning models.\nHands-on projects will guide students through Building NLP Models with PyTorch, Implementing Neural Networks with PyTorch, and Training and Evaluating Deep Learning Models to ensure proficiency in real-world applications.\nBy the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in both classical and deep learning approaches to NLP, with the ability to build cutting-edge models using PyTorch. This course is ideal for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI enthusiasts eager to advance their skills in NLP and deep learning.",

Or perhaps you are using Python and R, but you are tired of their slow performance.\nYou can accomplish everything, and even more, with Julia compared to what you can do with Python or R, all with the same level of ease. Moreover, Julia offers significantly greater speed than both of them.\nJulia is a modern programming language developed for data science, machine learning, AI, and numerical computing. It is a dynamically typed language that is easy to learn and use and moreover has the speed of C.\nJulia combines the best features of dynamic languages like Python and R with low-level languages like C, C#, and Java. You can develop a machine learning model or an algorithm in Julia and use that code in a production environment. You don't have to use different languages for development and production.\nThis is my second course about Julia. In this course, you will learn how to accomplish essential data science tasks with Julia: importing, analyzing, manipulating, and visualizing data. Having these foundations you will be ready for machine learning and deep learning with Julia which will be in my upcoming lectures. Please stay tuned.",

      "description": "Reinforcement Learning has become one of the hottest research areas in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. You can make an intelligent agent in a few steps: have it semi-randomly explore different choices of movement to actions given different conditions and states, then keep track of the reward or penalty associated with each choice for a given state or action. This Course describes and compares the range of model-based and model-free learning algorithms that constitute Reinforcement Learning algorithms.\nThis comprehensive 3-in-1 course follows a step-by-step practical approach to getting grips with the basics of Reinforcement Learning with R and build your own intelligent systems. Initially, you’ll learn how to implement Reinforcement Learning techniques using the R programming language. You’ll also learn concepts and key algorithms in Reinforcement Learning. Moving further, you’ll dive into Temporal Difference Learning, an algorithm that combines Monte Carlo methods and dynamic programming. Finally, you’ll implement typical applications for model-based and model-free RL.\nTowards the end of this course, you'll get to grips with the basics of Reinforcement Learning with R and build your own intelligent systems.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Reinforcement Learning Techniques with R, covers Reinforcement Learning techniques with R. This Course will give you a brief introduction to Reinforcement Learning; it will help you navigate the \"Grid world\" to calculate likely successful outcomes using the popular MDPToolbox package. This video will show you how the Stimulus - Action - Reward algorithm works in Reinforcement Learning. By the end of this Course, you will have a basic understanding of the concept of reinforcement learning, you will have compiled your first Reinforcement Learning program, and will have mastered programming the environment for Reinforcement Learning.\nThe second course, Practical Reinforcement Learning - Agents and Environments, covers concepts and Key Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning. In this course, you’ll learn how to code the core algorithms in RL and get to know the algorithms in both R and Python. This video course will help you hit the ground running, with R and Python code for Value Iteration, Policy Gradients, Q-Learning, Temporal Difference Learning, the Markov Decision Process, and Bellman Equations, which provides a framework for modelling decision making where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. At the end of the video course, you’ll know the main concepts and key algorithms in RL.\nThe third course, Discover Algorithms for Reward-Based Learning in R, covers Model-Based and Model-Free RL Algorithms with R. The Course starts by describing the differences in model-free and model-based approaches to Reinforcement Learning. It discusses the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and typical examples of model-free and model-based approaches. We look at model-based approaches to Reinforcement Learning. We discuss State-value and State-action value functions, Model-based iterative policy evaluation, and improvement, MDP R examples of moving a pawn, how the discount factor, gamma, “works” and an R example illustrating how the discount factor and relative rewards affect policy. Next, we learn the model-free approach to Reinforcement Learning. This includes Monte Carlo approach, Q-Learning approach, More Q-Learning explanation and R examples of varying the learning rate and randomness of actions and SARSA approach. Finally, we round things up by taking a look at model-free Simulated Annealing and more Q-Learning algorithms. The primary aim is to learn how to create efficient, goal-oriented business policies, and how to evaluate and optimize those policies, primarily using the MDP toolbox package in R. Finally, the video shows how to build actions, rewards, and punishments with a simulated annealing approach.\nTowards the end of this course, you'll get to grips with the basics of Reinforcement Learning with R and build your own intelligent systems.\nAbout the Authors\nDr. Geoffrey Hubona held a full-time tenure-track, and tenured, assistant, and associate professor faculty positions at three major state universities in the Eastern United States from 1993-2010.

Python is the most popular programming language for the data science processes in recent years. The world we are in is experiencing the age of informatics. In order to take part in this world and create your own opportunities, Python and its Pandas library will be the right choice for you. With this course, you can step into the world of data science.\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python Bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in data science, you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choices for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.\nWhat is R and why is it useful?\nThe R programming language was created specifically for statistical programming. Many find it useful for data handling, cleaning, analysis, and representation. R is also a popular language for data science projects. Much of the data used for data science can be messy and complex. The programming language has features and libraries available geared toward cleaning up unorganized data and making complex data structures easier to handle that can't be found in other languages. It also provides powerful data visualization tools to help data scientists find patterns in large sets of data and present the results in expressive reports. Machine learning is another area where the R language is useful. R gives developers an extensive selection of machine learning libraries that will help them find trends in data and predict future events.\nWhat careers use R?\nR is a popular programming language for data science, business intelligence, and financial analysis. Academic, scientific, and non-profit researchers use the R language to glean answers from data. R is also widely used in market research and advertising to analyze the results of marketing campaigns and user data. The language is used in quantitative analysis, where its data analysis capabilities give financial experts the tools they need to manage portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Data scientists use R in many industries to turn data into insights and predict future trends with its machine learning capabilities. Data analysts use R to extract data, analyze it, and turn it into reports that can help enterprises make better business decisions. Data visualization experts use R to turn data into visually appealing graphs and charts.\nIs R difficult to learn?\nWhether R is hard to learn depends on your experience. After all, R is a programming language designed for mathematicians, statisticians, and business analysts who may have no coding experience. For some beginning users, it is relatively simple to learn R. It can have a learning curve if you are a business analyst who is only familiar with graphical user interfaces since R is a text-based programming language. But compared to other programming languages, users usually find R easier to understand. R also may have an unfamiliar syntax for programmers who are used to other programming languages, but once they learn the syntax, the learning process becomes more straightforward. Beginners will also find that having some knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and probabilities makes learning R easier.\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\nDoes machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it. An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systems.\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science python uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Python data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science using python includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a python for data science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\nWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?\nPython for data science is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up.\nHow long does it take to become a data scientist?\nThis answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.\nHow can ı learn data science on my own?\nIt is possible to learn data science projects on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.\nDoes data science require coding?\nThe jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skillset.\nWhat skills should a data scientist know?\nA data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings.\nIs data science a good career?\nThe demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. Data science from scratch is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds.\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy's seasoned instructors' expertise.\nFresh Content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge.

      "description": "Easily Pass Databricks Certified Data Engineer Exam in 3 Days (updated Jun 2025 with latest questions)\n\n\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nThe Data Platform team at CloudScale Analytics requires full access to the `customers` database to effectively manage a newly assigned ELT project.  Which of the following commands can be used to grant full permissions on the database to the Data Platform team?\nA. GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE customers TO team;\nB. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE team TO customers;\nC. GRANT SELECT PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE customers TO teams;\nD. GRANT SELECT CREATE MODIFY USAGE PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE customers TO team;\nE. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE customers TO team;\n\n\nCorrect Answer: E\nExplanation:\nThe correct command to grant full privileges on the database `customers` to the team is `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE customers TO team;`. `ALL PRIVILEGES` encompasses all possible permissions, allowing the team to fully manage the database.  Option A only grants the `USAGE` privilege, which is insufficient for full management. `USAGE` allows the grantee to connect to the database but does not grant the ability to create, modify, or select data.  Option B has the arguments reversed and would attempt to grant permissions from the `team` database to the `customers` database, which is incorrect.  Option C grants only `SELECT` privileges, which is not enough for full management. The team would not be able to create, modify, or delete data. Also, the question states \"team\" not \"teams\".  Option D, `GRANT SELECT CREATE MODIFY USAGE PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE customers TO team;`, while granting a broader range of privileges than options A and C, it still doesn't cover all privileges (e.g., `DROP`, `ALTER`, etc.). Using `ALL PRIVILEGES` ensures that the team has complete control.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nThe Data Engineering team at InnovaTech is evaluating the Databricks Lakehouse Platform for their new data pipeline; what advantage does the platform's use of open source technologies offer InnovaTech?\nA. Cloud-specific integrations\nB. Simplified governance\nC. Ability to scale storage\nD. Ability to scale workloads\nE. Avoiding vendor lock-in\nCorrect Answer: E\nExplanation:\nVendor lock-in refers to the situation where a customer becomes dependent on a specific vendor for products or services, making it difficult or costly to switch to another vendor. By embracing open-source technologies, the Databricks Lakehouse Platform allows users to avoid being locked into a single vendor's ecosystem because open standards and formats enable interoperability and portability across different systems and platforms. This gives users the flexibility to choose the tools and services that best meet their needs, without being constrained by proprietary technologies or vendor-specific limitations.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nAt Apex Analytics, the BI Engineering team is deciding on cluster configurations. Which of the following describes a scenario where a data engineer would choose to use a single-node cluster?\nA. When they are working interactively with a small amount of data\nB. When they are running automated reports to be refreshed as quickly as possible\nC. When they are working with SQL within Databricks SQL\nD. When they are concerned about the ability to automatically scale with larger data\nE. When they are manually running reports with a large amount of data\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nA single-node cluster consists of an Apache Spark driver and no Spark workers. This configuration is ideal for lightweight, interactive tasks and working with small amounts of data because it avoids the overhead of distributing computations across multiple nodes.  Let's evaluate the options:\n*   A. When they are working interactively with a small amount of data: This is the primary use case for a single-node cluster. It's cost-effective for development, testing, and exploratory data analysis where the dataset is small enough to fit within the memory and processing capabilities of a single machine.\n*   B. When they are running automated reports to be refreshed as quickly as possible: Automated reports, especially those needing quick refresh times, typically involve larger datasets and demand high performance. This scenario would benefit from a standard (multi-node) cluster to leverage distributed processing and parallelism, which a single-node cluster cannot provide.\n*   C. When they are working with SQL within Databricks SQL: While you can run SQL on any Databricks cluster, Databricks SQL provides specialized SQL Warehouses (formerly SQL Endpoints) that are optimized for SQL workloads, offering instant compute and often employing multi-node configurations for performance and concurrency. A single-node cluster is not the primary or most efficient choice for general Databricks SQL workloads.\n*   D. When they are concerned about the ability to automatically scale with larger data: Single-node clusters do *not* scale automatically with larger data. They are fixed-size and suitable only for data that fits on a single machine. For scalability with larger data, a standard (multi-node) cluster or Databricks SQL Warehouse is required.\n*   E. When they are manually running reports with a large amount of data: Large amounts of data necessitate distributed processing to handle memory requirements and computational complexity efficiently. A single-node cluster would likely run out of memory or take an excessively long time to process large datasets.  Therefore, the most appropriate scenario for using a single-node cluster is interactive work with small amounts of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you ready to pass the Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate exam?\nOur Databricks Practice Test Course is designed to help you master core data engineering concepts and confidently pass the certification exam.

      "description": "Welcome to Tensorflow on the Google Cloud Platform for Data Engineers This is the fourth course in a series of courses designed to help you attain the coveted Google Certified Data Engineer.\nAdditionally, the series of courses is going to show you the role of the data engineer on the Google Cloud Platform.\nNOTE: This is not a course on how to develop machine learning models with TensorFlow. This is a very targeted course on TensorFlow for data engineers.  My goal is to give data engineers what they need to know for the exam and provide learners with the foundations of TensorFlow on Google's Cloud Platform.\nAt this juncture the Google Certified Data Engineer is the only real world certification for data and machine learning engineers.\nTensorFlow is an open source software library created by Goggle for doing graph-based computations quickly. It does this by utilizing the GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)  and also making it easy to distribute the work across multiple GPUs and computers.\n\nTensors, in general, are simply arrays of numbers, or functions, that transform according to certain rules under a change of conditions. Nodes in the graphs represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them.\nIn the course you'll discover how to apply TensorFlow to machine learning, the concept of a Tensor, the anatomy of a simple program, basic constructs such as constants, variables, placeholders, sessions and the computation graph.\nYou'll work with basic math operations and image transformations to see how common computations are performed.\nYou'll learn TensorFlow within the context of the Google Cloud Platform.\n*Five Reasons to take this Course.*\n\n1) You Want to be a Data Engineer\nIt's the number one job in the world. (not just within the computer space) The growth potential career wise is second to none. You want the freedom to move anywhere you'd like. You want to be compensated for your efforts. You want to be able to work remotely. The list of benefits goes on.\n2) The Google Certified Data Engineer\nGoogle is always ahead of the game. If you were to look back at a timeline of their accomplishments in the data space you might believe they have a crystal ball. They've been a decade ahead of everyone.  Now, they are the first and the only cloud vendor to have a data engineering certification. With their track record I'll go with Google.\n3) The Growth of Data is Insane\nNinety percent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years. Business around the world generate approximately 450 billions transactions a day. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5 Exabytes a day. That number doubles every month.\n4) TensorFlow in Plain English\n\nTensorFlow is a low level language.  The basic concept of a tenor is hard to grasp if you aren't familiar with neural networks. In the course we will break down TensorFlow in to bite sized pieces ensuring you learn the fundamentals first. After we've built a base understanding of tensors and how they flow we will move on to more complicated examples.\n5) You want to be ahead of the Curve\nThe data engineer role is fairly new.  While your learning, building your skills and becoming certified you are also the first to be part of this burgeoning field.  You know that the first to be certified means the first to be hired and first to receive the top compensation package.\nThank you for your interest in Tensorflow on the Google Cloud Platform for Data Engineers and we will see you in the course!!",

Many find it useful for data handling, cleaning, analysis, and representation. R is also a popular language for data science projects. Much of the data used for data science can be messy and complex. The programming language has features and libraries available geared toward cleaning up unorganized data and making complex data structures easier to handle that can't be found in other languages. It also provides powerful data visualization tools to help data scientists find patterns in large sets of data and present the results in expressive reports. Machine learning is another area where the R language is useful. R gives developers an extensive selection of machine learning libraries that will help them find trends in data and predict future events.\nWhat careers use R?\nR is a popular programming language for data science, business intelligence, and financial analysis. Academic, scientific, and non-profit researchers use the R language to glean answers from data. R is also widely used in market research and advertising to analyze the results of marketing campaigns and user data. The language is used in quantitative analysis, where its data analysis capabilities give financial experts the tools they need to manage portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Data scientists use R in many industries to turn data into insights and predict future trends with its machine learning capabilities. Data analysts use R to extract data, analyze it, and turn it into reports that can help enterprises make better business decisions. Data visualization experts use R to turn data into visually appealing graphs and charts.\nIs R difficult to learn?\nWhether R is hard to learn depends on your experience. After all, R is a programming language designed for mathematicians, statisticians, and business analysts who may have no coding experience. For some beginning users, it is relatively simple to learn R. It can have a learning curve if you are a business analyst who is only familiar with graphical user interfaces since R is a text-based programming language. But compared to other programming languages, users usually find R easier to understand. R also may have an unfamiliar syntax for programmers who are used to other programming languages, but once they learn the syntax, the learning process becomes more straightforward. Beginners will also find that having some knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and probabilities makes learning R easier.\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\nWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?\nPython is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quickly.\nHow long does it take to become a data scientist?\nThis answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.\nFresh Content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge.

      "description": "Welcome to my course on Computer Science! Let's consider two scenarios:\nScenario 1:\nYou started a new job in computer science (you thought you knew enough to handle it), and in that job you are required to know how to use some aspects of your computer you never knew even existed (e.g., a terminal, a webhook, a particular code editor, etc). You have to learn quickly because the project you were put on needs to be done in 1 month. *PANIC*.\nScenario 2:\nYou have never programmed anything before, but you decide to start a master's degree in computer science (but your bachelor's degree was in an entirely different field), and the first day the teacher asks you to write a program in C and it's due in 2 weeks. *PANIC*.\n\n\nHi, I'm James Michael Ballow, and both of these scenarios happened to me, at nearly the same time. I was nervous, and I felt anxiety and panic. The biggest problem I had was that every time I looked for a book, article, or video that would explain to me the very basics of computing, programming, or languages, nearly all of them began speaking 15 steps ahead of where I needed to start. I was always infuriated that no amount of searching could give me what I wanted. In order to get over this, I had to ask a million questions (sometimes admittedly stupid and embarrassing questions) to colleagues and professors in order to really understand things on a fundamental level.\nAs I went along in my academic and professional careers, I noticed something: the other students seemed to be struggling with the same thing I was, but because they did not admit their lack of fundamental understanding, their grades were often quite low. That's when it hit me: every single person is struggling with understanding this computer science stuff. This phenomena is best described by me as a \"barrier\" between the human and computer. This course breaks that barrier.\nIn this course I tell you about myself and my journey from knowing absolutely nothing about computer science, to getting a 4.0 in my Master's in Computer Science and becoming a practicing software engineer and machine learnist. I will tell you quite plainly how to think about certain concepts so that the concepts that you will learn beyond this course will be much simpler. After taking this course, you will no longer feel like there are a million things you need to learn on your own before you can start your programming, or managing/working on a programming team.\nLet's do it!",

      "description": "Welcome to my \" Python: Python Programming with Python project & 100 quizzes \" course.\nPython | Numpy & Pandas for Python Data Analysis, Data Science, Machine Learning from A-Z with python projects & quizzes\n\nPython is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.\n\nPython instructors at OAK Academy specialize in everything from software development to data analysis and are known for their effective, friendly instruction for students of all levels.\nWhether you work in machine learning or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python, machine learning, Django, python programming, machine learning python, python Bootcamp, coding, data science, data analysis, programming languages.\nPython's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed upon the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that has resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing a variety of different tools for programmers suited for many different tasks.\nPandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. Pandas is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.\nPandas is mainly used for data analysis and associated manipulation of tabular data in DataFrames. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, Parquet, SQL database tables or queries, and Microsoft Excel. data analysis, pandas, numpy, numpy stack, numpy python, python data analysis, python, Python numpy, data visualization, pandas python, python pandas, python for data analysis, python data, data visualization.\n\nPandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.\nPandas Pyhon aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.\n\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn.\nNumpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Moreover, Numpy forms the foundation of the Machine Learning stack.\nNumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray , it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.\nNumPy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. With this power comes simplicity: a solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant.\nWith this training, where we will try to understand the logic of the PANDAS and NumPy Libraries, which are required for data science, which is seen as one of the most popular professions of the 21st century, we will work on many real-life applications.\nThe course content is created with real-life scenarios and aims to move those who start from scratch forward within the scope of the PANDAS Library.\nPANDAS Library is one of the most used libraries in data science.\nDo you want to learn one of the employer’s most requested skills? If you think so, you are at the right place.\nWe've designed for you \"Python: Python Programming with Python project & 100 quizzes” a straightforward course for the Python programming language.\nIn the course, you will have down-to-earth way explanations of hands-on projects. With my course, you will learn Python Programming step-by-step.

Python for beginners has the second largest number of job postings relative to all other languages. So it will earn you a lot of money and will bring a great change in your resume.\n\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\n\n\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in data science , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\n\n\n\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too.

This course is expertly designed to teach everyone from complete beginners, right through to professionals ( as a refresher).\n\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\n\n\nWhy we use a Python programming language in Machine learning?\nPython is a general-purpose, high-level, and multi-purpose programming language. The best thing about Python is, it supports a lot of today’s technology including vast libraries for Twitter, data mining, scientific calculations, designing, back-end server for websites, engineering simulations, artificial learning, augmented reality and what not! Also, it supports all kinds of App development.\n\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning a-z is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\n\nDoes Machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning data science without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it\n\n\nWhat is the best language for machine learning?\nPython is the most used language in machine learning using python. Engineers writing machine learning systems often use Jupyter Notebooks and Python together. Jupyter Notebooks is a web application that allows experimentation by creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and more. Machine learning involves trial and error to see which hyperparameters and feature engineering choices work best. It's useful to have a development environment such as Python so that you don't need to compile and package code before running it each time. Python is not the only language choice for machine learning. Tensorflow is a popular framework for developing neural networks and offers a C++ API. There is a complete machine learning framework for C# called ML. NET. Scala or Java are sometimes used with Apache Spark to build machine learning systems that ingest massive data sets.\n\n\nWhat is data visualization?\nData visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. It is a storytelling tool that provides a way to communicate the meaning behind a data set. Simply put, data visualization helps users — the individuals or teams who generate the data, and in many cases, their audience — make sense of data and make the best data-driven decisions. Good visualizations can magically transform complex data analysis into appealing and easily understood representations that, in turn, inform smarter, more calculated business moves. Using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.\nWhat is a Kaggle?\nKaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners.\nHow does Kaggle work?\nEvery competition on Kaggle has a dataset associated with it and a goal you must reach (i.e., predict housing prices or detect cancer cells). You can access the data as often as possible and build your prediction model. Still, once you submit your solution, you cannot use it to make future submissions.\nThis ensures that everyone is starting from the same point when competing against one another, so there are no advantages given to those with more computational power than others trying to solve the problem.\nCompetitions are separated into different categories depending on their complexity level, how long they take, whether or not prize money is involved, etc., so users with varying experience levels can compete against each other in the same arena.\nWhat is a Pandas in Python?\nPandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.\nWhat is Pandas used for?\nPandas is mainly used for data analysis and associated manipulation of tabular data in DataFrames. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, Parquet, SQL database tables or queries, and Microsoft Excel.\nWhat is difference between NumPy and pandas?\nNumPy library provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, whereas Pandas is capable of offering an in-memory 2d table object called DataFrame. NumPy consumes less memory as compared to Pandas. Indexing of the Series objects is quite slow as compared to NumPy arrays.\n\nWhat are the different types of machine learning?\nMachine learning is generally divided between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. In supervised machine learning, we train machine learning models on labeled data. For example, an algorithm meant to detect spam might ingest thousands of email addresses labeled 'spam' or 'not spam.' That trained model could then identify new spam emails even from data it's never seen. In unsupervised learning, a machine learning model looks for patterns in unstructured data. One type of unsupervised learning is clustering. In this example, a model could identify similar movies by studying their scripts or cast, then group the movies together into genres. This unsupervised model was not trained to know which genre a movie belongs to. Rather, it learned the genres by studying the attributes of the movies themselves. There are many techniques available within.\n\nIs Machine learning a good career?\nMachine learning python is one of the fastest-growing and popular computer science careers today. Constantly growing and evolving, you can apply machine learning to a variety of industries, from shipping and fulfillment to medical sciences. Machine learning engineers work to create artificial intelligence that can better identify patterns and solve problems. The machine learning discipline frequently deals with cutting-edge, disruptive technologies. However, because it has become a popular career choice, it can also be competitive. Aspiring machine learning engineers can differentiate themselves from the competition through certifications, boot camps, code repository submissions, and hands-on experience.\n\nWhat is the difference between machine learning and artifical intelligence?\nMachine learning is a smaller subset of the broader spectrum of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence describes any \"intelligent machine\" that can derive information and make decisions, machine learning describes a method by which it can do so. Through machine learning, applications can derive knowledge without the user explicitly giving out the information. This is one of the first and early steps toward \"true artificial intelligence\" and is extremely useful for numerous practical applications. In machine learning applications, an AI is fed sets of information. It learns from these sets of information about what to expect and what to predict. But it still has limitations. A machine learning engineer must ensure that the AI is fed the right information and can use its logic to analyze that information correctly.\n\nWhat skills should a machine learning engineer know?\nA python machine learning engineer will need to be an extremely competent programmer with in-depth knowledge of computer science, mathematics, data science, and artificial intelligence theory. Machine learning engineers must be able to dig deep into complex applications and their programming. As with other disciplines, there are entry-level machine learning engineers and machine learning engineers with high-level expertise. Python and R are two of the most popular languages within the machine learning field.\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

      "description": "This course is a tutorial on speaker diarization techniques.\n\n\nSpeaker diarization is an advanced topic in speech processing. It solves the problem \"who spoke when\", or \"who spoke what\". It is highly relevant with many other techniques, such as voice activity detection, speaker recognition, automatic speech recognition, speech separation, statistics, and deep learning. It has found various applications in numerous scenarios, such as automatic meeting transcript generation, medical record analysis, media indexing and retrieval, and second pass speech recognition.\n\n\nIn this course, we will first go through the basic concepts and applications of speaker diarization, followed by the scoring and metrics. Then we will introduce the unsupervised methods in speaker diarization, starting with the commonly used modularized framework, followed by an introduction to clustering algorithms, with a focus on spectral clustering and its extensions. Next, we will talk about the problems with clustering algorithms, and introduce the supervised methods in speaker diarization. We will mainly talk about 4 supervised speaker diarization approaches, i.e. UIS-RNN, PIT/EEND, TS-VAD, and DNC. Finally, we will talk about the challenges and future research directions in speaker diarization.\n\n\nFor those who want to dive deep in speaker diarization, we also include video lectures from top speech conferences such as ICASSP and SLT by the instructors as additional learning materials.\n\n\nApart from the lecture videos, we have included small quizzes after each lecture to help you better understand the topics we have covered in the lecture.\n\n\nAlso, speaker diarization is a very practical skill. Thus we have carefully prepared various coding practices and projects, to get you familiar with the most popular toolkits which are used by various researchers and scientists, including SCTK, pyannote-metrics, pyannote-audio and uisrnn.\n\n\nThis course would be a great fit for students, researchers, developers, or product managers who work on audio and speech processing.",

In less than 2 hours, you will learn how to develop and deploy a fake news detection data science project!\nIn essence, you will learn,\n- how to design a real life data science project\n- how to get data to train a machine learning model\n- how to clean and preprocess your data\n- how to create and train a model to learn from your data\n- how to evaluate the performance of the trained model\n- and finally, how to deploy the model in any real-life application of your choice.\nAccording to wikipedia,\n\"Google Colaboratory (also known as Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud and stores its notebooks on Google Drive. Colab was originally an internal Google project; an attempt was made to open source all the code and work more directly upstream, leading to the development of the \"Open in Colab\" Google Chrome extension, but this eventually ended, and Colab development continued internally. As of October 2019, the Colaboratory UI only allows for the creation of notebooks with Python 2 and Python 3 kernels; however, an existing notebook whose kernelspec is IR or Swift will also work, since both R and Swift are installed in the container. Julia language can also work on Colab (with e.g. Python and GPUs; Google's tensor processing units also work with Julia on Colab.\"",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Machine Learning Interview Questions & Answers course by Uplatz.\n\n\nUplatz provides this course on the most frequently asked questions in Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist job interviews. In this Machine Learning interview questions course, you will learn and get familiarized with the correct and comprehensive answers to the trending questions related to Machine Learning.\nAccording to Indeed, the average salary for a machine learning engineer is $149,750 per year in the United States and similar high salaries in other countries too. With more and more organizations making machine learning as a key pillar for innovation and driving growth, there is huge scope for smart and enthusiastic Machine Learning engineers. It is one of the fields having great career prospects, both in terms of the compensation offered as well as considering the variety of challenges available.\n\n\nWhat is Machine Learning?\nMachine learning is the fastest growing subfield of artificial intelligence, where systems have the ability to “learn” through data, statistics and trial and error in order to optimize processes and innovate at quicker rates. Machine learning is giving computers the ability to develop human-like learning capabilities that are allowing them to solve some of the world’s toughest problems, ranging from cancer research to climate change.\nMachine Learning facilitates a system to learn from examples and experience without being explicitly programmed. Hence instead of writing code, what you do is you feed data to the generic algorithm, and the algorithm/ machine itself builds the logic based on the given data. Thus, Machine learning is the science of enabling computers to function without being programmed to do so.\nBy combining software engineering and data analysis, machine learning engineers enable machines to learn without the need for further programming.

Spam filtering, language understanding, text classification, information extraction, question answering, Social website feeds,  Voice recognition and speech-to-text are the other typical applications of natural language processing(NLP)\nThere are many open source Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries and these are some of them:\nNatural language toolkit (NLTK)\nGate NLP library\nApache OpenNLP.\nStanford NLP suite\nMALLET\nNLTK is more popular and the leading platform for building natural language processing(NLP) applications, which is written in python. It provides an intuitive framework along with substantial building blocks, consistent interfaces and data structures.\n\n\nBy the end of this course you will:\nHave an understanding of how to use the Natural Language Tool Kit.\nBe able to load and manipulate your own text data.\nKnow how to formulate solutions to text based problems.\nKnow when it is appropriate to apply solutions such as sentiment analysis and classification techniques.\nWhat is Natural Language Processing (NLP) ?\nNatural Language Processing or NLP is “ability of machines to understand and interpret human language the way it is written or spoken”.\nThe objective of Natural Language Processing(NLP) is to make our computers or machines as much intelligent as the human beings are in understanding various types of  language.\nThe ultimate goal of Natural Language Processing is filling the gap between natural language and machine language.\nNatural language processing (NLP) is able to  analyze, understand, and generate human speech.  The goal of Natural language processing(NLP) is to make interactions between computers and humans just like the interactions between one humans to another human.\nAnd when we say interactions between humans we’re talking about how humans communicate with each other by using natural language. Natural language is a language that is native to people.  English, Spanish, French, and portuguese are all examples of a natural language.\n\nOn the other hand, computers have their artificial languages like SQL, Java, C,.C++ which were constructed to communicate instructions to machines.\n\nBecause computers operate on artificial languages, they are unable to understand natural language. This is the problem that  Natural language processing(NLP) solves. With Natural language processing(NLP) , a computer is able to listen to a natural language being spoken by a person, understand the meaning then respond to it by generating natural language to communicate back to the person.\n\nBut there are also several complex steps involved in that process.Natural language processing(NLP) is a field of computer science that has been around for a while, but has gained much popularity in recent years as advances in technology have made it easier to develop computers with Natural language processing(NLP) abilities.\n\n\nWhy Natural Language Processing is so important ?\nNatural language processing or NLP is important for different reasons to different people. For some, Natural language processing(NLP) offers the utility of automatically harvesting arbitrary bits of knowledge from vast information resources that have only recently emerged. To others, Natural language processing(NLP) is a laboratory for the investigation of the human use of language which is a primary cognitive ability and its relation to thought.\nSo, there is a question arise, who cares? Then let's consider this response: human civilization is drowning in data. In 2008, According to the Google reports, the web had one trillion pages. Today, it estimates the web at 30 trillion pages. Merrill Lynch projects that available data will expand to 40 zettabytes by 2020. These estimates include video and image data, as well as the structured data in databases.\nWith Natural Language Processing(NLP), it is possible to perform certain tasks like Automated Speech and Automated Text Writing in less time.\nDue to the presence of large data or text around, why not we use the computers untiring willingness and ability to run several algorithms to perform tasks in no time.\nThese tasks include other Natural Language Processing(NLP) applications like Automatic Summarization and Machine Translation\nNLP is one of the most important and emerging technology nowadays. Natural Language Processing(NLP) drives many forms of AI you're used to seeing. The reason to focus on this technology instead of something like AI for math-based analysis, is the increasingly large application for Natural Language Processing(NLP)\nIf we think about it this way. Every day, humans say millions of words that other humans interpret to do countless things. At its core, it's simple communication, but we all know words run quite deeper than that. And the context is we derive from everything someone says. Whether they imply something with their body language or in how often they mention any specific word or phrase. While Natural Language Processing(NLP) doesn't focus on voice inflection, it does draw on contextual patterns.\nThis is where it gains its value. Let's use an example to show just how powerful Natural Language Processing(NLP) is when used in a practical situation. When you're typing on mobile, you'll see word suggestions based on what you type and what you're currently typing. That's natural language processing(NLP) in action.\nFree-form text or should I say the Unstructured data,comprises 70%-80% of the data available on computer networks. The information content of this resource is unavailable to governments, public services, businesses, and individuals unless humans read these texts or devise some other means to derive information value from them. Natural language processing(NLP) can be applied to characterize, interpret, or understand the information content of free-form text.\nAt present days, most natural language processing(NLP) aims to characterize text according to arbitrary notions of effective content or similarity as in sentiment analysis, text clustering, and document classification.Some natural language processing(NLP) efforts today aim to interpret free-form text to extract information with which to answer directed questions or populate databases as in information extraction, question-answering, and bioinformatics. This work requires processing with a comparatively more refined sensitivity for intended meaning.\nIt's such a little thing that most of us take for granted, and have been taking for granted for years, but that's why Natural Language Processing(NLP) becomes so important.\nNLP then allows for a quick compilation of the data into terms obviously related to their brand and those that they might not expect. Capitalizing on the uncommon terms could give the company the ability to advertise in new ways.\nAs NLP develops we can expect to see even better human to AI interaction. Devices like Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa, which are now making their way into our homes and even cars, are showing that AI is here to stay.\nThe next few years should see AI technology increase even more, with the global Natural Language Processing(NLP) and AI market expected to push around $60 billion by 2025 (assumed). Needless to say, you should keep an eye on Natural Language Processing(NLP) and AI.\n\n\nHow is Natural language processing used today?\nThere are several different tasks that Natural language processing(NLP) can be used to accomplish, and each of those tasks can be done in many different ways. Let’s look at some of the most common applications for NLP today:\nSPAM FILTERS\nOne of the biggest headaches of email is spam. Natural language processing(NLP) is used filtering the spam mails and messages to set up a first line of defense, services such as Gmail use Natural language processing(NLP) to determine which emails are good and which are spam. These spam filters scan the text in all the emails you receive, and attempt to understand the meaning of that text to determine if it’s spam or not using Natural language processing(NLP).\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\nWouldn’t it be amazing if you could master the stock market without having to do a thing? That’s what algorithmic trading is for. Natural language processing(NLP) comes here to help you in this case.Using Natural language processing(NLP), this technology reads news stories concerning companies and stocks and attempts to understand the meaning of them to determine if you should buy, sell, or hold onto certain stocks.\nANSWERING QUESTIONS\nIf you’ve ever typed a question in Google search, or asked Siri for directions, then you’ve seen this form of Natural language processing(NLP) in action. A major use of Natural language processing(NLP) is to make search engines understand the meaning of what we are asking, and then often times generating natural language in return to give us the answers we’re looking for.\nSUMMARIZING INFORMATION\nThere’s a lot of information on the web, and a lot of that information is in the form of long documents or articles. Natural language processing(NLP) is used to understand the meaning of this information, and then generates shorter summaries of the information so humans can understand it quicker.\nThere are three different levels of linguistic analysis done before performing Natural language processing(NLP) -\nSyntax - What part of given text is grammatically true.\nSemantics - What is the meaning of given text?\nPragmatics - What is the purpose of the text?\nNatural language processing(NLP) deals with different aspects of language such as\nPhonology - It is systematic organization of sounds in language.\nMorphology - It is a study of words formation and their relationship with each other.\nHere are the approaches of Natural language processing(NLP) to understand the  semantic analysis\nDistributional - It employs large-scale statistical tactics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\nFrame-Based - The sentences which are syntactically different but semantically same are represented inside data structure (frame) for the stereotyped situation.\nTheoretical - This approach is based on the idea that sentences refer to the real word (the sky is blue) and parts of the sentence can be combined to represent whole meaning.\nInteractive Learning - It involves pragmatic approach and user is responsible for teaching the computer to learn the language step by step in an interactive learning environment.\nThe true success of Natural language processing(NLP) lies in the fact that humans deceive into believing that they are talking to humans instead of computers.\nMany devices use Natural language processing(NLP) nowadays\nThose are just a handful of the ways Natural language processing(NLP) is used today. But by looking at those few examples you might have spotted some patterns. Have  you noticed that in all examples, Natural language processing(NLP) was used to understand natural language? And in most cases, it was also used to generate natural language.\nIn case the text is composed of speech, speech-to-text conversion is performed.\nThe mechanism of Natural Language Processing(NLP) involves two processes:\nNatural Language Understanding (NLU) and\nNatural Language Generation (NLG).\n\n\nSome real world applications of  Natural Language Processing(NLP)\nLearning has helped computers parse the ambiguity of human language.\nApache OpenNLP, Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK), Stanford NLP are various open source Natural language processing(NLP) libraries used in real world application below.\nHere are multiple ways Natural Language Processing(NLP) is used today:\nThe most basic and well known application of Natural language processing(NLP) is Microsoft Word spell checking.\nText analysis, also known as  sentiment analytics is a key use of Natural language processing(NLP).\nEmail filters are another important application of Natural language processing(NLP). By analyzing the emails that flow through the servers, email providers can calculate the likelihood that an email is spam based its content by using Bayesian or Naive bayes spam filtering.\nCall centers representatives engage with customers to hear list of specific complaints and problems. Mining this data for sentiment can lead to incredibly actionable intelligence that can be applied to product placement, messaging, design, or a range of other use cases using Natural language processing(NLP).\nGoogle and Bing and other search systems use Natural language processing(NLP) to extract terms from text to populate their indexes and to parse search queries.\nGoogle Translate applies machine translation technologies in not only translating words, but in understanding the meaning of sentences to provide a true translation.Another advantage of Natural language processing(NLP).\nMany important decisions in financial markets use Natural language processing(NLP) by taking plain text announcements, and extracting the relevant info in a format that can be factored into algorithmic trading decisions.\nSince the invention of the typewriter, the keyboard has been the king of human-computer interface. But today with voice recognition via  virtual assistants,like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s assistant, Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana respond to vocal prompts using Natural language processing(NLP) and do everything from finding a coffee shop to getting directions to our office and also tasks like turning on the lights in home, switching the heat on etc. depending on how digitized and wired-up our life is.\nQuestion Answering - IBM Watson which use Natural language processing(NLP), is the most prominent example of question answering via information retrieval that helps guide in various areas like healthcare, weather, insurance etc.\nTherefore it is clear that Natural Language Processing(NLP) takes a very important role in new machine human interfaces. It’s an essential tool for leading-edge analytics & is the near future.\nHow Much Does a Natural Language Processing(NLP) Make a Year ?\nThe salaries of Natural Language Processing engineers are also very attractive.\nThe average annual pay for a Natural Language Processing(NLP) Across the U.S. is $123,798 a year.\nData Scientist - $75K to $134K\nSoftware Engineer - $70K to $142K\nMachine Learning Engineer - $57K to $153K\nSenior Data Scientist - $120K to $180K\nSenior Software Engineer - $106K to $178K\nSr. Software Engineer / Developer / Programmer - $91K to $163K\nCareer Opportunities in Natural Language Processing and Companies using Natural Language Processing:\nIn Natural Language Processing(NLP) there are no. of jobs worldwide and the companies which are hiring Natural Language Processing(NLP) experts some are listed below\n\n\nAmazon\nApple\nGoogle\nIBM\nMicrosoft\nIntel\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nSamsung\nAIBrain\nBing\nYahoo\nAnki\nBanjo\nCloudMinds\nDeepmind\nH2O\niCarbonX\nIris AI\nNext IT\nNvidia\nOpenAI\nSalesforce\nSoundHound\nKlevu\nEnglishCentral\nYummly\nInsight Engines\nMindMeld\nDesti\nMarketMuse\nKngine\nNetBase\nNow again coming to this course,So this Natural Language Processing(NLP) course is ideal for beginners to experts to learn the artificial Intelligence technology or those who are new to Natural Language Processing(NLP) engineering or who want to enrich their knowledge in Natural Language Processing(NLP) much more.\nFrom this course you'll get\nIntroduction & Overview on Natural Language Processing(NLP)\nIntroduction to NLTK toolkit\nIntroduction to Machine Learning\nMachine Learning for binary and multi class classification\nIntroduction to Word Embedding in Natural Language Processing(NLP)\nDeep neural networks for word embedding – Word2Vec, GloVe\nDocument and Sentence Embedding in Natural Language Processing(NLP)\nSentiment Analysis in Natural Language Processing(NLP)\nClassical and Deep ML\nClassical and Deep ML\nNeural Machine Translation in Natural Language Processing(NLP)\n\n\nThere are some free to preview of the course,so you can already put a glance over it before buying the course!\nSo what are you waiting for?

      "description": "Why study data science?\nCompanies have a problem: they collect and store huge amounts of data on a daily basis. The problem is that they don't have the tools and capabilities to extract knowledge and make decisions from that data. But that is changing. For some years now, the demand for data scientists has grown exponentially. So much so, that the number of people with these skills is not enough to fill all the job openings. A basic search on Glassdoor or Indeed will reveal to you why data scientist salaries have grown so much in recent years.\n\n\nWhy this course?\nAlmost every course out there is either too theoretical or too practical. University courses don't usually develop the skills needed to tackle data science problems from scratch, nor do they teach you how to use the necessary software fluently. On the other hand, many online courses and bootcamps teach you how to use these techniques without getting a deep understanding of them, going through the theory superficially.\n\n\nOur course combines the best of each method. On the one hand, we will look at where these methods come from and why they are used, understanding why they work the way they do. On the other, we will program these methods from scratch, using the most popular data science and machine learning libraries in Python. Only when you have understood exactly how each algorithm works, we will learn how to use them with advanced Python libraries.\n\n\nCourse content\nIntroduction to machine learning and data science.\nSimple linear regression. We will learn how to study the relationship between different phenomena.\nMultiple linear regression. We will create models with more than one variable to study the behavior of a variable of interest.\nLasso regression. Advanced version of multiple linear regression with the ability to filter the most useful variables.\nRidge regression. A more stable version of multiple linear regression.\nLogistic regression. Most popular classification and detection algorithm. It will allow us to study the relationship between different variables and certain object classes.\nPoisson regression. Algorithm that will allow us to see how several variables affect the number of times an event occurs.\nCentral concepts in data science (overfitting vs underfitting, cross-validation, variable preparation, etc).\n\n\nAny questions? Remember that we have a 30-day full money-back guarantee. No risk for you. That's how convinced we are that you will love the course.",

      "description": "Artificial intelligence is the fastest growing field right now.\nThis course combines Artificial intelligence and Javascript and takes you into the world of 2D game development and creating 2D AI games.\nThere are too many job opportunities in this field today, and the scope is huge. Demand for AI programmers is increasing exponentially every day.\nHave you always wanted to learn artificial intelligence? Were you not able to do so because you never knew where to start? Is everything confusing out there?\nThen our course is the perfect solution to your problem.\n\n\nIn our course,\n-> You'll earn the concepts of artificial intelligence,\n-> Delve more into theories and implementation by learning what MiniMax algorithm is, and how to implement it,\n-> Apply your new found knowledge to create a fully functional Artificial intelligence that can play a Tic Tac Toe game against expert human players.\n-> All the while learning, and becoming proficient in Javascript, HTML5 canvas, HTML5, CSS3, front end web development and 2D game development.\n\n\nWhy take this course?\nYou'll be able to:\n1. Learn the basics of artificial intelligence, its terminologies, the various terms used in the field etc.\n2. Learn what the MiniMax algorithm is and how it's used in developing Zero sum artificial based games in the real world.\n3. Learn how to apply the MiniMax algorithm in a 2D web game like Tic Tac Toe\n4. Learn how to create an unbeatable AI opponent in your games\n5. Learn the basics of Javascript and HTML5 canvas and how to apply it in your Tic Tac Toe game project\n6. Improve your logical problem solving skills\n7. Create a complete dynamic Tic Tac Toe game app with an unbeatable AI with Javascript, HTML5 canvas and css\n8. Improve your web app development, web game development & javascript skills\n9. Improve your front end design and development skills\n10. How to design the game logic for the game and implement it as code\n11. Learn HTML5, CSS3 and much more while developing your game\n12. Add artificial intelligence to your resume with this project as proof of your knowledge\n\n\nHow is this course designed?\nI've made this course as easy to understand as possible. I've structured it in such a way that each section will handle one major part of the course.\nIntroduction: This is where we'll explain how the game works, it's various features and what we'll be using to achieve the same results.\n\nModule 1: We'll explain the basics of artificial intelligence and it's various terminologies. We'll put the ground work you'll need to understand the further concepts explained in this course.\nModule 2: We'll explain what the MiniMax alrogithm is and how it's implemented. We'll use pictorical and graphical representation to explain the concept with 2 detailed examples. We'll also explain the Pseudocode of the algorithm.\n\nModule 3: We'll explain how the MiniMax algorithm can be implemented in creating an artificial intelligence based player (computer player) for a Tic Tac Toe game. We'll explain the concept with another pictorical representation of the entire process.\nModule 4: We'll delve into Javascript and HTML5 canvas concepts that are related to the project we'll be creating. I'll only cover concepts that we'll need for our game's Javascript code though. If you already know the basics, you can skip this module.\nModule 5: We'll be teaching you how to create the bare bones of the app with HTML5. The result will be a page with all the elements we need in our game, devoid any colors or design elements. After that, we'll \"beautify\" our app. We'll be using CSS elements to give our game colors and styles. At the end of this module, we'll have a Tic Tac Toe web game that'll look like the final result, albeit one that is not playable yet.\nModule 6: We'll introduce a step by step algorithm that explains what we'll be doing while creating the Javascript part of our code.\nModule 7: We'll be delving into Javascript & HTML5 canvas code of our game in this module, and we'll teach you how to make the game playable (let the user draw on the canvas and display the game results) in here. In this part, we'll create the necessary code to make the human player play the game on the app.\nModule 8: This would be the meat of the course. In this module, we'll be applying the MiniMax algorithm with relevant Javascript code to create an artificial intelligence that can play against the human player (the web user).\n\n\nThis course is for you if:\n1. If you like learning by doing rather than hours of boring theoretical lectures.\n2. If you've always been interested in artificial intelligence, but you're intimidated by the sheer amount of information available on the subject.\n3. If you want a simplified way of starting out with artificial intelligence.\n4. If you want to pad your resume with an eye-catching skill, a.k.a applied artificial intelligence.\n5. If you don't want to just learn theories but start applying it to create an application you can brag about in your resume. You'll be learning the concepts of MiniMax algorithm, a very important algorithm in artificial intelligence, while applying it to create your AI based Tic Tac Toe game. What better way to learn a concept that's considered difficult for most people?\n6. If you're a complete newbie to the world of web development, or just programming in general, and would like to start creating software with the help of a beginner-friendly course. You'll learn the basics of everything used in this project (HTM5, CSS3, Javascript, HTML canvas).  We'll be explaining every single line of code we'll be using in this course, so you won't feel lost.\n7. If you have the passion for programming, and know the basics of HTML5 and CSS, but you're stuck on the practical aspects of it. Turn your theoretical knowledge into practical knowledge with our course.\n8. If you want to delve into the exciting world of front end web app development, this course will take you a couple steps further in the right direction.\n9. If you're a Javascript web developer who just wants to try out a new project. Our course welcomes coders of every level, from absolute beginners, to pros. By adding artificial intelligence to this project, we've tried to make it interesting for programmers of every level.\n10. If you want to learn HTML5 based 2D game development.\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Get this course today, and begin your journey into the wonderful world of Artificial Intelligence and web game development!",

      "description": "Welcome to the JARVIS AI 3.0 course! This advanced course is designed for those who are interested in building and training their own artificial intelligence (AI) virtual assistant using the latest GPT-3 technology.\n\n\nThroughout the course, you will learn how to create and program a virtual assistant called JARVIS that can understand and generate human-like language, perform a wide range of tasks, and hold intelligent conversations. Some of the capabilities you will be able to teach JARVIS include scheduling and calendar management, email and messaging, internet searches and data lookup, translation, and task automation.\n\n\nTo build and train your JARVIS AI, you will need to have a basic understanding of natural language processing, machine learning, and API development. These concepts will be covered in the course, so no prior knowledge is required. However, having some programming experience will be helpful.\n\n\nUpon completing the JARVIS AI 3.0 course, you will have a fully functional, GPT-3 based AI virtual assistant that you can use in your personal or professional life. Whether you are a beginner to AI or an experienced developer, this course has something to offer. Join us and learn how to create your own intelligent virtual assistant with JARVIS AI 3.0!\n\n\nWhat is AGI?\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of understanding or learning any intellectual task that a human being can. It is also referred to as \"strong AI\" or \"human-level AI.\"\nThe goal of AGI is to create a machine that has a level of intelligence comparable to that of a human being and can perform any intellectual task that a human can. This includes tasks such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and adapting to new situations.\nAGI is different from narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks but is not capable of adapting to new tasks or situations. Some examples of narrow AI include virtual assistants, language translation tools, and self-driving cars.\nAGI is still in the realm of science fiction and is not yet a reality. However, researchers and scientists are working towards developing AGI, and some believe that it may be achievable in the future.",

The focus of AI has been more on building models and analyzing data, while users were asking for crisp outputs and self-use interactive applications. It's not that the data science and AI community was not aware of these needs. The lack of web skills like javascript, html/css etc., became a roadblock. We can't blame data scientists too since data science and web technologies are two separate streams of specializations. So, only a large team with a mix of data science and web technology specialists could build an AI app that users were looking for.\nIn summary, end users wanted a simple web app to view the results of AI algorithms and data scientists wanted a platform to build AI web apps easily & faster. Streamlit addressed both these needs perfectly.\nI am going to demonstrate how to build a healthcare AI app (and few other examples) in less than 50 lines of code using streamlit platform. This covers AI/ML code as well as code for the app including the user interface. We will start with the functionalities of streamlit and then cover how to build and host web applications.\nFor those who are new to AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) are included in the program. Python is also covered extensively to assist those who are looking for a refresher on python topics or new to python itself.\nIn all, this program can be pursued by both experienced professionals as well as those who are new to the world of AI.\nLet's build stunning web based AI apps!",

It is a practical and interactive way to learn about R graphics, all of which are discussed in an easy-to-grasp manner. This course has been designed to include topics on every possible data visualization requirement from a data scientist and it does so in a step-by-step and practical manner.\nWe will start by focusing on “ggplot2” and show you how to create advanced figures for data exploration. Then, we will move on to customizing the plots and then cover interactive plots. We will then cover time series plots, heat maps, dendograms. Following that, we will look at maps and how to make them interactive. We will then turn our attention to building an interactive report using the “ggvis” package and publishing reports and plots using Shiny. Finally, we will cover data in higher dimensions which will complete our extensive tour of the data visualization capabilities possible using R.\nThis course has been authored by some of the best in their fields:\n\nDr. Fabio Veronesi\nIn his career, Dr. Veronesi worked at several topics related to environmental research: digital soil mapping, cartography and shaded relief, renewable energy and transmission line siting. During this time Dr. Veronesi has specialized in the application of spatial statistical techniques to environmental data.\nAtmajitsinh Gohil\nAtmajitsinh Gohil works as a senior consultant at a consultancy firm in New York City. He writes about data manipulation, data exploration, visualization, and basic R plotting functions on his blog. He has a master's degree in financial economics from the State University of New York (SUNY), Buffalo.\nYu-Wei, Chiu (David Chiu)\nYu-Wei, Chiu (David Chiu) is the founder of LargitData, a start-up company that mainly focuses on providing Big Data and machine learning products. In addition to being a start-up entrepreneur and data scientist, he specializes in using Spark and Hadoop to process big data and apply data mining techniques for data analysis.

In this course, you will learn about programming using Apache Spark 3.0 using Python, usually referred as PySpark, along with preparing you for the Databricks certification using Python in a fun and easy way from ground zero.\n\n\nThis course requires zero knowledge on PySpark, and it will take you to an advanced user level of PySpark by the end of this course. We will be only using Python language here, in this course. This course can also be taken by someone who is starting their journey with Apache Spark using Python.\n\n\nThis course focuses on the most important aspects of Apache Spark 3.0 without going into the esoteric side of the Spark framework. Therefore, you will be productive with PySpark with the help of this course in a couple of hours. Additionally, this course covers all the topics required for Databricks certification using Python language.\n\n\nThis course also comes with two bonus projects on Machine learning using PySpark. In those videos, I will talk about how to prepare your data so that it is ready for applying machine learning algorithms along with some hands-on on some machine learning algorithm from the PySpark machine learning framework. I have considered very gentle examples to illustrate the power of PySpark’s machine learning, so it will be very easy to follow along.\n\n\nThis course is ideal if you are an absolute beginner or someone with less than two years of experience with PySpark or if you wish to get certified as a Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark 3.0. This course can also be used by experienced professionals to quickly brush up their basics in PySpark.\n\n\nIn terms of hardware requirements, you just need a computer with an internet connection. We will be using a free Databricks cluster to practice the problems here, so you also don't need to worry about any complicated installations. This is also helpful for many professionals because almost always, we do not have admin access to the computer and we cannot install any software on the computer.

      "description": "This video course will get you up-and-running with one of the most cutting-edge deep learning libraries: PyTorch. Written in Python, PyTorch is grabbing the attention of all data science professionals due to its ease of use over other libraries and its use of dynamic computation graphs.\nIn this course, you will learn how to accomplish useful tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks to process spatial data such as images and using Recurrent Neural Networks to process sequential data such as texts. You will explore how you can make use of unlabeled data using Auto Encoders. You will also be training a neural network to learn how to balance a pole all by itself, using Reinforcement Learning. Throughout this journey, you will implement various mechanisms of the PyTorch framework to do these tasks.\nBy the end of the video course, you will have developed a good understanding of, and feeling for, the algorithms and techniques used. You'll have a good knowledge of how PyTorch works and how you can use it in to solve your daily machine learning problems.\nThis course uses Python 3.6, and PyTorch 0.3, while not the latest version available, it provides relevant and informative content for legacy users of Python, and PyTorch.\nAbout the Author\nAnand Saha is a software professional with 15 years' experience in developing enterprise products and services. Back in 2007, he worked with machine learning to predict call patterns at TATA Communications. At Symantec and Veritas, he worked on various features of an enterprise backup product used by Fortune 500 companies. Along the way he nurtured his interests in Deep Learning by attending Coursera and Udacity MOOCs.\nHe is passionate about Deep Learning and its applications; so much so that he quit Veritas at the beginning of 2017 to focus full time on Deep Learning practices. Anand built pipelines to detect and count endangered species from aerial images, trained a robotic arm to pick and place objects, and implemented NIPS papers. His interests lie in computer vision and model optimization.",

These intelligent entities transcend the role of mere tools; they function as digital collaborators capable of independently managing tasks to achieve specific objectives. Whether given vague directives or precise goals like creating a sales tracker tool, these agents autonomously navigate the task at hand, continually improving their efficiency until the desired outcome is achieved. This level of automation is revolutionary, akin to an indefatigable and highly efficient worker.\n\n\nAccessible to individuals with coding skills, operational autonomous agents are capable of handling diverse tasks, from app development to everyday chores, thereby saving valuable time and resources. Their potential lies in transforming industries, automating mundane tasks, and freeing individuals to focus on more creative pursuits.\n\n\nA notable project in the field of autonomous agents is Microsoft Research's AutoGen. This innovative tool simplifies the development of conversational agents designed to solve problems through interactions with other agents, humans, and tools. The process involves defining conversable agents and interaction behaviors, analogous to scripting a play where the user determines how agents engage in and progress through the conversation.\n\n\nAutoGen's agents possess the ability to interact and collaborate, essentially functioning as a team. Leveraging Language Models (LLMs), human input, and tools, these agents understand language, generate ideas, and make logical decisions. The central role of LLMs supports various agent configurations, including those fine-tuned on private data. Developers can adjust human participation levels, and tools act as specialized utilities to overcome LLM limitations.\n\n\nAutoGen distinguishes itself with features like unified conversation interfaces, facilitating seamless communication among agents. The system empowers automated agent chats to run autonomously, reducing the need for constant human control. This capability streamlines complex workflows and enhances overall efficiency.",

This type of application can be very useful, especially for security systems, in which it is necessary to detect suspicious movements such as a thief trying to enter the house. There are several other applications, such as: traffic analysis on highways, people detection/counting, animal tracking, cyclist counting, among others. A traffic control system can use these techniques to identify the number of cars and trucks that pass through the highway daily and at certain times, so then it is possible to carry out a road maintenance plan.\nIn this course you will learn in practice how to use background subtraction algorithms to detect movements in videos, all step by step and using Python programming language! Check out the main topics you are going to learn, as well as the hands-on projects:\n\nBasic theoretical intuition about the following background subtraction algorithms: Temporal Median Filter, MOG (Mixture of Gaussians), GMG (Godbehere, Matsukawa and Goldbert), KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) and CNT (Count)\nComparison of quality and performance of each algorithm\nPractical project 1: motion detector to monitor environments\nPractical project 2: social distancing detector to identify possible crowds of people\nPractical project 3: car and truck counter on highways\nAt the end of the course, you will be able to create your own motion detection projects!",

You will go from zero to mastery!\n\n\nLearn Data Science and Machine Learning from scratch, get hired, and have fun along the way with the most modern, up-to-date Data Science course on Udemy (we use the latest version of Python, Tensorflow 2.0 and other libraries). This course is focused on efficiency: never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete Machine Learning tutorials anymore. We are pretty confident that this is the most comprehensive and modern course you will find on the subject anywhere (bold statement, we know).\nThis comprehensive and project based course will introduce you to all of the modern skills of a Data Scientist and along the way, we will build many real world projects to add to your portfolio. You will get access to all the code, workbooks and templates (Jupyter Notebooks) on Github, so that you can put them on your portfolio right away! We believe this course solves the biggest challenge to entering the Data Science and Machine Learning field: having all the necessary resources in one place and learning the latest trends and on the job skills that employers want.\n\nThe curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of becoming a professional Machine Learning and Data Science engineer. The course covers 2 tracks. If you already know programming, you can dive right in and skip the section where we teach you Python from scratch. If you are completely new, we take you from the very beginning and actually teach you Python and how to use it in the real world for our projects. Don't worry, once we go through the basics like Machine Learning 101 and Python, we then get going into advanced topics like Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Transfer Learning so you can get real life practice and be ready for the real world (We show you fully fledged Data Science and Machine Learning projects and give you programming Resources and Cheatsheets)!\n\nThe topics covered in this course are:\n\n\n- Data Exploration and Visualizations\n- Neural Networks and Deep Learning\n- Model Evaluation and Analysis\n- Python 3\n- Tensorflow 2.0\n- Numpy\n- Scikit-Learn\n- Data Science and Machine Learning Projects and Workflows\n- Data Visualization in Python with MatPlotLib and Seaborn\n- Transfer Learning\n- Image recognition and classification\n- Train/Test and cross validation\n- Supervised Learning: Classification, Regression and Time Series\n- Decision Trees and Random Forests\n- Ensemble Learning\n- Hyperparameter Tuning\n- Using Pandas Data Frames to solve complex tasks\n- Use Pandas to handle CSV Files\n- Deep Learning / Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras\n- Using Kaggle and entering Machine Learning competitions\n- How to present your findings and impress your boss\n- How to clean and prepare your data for analysis\n- K Nearest Neighbours\n- Support Vector Machines\n- Regression analysis (Linear Regression/Polynomial Regression)\n- How Hadoop, Apache Spark, Kafka, and Apache Flink are used\n- Setting up your environment with Conda, MiniConda, and Jupyter Notebooks\n- Using GPUs with Google Colab\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be a complete Data Scientist that can get hired at large companies.

By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others.\n\n\nHere’s the truth: Most courses teach you Data Science and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is, you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects. Or they show you a lot of code and complex math on the screen, but they don't really explain things well enough for you to go off on your own and solve real life machine learning problems.\n\n\nWhether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Data Science skills, or are coming from a different industry, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no Data Science experience, to someone that can go off, forget about Daniel and Andrei, and build their own Data Science and Machine learning workflows.\n\nMachine Learning has applications in Business Marketing and Finance, Healthcare, Cybersecurity, Retail, Transportation and Logistics, Agriculture, Internet of Things, Gaming and Entertainment, Patient Diagnosis, Fraud Detection, Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing, Government, Academia/Research, Recommendation Systems and so much more. The skills learned in this course are going to give you a lot of options for your career.\nYou hear statements like Artificial Neural Network, or Artificial Intelligence (AI), and by the end of this course, you will finally understand what these mean!\n\n\nClick “Enroll Now” and join others in our community to get a leg up in the industry, and learn Data Scientist and Machine Learning. We guarantee this is better than any bootcamp or online course out there on the topic. See you inside the course!",

      "description": "For data to be useful and meaningful, it must be curated and refined. Data Wrangling with Python teaches you the core ideas behind these processes and equips you with knowledge of the most popular tools and techniques in the domain.\nThe course starts with the absolute basics of Python, focusing mainly on data structures. It then delves into the fundamental tools of data wrangling like NumPy and Pandas libraries. You'll explore useful insights into why you should stay away from traditional ways of data cleaning, as done in other languages, and take advantage of the specialized pre-built routines in Python. This combination of Python tips and tricks will also demonstrate how to use the same Python backend and extract/transform data from an array of sources including the Internet, large database vaults, and Excel financial tables. To help you prepare for more challenging scenarios, you'll cover how to handle missing or wrong data, and reformat it based on the requirements from the downstream analytics tool. The course will further help you grasp concepts through real-world examples and datasets.\nBy the end of this course, you will be confident in using a diverse array of sources to extract, clean, transform, and format your data efficiently.\nAbout the Author\nSamik Sen is currently working with R on Machine Learning.

Data science includes techniques and theories extracted from the fields of statistics, computer science, and most importantly machine learning, databases, and visualization.\nThis video course consists of step-by-step introductions to analyze data and the basics of statistics. The first chapter focuses on the steps to analyze data and which summary statistics are relevant given the type of data you are summarizing. The second chapter continues by focusing on summarizing individual variables and specifically some of the reasons users need to summarize variables. This chapter also illustrates several procedures, such as how to run and interpret frequencies and how to create various graphs. The third chapter introduces the idea of inferential statistics, probability, and hypothesis testing.\nThe rest of the chapters show you how to perform and interpret the results of basic statistical analyses (chi-square, independent and paired sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, post-hoc tests, and bivariate correlations) and graphical displays (clustered bar charts, error bar charts, and scatterplots). You will also learn when to use different statistical techniques, how to set up different analyses, and how to interpret the results.\n\nAbout the Author\nJesus Salcedo has a Ph.D. in Psychometrics from Fordham University.

      "description": "Text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are among the most active research areas. Pre-processing your text data before feeding it to an algorithm is a crucial part of NLP. In this course, you will learn NLP using natural language toolkit (NLTK), which is part of the Python. You will learn pre-processing of data to make it ready for any NLP application.\nWe go through text cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, part of speech tagging, and stop words removal. The difference between this course and others is that this course dives deep into the NLTK, instead of teaching everything in a fast pace.\nThis course has 3 sections. In the first section, you will learn the definition of NLP and its applications. Additionally, you will learn how to install NLTK and learn about its components.\nIn the second section, you will learn the core functions of NLTK and its methods and techniques. We examine different available algorithms for pre-processing text data.\nIn the last section, we will build 3 NLP applications using the methods we learnt in the previous section.\nSpecifically, we will go through developing a topic modeling application to identify topics in a large text. We will identify main topics discussed in a large corpus.\nThen, we will build a text summarization application. We will teach the computer to summarize the large text and to summarize the important points.\nThe last application is about sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis in Python is a very popular application that can be used on variety of text data. One of its applications is Twitter sentiment analysis. Since tweets are short piece of text, they are ideal for sentiment analysis. We will go through building a sentiment analysis system in the last example.\nFinally, we compare NLTK with SpaCy, which is another popular NLP library in Python. It's going to be a very exciting course. Let's start learning.",

The course provides students with practical experience in various self-driving vehicles concepts such as machine learning and computer vision. Concepts such as lane detection, traffic sign classification, vehicle/object detection, artificial intelligence, and deep learning will be presented. The course is targeted towards students wanting to gain a fundamental understanding of self-driving vehicles control. Basic knowledge of programming is recommended. However, these topics will be extensively covered during early course lectures; therefore, the course has no prerequisites, and is open to any student with basic programming knowledge. Students who enroll in this self-driving car course will master driverless car technologies that are going to reshape the future of transportation.\nTools and algorithms we'll cover include:\nOpenCV.\nDeep Learning and Artificial Neural Networks.\nConvolutional Neural Networks.\nYOLO.\nHOG feature extraction.\nDetection with the grayscale image.\nColour space techniques.\nRGB space.\nHSV space.\nSharpening and blurring.\nEdge detection and gradient calculation.\nSobel.\nLaplacian edge detector.\nCanny edge detection.\nAffine and Projective transformation.\nImage translation, rotation, and resizing.\nHough transform.\nMasking the region of interest.\nBitwise_and.\nKNN background subtractor.\nMOG background subtractor.\nMeanShift.\nKalman filter.\nU-NET.\nSegNet.\nEncoder and Decoder.\nPyramid Scene Parsing Network.\nDeepLabv3+.\nE-Net.\nIf you’re ready to take on a brand new challenge, and learn about AI techniques that you’ve never seen before in traditional supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, or even deep learning, then this course is for you.\nMoreover, the course is packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life examples. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get some hands-on practice building your own models. There are five big projects on healthcare problems and one small project to practice. These projects are listed below:\nDetection of road markings.\nRoad Sign Detection.\nDetecting Pedestrian Project.\nFrozen Lake environment.\nSemantic Segmentation.\nVehicle Detection.\nThat is all. See you in class!\n\n\n\"If you can't implement it, you don't understand it\"\nOr as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: \"What I cannot create, I do not understand\".\nMy courses are the ONLY course where you will learn how to implement deep REINFORCEMENT LEARNING algorithms from scratch\nOther courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?\nAfter doing the same thing with 10 datasets, you realize you didn't learn 10 things. You learned 1 thing, and just repeated the same 3 lines of code 10 times...",

      "description": "Welcome to Supply Chain Analysis with Machine Learning & Neural Network course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualization on supply chain dataset. This course will be mainly focusing on performing cost optimization, demand forecasting, lead time efficiency, risk management, and order quantity optimization. We will be utilizing two different models, those are LightGBM which is a machine learning model and RNN which stands for Recurrent Neural Networks. Regarding programming language, we are going to use Python alongside several libraries like Pandas for performing data modelling, Numpy for performing complex calculations, Matplotlib for visualizing the data, and Scikit-learn for implementing the machine learning models.Meanwhile, for the data, we are going to download the supply chain dataset from Kaggle. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of supply chain analytics, such as getting to know its key objectives, getting to know models that will be used, and challenges that we commonly faced when it comes to analyzing supply chain data for example demand volatility and data integration. Then, you will continue by learning the basic mathematics and logics behind price and order quantity optimization where you will be guided step by step on how to solve a basic case study using economic order quantity equation. This session was designed to prepare your knowledge and understanding about order quantity optimization before implementing this concept to your code in the project. Afterward, you will learn about several different factors that can potentially cause supply chain disruption, such as natural disaster, economic volatility, and supplier issues. Once you’ve learnt all necessary knowledge about supply chain analytics, we will start the project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE, then, you will also learn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, you will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will consist of two main parts where in the first part you will use machine learning specifically the LightGBM algorithm while in the second part, you will use Recurrent Neural Network. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will also learn how to evaluate the accuracy of the models that you built in the project using the K-fold cross validation method.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we analyze supply chain data with machine learning and neural networks? Well, there are a lot of answers to that question. Firstly, supply chain is undeniably one of the most important factors in business operation. Let me give you an example, let’s say you have an E-commerce business and you rely only on one supplier and one day, your supplier decided to stop producing the product, what would be your strategy to survive if that is the case. Or let’s talk about another example where you tried to optimize your logistic cost and decided to ship your product to your customers using one freight forwarder because it offers the cheapest fee, nonetheless, you did not realize that actually the freight forwarder does not have the ability to handle your requested capacity, if that is the case, what would be your solution and there are still a lot of complex cases like those in supply chain. Therefore, by utilizing machine learning and neural networks, we will be able to solve those kinds of problems and find the best solutions possible.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn basic fundamentals of supply chain analytics, such as getting to know its key objectives and several challenges commonly faced when analyzing supply chain data\nLearn how to do cost optimization analysis using TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) method\nLearn how to do inventory and order quantity optimization analysis using EOQ (Economic Order Quantity)\nLearn several factors that can potentially cause supply chain disruptions, such as natural disaster, economic volatility, tariff and trade barriers\nLearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\nLearn how to clean dataset by removing missing rows and duplicate values\nLearn how to do quality control check by analyzing defect rate for each product type\nLearn how to do supply chain risk assessment analysis to mitigate potential supply chain disruption risks\nLearn how to do inventory optimization analysis using Economic Order Quantity\nLearn how to do customer segmentation analysis by breaking down generated revenue by its customer demographics\nLearn how to do lead time optimization analysis to find the most optimal transportation mode and route\nLearn how to forecast customer demand using LightGBM model\nLearn how to do cost optimization analysis using Recurrent Neural Network model\nLearn how to do K-Fold Cross Validation method to evaluate the performance of LightGBM forecasting model",

The first few sections in this course set you up with the fundamentals for success, while the advanced sections in the end provide more details on completely building out your architecture.\nThe price of the course is based on the time and effort put into it, but at the same time, I want it to be affordable for all. If the price is an issue, please reach out and I'll be happy to figure it out with you.\nWhat you'll learn\nBy the end of the class, you'll have completely connected your own Terraform and Snowflake accounts following best practices, and you'll be able to manage your Snowflake objects (users, roles, warehouses, databases, etc.) with Terraform. Some of these skills you'll gain include:\nManage all types of Snowflake objects using modules that can easily be reused\nGrant privileges on all of these objects, including future grants that simplify the management of databases and schemas\nCreation and management of roles in a hierarchical structure to simplify grants\nAbility to import existing Snowflake objects into your Terraform configuration\nSetting up a DEV and PROD Snowflake account, and using GitHub to manage it all\nWhy you should use Terraform to manage your Snowflake account\nSnowflake is an incredible data warehouse critical to thousands of organizations. But effectively managing Snowflake at scale has been difficult, until we start taking advantage of Terraform.\nSome of the benefits of using Terraform with Snowflake include:\nSpeeding up manual and repetitive tasks\nStandardization of roles and privileges\nAuditability of privileges\nCode review for the management of Snowflake objects\nEssentially, Terraform allows you to use Infrastructure as Code to manage your Snowflake account. The state of Snowflake objects is controlled by the configuration you set up in Terraform, which makes it simple to manage.\n\n\nAbout Terraform\nTerraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files. There is a specific provider plugin that allows you to manage your Snowflake account with Terraform.",

      "description": "This course is ideal for you if you want to gain knowledge in statistical methods required for Data Science and machine learning!\nLearning Statistics is an essential part of becoming a professional data scientist. Most data science learners study python for data science and ignore or postpone studying statistics. One reason for that is the lack of resources and courses that teach statistics for data science and machine learning.\nStatistics is a huge field of science, but the good news for data science learners is that not all statistics are required for data science and machine learning. However, this fact makes it more difficult for learners to study statistics because they are not sure where to start and what are the most relevant topics of statistics for data science.\nThis course comes to close this gap.\nThis course is designed for both beginners with no background in statistics for data science or for those looking to extend their knowledge in the field of statistics for data science.\nI have organized this course to be used as a video library for you so that you can use it in the future as a reference. Every lecture in this comprehensive course covers a single topic.\nIn this comprehensive course, I will guide you to learn the most common and essential methods of statistics for data analysis and data modeling.\nMy course is equivalent to a college-level course in statistics for data science and machine learning that usually cost thousands of dollars. Here, I give you the opportunity to learn all that information at a fraction of the cost! With 77 HD video lectures, many exercises, and two projects with solutions.\nAll materials presented in this course are provided in detailed downloadable notebooks for every lecture.\nMost students focus on learning python codes for data science, however, this is not enough to be a proficient data scientist. You also need to understand the statistical foundation of python methods. Models and data analysis can be easily created in python, but to be able to choose the correct method or select the best model you need to understand the statistical methods that are used in these models. Here are a few of the topics that you will be learning in this comprehensive course:\n· Data Types and Structures\n· Exploratory Data Analysis\n· Central Tendency Measures\n· Dispersion Measures\n· Visualizing Data Distributions\n· Correlation, Scatterplots, and Heat Maps\n· Data Distribution and Data Sampling\n· Data Scaling and Transformation\n· Data Scaling and Transformation\n· Confidence Intervals\n· Evaluation Metrics for Machine Learning\n· Model Validation Techniques in Machine Learning\n\n\nEnroll in the course and gain the essential knowledge of statistical methods for data science today!",

Whether you're new to GMP or looking to refresh your knowledge, this course will guide you through the critical principles and best practices that ensure high-quality, compliant manufacturing processes.\nWe will begin by exploring the origins of GMP, its creation, and the objectives it seeks to achieve. You will learn why GMP standards are essential for maintaining product safety and quality in the pharmaceutical industry. Following that, we will dive into the importance of personnel within a pharmaceutical company, focusing on the role of each individual in maintaining high GMP standards. A key part of this will be understanding the difference between contamination and mix-ups—two issues often confused—and how to effectively prevent and control both in a GMP-compliant environment.\nNext, we’ll examine the expectations for health, dressing, and behavior according to GMP guidelines. This includes understanding personal hygiene, appropriate attire, and workplace conduct, all critical to maintaining a sterile and safe environment. We’ll then discuss the management of personnel and materials within the facility, covering best practices to ensure efficiency and prevent contamination risks.\nThe course will also cover GMP requirements for equipment design, cleanliness, and maintenance, emphasizing the importance of equipment validation and preventive maintenance. Afterward, we will explore GMP standards for the Quality Control Laboratory, focusing on how contamination and mix-ups can occur in a lab setting and the distinct consequences of these issues in comparison to production environments.\nFinally, we’ll address the importance of proper documentation and record-keeping within GMP compliance. We will focus on Data Integrity, explaining how to ensure accurate and compliant records across all stages of the manufacturing process.\nThis course is ideal for pharmaceutical industry professionals seeking a deeper understanding of GMP, quality assurance, and regulatory affairs professionals, as well as beginners interested in GMP compliance in regulated environments.",

However, around 2017 researchers at Uber stated they had found that simple structural neuroevolution algorithms were competitive with sophisticated modern industry-standard gradient-descent deep learning algorithms.\nDeep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning\nThis course introduces students to the principles of neuroevolution and the techniques used to design and implement neuroevolution algorithms.\nThe course covers the following topics:\nIntroduction to neuroevolution: basic principles and applications\nEvolutionary algorithms: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and evolutionary strategies\nNeural networks: types, architectures, and training techniques\nNeuroevolution algorithms: evolutionary algorithms applied to neural networks\nApplications of neuroevolution: games, and optimization problems\nAdvanced topics: multi-objective neuroevolution, neuroevolution of recurrent neural networks, and deep neuroevolution.\nIn this project, we have applied GeneticEvolution to multiple games such as self-driving cars, smart caps and flappy bird.\n\n\nThis course is a follow-up to my other course about Artificial Neural Networks from scratch, where I show how to create an ANN from scratch without libraries. In that project, the learning process is done using backpropagation(gradient descent), this project uses a different approach. We will use Evolutionary Algorithm.\n\n\nBy following this course until the end,  students will have a solid understanding of the principles of neuroevolution and the ability to design and implement Neuroevolution algorithms for a variety of applications.",

The training program will help the trainee to perform all the statistical analysis with Minitab. It is also intended to make the trainees cover all the topics that fall under the domain of Minitab. Topics like Minitab GUI and Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Analysis using Minitab, Correlation Techniques in Minitab and Predictive Modeling using Excel will be covered in this training module and Project on Data Analytics using Minitab and Project on Minitab – Regression Modeling will be covered in the project module. The goal of this course is to help an individual to achieve knowledge of working with Minitab to perform time series analysis and forecasting of data in all sorts of statistics based problems. It will help all the interested trainees who are willing to extend their knowledge base concerned with Data analytics. This training will also assist the trainees to understand the sort of problems that could be resolved using this. After the finishing of the course, the trainee will advance with the skills needed for time series analysis and forecasting of data.\nTo understand the meaning of the “name” of the course, let us break down the curse and understand them word by word so that the intent of the course would be clear to our learners and we would set an expectation for our learners who would be pursuing the course. Let us start to understand what Minitab is. Minitab is a software used in use cases of statistics. Minitab, as the software is capable of data analysis, pattern detection through statistics, data crunching. Most of the calculation is automated, and graphs are generated as per the functionality required by the analyst working on the use cases. For this course specifically, we would be exploiting the use of Minitab for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.\nNow, let us understand what time series analysis is. Time series data is a collection of data over some time or interval. The data when captured over time typically might have some internal structure, for example, autocorrelation, trends, seasonality, stationarity, and many such fundamentals. For example, let us think about the sales of umbrellas or raincoats. We can see that in the selling of these items we might encounter a seasonality aspect, that they might be sold high during the onset of the rainy season. Also, we can see that the data itself might auto-correlate itself to the promos that might have been set by some stores, online or offline, and many more such intricate detailing through the understanding of time series analysis fundamentals.\nNow when we know how to analyze the time series it becomes pretty evident that what exactly to do with the studies or hypothesis we developed as a part of the study. The answer lies in prediction! We would understand the fundamentals through historical time series data and then utilize that deep insight to predict or forecast for the future. In this way, we would be able to capture the historical trends and seasonality and utilize them to have a better insight into what’s in store in the future.\nThis course is a collection of well-crafted tutorials or topics we would naturally go about if we must fully understand the topic of time series analysis and forecasting. This course will allow you to get a sense of what is lying in the basket of time series analysis in the professional project which you would encounter as soon as you take up the project in your organization. This course makes you reach that level of being the “handful” of people who are capable of cracking even the toughest nut in the professional world.\nThis confidence you build in the course of this training will go a long way in not only analyzing the sense of time series data but also give you the capability to mentor people who would have just started their track on time series analysis. This course doesn’t differentiate between a beginner or an advanced learner. We have to learn for everyone who is here to expand their horizon of knowledge. Lastly, we would like to mention that this course will lay a strong foundation in time series analysis so that you would be able to build a strong mansion on this foundation layer.",

This course or training can also be used by people who want to bridge the gap in moving to the next role. This course, as we say, has those ingredients to bridge the gap. Also, for people who have been in the space of time series analysis and want to have a quick revision, this course is not bad either!

      "description": "Understanding how we can derive valuable information from the data has become an everyday expectation. Previously, organizations looked up to data scientists. Nowadays, organizations liberate data science. Everyone can contribute to the efforts of turning data into valuable information. Thus, even if your aspirations are not to be a data scientist, open yourself the door to these projects by gaining so-necessary intuitive understanding. With this course, you can take the first step into the world of data science! This course will explain how data science models create value from the absolute basics even if you feel like a complete beginner to the topic.\nThree data scientists deliver the course, with cumulative 15 years of professional and academic experience. Hence, we won't repeat the textbooks. We will uncover a valuable bit of this lucrative field with every lecture and take you closer to your desired future role around data science projects. We do not teach programming aspects of the field. Instead, we entirely focus on data science's conceptual understanding. As practice shows, real-world projects tremendously benefit by incorporating practitioners with thorough, intuitive knowledge.\nOver 6 hours of content, consisting of top-notch video lectures, state-of-the-art assignments, and intuitive learning stories from the real world. The narrative will be straightforward to consume. Instead of boring you with lengthy definitions, the course will enlighten you through dozens of relatable examples. We will put ourselves in the shoes of ice cream vendors, environmentalists examining deer migrations, researchers wondering whether storks bring babies, and much more! After the course, you will be aware of the basic principles, approaches, and methods that allow organizations to turn their datasets into valuable and actionable knowledge!\nThe course structure follows an intuitive learning path! Here is an outline of chapters and a showcase of questions that we will answer:\nChapter 1: \"Defining data science\". We start our journey by defining data science from multiple perspectives. Why are data so valuable? What is the goal of data science? In which ways can a data science model be biased?\nChapter 2: \"Disciplines of Data Science\". We continue by exploring individual disciplines that together create data science - such as statistics, big data, or machine learning. What is the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning? Who is a data scientist, and what skills does s/he need? Why do data science use cases appear so complex?\nChapter 3: \"Describing and exploring data\". We tackle descriptive and exploratory data science approaches and discover how these can create valuable information. What is a correlation, and when is it spurious? What are outliers, and why can they bias our perceptions? Why should we always study measures of spread?\nSection 4: \"Inference and predictive models\". Herein, we focus on inferential and predictive approaches. Is Machine Learning our only option when creating a predictive model? How can we verify whether a new sales campaign is successful using statistical inference?\nSection 5: \"Bonus section\". We provide personal tips on growing into data science, recommended reading lists, and more!\nWe bring real-life examples through easy-to-consume narratives instead of boring definitions. These stories cover the most critical learnings in the course, and the story-like description will make it easier to remember and take away. Example:\n\"Do storks bring babies?\" story will teach us a key difference among correlation, causation, and spurious correlation.\n\"Are we seeing a dog or a wolf?\" story will explain why it is crucial to not blindly trust a Machine Learning model as it might learn unfortunate patterns.\n\"Is the mushroom edible?\" case will show a project that might be a complete failure simply because of a biased dataset that we use.\n\"Which house is the right one?\" story will explain why we frequently want to rely on Machine Learning if we want to discover some complex, multi-dimensional patterns in our data.\n\"I love the yellow walkman!\" is a case from 20 years ago, when a large manufacturer was considering launching a new product. If they relied on what people say instead of what data say, they would have a distorted view of reality!\n\"Don't trust the HIPPO!\" is a showcase of what is, unfortunately, happening in many organizations worldwide. People tend to trust the Highest Paid Person's Opinion instead of trusting what the data says.\nThe course is interactive! Here is what you will meet:\nAssignments in which you can practice the learned concepts and apply your creative and critical thinking.\nQuizzes on which you can demonstrate that you have gained the knowledge from the course.\nYou can take away many handouts and even print them for your future reference!\nShareable materials that you can use in your daily work to convey a vital Data Science message.\nReference and valuable links to valuable materials and powerful examples of Data Science in action.\nImportant reminder: This course does not teach the programming aspects of the field. Instead, it covers the conceptual and business learnings.",

The project received an astronomical funding of 749,000,000 Euros.\nThese days, you don’t need such budgets for artificial intelligence. All you need is a computer with Python on it! But where to start to build the AI for self-driving cars?\nIn this course you learn to build Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms from the ground up. Without frameworks that hide all the interesting stuff in a black box, you are going to build a program that trains self-driving cars.\nYou will learn and assemble all the required building blocks and will be amazed that in no time cars are learning to drive autonomously. There is only one way to learn AI and that is to just pick a project and start building. That is what you are going to do in this course!\n\n\nTarget audience\n\nDevelopers who especially benefit from this course, are:\ndevelopers who want to use their basic Python skills to program self-driving cars.\ndevelopers who want to understand Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms by building them from the ground up.\n\n\nChallenges\n\nArtificial Intelligence is a black box to many developers.

      "description": "ML Ops topped LinkedIn’s Emerging Jobs ranking, with a recorded growth of 9.8 times in five years.\nMost individuals looking to enter the data industry possess machine learning skills. However, most data scientists are unable to put the models they build into production. As a result, companies are now starting to see a gap between models and production. Most machine learning models built in these companies are not usable, as they do not reach the end-user’s hands. ML Ops engineering is a new role that bridges this gap and allows companies to productionize their data science models to get value out of them.\nThis is a rapidly growing field, as more companies are starting to realize that data scientists alone aren’t sufficient to get value out of machine learning models. It doesn’t matter how highly accurate a machine learning model is if it is unusable in a production setting.\nMost people looking to break into the data industry tend to focus on data science. It is a good idea to shift your focus to ML Ops since it is an equally high-paying field that isn’t highly saturated yet.\nLearn ML Ops from the ground up! ML Ops can be described as the techniques for implementing and automating continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous training for machine learning systems. As most of you know, the majority of ML models never see life outside of the whiteboard or Jupyter notebook. This course is the first step in changing that!\nTake your ML ideas from the whiteboard to production by learning how to deploy ML models to the cloud! This includes learning how to interact with ML models locally, then creating an API (FastAPI & gRPC), containerize (Docker), and then deploy (AWS & GCP). At the end of this course you will have the foundational knowledge to productionize your ML workflows and models.\nCourse outline:\n1. Introduction\n2. Environment set up\n3. PyTorch model inference\n4. Tensorflow model inference\n5. API introduction\n6. FastAPI\n7. gRPC\n8. Containerize our APIs using Docker\n9. Deploy containers to AWS\n10. Deploy containers to GCP\n11.

Then this course is for you!\nThrough this course, you will learn how to use backcasting as a powerful tool for planning and decision-making, leveraging the power of generative AI and chat GPT to explore what is possible and what is needed to achieve a solar punk future. You will also learn how to utilize the concept of ikigai to identify your perfect role in the world and how to use systems change to transform the systems and structures that shape our world.\nUsing these powerful tools and techniques, you will work backwards from a solar punk future to identify the steps needed to get there and how you can contribute to the realization of this aspirational and feasible vision.\nJoin us on this journey to co-create a better future for ourselves and the world!\nHere are some reasons why someone might love this course:\nThey want to learn how to use backcasting as a powerful tool for planning and decision-making.\nThey are interested in using generative AI and chat GPT to explore what is possible and what is needed to achieve a solar punk future.\nThey want to learn how to utilize the concept of ikigai to identify their perfect role in the world and contribute to the realization of a solar punk future.\nThey are interested in learning how to use systems change to transform the systems and structures that shape our world.\nThey want to co-create a hopeful and realistic vision for the world with the help of advanced artificial intelligence and global wisdom.\nBackcasting can be applied at various levels - from the individual to the global level - to create a hopeful and realistic vision for the future.\nAt the individual level, backcasting can be used to identify one's perfect role in the world and how they can contribute to the realization of a solar punk future. It can help individuals to understand their strengths, passions, and values and how they can align them with the needs of the world.\nAt the family level, backcasting can be used to co-create a vision for the future that reflects the hopes and needs of all members of the family. It can help families to identify their unique strengths and how they can work together to contribute to the world in meaningful ways.\nFor systems change oriented products and services, backcasting can be used to identify the steps needed to create a more just and sustainable world. It can help organizations to understand the systems and structures that shape our world and how they can use their resources and expertise to transform them for the better.\nAt the global level, backcasting can be used to create a vision for a world that thrives for all. It can help us to understand the interconnections between different systems and how we can work together to create a better future for everyone.\n\n\nThis course leverages the work of Donella Meadows on vision in the policy process to help learners understand the importance of having a clear, feasible, and shared vision for a sustainable future. Meadows argues that envisioning a better world is a skill that can be developed, and this course will provide learners with the tools and techniques to develop this skill. Through the use of generative AI and backcasting methods, learners will learn how to build a responsible vision of a solar punk future that meets the needs of all people and preserves the natural systems of the world. By focusing on the values and motivations that drive the policy process, learners will be able to create a shared vision that can be used to guide their systems change efforts and contribute to the creation of a more just and sustainable world.",

      "description": "A data engineer is someone who creates big data ETL pipelines, and makes it possible to take huge amounts of data and translate it into insights. They are focused on the production readiness of data and things like formats, resilience, scaling, and security.\nSQL Server Integration Services is a component of the Microsoft SQL Server database software that can be used to perform a broad range of data migration tasks. SSIS is a platform for data integration and workflow applications. It features a data warehousing tool used for data extraction, transformation, and loading .\nETL, which stands for extract, transform and load, is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store that is loaded into a data warehouse or other target system.\nAn ETL pipeline is the set of processes used to move data from a source or multiple sources into a database such as a data warehouse or  target databases.\nSQL Server Integration Service (SSIS) provides an convenient and unified way to read data from different sources (extract), perform aggregations and transformation (transform), and then integrate data (load) for data warehousing and analytics purpose. When you need to process large amount of data (GBs or TBs), SSIS becomes the ideal approach for such workload.\nWeb scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.",

MySQL is available on almost all web-hosting platforms and geospatial capabilities have been part of the core MySQL distribution since version 5.6.  This means that is far easier and less expensive to setup and deploy a spatial database with MySQL than other options such as PostGIS. At this point it does not have all the bells and whistles that PostGIS has but all of the important core functionality is there. This course uses the latest (as of 11/22) versions of MySQL (8.0, and QGIS (3.28). I believe it is the most current and thorough course on spatial databases available today. You will learn\nWhat a spatial database is and why you would want to use one.\nWhat SQL is, why you would want to use it, and how it can be applied to geospatial concepts.\nHow to install MySQL locally for development purposes and how to access a production version via a network or the internet.\nHow to load your spatial data into MySQL and access it from a variety of clients, especially QGIS\nThe basics of SQL for both spatial and non-spatial queries\nHow to validate data and control user access with the tools built-in to MySQL\nOptimizing your queries for the best performance\nThe basics of programming custom functions with the MySQL stored procedure language\nThe basics of database administration to keep your database operating smoothly\nDeploy your database on a web'hosting service so that it is available to anyone with an internet connection (assuming they have been granted access priveleges)",

      "description": "Attention: Please read careful about the description, especially the last paragraph, before buying this course.\n\n\nThe Wavelet Transforms (WT)  or wavelet analysis is probably the most recent solution to overcome the shortcomings of the Fourier Transform (FT). WT transforms a signal in period (or frequency) without losing time resolution.  In the signal processing context, WT provides a method to decompose an input signal of interest into a set of elementary waveforms, i.e. “wavelets”, and then analyze the signal by examining the coefficients (or weights) of these wavelets.\nWavelets transform can be used for stationary and nonstationary signals, including but not limited to the following:\nnoise removal from the signals\ntrend analysis and forecasting\ndetection of abrupt discontinuities, change, or abnormal behavior, etc. and\ncompression of large amounts of data\nthe new image compression standard called JPEG2000 is fully based on wavelets\ndata encryption, i.e. secure the data\nCombine it with machine learning to improve the modelling accuracy\nTherefore, it would be great for your future development if you could learn this great tool.  Practical Python Wavelet Transforms includes a series of courses, in which one can learn Wavelet Transforms using word-real cases. The topics of  this course series includes the following topics:\nPart (I): Fundamentals\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)\nStationary Wavelet Transform (SWT)\nMultiresolutiom Analysis (MRA)\nWavelet Packet Transform (WPT)\nMaximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT)\nMultiresolutiom Analysis based on MODWT (MODWTMRA)\nThis course is the fundamental part of this course series, in which you will learn the basic concepts concerning Wavelet transforms, wavelets families and their members, wavelet and scaling functions and their visualization, as well as setting up Python Wavelet Transform Environment. After this course, you will obtain the basic knowledge and skills for the advanced topics in the future courses of this series.

Then this course is for you!\nEver since Transformers arrived on the scene, deep learning hasn't been the same.\nMachine learning is able to generate text essentially indistinguishable from that created by humans\nWe've reached new state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks, such as machine translation, question-answering, entailment, named entity recognition, and more\nIn this course, you will learn very practical skills for applying transformers, and if you want, the detailed theory behind how transformers and attention work.\n\n\nThere are several reasons why this course is different from any other course. The first reason is that it covers all basic natural language process techniques, so you will have an understanding of what natural language processing is. The second reason is that it covers GPT-2, NER, and BERT which are very popular in natural language processing. The final reason is that you will have lots of practice projects with detailed explanations step-by-step notebook so you can read it when you have free time.\n\n\nThe course is split into 4 major parts:\nBasic natural language processing\nFundamental Transformers\nText generation with GPT-2\nText classification\n\n\nPART 1: Using Transformers\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn about the fundamental of the natural language process. It is really important to understand basic natural language processing before learning transformers. In this section we will cover:\n\n\nWhat is natural language processing (NLP)\nWhat is stemming and lemmatization\nWhat is chunking\nWhat is a bag of words?\nIn this section, we will build 3 small projects. These projects are:\nGender identification\nSentiment analyzer\nTopic modelling\nPART 2: Fundamental transformer\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how transformers really work. We will also introduce the new concept called Hugging face transformer and GPT-2 to have a big understanding of how powerful the transformer is.\nIn this section, we will implement two projects.\nIMDB project\nQ&A project implementation\n\n\nPART 3: Project: Text generation with GPT-2\n\n\nIn this project, we will generate text with GPT-2. This is a project for us to practice and reinforce what we have learned so far. It will also demonstrate how text is generated quickly with a transformer.\n\n\nPART 4: Token classification.\n\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to classify a text using a transformer. We will also learn about NER which is also popular in transformers.  The main project in this section is about Q &A project and  it will be more advanced than the previous Q & A project.",

By using drone images, one can create detailed maps and models of the earth through a process called Photogrammetry. Essentially, you computer analyzes the same area in multiple images and calculates a 3D model. Because of photogrammetry's usefulness, it is very expensive. However, there is a better way. A great way to get started with this is downloading and installing Open Drone Map, a free and open source software package available to everyone on the web. This course instructs you on how to:\n\n\nDownload and Install Open Drone Map, a free and open source photogrammetry software package\nLoad in photos that you took with your drone\nCreate data products such as Orthophotos, Orthomosaics, Digital Surface Models, Digital Terrain Models, 3D models\nTake these data products and get them into GIS software for further analysis\nYour Instructor has been making digital maps for over 30 years and teaching digital map making techniques at a University in Boston, MA for over 15 years. He has taught countless GIS labs using both ESRI products and, as of late, QGIS software. Around 5 years ago, the drones arrived and have allowed map makers to create high resolution background images of their study areas. As the digital mapping field matures into 3D visualization, drones as data collection machines continue to increase in usefulness.\nThis course is designed for folks who want to get started in Photogrammetry without having to pony up big bucks for the commercial software. With ODM, you can learn all you want for free. You may graduate up more complicated software at some point if your products start turning a real profit. You may find however that ODM fills all your needs and you'll never have to pay those high costs.\nThe course comes with instructions on how to get to many sample data sets as well as written instructions for software installation. With this course you have everything you need to get up and running. Now is the time to level up your drone game!",

We will be using a non-cloud-based machine-learning tool called Model Builder, inside of Visual Studio. There will be zero coding involved (except for the very last lesson). But even though there is little coding involved, you will still get a very detailed understanding of complex machine-learning concepts.\n\n\nThis course requires you to have at least some theoretical exposure to the concepts of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. This course is designed to build on a basic, theoretical understanding of machine learning by doing a practical machine-learning exercise. The concepts taught in this course are foundational and will be relevant in the future, regardless of what machine learning platform or programming language you use.\n\n\nIn the process, you will also get some exposure to Visual Studio, code projects, solutions, and the Microsoft Machine Learning ecosystem. But that is just a side benefit. This course focuses on machine learning itself, not the tools that are used.\n\n\nIf you've already done any kind of machine learning or trained a model, this course might be too basic for you.

The main differences between a Neural Network and Genetical Algorithm are also highlighted into this section\nGenetical Algorithm: The basic concepts are taken care of over here starting from the basics like a fitness function which as I like to call it, a major driver into the direction of learning or output that your program will eventually take up. Elitism, followed by Mating or crossover or mutation which are the key factors responsible for the 'learning' in machine learning are explained well in detail over here.\nGuess-the-phrase: This is our first programming project based on Python. It is a light-weight project which serves a good purpose of providing clarity into the various aspects of Genetical Algorithm.\nPath-Finder: This will be our second project which will use the concepts initialised in the first project to a new depth. This will be our first project where we will be having some graphical (non-terminal) output.\nFlappy Bird: A JavaScript Flappy Bird  will be created which used genetic algorithm to simulate multiple players and use neural network to play the game\nThis course is created by keeping absolute beginners in mind. If you are a professional and find the course to be a bit slower. You can always view the lectures at 2x speed\n\n\nI hope you take away something useful from this course and use it to create awesome new programs which in turn will be your contribution in making the world a better place",

This is especially true if you need to generate and code data visualizations yourself.\nThis course is designed to provide you with a compact, and easy to understand, set of videos that focus on the basic principles behind many common data visualization and how you can code them in Stata.\nThe course is modular; just click on the graphs that you are most interested in and learn away. You do not need to follow this course linearly.\nThis course will teach you many different methods to visualize data and how to generate these yourself in Stata\nVisualizing and graphing data is a vital in modern data analytics. Whether you are a data scientist, student of quantitative methods or a business user, having an understanding of how to visualise data is an important aspect in getting data information across to other stakeholders. Many different ways of visualising data have been devised and some are better than other. However, each method has advantages and disadvantages and having a solid understanding of what visualization might be best suited is key to delivering a concise and sharp \"data message\".\nOften, it takes years of experience to accumulate knowledge of the different graphs and plots. In these videos, I will outline some of the most important data visualization methods and explain, without any equations or complex statistics, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each technique.\nI will also demonstrate how each graph can be created, modified and customised in Stata.\nThe main learning outcomes are:\nTo learn and understand the basic methods of data visualization\nTo learn, in an easy manner, variations and customisations of basic visualization methods\nTo gain experience of different data visualization techniques and how to apply them\nTo learn and code many Stata graphs\nTo gain confidence in your ability to modify and create bespoke data visualisations in Stata\nPlease note the following: You should have some understanding of how Stata works and what .do files are. If you are totally new to Stata you should take a look at my \"Essential Guide To Stata\" course that explains Stata from the ground up. This course focuses specifically on how to create many different types of graphs and all their possible options and sub-options.\nSpecific themes include:\nHistograms\nDensity plots\nSpike plots\nRootograms\nBox plots\nViolin plots\nStem-and-Leaf plots\nQuantile plots\nBar graphs\nPie charts\nDot charts\nRadar plots\nScatter plots\nHeat plots\nHex plots\nSunflower plots\nLines of best fit\nArea plots\nLine plots\nRange plots\nRainbow plots\nJitter plots\nTable plots\nBaloon plots\nMosaic plots\nChernoff faces\nSparkling plots\nBubble plots\nand more",

      "description": "Practical Foundations of R Programming is the first course of a learning path that teaches critical foundation skills necessary to create quality code using the free and open-access R programming language. This course, and the courses that follow, are useful for both beginner and intermediate R programmers who want to understand the unique features of R and why \"R works the way it does.\" I have been using, teaching, and writing applications in R for 6 years and have come to appreciate that R is a beautiful and elegant language that is especially well-suited for writing applications for data analytics, and for mathematical and statistical applications. Furthermore, R is superior in terms of inherent graphical data presentation capabilities that go hand-in-hand with exploring and understanding data relationships.\nMost introductory R courses, those that do not directly address sharpening one's R programming skills, first teach the important R data structures, then the basics of R functions, and generally the use of base R graphics capabilities. However, these introductory R courses are not targeted at the R programmer population, but rather at the general R user population. This course, Practical Foundations of R Programming, which contains all-unique material compared to my other Udemy R courses, addresses R data structures, R subsetting, and R functions, but from the focused perspective of someone who intends to write efficient higher-level applications using R. It is specifically intended to teach the most important foundation concepts and features of the R programming language which are necessary to understand to write efficient and effective applications in R.\nThis course, which is exclusively \"hands-on,\" demonstrates the construction and use of R code within the RStudio IDE, and focuses on the unique features of R that can make writing applications in R both a challenge and a delight. The course does not present a single power point slide and relies heavily on user exercises. In each of the three major sections of the course, (1) data structures, (2) subsetting, and (3) functions, there are multiple sets of within-section exercises, as well as a final end-of-section exercise set. Participants are encouraged to complete each set of exercises \"on their own\" before they view the videos that present the exercise solutions. All course videos, and all exercises, as well as their solutions, are presented within R scripts that are made accessible with the course materials. Anything and everything that you see me demonstrate and/or discuss in the 100+ course videos are available for you to download at the beginning of the course.\nThe second course in this learning path, which should be available to you by the time you complete this first course, will delve more deeply into functional programming in R per se. The second course will have a similar format to this first course: all \"hands-on\" with extensive use of practical and relevant in-section, and end-of-section, exercises.",

Then, we will transform and manipulate real data. For the manipulation, we will use the tidyverse package, which involves dplyr and other necessary packages.\nAt the end of the course, you will be able to select columns, filter rows, arrange the order, create new variables, and group by and summarize your data simultaneously.\nIn this course you will learn;\nHow to use Anaconda and Jupyter notebook,\nFundamentals of Python such as\nDatatypes in Python,\nLots of datatype operators, methods, and how to use them,\nConditional concept, if statements\nThe logic of Loops and control statements\nFunctions and how to use them\nHow to use modules and create your own modules\nData science and Data literacy concepts\nFundamentals of Numpy for Data manipulation such as\nNumpy arrays and their features\nHow to do indexing and slicing on Arrays\nLots of stuff about Pandas for data manipulation such as\nPandas series and their features\nDataframes and their features\nHierarchical indexing concept and theory\nGroupby operations\nThe logic of Data Munging\nHow to deal effectively with missing data effectively\nCombining the Data Frames\nHow to work with Dataset files\nAnd also you will learn fundamentals thing about the Matplotlib library such as\nPyplot, Pylab and Matplotlb concepts\nWhat Figure, Subplot, and Axes are\nHow to do figure and plot customization\nExamining and Managing Data Structures in R\nAtomic vectors\nLists\nArrays\nMatrices\nData frames\nTibbles\nFactors\nData Transformation in R\nTransform and manipulate a deal data\nTidyverse and more\nPython and r\nR programming\ndata science\ndata science with r\nr python\ndata science with r and python\npython r programming\nnumpy python\npython r data science\npython data science\nAnd we will do many exercises.  Finally, we will also have 4 different final projects covering all of Python subjects.\n\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science python uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Python data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science using python includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a python for data science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\nWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?\nPython for data science is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up.\nDoes data science require coding?\nThe jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skillset.\nWhat skills should a data scientist know?\nA data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings.\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\n\n\nWhat is R and why is it useful?\nThe R programming language was created specifically for statistical programming. Many find it useful for data handling, cleaning, analysis, and representation. R is also a popular language for data science projects. Much of the data used for data science can be messy and complex. The programming language has features and libraries available geared toward cleaning up unorganized data and making complex data structures easier to handle that can't be found in other languages. It also provides powerful data visualization tools to help data scientists find patterns in large sets of data and present the results in expressive reports. Machine learning is another area where the R language is useful. R gives developers an extensive selection of machine learning libraries that will help them find trends in data and predict future events.\nWhat careers use R?\nR is a popular programming language for data science, business intelligence, and financial analysis. Academic, scientific, and non-profit researchers use the R language to glean answers from data. R is also widely used in market research and advertising to analyze the results of marketing campaigns and user data. The language is used in quantitative analysis, where its data analysis capabilities give financial experts the tools they need to manage portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Data scientists use R in many industries to turn data into insights and predict future trends with its machine learning capabilities. Data analysts use R to extract data, analyze it, and turn it into reports that can help enterprises make better business decisions. Data visualization experts use R to turn data into visually appealing graphs and charts.\nIs R difficult to learn?\nWhether R is hard to learn depends on your experience. After all, R is a programming language designed for mathematicians, statisticians, and business analysts who may have no coding experience. For some beginning users, it is relatively simple to learn R. It can have a learning curve if you are a business analyst who is only familiar with graphical user interfaces since R is a text-based programming language. But compared to other programming languages, users usually find R easier to understand. R also may have an unfamiliar syntax for programmers who are used to other programming languages, but once they learn the syntax, the learning process becomes more straightforward. Beginners will also find that having some knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and probabilities makes learning R easier.\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R, you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too.

      "description": "Welcome!\nThis course is carefully designed for you to learn the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing and then to advance gradually and to solve complex NLP problems using Machine Learning. Everything taught in this course is completely hands on. So you will be able to learn things by doing them yourself.\nYou don't need prior experience in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning or even Python. But you should be comfortable with programming, and should be familiar with at least one programming language. Python is by far one of the best programming language to work on Machine Learning problems and it applies here as well. If you're new to Python, don't worry, I'll explain what you need to know, just before using it.\nIn this course, we use Google Colab to run our code. So, you don't have to install or configure anything in your machine. It doesn't matter what's your OS or hardware spec, as long as you have access to the Internet. But if you're interested, the same code can be run on Jupyter Notebook, installed in your machine.\nFirst we will explore the basic concepts of Natural Language Processing, such as tokenization, stemming and lemmatization using NLTK. You will learn more than one way to get these things done, so you can understand the pros and cons of different approaches. Then we will study some pre-processing techniques for removing stop-words, whitespaces, punctuations, symbols, new lines, etc.\nNext we will move to SpaCy - a state of the art NLP library heavily used in the industry. We will explore the NLP pipeline, and more advanced concepts such as Named Entity Recognition and Syntactic Dependencies. These techniques allow your code to automatically understand concepts like money, time, companies, products, locations, and many more simply by analysing the text information.\nThere we will cover Part-of-Speech tagging as well, where your code will be able to automatically assign words in text to their appropriate part of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives, an essential part of building intelligent language systems.\nAfter that, you will learn how to transform text into a format where the computer can understand. This process is called vectorization. There're more than one way to do this, and you will learn the two most common mechanisms. Count vectorization and TF-IDF vectorization.\nNext, we will move to Text Classification, where we will start using Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing. We will build a fully functioning model to classify IMDb movie reviews. There you will learn how to perform data cleansing, pre-processing, feature engineering, model training and testing. We will try out few different machine learning algorithms from the scikit-learn library, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Linear SVC, and we will explore how to improve the performance on each case. You will be able to use the learnings from this section to address real world NLP problems, such as review classifications or spam detection.\nThen we will move to one of the most demanding areas of Natural Language Processing, which is Sentiment Analysis. First we will explore how to use some built-in sentiment analysis tools such as TextBlob and VADER. Then we will start building our own Sentiment Analyzer using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. There we will go through all the steps required to build a sentiment analyser from the scratch, including pre-processing, feature engineering, training and testing.\nFinally we will complete this course by learning how to integrate Twitter's APIs to pull Twitter data. Twitter is by far the strongest social media when it comes to text data. Some investors, banks and hedge funds are already using Twitter data to understand the market sentiment. So why not learn how to use this valuable resource, as the data source for your NLP problem.\nNatural Language Processing is becoming one of the highly demanding skillset in the technology industry, and this course will help you to start your NLP journey.\nWhat are you waiting for? Start your journey to become an expert in NLP today!\nAll of this comes with a 30 day money back garuantee, so you can try the course risk free.\nI will see you inside the course.",

      "description": "Course Description\nThis course is designed to bridge the gap between understanding statistical hypothesis testing and applying it effectively using Python. It focuses on leveraging Python's capabilities to perform hypothesis testing on real-world datasets, offering students practical experience that can be directly applied in professional and academic settings.\nPrerequisites\nA strong foundation in the theory of hypothesis testing is essential. This includes familiarity with concepts such as null and alternative hypotheses, significance levels, test statistics, and p-values. If you’re comfortable with these concepts, you’re ready to dive into applying them programmatically.\nWhat You Will Learn\nThroughout the course, we explore a variety of statistical hypothesis tests, both parametric and non-parametric, including:\nOne-sample tests for means: : Testing whether the mean of a population (e.g., average daily calorie intake) equals a specified value.\nTwo-sample tests for means: Comparing the means of two independent groups (e.g., average blood pressure of patients on two different medications).\nOne-sample test for proportions: Testing whether the proportion of a population (e.g., the percentage of people who prefer a certain product) equals a specified value.\nTwo-sample test for proportions: Comparing the proportions of two independent groups (e.g., the percentage of smokers in two different cities).\nPaired tests: Testing differences in paired data (e.g., before-and-after scores of a treatment group).\nANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Comparing the means of more than two groups (e.g., effectiveness of three different diets).\nChi-square tests: Testing for independence between categorical variables (e.g., gender and preference for a product).\nNon-parametric tests: Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and others for datasets that do not meet parametric test assumptions.\nYou’ll learn how to formulate hypotheses, calculate test statistics, identify rejection regions, and draw meaningful conclusions—all using Python.\nWhy Take This Course?\nHands-On Learning: Every concept is illustrated with examples data relevant to health, business, education, engineering, etc.\nPractical Tools: You'll use Python Jupyter notebooks to write code. Where needed, the hypotheses are clearly well written using LaTeX to clearly document statistical hypotheses.\nExpert Instruction: The course is taught by a Data Scientist and Statistician with over 20 years of experience applying statistical methods in engineering, health, and business contexts.\nComprehensive Content: This course focuses exclusively on hypothesis testing, ensuring depth and mastery of the topic.\nWho Should Take This Course?\nThis course is ideal for:\nHealth researchers performing clinical studies.\nData Scientists and Analysts who draw conclusions from data by carrying out hypotheses testing.\nStatisticians applying advanced testing methods.\nEngineers validating process performance.\nIf your work involves testing hypotheses and interpreting data, this course will equip you with the skills to confidently analyze statistical problems using Python.",

      "description": "Hi this is Abhilash Nelson and I am thrilled to introduce you to my new course Deep Learning and Neural Networks using Python: For Dummies\n\n\nThe world has been revolving much around the terms \"Machine Learning\" and \"Deep Learning\" recently. With or without our knowledge every day we are using these technologies. Ranging from google suggestions, translations, ads, movie recommendations, friend suggestions, sales and customer experience so on and so forth. There are tons of other applications too. No wonder why \"Deep Learning\" and \"Machine Learning along with Data Science\" are the most sought after talent in the technology world now a days.\n\n\nBut the problem is that, when you think about learning these technologies, a misconception that lots of maths, statistics, complex algorithms and formulas needs to be studied prior to that. Its just like someone tries to make you believe that, you should learn the working of an Internal Combustion engine before you learn how to drive a car. The fact is that, to drive a car, we just only need to know how to use the user friendly control pedals extending from engine like clutch, brake, accelerator, steering wheel etc. And with a bit of experience, you can easily drive a car.\n\n\nThe basic know how about the internal working of the engine is of course an added advantage while driving a car, but its not mandatory. Just like that, in our deep learning course, we have a perfect balance between learning the basic concepts along the implementation of the built in Deep Learning Classes and functions from the Keras Library using the Python Programming Language. These classes, functions and APIs are just like the control pedals from the car engine, which we can use easily to build an efficient deep learning model.\n\n\nLets now see how this course is organized and an overview about the list of topics included.\n\n\nWe will be starting with few theory sessions in which we will see an overview about the Deep Learning and neural networks. The difference between deep learning and machine learning, the history of neural networks, the basic work-flow of deep learning, biological and artificial neurons and applications of neural networks.\n\n\nIn the next session, we will try to answer the most popular , yet confusing question weather we have to choose Deep Learning or machine learning for an upcoming project involving Artificial intelligence. We will compare the scenarios and factors which help us to decide in between machine learning or deep learning.\n\n\nAnd then we will prepare the computer and install the python environment for doing our deep learning coding. We will install the anaconda platform, which a most popular python platform and also install the necessary dependencies to proceed with the course.\n\n\nOnce we have our computer ready, we will learn the basics of python language which could help if you are new to python and get familiar with the basic syntax of python which will help with the projects in our course. We will cover the details about python assignments, flow control, functions, data structures etc.\n\n\nLater we will install the libraries for our projects like Theano, Tensorflow and Keras which are the best and most popular deep learning libraries. We will try a sample program with each libraries to make sure its working fine and also learn how to switch between them.\n\n\nThen we will have another theory session in which we will learn the concept of Multi-Layer perceptrons, which is the basic element of the deep learning neural network and then the terminology and the Major steps associated with Training a Neural Network. We will discuss those steps in details in this session.\n\n\nAfter all these exhaustive basics and concepts, we will now move on to creating real-world deep learning models.\n\n\nAt first we will download and use the Pima Indians Onset of Diabetes Dataset, with the training data of Pima Indians and whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years. We will build a classification model with this and later will train the model and evaluate the accuracy of the model. We will also try Manual and automatic data splitting and k-Fold Cross Validation with this model\n\n\nThe next dataset we are going to use is the Iris Flowers Classification Dataset, which contains the classification of iris flowers into 3 species based on their petal and sepal dimensions. This is a multi class dataset and we will build a multi-classification model with this and will train the model and try to evaluate the accuracy.\n\n\nThe next dataset is the  Sonar Returns Dataset, which contains the data about the strength of sonar signals returns and classification weather it was reflected by a rock or any metal like mines under the sea bed. we will build the base model and will evaluate the accuracy. Also we will try to Improve Performance of model With Data Preparation technique like standardization and also by changing the topology of the neural network. By making it deeper or shallow.\n\n\nWe will also use the Boston House Prices dataset. Unlike the previous ones, this is a regression dataset which uses different factors to determine the average cost of owning a house in the city of Boston. For this one also we will build the model and try to Improve Performance of model With Data Preparation technique like standardization and also by changing the topology of the neural network.\n\n\nAs we have spend our valuable time designing and train the model, we need to save it to use it for doing predictions later. We will see how we can save the already trained model structure to either json or a yaml file along with the weights as an hdf5 file. Then we will load it and convert it back to a live model. We will try this for all the data sets we learned so far.\n\n\nNow the most awaited magic of Deep Learning. Our Genius Multi-Layer Perceptron models will make predictions for custom input data from the already learned knowledge they have. The pima Indian model will predict weather I will get diabetes in the future by analysing my actual health statistics. Then the next model, the Iris Flower model will predict correct species of the newly blossomed Iris flower in my garden.\n\n\nAlso the prediction will be done with the Sonar Returns Model to check if the data provided matches either a mine or a rock under the sea.\n\n\nThen with our next Multi-Layer Perceptron model, the Boston House Price model will predict the median value of the cost of housing in Boston.\n\n\nLarge deep learning models may take days or even weeks to complete the training. Its a long running process. There is a great chance that some interruptions may occur in between and all our hard work till then will be lost. In order to prevent that, we have a feature called Check-pointing. We can safely mark checkpoints and keep them safe and load model from that point at a later time. Check-pointing can be done based on  every improvement to a model during training or the best instance of model during training.\n\n\nAt times, we may need to supervise and take a look at how the model is doing while its getting trained. We can Access Model Training History in Keras very easily and if needed can visualize the progress using a graphical representation.\n\n\nThen we will deal with a major problem in Deep Learning called Over-fitting. Some neurons in the network gain more weightage gradually and will contribute to incorrect results. We will learn how to include drop-out regularization technique to prevent this to both visible as well as hidden layers\n\n\nWe can control the learning rate of a model. Just like we do rigorous learning at first and by the end of lesson, we could slow down the pace to understand better, we will also configure and evaluate a time-based as well as  drop-based learning rate scheduler for our new model called Ionosphere classification model.\n\n\nIn the sessions that follow, we will learn a powerful deep learning neural network technique called Convolutional Neural Networks. This is proved very efficient in dealing with difficult computer vision and natural language processing tasks where the normal nerual network architecture would fail.\n\n\nIn the following sessions, at first we will have an overview about the convolutional neural networks or CNNs. How it works and its architecture. Then we will proceed with some popular and interesting experiments with the convolutional neural network.\n\n\nThe major capability of deep learning techniques is object recognition in image data. We will build a CNN model in keras to recognize hand written digits. We will be using the openly available MNIST dataset for this purpose. We will at first build a Multi-Layer Perceptron based Neural Network at first for MNIST dataset and later will upgrade that to Convolutional Neural Network.\n\n\nAnd you know what... we are bold enough to do prediction with a hand written digit using our MNIST dataset. We will take time to train the model, save it. And later load it and do a quick prediction with the already saved model.\n\n\nWe will later try improving the performance of the model by making the network large. We will also try techniques like Image Augmentation, Sample Standardization, ZCA whitening, transformations like Random rotations, random shifts and flips to our augmented images. And we will finally save the augmented images as the dataset for later use.\n\n\nThen we will go ahead with another important and challenging project using CNN which is the Object Recognition in Photographs. We will use another openly available dataset called CIFAR-10. We will learn about the CIFAR-10 object recognition dataset and how to load and use it in Keras. We will at first create a simple Convolutional Neural Network for object recognition. Then later will try to improve the performance using a more deeper network. One more time we are having the guts to do a real time prediction with the CIFAR-10 dataset Convolutional Neural network, where the model will identify a cat and dog from the image we supplied to the system.\n\n\nOverall, this is a basic to advanced crash course in deep learning neural networks and convolutional neural networks using Keras and Python, which I am sure once you completed will sky rocket your current career prospects as this is the most wanted skill now a days and of course this is the technology of the future. We will also be providing you with an experience certificate after the completion of this course as a proof of your expertise and you may attach it with your portfolio.\n\n\nThere is a day in the near future itself, when the deep learning models will out perform human intelligence. So be ready and lets dive into the world of thinking machines.\n\n\nSee you soon in the class room. Bye for now.",

But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\nWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?\nPython is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quickly.\nHow long does it take to become a data scientist?\nThis answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.\nWhat is R and why is it useful?\nThe R programming language was created specifically for statistical programming. Many find it useful for data handling, cleaning, analysis, and representation. R is also a popular language for data science projects. Much of the data used for data science can be messy and complex. The programming language has features and libraries available geared toward cleaning up unorganized data and making complex data structures easier to handle that can't be found in other languages. It also provides powerful data visualization tools to help data scientists find patterns in large sets of data and present the results in expressive reports. Machine learning is another area where the R language is useful. R gives developers an extensive selection of machine learning libraries that will help them find trends in data and predict future events.\nWhat careers use R?\nR is a popular programming language for data science, business intelligence, and financial analysis. Academic, scientific, and non-profit researchers use the R language to glean answers from data. R is also widely used in market research and advertising to analyze the results of marketing campaigns and user data. The language is used in quantitative analysis, where its data analysis capabilities give financial experts the tools they need to manage portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Data scientists use R in many industries to turn data into insights and predict future trends with its machine learning capabilities. Data analysts use R to extract data, analyze it, and turn it into reports that can help enterprises make better business decisions. Data visualization experts use R to turn data into visually appealing graphs and charts.\nIs R difficult to learn?\nWhether R is hard to learn depends on your experience. After all, R is a programming language designed for mathematicians, statisticians, and business analysts who may have no coding experience. For some beginning users, it is relatively simple to learn R. It can have a learning curve if you are a business analyst who is only familiar with graphical user interfaces since R is a text-based programming language. But compared to other programming languages, users usually find R easier to understand. R also may have an unfamiliar syntax for programmers who are used to other programming languages, but once they learn the syntax, the learning process becomes more straightforward. Beginners will also find that having some knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and probabilities makes learning R easier.\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R, you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nPython vs. R: what is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools.

Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping. The concept of combining data with functionality in an object is called encapsulation, a core concept in the object-oriented programming paradigm.\n\n\nI am glad that I took this course.

Students will code their own word embedding vectors from scratch, using just Numpy and a little bit of calculus. For students who don't have the required background, a crash course in the required mathematics is included. We'll cover the fundamentals of differential calculus and linear algebra in a succinct overview, so students can easily follow all mathematical derivations.\n\nRather than simply be presented with results, each step of the mathematical derivations is included. This is to help students foster a deeper understanding of natural language processing and artificial intelligence in general.\nFar from being a course where students are simply spoon fed the instructors' interpretation, students will learn to gather information directly from the source. I will show you a repeatable and easy to remember framework to read, understand, and implement deep learning research papers. You will get insight into how the verbiage in research papers maps to real world code. This is an essential skill set for all practitioners of artificial intelligence and data science, and will help you stand out from the crowd.\nThroughout the course, good coding practices will be stressed. Students will learn the fundamentals of writing pythonic and extensible code from the very beginning, so that they can easily transition into writing more complex code for production.\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to answer the following questions:\nWhat is the difference between the skip-gram and continuous bag of words models?\nWhat is distributional semantics?\nHow can we use vectors to teach computers about language?\nHow do we derive the word2vec gradients?\nWhy is the softmax function so slow in natural language processing?\nHow can we deal with small datasets for natural language processing?\nHow can we improve word embedding using negative sampling?\nWhat is the best way to to deal with proper nouns in natural language processing?\nWhat were some of the historical approaches to natural language processing?\nWhat can word plots teach us about how computers understand language?\nThere is zero fluff in this course. It is taught at a brisk pace, and is intended for motivated beginners who want deeper insights into natural language processing. Those that complete this course will learn how to implement research papers on there own; you'll never have to rely on Medium blog posts again.",

      "description": "Hi there,\n\nWelcome to \"Generative AI for Data Analysis and Engineering with ChatGPT\" course.\nChatGPT and AI | Data Analytics and ML Mastering Course with ChatGPT-4o and Next-Gen AI Techniques for Data Analyst\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we interact with technology, and mastering AI tools has become essential for anyone looking to stay ahead in the digital age.\n\nIn today's data-driven world, the ability to analyze data, draw meaningful insights, and apply machine learning algorithms is more crucial than ever. This course is designed to guide you through every step of that journey, from the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to mastering advanced machine learning algorithms, all while leveraging the power of ChatGPT-4o.\n\n\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information about whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat.\n\n\nA machine learning course teaches you the technology and concepts behind predictive text, virtual assistants, and artificial intelligence. You can develop the foundational skills you need to advance to building neural networks and creating more complex functions through the Python and R programming languages.\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction.\n\n\nData science application is an in-demand skill in many industries worldwide — including finance, transportation, education, manufacturing, human resources, and banking.

Desmos is super user-friendly compared to previous graphing calculators. Although math is NOT the focus of the course, you’ll probably learn a thing or two about math along the way.\nIn this class you'll learn:\nHow to customize and share your visualizations\nHow to use sliders to animate your graphs\nAbout all the different types of graphable expressions\nHow to use lists, tables, and statistics\nHow to use derivatives and integrals\nWho am I?\nMy name is Olivier Chabot. I'm a certified math and physics teacher in Ontario. I recently completed my Master’s in stats at Carleton University where I did my undergrad in math. I use Desmos almost on a daily basis for my work and personal life. It is important to note that I do not work for Desmos.",

I see plenty of other courses that teach how to create machine language (ML) models and AI pipelines in AWS SageMaker, but NOT how to set it up and customize it.\nIntroducing, d8aland's new mini course on how to customize SageMaker\nOur mini courses are designed to be under two hours so you can get to the information you need quickly. They are created for specific use-cases instead of just a lengthy, high level tech overview. In other words, \"how do I. . .?\"\nThere are some explainer videos, but only enough to understand what we are doing in the demonstrations and why. In this case, how to create an SageMaker Studio domain, launch JupyterLab and, configure lifecycle scripts and custom images.\nWho Should Enroll?\nData scientists, ML engineers, and AWS professionals who want to optimize SageMaker ML for advanced AI projects or prepare for the AWS Machine Learning Specialty exam.\nI hope you find great value in this mini-course from D8aland. Please shoot me a message if you have suggestions for this course or any other mini course you would like to see us make.\nNow, let's go build something cool.\nJoe Cline\nA senior level data engineer with over 25 years experience in enterprise data management.",

      "description": "Unleashing the Power of Support Vector Machine\n\n\nWhat is Support Vector Machine?\nSVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies data by creating a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space. It is widely used for both regression and classification tasks. SVM excels at handling complex datasets, making it a go-to choice for various applications, including image classification, text analysis, and anomaly detection.\nThe Working Principle of SVM\nAt its core, SVM aims to find an optimal hyperplane that maximally separates data points into distinct classes. By transforming the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space, SVM facilitates effective separation, even when the data is not linearly separable. The algorithm achieves this by finding support vectors, which are the data points closest to the hyperplane.\nKey Advantages of Support Vector Machine\nFlexibility: SVM offers versatile kernel functions that allow nonlinear decision boundaries, giving it an edge over other algorithms.\nRobustness: SVM effectively handles datasets with outliers and noise, thanks to its ability to focus on the support vectors rather than considering the entire dataset.\nGeneralization: SVM demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities, enabling accurate predictions on unseen data.\nMemory Efficiency: Unlike some other machine learning algorithms, SVM only requires a subset of training samples for decision-making, making it memory-efficient.\nThe Importance of Maximum Margin\nBy maximizing the margin, SVM promotes better generalization and robustness of the classification model. A larger margin allows for better separation between classes, reducing the risk of misclassification and improving the model's ability to handle unseen data. The concept of maximum margin classification is rooted in the idea of finding the decision boundary with the highest confidence.\nUse Cases of SVM\nSVM finds its applications in a wide range of domains, including:\nImage Recognition: SVM's ability to classify images based on complex features makes it invaluable in computer vision tasks, such as facial recognition and object detection.\nText Classification: SVM can classify text documents, making it ideal for sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization.\nBioinformatics: SVM aids in protein structure prediction, gene expression analysis, and disease classification, contributing significantly to the field of bioinformatics.\nFinance: SVM assists in credit scoring, stock market forecasting, and fraud detection, helping financial institutions make informed decisions.\nBest Practices for SVM Implementation\nTo maximize the effectiveness of SVM in your projects, consider the following best practices:\nData Preprocessing: Ensure your data is properly preprocessed by performing tasks such as feature scaling, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.\nHyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different kernel functions, regularization parameters, and other hyperparameters to optimize the performance of your SVM model.\nFeature Selection: Select relevant features to improve SVM's efficiency and avoid overfitting.\nCross-Validation: Utilize cross-validation techniques to validate your SVM model and assess its generalization capabilities.\nKernel Trick\nThe SVM algorithm utilizes the \"kernel trick\" technique to transform the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space. This transformation allows nonlinear decision boundaries to be defined in the original input space. The kernel function plays a vital role in this process, as it measures the similarity between pairs of data points. Commonly used kernel functions include the linear kernel, polynomial kernel, and radial basis function (RBF) kernel.\nMargin and Support Vectors\nIn SVM, the margin refers to the region between the decision boundary (hyperplane) and the nearest data points from each class. The goal is to find the hyperplane that maximizes this margin. The data points that lie on the margin or within a certain distance from it are known as support vectors. These support vectors are critical in defining the hyperplane and determining the classification boundaries.\nC-Parameter and Regularization\nThe C-parameter, often called the regularization parameter, is a crucial parameter in SVM. It controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification errors. A higher value of C places more emphasis on classifying data points correctly, potentially leading to a narrower margin. On the other hand, a lower value of C allows for a wider margin but may result in more misclassifications. Proper tuning of the C-parameter is essential to achieve the desired balance between model simplicity and accuracy.\nNonlinear Classification with SVM\nOne of the major strengths of SVM is its ability to handle nonlinear classification problems. The kernel trick allows SVM to map the input data into a higher-dimensional space where linear separation is possible. This enables SVM to solve complex classification tasks that cannot be accurately separated by a linear hyperplane in the original feature space.\nSVM Training and Optimization\nThe training of an SVM model involves finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin and separates the classes. This optimization problem can be formulated as a quadratic programming task. Various optimization algorithms, such as Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are commonly used to solve this problem efficiently.\nConclusion\nSupport Vector Machine is a versatile and robust algorithm that empowers data scientists to tackle complex classification and regression problems.

      "description": "In this Course you learn k-Nearest Neighbors & Naive Bayes Classification Methods.\n\nIn pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.\nFor  classification, a useful technique can be to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones.\nThe neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification). This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required.\n\n\nIn machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.\nNaive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.\n\nIn the statistics and computer science literature, Naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes. All these names reference the use of Bayes' theorem in the classifier's decision rule, but naive Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method.\nIn this course you learn how to classify datasets by k-Nearest Neighbors Classification Method to find the correct class for data and reduce error. Then you go further  You will learn how to classify output of model by using Naive Bayes Classification Method.\nIn the first section you learn how to use python to estimate output of your system. In this section you can classify:\nPython Dataset\nIRIS Flowers\nMake your own k Nearest Neighbors Algorithm\nIn the Second section you learn how to use python to classify output of your system with nonlinear structure .In this section you can classify:\nIRIS Flowers\nPima Indians Diabetes Database\nMake your own Naive Bayes  Algorithm\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nImportant information before you enroll:\nIn case you find the course useless for your career, don't forget you are covered by a 30 day money back guarantee, full refund, no questions asked!\nOnce enrolled, you have unlimited, lifetime access to the course!\nYou will have instant and free access to any updates I'll add to the course.\nI will give you my full support regarding any issues or suggestions related to the course.\nCheck out the curriculum and FREE PREVIEW lectures for a quick insight.\n___________________________________________________________________________\nIt's time to take Action!\nClick the \"Take This Course\" button at the top right now!\n...Don't waste time!

Beyond that, the course also covers steps that help you continuously maintain and improve your solution pipeline, throughout its lifecycle.\n\n\nThere could be parts of this course that the learner may be aware of already, but as someone who does this day in and out, I have tried to include scenarios, challenges, steps and the outlook to face even well known topics with more confidence than before, and put them together in a well-ordered flow. This might come in handy to someone preparing for an interview in this field. As someone who has learnt courses on the go during commute or other times, and having realised the time saving value, I have made the course's audio content substantially context rich for those who prefer consuming it through audio. It does have the video component as well, for visual learners.\n\n\nThis course can act as a well organised end-to-end guidebook to integrate Data Science and Machine Learning knowledge across the board into the everyday work of a Business Leader, Product Manager, Software Developer, Researcher, Analyst or Data Scientist, by being realistic and holistic. The learner can use this as a framework and mindset, that will enable them to think objectively and comprehensively at all stages of data and ML adaptation and application, thereby increasing its success rate.",

Rattle provides considerable data mining functionality by exposing the power of the R Statistical Software through a graphical user interface.\nRattle is also used as a teaching facility to learn the R software Language. There is a Log Code tab, which replicates the R code for any activity undertaken in the GUI, which can be copied and pasted. Rattle can be used for statistical analysis, or model generation. Rattle allows for the dataset to be partitioned into training, validation and testing. The dataset can be viewed and edited. There is also an option for scoring an external data file.\nData mining is the analysis of data and the use of software techniques for finding patterns and regularities in sets of data. The computer is responsible for finding the patterns by identifying the underlying rules and features in the data. The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records",

If you're looking to seamlessly deploy dbt without worrying about the hassle of maintaining an orchestration tool, or paying for dbt Cloud, but you still want the benefits of modern version control systems and deployment methodologies, this course is tailor-made for you.\nIn this comprehensive mini-course, you'll embark on a journey that walks you through the initial setup all the way through the development lifecycle and deploying your code.\nAs you progress, you'll set up dbt Cloud - as a development environment, and also to see how you could deploy in dbt Cloud). Then, we'll switch gears and focus on the world of GitHub Actions. This will empower you to confidently develop with dbt locally, and when you're ready, the latter videos will guide you step-by-step on deploying production dbt jobs, both on a schedule and automatically upon merges.\nThe cherry on top? Our final module focuses on setting up a CI (Continuous Integration) dbt job with GitHub Actions, ensuring that your deployments are not just efficient, but also reliable and error-free.\n\n\nWhy you should deploy dbt with Github Actions\nWhen it comes to deploying dbt, various platforms and tools such as dbt Cloud and Apache Airflow are available. However, GitHub Actions emerges as an incredibly powerful and flexible choice for several reasons:\nSeamless Integration with GitHub: If your codebase and team already operate on GitHub, deploying with GitHub Actions ensures you don’t have to juggle multiple platforms. This integrated approach streamlines workflows, allowing developers and data engineers to stay within one ecosystem.\nGranular Control: While dbt Cloud provides an excellent interface for dbt deployments, GitHub Actions offers more granular control over deployment workflows, allowing for tailored operations based on specific project requirements.\nFlexibility: With GitHub Actions, you can easily integrate other tools and systems in your workflow. It’s not just about dbt; perhaps you want to add linters, testing suites, or any other tools into your CI/CD process.\nCost-Effective: For teams operating on a budget, GitHub Actions can be more cost-effective than maintaining a dedicated orchestration system or subscribing to premium tiers of dbt Cloud.\nAutomated Workflows: The automation capabilities in GitHub Actions mean you can trigger dbt runs and tests on specific events, such as pull requests or merges. This can be harder to achieve and often less native with other platforms.\nVersatility: While tools like Airflow are powerful and designed for complex workflows, not every dbt deployment demands such intricacy. GitHub Actions strikes a balance, offering both simplicity for beginners and depth for advanced users.\nActive Community and Updates: Given GitHub’s vast community, you’ll find a plethora of pre-built actions, consistent updates, and an active community ready to assist, ensuring you remain at the forefront of best practices.\nWhile dbt Cloud and orchestration tools like Airflow have their own sets of advantages, GitHub Actions offers a unique blend of control, flexibility, and integration. For teams looking to maintain a streamlined workflow with fewer platforms to manage, GitHub Actions might just be the optimal solution.\n\n\nWhy you should enroll in this course\nThis course will quickly teach you the basics you need to get your dbt project fully deployed using Github Actions. This includes:\nEfficient Deployment: Streamline your dbt deployment processes with the integration of GitHub Actions.\nHands-on Learning: Real-world examples and practical guidance for setting up and deploying in multiple environments.\nEnhanced Reliability: Learn how to implement CI for your dbt jobs, ensuring consistent and error-free deployments.\nSkill Enhancement: Master a crucial skill set that is in high demand in the data engineering and DevOps landscapes.\nEquip yourself with the skills to blend the power of dbt with the flexibility and efficiency of GitHub Actions.

Goodfellow et al.). You will therefore understand how they work in a mathematical way, which will give you the foundation to implement your first GAN from scratch.\n\n\nWe will implement in approximately 100 lines of code a generator, a discriminator and the pseudo-code described in the paper in order to train them. We will use the Python programming language and the PyTorch framework. After training, the generator will allow us to generate synthetic images that are indistinguishable from real images.\n\n\nI believe that a concept is learned by doing and this crash course aims to give you the necessary basis to continue your learning of Machine Learning, PyTorch and generative models (GANS, Variational Autoencoders, Normalizing Flows, Diffusion Models, ...).\n\n\nAt the end of this course, the participant will be able to use Python (and more particularly the PyTorch framework) to implement scientific papers and artificial intelligence solutions. This course is also intended to be a stepping stone in your learning of generative models.\n\n\nBeyond GANs, this course is also a general introduction to the PyTorch framework and an intermediate level Machine learning course .\n\n\nConcepts covered:\nThe PyTorch framework in order to implement and optimize neural networks.\nThe use of generative models in the research and industrial world.\nGANs in an intuitive way. GANs in a mathematical way.\nThe generation of synthetic data (such as images).\nThe implementation of a scientific paper.\n\n\nDon't wait any longer before jumping into the world of generative models!",

      "description": "Welcome! Nice to have you. I'm certain that by the end you will have learned a lot and earned a valuable skill. You can think of the course as compromising 3 parts, and I present the material in each part differently. For example, in the last section, the essential math for data science is presented almost entirely via whiteboard presentation.\nThe opening section of Data Science 101 examines common questions asked by passionate learners like you (i.e., what do data scientists actually do, what's the best language for data science, and addressing different terms (big data, data mining, and comparing terms like machine learning vs. deep learning).\nFollowing that, you will explore data science methodology via a Healthcare Insurance case study. You will see the typical data science steps and techniques utilized by data professionals. You might be surprised to hear that other roles than data scientists do actually exist. Next, if machine learning and natural language processing are of interest, we will build a simple chatbot so you can get a clear sense of what is involved. One day you might be building such systems.\nThe following section is an introduction to Data Science in Python. You will have an opportunity to master python for data science as each section is followed by an assignment that allows you to practice your skills. By the end of the section, you will understand Python fundamentals, decision and looping structures, Python functions, how to work with nested data, and list comprehension. The final part will show you how to use the two most popular libraries for data science, Numpy, and Pandas.\nThe final section delves into essential math for data science. You will get the hang of linear algebra for data science, along with probability, and statistics. My goal for the linear algebra part was to introduce all necessary concepts and intuition so that you can gain an understanding of an often utilized technique for data fitting called least squares. I also wanted to spend a lot of time on probability, both classical and bayesian, as reasoning about problems is a much more difficult aspect of data science than simply running statistics.\nSo, don't wait, start Data Science 101 and develop modern-day skills.
