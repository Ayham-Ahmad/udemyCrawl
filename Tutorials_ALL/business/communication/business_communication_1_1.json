      "description": "Collaboration frequently occurs in the workplace where people come together to cooperate and work on a strategic project in order that they can accomplish a common goal.  It is simply teamwork taken to a higher level and has become a more productive way of doing things.\nMost often collaboration happens within fairly small teams  - functional teams, time-limited project teams or cross-functional management teams.\n\nIn effective collaboration, all people involved use their emotional intelligence well to balance emotional needs with their thinking, build authentic relationships and make good quality decisions on behalf of the organisation. Whether working with others one-to-one, in small groups or large teams, there is exemplary communication with empathy that engages hearts and minds.  This occurs at all levels of the organisation.\nThis course is about collaborating with others in ways that will help you to communicate more efficiently as you work to understand and work with differences that lead to effective collaboration.  In addition, the skills, processes and tools taught in this course can bring value to other aspects of your life.\nPeople often talk about positive and negative emotions.  This is not that helpful as emotions cannot really be labelled in that way.  The course also covers the myths around positive and negative emotions and why this terminology is not appropriate when working to understand emotions and emotional intelligence in the workplace.\nThe course covers all aspects of collaborative working focusing on win-win collaboration where everyone benefits. The characteristics, principles and modes of collaboration are examined to give you a much broader insight into getting the best from collaboration.\nThe course, also, covers trust and how you can build trust as you work together with others.\n\nBehavioural styles are reviewed looking at the strengths and liabilities of each. You get the opportunity to complete a questionnaire that will give you an insight to the behavioural style that you prefer to use with the chance to explore how your style can help and how it can hinder collaboration.  Completing this practical activity will enable you to how to use your behavioural preferences and style to better effect when collaborating within a project.\nThis course is a standalone course for anyone interested in understanding collaboration at work and how to get more from collaborative relationships.  It compliments other courses that explore emotional intelligence in more depth.\nBy completing this course, you will be able to\nDetermine why a collaborative approach is beneficial in teamwork\nRecognize why collaboration is underpinned with good emotional intelligence\nEvaluate ways to work with the principles and characteristics of collaboration - what works best, when and where\nExplain the various modes that can be used in collaboration\nAssess your own collaborative style and how this helps or hinders you in collaborative working\nIdentify strategies and ideas about how to collaborate more effectively\nManage work with multi-disciplinary teams at all levels within an organisation\nExplore how to use mindfulness techniques to run collaborative meetings more effectively\nRecognize how to use emotional intelligence to collaborate with others and build emotional bonds\nYou'll receive all the information that you need and will be coached using loads of practical hints that you can use straight away.\nThe course is made up of a series of lectures and contains comprehensive course notes. There are a series of interactive exercises that involve some activity with other people and some reflection.\nPLEASE NOTE - This course is NOT for you if you are not prepared to work through the practical activities that make up a fundamental part of the course.  Collaboration cannot be developed just by watching the video lectures.  It requires you to do some reflective thinking, to get some feedback and to discuss your development with others.  I'm afraid that you won't get the best from the course unless you are prepared to do this.\nThere are SEVEN practical activities included within the course that are designed to help you understand collaboration and how you can improve the way in which you work with other people towards shared goals  All of them require you to engage with your collaborative team and do some work outside of the course.\nThe course is being continually refined and updated to ensure it remains current and relevant.  Feedback is always welcome.\n\n\nThe course contains a series of Lightbulb Moments resource cards, which have been created to provide you with handy reminders of key points around topics covered within the course.\nAll PDFs can be completed online and are Section 508 / ADA Accessibility compliant.\nAll videos are high definition recorded in 1080p.\nAll videos have grammatically correct English captions.\nLatest update - July 2025",

      "description": "FROM THE CREATOR OF THE BESTSELLING, Writing With Flair: How To Become An Exceptional Writer...\nWant to become an outstanding editor?\nMost editors do a fine job of fixing up the spelling, grammar, punctuation, and typos in a piece of writing.\nIt takes a different skill level to turn dry, disorganised, and clunky prose into writing that is beautifully organised and bursting with life and energy.\nImagine having that power over your own writing.\nEnter, deep editing\nEditing Mastery introduces you to a technique the author calls deep editing, familiar only to an inner circle of exceptional editors.\nIt offers a systematic way of editing that reliably transforms almost any piece of nonfiction writing into magnificent, sparkling prose.\nThe deep editing technique forces you to consider every aspect of a document, ensuring that quality gets embedded into each and every pore of the writing.\n\"It takes a genius to make the complex and difficult look exceedingly easy and simple and Shani Raja is one such case. I learned so much from him that even though I spent my life in journalism, I never learned as much from anyone as I did from him. Highly recommended...\" -- GLORIA LINDA ABELL, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"I'm crafting better content than ever...\" -- PAULO ARMI, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"The editing process is beautifully simplified...\" -- SUMAN PRABHU, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"A remarkably simple and clear process to edit writing...\" -- JIM CANTONI, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Satisfies a writer's hunger for certainty that his work will garner a five star ranking...\" -- GREG STONE, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"The most professionally produced training I've seen on Udemy ...\" -- DANIEL HARRIGAN, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"My experience while doing this Deep Editing course has been one of sheer delight...\" -- ROSALIE PRINTER, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Every lesson is gold...\" -- MEGHAN BLOOD, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Excellent for anyone who wants to learn about clarity, simplicity, and elegance in writing...\" -- AGATA T SZCODRAK, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Half an hour into this course, and I am less overwhelmed...\" -- KATEY NIXON, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Simply awesome...\" -- GOPINATH CHANDRA, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Brilliant content and structure...\" -- JESS MELAS, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"A very lean and methodical way to edit a document...\" -- DANA PETERSON, UDMEY STUDENT\n\"A genius teacher...\" -- TRISH ELLIS, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Will help editors of every level...\" -- DSDAVIS, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"A realistic perspective on different editing techniques...\" -- CHAE CLARK, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Very impressed...\" -- MICHAEL JORDAN, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Concise and practical...\" -- AUROSHREE MAJUMDAR, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"A process we can follow for all our writing...\" -- JOAN SALANITRI -- UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Shani's courses are simply the best when it comes to real life, practical, applicable writing...\" -- ALICIA ADAMS, UDEMY STUDENT\nThe deep editing method will set you apart from other editors -- whether you’re editing a book, a blog, an essay, or business writing of some type.\nIt will also help you self-edit your own writing to its full potential.\nTrade secrets\nAmong the few who know how perform this sort of advanced surgery on writing are senior editors on top newspapers, who spend their days turning raw copy into captivating stories for millions of readers.\nI've worked for several such newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, where I was employed as a senior editor and writing coach for some years.\nOnce you learn these deep editing secrets, you won't just be a competent editor. You'll become a masterful one.\nHaving these skills will enhance your own writing exponentially, too, as you begin incorporating deep-editing techniques into your work naturally.\nYour books, blogs, essays, emails, or website copy will shine like never before.\nWhat is deep editing?\nThe system basically has four stages. First, you edit the content of a piece of writing. Then you edit the structure. Next, you edit for style. And finally, you focus on the presentation.\nBy concentrating on those layers one at a time, your edit will be thorough -- and the writing as a result will look spectacularly polished.\nSTAGE 1: THE CONTENT EDIT\nYou make sure every point in a piece of writing is unique, makes perfect sense, is factually correct, and is worth keeping.\n\n\nSTAGE 2: THE STRUCTURE EDIT\nYou organise all the points into an orderly narrative that flows elegantly from start to finish.\n\n\nSTAGE 3: THE STYLE EDIT\n\nYou make sure all the ideas are expressed as simply, clearly, elegantly, and evocatively as possible.\n\n\nSTAGE 4: THE PRESENTATION EDIT\nYou fix any mistakes and inconsistencies that create a bad look for any type of professional writing.\n\n\nIn this premium course, I'll guide you through each stage of a deep edit so the process becomes second nature to you.\n\nYou'll be editing a piece of writing right along with me. I chose this interactive method to help you get to the top of the learning curve of deep editing in the fastest possible time.\nThe writing you'll be working with will be very flawed and difficult to edit. But with my help, you'll move step by step toward making it read brilliantly.\nSupreme confidence and competence\nOnce you know how to deep edit, you'll know how to make any type of writing reach its full potential.\nYou'll come out of this course a much more proficient and confident editor, as well as a much better writer.\n\nABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR\n\nShani Raja is a veteran journalist who has edited for The Wall Street Journal and contributed to The Economist, the Financial Times, and Bloomberg News, among other top news organisations. He has trained dozens of prominent journalists in the craft of writing, including at The Wall Street Journal. Shani's flagship course, Writing With Flair, has long been the bestselling writing course on Udemy, with many tens of thousands of passionate students learning how to become elite writers.",

Knowledge of equality and diversity helps you and your team to operate appropriately within an equal and diverse workforce. The course analyses how you behave at work, and how it may affect those around you.  It addresses unacceptable behaviour, such as stereotyping and discrimination as well as how to deal with inappropriate or offensive behaviour.\nThis course will help you to develop and apply your skills as an inclusive leader. You will learn about the psychology of equality and diversity to grow your team and your organisation, enhance their performance and improve your personal satisfaction.  Critical thinking to work in an emotionally intelligent manner forms a major component of the skills of an Inclusive Leader to overcome unconscious bias.  This is covered in detail within the course.\nAs an Inclusive Leader it is important to consider the communication between people who have differences.  These include age, nationality, ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.\nCross cultural communication is an important leadership topic as we develop teams and build relationships with people across the world.  Many of these people are from different cultures and backgrounds from our own.\nCross cultural communication refers to your efforts as a leader to exchange information, negotiate and mediate differences based on national culture through communication.  It is understanding how people belonging to different cultures engage with each other and respectfully modifying your communication style to make allowances for this.\nThe course covers how different types of cultures impact upon individuals' needs.  It also covers how you can use cross-cultural communication as an inclusive leader with people from a variety of different backgrounds and cultures.\n\nBy taking this course, you will be able to\nDetermine what equality, diversity and inclusion means for inclusive leadership\nDiscover the impact of bias and unconscious bias in equality and diversity\nDemonstrate the attributes of an emotionally intelligent, inclusive leader through critical thinking\nDescribe how to inspire and foster respect through your work with equality and diversity\nRecognise ways to effectively communicate across various cultures\nAnalyse the impact of cultural factors on communication between individuals from different cultures\nExplore your ability to incorporate an inclusive approach into all that you say and do as a leader\nThe course gives you practical tools and actions to begin leading inclusively with immediate effect. You will strengthen your relationships with others, build your awareness of unconscious bias, develop your critical thinking skills, and become a senior advocate for inclusive workplace cultures.  You can expect to see the results of a more inclusive culture, both internally and externally, very quickly.\nThere is a practical activity in the course that invites you to assess your inclusive leadership traits.  It requires you to do some reflective thinking, to get some feedback and to discuss your development with others. By completing this activity fully, you will be able to examine your inclusive leadership traits and recognise what you need to do to grow and develop as an inclusive leader.   I am here to help and guide you.\nThis course is a standalone course for anyone interested in understanding how work to more effectively with others as a leader. It compliments other courses that explore emotional intelligence in more depth.\nYou'll receive all the information that you need and will be coached using loads of practical hints that you can use straight away.\nThe course is for you if you want to develop as an inclusive leader to improve the way that you interact with other people, the way that you make decisions and the way that you manage performance.\nThe course material makes up a one to two day workshop so is equivalent to 8 -12 hour's training. It forms part of our advanced emotional intelligence course endorsed by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\n\n\nThe course is being continually refined and updated to ensure it remains current and relevant.  Feedback is always welcome.\n\nAs the focus of this course is on inclusivity, it is important that it is as inclusive as possible so all course elements are designed for accessibility.\n\nThe course has been designed for everyone to encourage human diversity\nExpectations are set with clear learning outcomes\nThe course content recognises diversity and acknowledges barriers to inclusion\nThere is sufficient contrast using colours and textures, and optimum font sizes are used throughout the course\nAll documents are supplied in PDF format that can be read using assistive technologies\nAll the captions have been checked for errors and so are grammatically correct (as far as possible)\nThe course has been a Udemy highly rated course and is featured in the Udemy for Business catalogue.  A few people are instructed to take the course under duress by their organisation.  Some of these learners have been known to leave low ratings without comments - not the behaviour expected of appreciative, inclusive leaders!  Watch the preview lecture on The Inclusive Leader and Feedback.  Constructive feedback is always welcome as I want to made this course the best that it can be.\nEquality, Diversity, and Inclusion programmes have faced growing scrutiny, with critics arguing they prioritise group identity over individual merit and risk encouraging reverse discrimination.  This course reviews this and considers the role of emotional intelligence in equality, diversity and inclusion.\nLessons are being continually upgraded and rerecorded to improve the overall quality and new activities have been added to enhance your learner experience.  This ensures the course remains current and relevant.\n\n\nAll PDFs can be completed online and are Section 508 / ADA Accessibility compliant.\nAll videos are High Definition recorded in 1080p.\nAll videos have grammatically correct English captions.\nLatest update - September 2025",

You're not alone, there's a scientific reason for that reaction, and an equally powerful motivation for doing it anyway. In fact, the simple and proven tools that you'll be given in this course will not only explain the neuroscience behind giving and receiving feedback, but also how to get into a 'rest and digest' mindset so that you and your colleagues can actually embrace the feedback and therefore increase your performance and reach your goals.\nThe reality is that we are all shying away from having the conversations that can most impact our growth, development and advancement at work. In this engaging and interactive course, you will:\nConquer your anxiety about giving or receiving feedback so that it becomes second nature\nIdentify feedback style in yourself and others\nRecognize the benefits of feedback, and the consequence of not generously offering it\nDetermine what might be holding you back from freely giving and receiving feedback\nPractice a proven 4-step feedback process for delivering feedback with finesse\nAvoid the most common feedback errors and debunk the common myths\nReceive feedback openly and put feedback into practice using an AIM SMART Plan\nCreate a plan to bring a culture of feedback to your organization\nMove from delivering annual performance reviews to embracing a culture of continuous improvement everyday\nWith these tools, you will not only increase your motivation to give and receive continuous feedback, but also better establish yourself as the kind of leader who is invested in the growth and development of your people. We are navigating the path to leadership during a time of unprecedented volatility, uncertainty and change, and the ability to 'feed back' to one another what we're seeing, in real time, is the secret weapon for keeping us moving swiftly in the right direction.\nIn this course, you will integrate the learning in real time, by getting hands-on practice with activities such as putting together a specific feedback action plan plan using a 4-step process, identifying the most common feedback errors, identifying your feedback style and drafting your own feedback mantra to ensure you never shy away from these conversations again.\nThis is unlike any other course of its kind because it goes beyond the typical 'how to give and receive feedback' training to actually embracing a culture of continuous improvement everyday. In addition, I have over 20+ years of business leadership experience and first hand knowledge and examples to share about the power of feedback in maximizing your potential.\nAfter taking this course, feedback conversations will become so second-nature and fulfilling, that you will look forward to having them any place, anywhere and with anyone, anytime.

Top copywriters like your instructor, Dr Clare Lynch, in fact.\nFrom the very first lectures, you’ll be inspired to beat writer’s block and get something down on the page. You'll also gain instant ideas for taking your first draft from OK to outstanding.\nNext, you’ll discover a secret most writing and editing teachers won’t share with you: that good writing isn’t just about the writing. For the most part, good writing is about the thinking you do before you even sit down at your laptop or open your journal.\nThat’s because, when it comes to becoming a powerful writer – the sort of writer who gets the job, closes the sale or wins buy-in for your ideas - it’s not about the technicalities of spelling and grammar. It’s about your ability to connect with your reader on an emotional, intellectual and visceral level.\nThat’s why early on in the course, you’ll learn powerful, little-known techniques for really getting under the skin of your readers. Techniques that will allow you to write in a way that grabs people’s attention immediately – and keeps them addictively glued to your writing.\nYou’ll also learn expert tips and techniques for confidently honing your message down to its essentials, to keep your reader focused on what matters most to you. Tips that will save you time as a writer – and get you better results.\nAs the course progresses, you’ll learn what words to choose, how to turn turgid, lifeless sentences into attractive musical phrases that compel people to keep reading.\nIn the second half of the course, you’ll discover how to apply recent findings of neuroscience to make your messages stick. In this part of the course, you’ll learn how to use imagery to paint unforgettable word-pictures in your reader’s mind.\nYou’ll also discover the secret narrative structure underpinning the most persuasive stories. The narrative structure that’s made millions for the makers of Toy Story and persuaded the British to vote for Brexit. The same narrative structure that your instructor, Dr Clare Lynch, deployed in a tear-jerking speech that allowed a CEO to win over the hearts and minds of employees.\nIn the final section of the course, you’ll take your writing to a level only achieved by the world’s top copywriters and political speech writers. In this part of the course, you’ll learn how to apply the ancient art of rhetoric to any piece of writing to create rhythmic, emotionally resonant writing that’s totally unforgettable.\nAnd throughout the course, you’ll have an opportunity to put into practice what you’ve learned.

      "description": "Are you looking to help people become better versions of themselves? Do you want to help your team or colleagues perform and improve? Do you wish to have an impact on our audience every time you walk on stage?\nIf so, then you’ve come to the right place. Storytelling is the best way to connect with your audience, engage them emotionally and help them change their behavior for the better. Stories break barriers, open people up and help us discover new ways of doing things. And that is what I want to teach today.\nMy name is Alex Glod. When I started off my career as a trainer, I never thought I would have something original to offer my students, I always relied on material and inspiration from others. But in time I learned to integrate my personal stories into my classes and they became the most valuable asset I had to offer. Thanks to my personal stories I grew a strong personal brand, I stood out from the crowd and I’ve had the chance to speak at 3 TEDx events, train thousands of people across Europe and Asia and teach over 15.000 students on Udemy.\nDuring this course I would like to teach you all that I’ve learned about Storytelling and help you make a difference in the lives of the people around you, whether they are your colleagues, customers or students. You will get to learn more about:\nHow Stories can persuade and impact your audience\nHow to deal with your own anxiety and fears on stage\nHow to craft short persuasive stories\nHow to tell stories with passion and conviction\nAnd how to help your customers or colleagues transform into better versions of themselves\nYou will have access to over 3 hours of video content and several useful resources. You will experience the course as a live training participant, you will see other students taking part in the experience and you will also get to share your stories in the Q&A section.\nStorytelling is a powerful method to impact, persuade and transform people and your personal stories are your most precious treasure. Join me now on this learning adventure and let’s share that treasure with the world!",

      "description": "You know the feeling: you have something difficult you want to say to a colleague or friend. But you’re worried about how they’ll react, figure, “Why rock the boat?,” and talk yourself out of it. You attempt to ignore it, but of course, nothing changes, and you find yourself dwelling on what it is you want to tell them. You want to keep the peace and avoid a conflict, so again, you stay quiet. You try to let it go to avoid an uncomfortable conversation, but that discomfort just stays with you.\nMy aim in creating this course was to teach you to be able to speak up when it really matters no matter how uncomfortable that idea seems to you now. The benefits of being able to do this far outweigh the discomfort, I promise. You may have trouble speaking up when you disagree, struggle to give difficult feedback to a report, need to shape the way your manager manages you, or figure out how to say “no” to what a stakeholder wants you to do.\nMost people shy away from these types of tough conversations, because they don’t have the skills to approach them in a way that makes them feel safe. They may downplay the impact not having the conversation is having on their self-esteem but also the sheer amount of time they spend thinking about the unresolved issue.\nI’ve been teaching and coaching people on this subject for over two decades and have worked with my clients on it across industries, jobs levels and cultures. I’d like to give you all of my own hard-earned tools to help you tackle your difficult conversations and develop the muscle that will only grow stronger with practice.\nIn this course, you will:\nLearn why having difficult conversations is so important\nTame your anxious thinking around speaking up\nSpeak assertively (not passively or aggressively) to get the best outcome from your conversation\nPrepare your message by understanding the other person’s point of view and finding common ground\nTackle those tough conversations, whether with a peer, manager, direct report, or friend\nDeal with manipulation when passive-aggression is at play\nThe course is full of practical tips, examples and exercises you can build on one step at a time along with invitations to put what you’re learning into practice, immediately.\nThere are no prerequisites to taking this course.

Make each customer feel special, and turn them into super-fans who stay loyal to your brand, and recommend your business to their friends.\nWHY EMPATHY\nYou don't want to cut corners on your customer service because if a customer is reaching out to you for help, they are experiencing a pain point. They are also often in an heightened emotional state.\nIf you neglect them in this situation or give minimal care and support, they will remember that next time they have to buy from you, and it might act as a deterrent. But if you give them truly caring customer service, they will remember that too, and they will trust your brand more, which might get them to remain as customers longer and buy more from you.\nLISTEN TO CUSTOMERS BETTER\nMost communication is non-verbal, so you'll also learn active listening techniques as well as elements of non-verbal communication. It will help you understand the needs of your customers sooner, which will enable you to provide them with better support!\nBE KNOWN FOR WORLD-CLASS CARE AND SUPPORT\nUse customer service as more than just something you have to do, but rather as an advantage by which you retain clients and win new clients through the recommendations of your existing customers.\nInvest in your future!

      "description": "From the creator of one of Udemy's most popular courses, Writing With Flair: How To Become An Exceptional Writer, comes Punctuation Mastery, a non-technical guide to using commas, dashes and other types of punctuation more stylishly.\n\"Every once in a while, you find that one person who understands you, and teaches you exactly what you wanted to know...\" -- JAYANTH S, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Didn't realize punctuation could be so cool...\" -- RYAN, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Exactly what I needed to clear up all confusions I had about punctuation without reading through boring grammar lessons...\" -- NIKKI BRUSOE, UDEMY STUDENT\nPLEASE NOTE: This program is not for you if you're seeking a strict guide to formal punctuation rules, which can be obtained from any number of books and grammar experts. It offers the author's personal, often unorthodox, take on punctuation based on decades of experience in the news business. The program adopts mostly a non-technical, intuitive approach to the subject with the aim, above all, of fostering clear and elegant writing that is easy (and pleasurable) for readers to navigate.\nAre you among the growing army of people seeking to make a mark on the world by writing an outstanding book or creating a magnificent blog read by thousands?\nIf so, you will find it easier to make an impact once you discover how to use punctuation more stylishly.\nConversely, if you don't yet know how to use commas, colons, semi-colons, hyphens, apostrophes and dashes with a certain kind of flair, you may never be able to weave magic with your words.\nWhile studying all aspects of grammar in a formal setting is highly recommended, a strictly technical approach to punctuation can often leave students bored and uninspired.\nThat's why, here, you will find a more intuitive and flexible approach: one that focuses exclusively on the purpose of communicating powerfully and beautifully, rather than on just blindly following rules.\nThe goal is to help make your writing more effective, while steering clear of the dense jungle of jargon that can destroy your enthusiasm.\n\"One of the best courses I have ever taken...\" -- RICHARD HAKE, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Good for any writer looking to work on their clarity and form...\" -- BRENDAN TERRY, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Will agonize less when editing...\" -- JOAN SALANITRI, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Puts you behind the steering wheel...\" -- CHRIS HEMMES, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Take this course if you want to write like a pro...\" -- AARON LEBLANC, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Thought I knew how to effectively use punctuation...\" -- IGOR MILOSAVLJEVIC, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Covers just about everything...\" -- KNOWLEDGE GATHERING, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Will now write with more confidence...\" -- DEVON HALL, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Clarified a lot of questions...\" -- ARIEL JACOBY, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"One of those people whose products I don't even think about buying. I just buy them...\" -- IVAN JURAS, UDEMY STUDENT\nSo, if you spend ages wondering whether a comma should go here or there, and then doubt yourself straight afterwards because of all the complex rules around comma placement... Or, if you frequently end up with a random mess of semi-colons littering the page and distracting from your message... Or, if you don't yet know how to use a dash or colon to create dramatic tension in your writing....\nThen this course, developed by someone who has written edited for top news organisations, including The Wall Street Journal, should help put you on a firmer footing.\nTo reiterate, this course is NOT for those interested in a \"purist\" approach to punctuation based on traditional grammar rules. There is certainly a place for such an approach, and you can, if you want, find it elsewhere. The program is for nonfiction writers seeking a more intuitive and commonsense guide to punctuation, as well as for those interested in learning about some of its more hidden aspects.\nSome of the best professional writers don't treat punctuation as a set of rigid rules to obediently follow. They see it, rather, as a tool for making their communication more engaging and captivating.\nYour school and college tutors may have discussed punctuation in a largely jargon-laden way that may have left you bored or mystified. You may even dread going back to the subject.\nThis course steers clear of all that. By the end, you may wonder why nobody told you punctuation could be so interesting.\nYou'll discover, for instance, that a comma doesn't just help create useful pauses in a sentence, but that it can be a mighty weapon letting you express your ideas with more clarity and gracefulness. You'll discover that colons don't just give you a neat way of introducing lists; they can be used to heighten drama and anticipation.\nIn fact, you'll come to see that each little symbol that you thought was so mundane has its own unique power to create special effects right across your writing.",

      "description": "People Skills - How People Tick & How To Read Them Instantly\nThe success or otherwise of any interaction in life comes down to your people skills. If you can understand what a person is thinking and feeling, then you can help them feel relaxed, welcome, and ultimately trust you.\nSo, if you are around people whether at work, socially – or even in your family, then this is the course for you.\n\n\nAndy Edwards is an international speaker and widely published author, who's been teaching business and relationship skills for more than 25 years. He's spoken to audiences all over the world (in person and online) and has an entertaining, practical teaching style. This course is guaranteed to keep you engaged, fascinated – and even amused, and will teach you life-changing skills to transform your business and personal life.\n\n\nThe course covers self-awareness:\nwhy you behave in the way you do\nhow relationships develop\nwhat to look out for when you first meet someone.\nWe also take a look at what psychometrics are based on:\nthe underpinning psychology\nwhy perception isn’t reality\ngood day vs bad day behaviours\nWe move on to how you can read and understand others by checking just three elements of their behaviour:\nbody language\ntone of voice\nvocal patterns and words used\nYou will also learn how we can use psychometrics to:\nadapt our behaviour to any situation\nconnect with others by learning and keeping in mind their ‘Motto’\ncommunicate with and influence others like never before\nBy the end of the course…\n… you will be able to anticipate others’ decision-making processes, their likely responses to your questions – their wants, their needs, their motivations, and their preferences.\nYou will know how to consciously adapt your behaviour and your own communication style to suit that interaction. The other person will walk away from a meeting you with an unconscious (or perhaps even conscious) sense of connection with you...\n· “What a nice guy.”\n· “She’s having a good day today!”\n· “She seems a trustworthy person.”\n· “He made me feel really comfortable.”\n· “It seems like I have known them for years!”\n\n\nIf it’s better business results that you’re after, then psychometrics could be your route to success. Why? Well, we all know that people buy people; so, when it comes to the true currency of a business, ‘Relationships’ not ‘Money’ takes precedence. In which case, it makes sense to help people get to know you, like you and trust you. With psychometrics, this becomes a simple – yet incredibly powerful process.\n\n\nIf you like the idea of finding out more about yourself and others… and you want to know a few answers to the question: “What makes people tick…?” Then let’s get started as soon as possible.",

      "description": "FROM THE CREATOR OF THE BESTSELLING WRITING WITH FLAIR: HOW TO BECOME AN EXCEPTIONAL WRITER COMES THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF SHANI RAJA'S WRITING COURSES...\nNINJA WRITING: The Four Levels Of Writing Mastery is designed to take you to the summit of flawless writing.\nThe course is taught by Shani Raja, a former editor for The Wall Street Journal whose premium writing courses have been featured in Time magazine and Business Insider and have attracted more than 200,000 students on this platform.\n\n\"This fantastic course should be in every writer's toolbox...\"  -- SAMUEL PHILLIP RANGER\n\n\"Opens your eyes to all that writing could be...\" -- SANDY, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Boosted my writing by one thousand percent...\" -- PAULO ARMI, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"This level of teaching is what I would expect to pay big $$ for...\" -- SARAH BLACK, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Solid gold...\" -- DON, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"A perfect breakup of the writing process...\" -- JOEY CRAY, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"One of the best writing courses I have ever taken...\" -- STEPHEN, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Brilliant...\" -- JOAN SALANITRI, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"Any aspiring writer would gain magnificent polish following the suggestions in this course...\" -- ROSILYN KINNERSLEY, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Gets you excited you purchased something of true value...\" -- MELANIE JARRELL\n\"Sound advice peppered with subtle insight....\" -- LORI, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"I feel like an inspired artist with... potential to create a masterpiece...\" -- ANZHELA SHURINA, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"Writing techniques down to the atomic levels of a narrative...\" --  ALDRICH DEMATA, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"When I had read the all time bestselling writer's guide by Strunk and White, I thought, 'There is nothing more to be known.' Shani proved that I was terribly wrong...\" -- GOPINATH CHANDRA, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Shani's courses have literally changed my life. I started applying for freelance blogging jobs. Now I'm making a living without having to work in a 9-5 environment...\" -- IVAN JURAS, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"Will improve your writing exponentially... I wish I had known about these subtle writing nuances when I was in college...\" -- KEVIN CHUNG, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Cannot believe how helpful this is...\" -- AMY, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"The way he teaches is absolutely amazing...\" -- FRANCESCO CATAPANO, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"Only four lessons in and I can see how to truly improve my writing...\" -- ANITA BYRD-PETTS, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"Am much happier with my writing since taking this course... so is my editor...\" -- JACK STEPHENS, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Will buy any future course... without any hesitation...\" -- AZAT MUKHAMETOV, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"As an eager blogger, I found this course extremely helpful...\" -- VASILEIOS PANAGOPOULOS, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Given me a deeper understanding of how to write a narrative...\" -- IAN MCLEAN, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"An excellent way to polish and enhance your writing...\" -- ISRAEL, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Brilliant, clear and precise instruction on how to write well...\" -- JANE MANTHORPE, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"Teaches how to recognize effective writing by explaining why it is effective... without getting bogged down explaining the finer points of grammar...\" -- DOUG UNRAU, UDEMY STUDENT\n\nWho doesn't want to enhance their prospects by writing much more stylishly than their peers and competitors?\n\nOr to make a mark on the world by writing an outstanding book or creating a magnificent blog read by thousands—or even millions—of people?\n\nAfter taking this course, that could be you.\nIt teaches you how to become not just an exceptional writer, but a masterful one. You'll know exactly how to get your writing noticed.\nIn Ninja Writing, you will discover how to embed quality at EVERY LAYER of your writing—whether it’s a blog, article, college essay, cover letter, corporate report or content marketing.\n\nBy the end, you’ll appreciate exactly how one piece of writing can be strikingly beautiful while another—on the same subject—bores you to tears.\n\"Up to this point, you've probably been bored with so many writing teachers who emphasize 'structure' through grammar tips and organization with a shot of word selection. But Shani covers that missing component: the artistry of writing. Writing can be just as fulfilling as painting, drawing or designing...\" -- SANDY, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Even my degree did not teach me to write at these levels...\" -- YAP WAN XIANG, UDEMY STUDENT\n\nSo, what exactly is a ninja writer?\n\nIt's someone who can take disjointed thoughts and ideas and create beautiful narratives out of them.\nThat is the hallmark of a distinguished writer: one who understands how to build points elegantly, wrap them into neatly arranged sections, and then thread the ideas through exquisitely organized paragraphs.\n\nA ninja writer has mastery over the sentence layer of writing as well.\nHe or she instinctively understands how to tighten loose sentences, sharpen blurred ones, and bring rhythm to those that don't flow well.\nFinally, ninja writers wield invincible power over words. They’re able to bring color, variety and freshness into their writing through their word choices, while slicing away any that have lost their edge or carry dead weight.\n\nWhile a bad writer can make a mess even of the most sublime thinking, a ninja writer’s prose—blogs, essays, or any kind of business writing—always ends up looking spectacularly polished.\nThe fact is that great writing isn’t just a nice skill to have. It’s vital to conveying intelligence and professionalism to your bosses, clients, business partners, and blog or book readers.\nFrankly, if you don't have this part of your life handled, you'll probably get fewer career chances, less shots at a promotion, and not as many eyeballs online.\nAnd instinctively you know it.\nIf you’re a blogger, the world may miss out on your brilliant ideas, simply because your writing is too dull or unwieldy to take seriously.\nRemember that we live in the internet age, where a growing army of writers are competing to get noticed in an expanding sea of content.\nThis course will give you an edge.\nIt’ll quickly take your writing to a level of refinement that will mystify anybody who doesn’t know these elite techniques.\nHere's a chance to take your writing to a level that, honestly, blows your competition out of the water.\n\n\"All I can say is WOW! After only a few lessons I went from struggling to write fewer than five hundred coherent words in two hours to easily churning out well written, well thought out content in less than 20 minutes.\" -- LISA THOMPSON, UDEMY STUDENT\nJust the understanding that writing has four layers can make a huge difference to how effectively you communicate.\n\nIf you don't know anything about those layers yet, don’t fret.\nOnly a handful of writers do, and many are editors who work, as I have done, for top news organizations.\nThey spend all day bringing order and beauty to whatever article is presented to them.\nThey know how to focus on areas that bring structure to untidy prose, and a razor-sharp focus to disorderly ideas.\nI know how rare this skill is because until recently I was an editor at The Wall Street Journal, where I taught many of the newspaper's journalists how to add style, flair and potency to their articles.\nI've also written for The Economist, Financial Times, Bloomberg News and other highly regarded news institutions.\nIn Ninja Writing, I share what I’ve learned at those places under the mentorship of some of the best editors in the world.\nOnce you've learned their secrets, you too will be able to weave magic with your words.\nYou'll know how to create spellbinding narratives, breathe life into tired sentences, and dazzle readers with the words you choose.\nYou'll also write with more confidence.\n\n\n\n\"My writing has dramatically improved...\" -- LYNN, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Can’t wait to use all the tricks and techniques...\" -- ADAPERIO, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"The Strunk and White guide for today's world... sure to be a classic...\" -- DERRICK HOWELL, UDEMY STUDENT\n\nOne of the biggest problems novice writers have is not knowing if their writing is any good.\n\nThat won’t be a problem for you anymore.\nYou’ll know that it is.\nNinja Writing: The Four Levels Of Writing Mastery takes the mystery out of the writing process.\nThe tricks and tactics taught here will create a seismic shift in the quality of your writing, almost immediately.\nYou’ll express yourself as brilliantly as some of the slickest editors on the planet.\n\nYou’ll understand how to turn any kind of mediocre business writing into masterful prose.\nThe content here goes beyond what is taught in Writing With Flair: How To Become An Exceptional Writer, one of Udemy’s best-selling courses.\nIn Writing With Flair, I gave you a powerful framework for creating outstanding writing based on the three principles of simplicity, clarity and elegance.\nThe sweep of Ninja Writing: The Four Levels Of Writing Mastery is much broader.\nIt covers the whole territory of nonfiction writing, giving you a ground-up-and-top-down view of what’s needed to inject quality into EVERY PORE of your writing.\nIf Writing With Flair turned you into an exceptional writer, Ninja Writing will mould you further into an elite one.\nLike my other courses, Ninja Writing steers clear of needlessly complicated jargon. You’ll simply get strategies to help you write with impeccable style and poise.\nThe course has been designed to help you reach the top of the learning curve in as little as a few days.\nYou’ll discover ways of looking at your writing that will elevate it to a plane most others don’t even know exists.\nIn Ninja Writing, I reveal the four levels of writing mastery you must work to perfect.\nTHE NARRATIVE LEVEL\nHow to connect with your audience, organize your writing magnificently, start your piece with a bang, end with a flourish, and embed it with powerful imagery. Getting the structure right is one of the hardest skills to master, but I'll make it super easy for you in this section.\nTHE PARAGRAPH LEVEL\nHow to weave points through paragraphs, so your writing looks exceptionally ordered and polished.\nTHE SENTENCE LEVEL\nHow to turn limp and bloated sentences into sharp, graceful and rhythmic expressions of your ideas.\nTHE WORD LEVEL\nHow to choose precise and evocative words, and strip your writing of any that carry dead weight.\nWith heaps of examples and exercises to embed these tactics deep into your subconscious, by the end of Ninja Writing you’ll begin to see precisely the mistakes others are making.\nAnd your own writing will shine like a polished diamond next to the lackluster efforts of your peers and business competitors.\nInvest today in discovering techniques that will superpower one of the most important skills you'll ever need in life -- communicating with style.\n\nLearn to:\nTransform a weary marketing email into a persuasive sales pitch...\nTranslate a lackluster cover letter into a hard-hitting document...\nConvert a dreary college essay into an compelling argument...\nTurn a lifeless blog into a poignant masterpiece...\n\n\nDISCOVER AT THE NARRATIVE LEVEL...\n\nHow to overcome writer's block\nHow to decide what to say\nHow to connect with your audience\nHow to create tone and pace\nHow to organize your ideas neatly\nHow to start with a bang and end on a high note\nHow to texture your writing\nHow to add more without resorting to fluff\n\n\n...AT THE PARAGRAPH LEVEL...\nDifferent paragraph styles so you can choose what suits your work best\nHow to weave points expertly through paragraphs\nHow to know when to switch to a new paragraph\n\n\nAT THE SENTENCE LEVEL...\nHow to tighten sentences\nHow to sharpen sentences\nHow to give sentences rhythm\nHow to create poetic sentences\nHow to maximise the dramatic impact of a sentence\n\n\n...AT THE WORD LEVEL...\nHow to choose precise words\nHow to avoid abstract words\nHow to find colorful words\nHow to avoid pointless distinctions\nHow to make useful ones\nHow to order words elegantly\nHow to exploit word sounds\nHow to slice syllables\nHow to boost your vocabulary\n\n\nStart learning these elite writing tactics today.\nIn case you have any hesitation, know you're covered by Udemy's month-long money-back guarantee, so there's no risk dipping your feet in and trying this course out.\n\nAnd take a peek at these reviews of WRITING WITH FLAIR: HOW TO BECOME AN EXCEPTIONAL WRITER...

      "description": "Earn your business more repeat buyers, and career growth for you as a customer service agent by delighting customers and creating \"WOW\" moments for them.\n\n\nGOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE IS YOUR SECRET WEAPON\n\n\nThe key to your business growth lies in thrilling your current customers - not just chasing new ones.\nWhen you provide a TRULY STANDOUT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, clients BUT AGAIN AND BRING FRIENDS along, too. You can skip the constant chase and let your delighted clients do your marketing for you.\nSeasoned entrepreneurs know that an \"OKAY\" product won't cut it.\nDelivering exceptional customer service fuels customer excitement, sparking emotional \"WOW\" connections that make your product feel even better.\nWhen you ignite positive reactions in your customers, they connect those feelings with your brand - making them loyal fans who remember you and keep coming back.\n\n\nTWO KEYS TO MAKE CUSTOMERS YOUR BIGGEST FANS\n\n\nThere are two essential strategies that turn one-time buyers into loyal superfans:\n\n\n1) Customer EXPERIENCE - the proactive approach to delivering exceptional care. This means identifying your best clients and creating memorable touches—like a thoughtful birthday gift—that make them feel valued and appreciated. You need to go beyond meeting expectations and learn how to turn customers into loyal, enthusiastic superfans.\n\n\n2) Customer SERVICE - the reactive approach. It means the skillful handling of challenges as they arise—addressing issues, resolving concerns, and turning problems into trust and loyalty.\n\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between Customer Experience and Customer Service?\n\nCustomer Experience means proactively building loyalty from the start. It’s the extra mile that turns customers into advocates. Customer Service, however, is the essential, reactive support that transforms dissatisfaction into satisfaction, ensuring every customer interaction strengthens the relationship.\nLeverage BOTH as powerful tools - not just for happier customers, but to boost your brand, drive sales, and create lasting connections.\n\n\nWHAT IS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND HOW IT IS DIFFERENT FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT\n\n\nCustomer experience is different from customer service. Customer experience is a proactive approach where you create ways to identify good clients and give them a better customer experience.\nFor example, give them something for free when it's their birthday. They will appreciate that and become more loyal as customers. Customer experience is proactive whereas customer support is reactive.\n\n\nTURN EVEN ANGRY AND UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS INTO LOYAL CLIENTS WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE\n\n\nAngry customers are not wrong, crazy, or mean. They are just frustrated and they want your product to work for them. If you provide great customer service, respect them, listen to them, and offer a great solution that works and fixes their problems, you can turn them into clients who are loyal long-term.\n\n\nAnd it’s an OPPORTUNITY for you!\n\n\nWHAT IS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND HOW IT IS DIFFERENT FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT\n\n\nCustomer experience is different from customer service. Customer experience is a proactive approach where you create ways to identify good clients and give them a better customer experience. For example, give them something for free when it's their birthday. They will appreciate that and become more loyal as customers. Customer experience is proactive whereas customer support is reactive.\n\n\nCOURSE MATERIAL IS FROM SUCCESSFUL PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY GOOD PRACTICES\n\n\nOnce I started applying the customer experience ideas in this course, it caused more positive responses from my customers, more sales, more repeat customers, more good reviews, and business growth.\nI rarely see other entrepreneurs apply these strategies, which is why I feel that they are only used by advanced and experienced entrepreneurs. Customer support isn't hard. It just requires care and attentiveness.\n\n\nREAL-WORLD STRATEGIES FROM PERSONAL SUCCESS AND INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES THAT DRIVE REAL RESULTS\n\n\nThese customer experience strategies come from real-life wins and proven industry practices.\nWhen I put these methods into action, I saw a dramatic shift: happier customers, more sales, repeat clients, glowing reviews, and real business growth.\nVery few entrepreneurs know or use these techniques, making them a true edge for experienced and high-level businesses.\nOutstanding customer support isn’t hard; it just takes genuine care and attention.\n\n\nSKILLS THAT WORK FOR ANY BUSINESS - ONLINE OR OFFLINE\n\n\nThe skills you’ll gain in this course will help you retain loyal customers, grow your reputation, and increase revenue.\nFor brick-and-mortar businesses, you’ll learn how to create a welcoming environment, and turn every visit into a reason for customers to come back.\nOnline businesses will gain tools to deliver exceptional support through email, chat, or social media, building loyalty even without face-to-face interaction.\nService providers, from consultants to local businesses, will discover strategies to wow clients, encourage referrals, and keep their schedules full.\n\n\nGET SPECIFIC STRATEGIES YOU CAN USE NOW\n\n\nThis course cuts the fluff and gets straight to the point. Every lesson gives you practical steps you can apply immediately—no wasting time.\nEven if your customer service is already good, you’ll discover fresh ideas that work. And these strategies don’t take hours to implement. At every step, you’ll see ways to improve, keep more customers, and grow your business fast.\n\n\nRESPONSIVE AND CARING INSTRUCTOR: WORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT\n\n\nIf you have questions, know that I am here to help! I answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours. Many students tell me that other instructors don't respond. Well, I do because\n1) I care about my students.\n2) I feel a responsibility to make sure that students get their money's worth from the course.\n3) I’m committed to delivering real value by giving you practical, actionable skills you can use immediately.\n\n\nMONEY-BACK GUARANTEE\n\n\nThis customer service and customer experience course has an unconditional, Udemy-backed, 30-day money-back guarantee. This is not just a guarantee, it's my personal promise to you that I will go out of my way to help you succeed just like I've done for thousands of my other students.\n\n\nInvest in your future.

Took my test last week and my result is out. I got an 8! I got a friggin 8!\" -- Ede Omokhudu, Udemy student\n\"I was expecting it to be a stereotypical tutorial course but it turned out to be a lot more than that. The course touched on other aspects of speaking English in general that I would have otherwise missed if I had not taken the course. The course is concise and really helpful for those looking to add a bit of that natural essence and flair in your English.\" -- Rahil Rajbhandari, Udemy student\n\"Fabulous insights, not just for achieving higher IELTS bands but also to improve your overall communication skills and leave an impact on the other person. Recommended to everyone.\" -- Mit Sheta, Udemy student\nEvery year, millions of people around the world dream of making it big in English-speaking countries like the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US.\nFor many, IELTS is the magic ticket to getting accepted into universities, landing their perfect job and obtaining residency.\nBut many people from places like India, China, Brazil, and other countries where English isn't the first language, fail to score high enough marks in the IELTS examination to achieve their ambition.\nHi, I'm Misa Zhang, and a few years ago I scored an overall 8.5 out of 9 in the IELTS test. In the speaking part, I obtained a band 9, the highest possible score.\nThat result got me permanent residency in Australia, where I've built a successful career in sales working for top-tier global companies, including Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, Wood Mackenzie and Thomson Reuters.\nI got my exceptional IELTS speaking score by using a combination of \"technical\" and \"people\" skills that I teach in this program.\nIELTS has four components: listening, reading, writing and speaking. Of those four, most people struggle with writing and speaking, because those rely less on easily learnable rules and more on creative ability and language mastery.\nWhile things like grammar, vocabulary and other technical elements are important, those who focus solely on those lose sight of a whole universe of conversation and people skills that are less tangible and often neglected.\nLearning those skills could boost their speaking score to well above the minimum requirement -- all the way up to the maximum 9.\n*****NOTE: This course does not cover the basics of grammar and pronunciation, as there is plenty of material covering those topics, and it's assumed you have obtained such fundamental  knowledge before taking this program.*****\nThe official IELTS scoring guide defines success as competence in vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and fluency. Such technical skills are, no doubt, of critical importance.\nBut what made the biggest difference, in my case, were the \"people\" skills many IELTS teachers and students aren't even aware of.\nThose skills -- things like mindset, body language, the ability to stir emotions, showing cultural sensitivity and avoiding verbal and other landmines -- helped set me apart from other candidates.\nUsing those techniques, developed through years of working as a sales professional, I managed to create an instant connection with my examiner, answer difficult questions while maintaining an upbeat vibe, and leave a strong impression by projecting a positive personality throughout the interview.\nWhat's more, I was able to demonstrate a high degree of cultural awareness, while neutralising my accent to the extent that the examiner couldn't hide her surprise and even asked where I learned my English from.\nFew of those people skills are taught in other IELTS courses, but they're essential for survival in the sales industry, where clients don't give you a second chance if you fail on the first impression.\nTake this course and you too will discover the techniques that will make you stand out and sparkle in the speaking examination, including:\n* How to evolve from a 6 to a 9\n* How to grasp the basic requirements of vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, accent, and fluency\n* How to make your answers relevant\n* How to be interesting, logical and genuine\n* How to master speech structures that help your answers seem coherent and convincing\n* How to come up with appropriate things to say\n* The right mindset for displaying confidence\n* How to create a good first impression through appearance, body language, facial expressions, and small talk\n* How to give powerful answers that will stir emotions\n* The importance of curiosity\n* The value of displaying humor\n* Other superior qualities to portray, and which to avoid\n* How to prepare for the speaking test in the long-term and short-term\n* How to overcome nerves in the exam, buy yourself time, and leave a glowing final impression\nIf you can grasp the essence of this course, practice diligently and internalize these skills, you'll likely walk into the examination room with an air of confidence that will set you apart.\nBut the benefits of learning what I'm going to teach you go well beyond the initial objective you have of passing the IELTS test.\nThey'll help you, as well, to improve your social experience overseas, to get your voice and opinion heard, to be recognised and respected for your unique personality and talent, to make fabulous friends at university, to find well paid jobs, to build a successful business, to make a tremendous social impact, to develop a high-quality network, to get into to a desired social circle, or simply to enjoy yourself at any party.\nThis is not black magic, it is simple and plain fact - communications skills at a higher level is directly correlated to the success in all above areas. And any improvement counts, even just a little, especially in the beginning when you're trying to get the direction right. Of course, your own dedication in practicing in the long term makes the rest of the difference.\nThe course was co-designed with Shani Raja, one of the most successful instructors on the Udemy platform, whose courses are enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of students worldwide.",

Writing well is a vital part of any successful career or business. If you want to thrive at work you need to thrive at writing. By the end of this course, you will have developed writing skills that will propel your career to the next level.\n5 STAR REVIEW - “This is such an amazing well structured, clear/concise course with immense value for anyone who needs to write articles and content of any nature.” A.P.\nMy name is Mark Morris. I’m an award-winning professional speechwriter with eighteen years of experience. I've written for senior politicians in the United Kingdom and, for ten years, I was the speechwriter for the NATO Secretary General. During my career I’ve written thousands of speeches to audiences across Europe and North America.\nI’ve written countless debates in the British Parliament. I’ve written articles for newspapers including The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, La Repubblica, El Pais, The Times and Die Welt. I’ve also written for magazines including Wired and Newsweek. I even had the honour of writing an historic and award-winning speech to a joint meeting of the United States Congress. In this course, I’ll give you the full benefit of my years of experience and expertise to set you on the path to writing success.\n5 STAR REVIEW - “I really enjoyed the course. Each lesson was interesting and full of examples. Mark is a real specialist in his field and it's clear that he is passionate about his work. You are not only listening to empty words but learning from someone's experience - which for me is the best way. Even now, writing this review, I am trying to implement what I have learnt - which is a good proof of this course being a 5 stars one.” A.A.\nThis is not a technical course full of complex grammar. It focusses on the timeless principles that you can use to produce clear, powerful, persuasive writing. It also includes a section on how you can use ChatGPT as a powerful tool for your business writing.\nThe course starts by looking at what good writing is and at the evidence as to why writing well is so important. The course is then divided into three main sections: before you write (planning), while you write (writing), and after you write (editing).\nPart One: Planning: In this section, I’ll show you what you need to do before you put pen to paper. We’ll ask the big questions you need to answer for everything you write:\nWhat is your objective? If you don’t know what you want, you’re unlikely to get it.\nWho is your reader? Only by understanding your reader and consciously writing for them can you achieve your objectives.\nWhat is your voice? Who or what do your words represent? Yourself, your boss, your company? Only by having a clear and consistent voice can you achieve your objectives.\nI’ll then show you how to plan and structure your work to lead your reader from where they are to where you want them to be.\n5 STAR REVIEW - “Loved this course! Mark gives you what you need to write in clear English. He goes directly to the point with his ideas, examples, and summaries. After doing this course, I started to see that my writing has improved. My sentences are shorter, cleaner, and more direct. I can't wait to continue to practice all learned in the course. Here's fresh news! Mark remastered the videos recently. Now, it's much more pleasant to watch and to listen. Go for it that you won't regret.” B.B.\nPart Two: Writing: In this second section, I’ll guide you through the building blocks of writing: words, sentences, paragraphs and the whole piece. I’ll show you how to choose the right words and put them in the best order so you can achieve your objectives.\nIn this section you’ll learn techniques both ancient and modern that will turn your words into a powerful engine for achieving your goals. We’ll look at the logic and emotion of your words and at establishing credibility with your reader. I’ll also take you through many of the most common mistakes that people make in their writing, and how to avoid them.\n5 STAR REVIEW - “I loved the way he explained things, simple yet profound. Easy to understand; he lives up to his words. Highly recommended. Thank you so much.” B\nPart Three: Editing: In this section you’ll learn the vital art of editing. I’ll show you how to sharpen and smooth your first draft into something you can be truly proud of. I’ll show you how to test your words to see if they are clear, understandable and – most important - achieve your objectives.\n5 STAR REVIEW - “I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was fully comprehensive and packed with valuable tips to improve any type of writing. The tutor obviously had a lot of writing experience and didn’t hold back in sharing his knowledge. I liked the way he explained how to deal with writer’s block as it sounds very effective. I’ll definitely use it the next time my head feels empty.” S.M.\nPart Four: Writing with ChatGPT: In this section, I’ll show you how you can use ChatGPT to enhance your business writing. Artificial Intelligence has huge potential benefits, but it also comes with significant limitations. If you are to make the most of this powerful new technology, you need to understand both.\nYou’ll learn how to use ChatGPT, how it can help you write both simple and complex documents, how you can train it to mimic your own style or that of your company, how it can summarise and simplify text, and how you can use it to generate an endless stream of ideas for you and your company.\n\n\nFinally, I’ll share some of the techniques I use to be a productive and successful writer. I’ll show you how you can enter a ‘State of Flow’, where excellent writing comes easily, and how you can avoid ever suffering from writer’s block.\nIn each section, I’ll take you step-by-step through the techniques, tricks and habits that can transform your writing.\nIf you want to promote your business, excel in your career, and feel proud of your writing, Better Business Writing is the course for you.\nSo join over a hundred thousand people already improving their writing skills and enroll now!",

There are certain strategies, tools, and techniques you need to use in order to effectively calm an angry person down, and certain approaches you must avoid at all costs.\nYou will learn what changes take place to a person who becomes angry and why it is so important to calm that person down before you try to enter into conversation with them. This course teaches you how to do this. The steps shared in this course are often taught to customer service staff.\nTake on board the learnings, and practice in a safe environment, and you've be amazed and delighted with your new found confidence and abilities when next having to deal with an angry person.\nMy suggestion is not to rush your way through this course. Systematically practice the different strategies as you are introduced to them. For this you will need a partner - ideally somebody who is good at pretending they are angry! Practicing in a safe environment will prepare you for a real event.\nPlease Note: this course covers practical steps you can follow and the content is presented in layman terms. It is not designed for health professionals who most probably already have covered anger management as part of their training. Nor is this a Conflict Resolution course; this would be far more in-depth and would incorporate a small component on anger management.",

      "description": "Communication Skills are the most important personal skills you can ever develop for your success in life. Life is a series of communications. Those who develop strong communication skills do well in school, secure jobs, and promotions and often ascend to the highest levels of leadership in corporations, governments, and civic life. People who fail to develop communication skills often have their careers stagnate or plateau in the mid-range. Sadly, presentation skills are either not taught in primary or secondary education or are taught poorly.\nThe Complete Communication Skills Masterclass for Life course is your way to get a Master's level education on how to communicate effectively.\nThis course is designed to be a one-stop shop for all your communication skills training needs. This course covers a vast array of communication needs and scenarios, from how to communicate during a job interview, pitching investors, asking for a raise, speaking one on one, or to large groups. And it covers how to speak to big corporations when you have a problem with service, plus public speaking for kids, how to deliver a wedding speech, and even a eulogy. You will also become a master of persuasion, assertiveness, and all aspects of business communication. Your leadership abilities will expand dramatically as your social skills grow to allow you to communicate effectively in every situation.\nThis course has the following:\nMore lectures on communication skills than any other course on Udemy, by far.\nMore hours of communication skills training than any other course (30 hours long. Sometimes More is More!)\nMore in-depth training techniques than any other course.\n\n\n\"I've devoted the last 30 years of my life conducting live, in-person communication skills to Presidents, Prime Ministers, CEOs, Entrepreneurs, Senators, Nobel Peace Prize Winners, and Professional Athletes. Now, I'm excited to bring to you these same insider secrets that will transform you into an excellent presenter. If you take this course and do a few simple homework assignments, I am absolutely convinced I can make your communication skills world-class. You WILL be able to do the following in EVERY Presentation:\nLook comfortable, confident, and relaxed, regardless of whether you are sitting or standing, regardless of audience size.\nCommunicate so your audience understands you.\nCommunicate so your audience remembers your messages (this is the hardest part).\nInfluence people to take the actions you want.\"\nTJ Walker, President of Media Training Worldwide and best-selling Udemy Instructor.\n“TJ Walker's single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\" Bob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television\n“TJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\" Stu Miller, Viacom News Producer\n(TJ Walker's Media Training Worldwide) “The world's leading presentation and media training firm.\" Gregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor\nTJ Walker is the founder of Media Training Worldwide and has been conducting communication skills training workshops and seminars since 1984.

      "description": "You listen every day - now it’s time to learn active listening skills, and turn listening into a powerful advantage!\nMake listening and understanding people a strength. Develop stronger bonds with others, and be more productive in your professional life, and more fulfilled in your personal life!\n\n\nBECOME BETTER AT DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS LIKE TAKING FEEDBACK\n\n\nThis course teaches you how to give and receive feedback the right way, using the proven Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) model. No more awkward or tense conversations.\nGiving or taking bad, critical, or negative feedback at work or in your interpersonal situations can be difficult. Sometimes the conversation might even turn negative, and escalate into a conflict that is accompanied by negative emotions like anger, frustration, or even fear.\nYou’ll gain the skills to listen better, read emotions clearly, and handle difficult conversations with confidence. Instead of letting things go wrong, you’ll know exactly how to steer them toward positive outcomes. Master these techniques and notice the immense improvement in the quality of your relationships\n\n\nLEARN ACTIVE LISTENING\n\n\nActive listening is a technique that is used in counseling, training, and solving disputes or conflicts. It requires that the listener fully concentrate, understand, respond, and then remember what is being said. This is opposed to other listening techniques like reflective listening and empathic listening.\n\n\nUSE EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TO LISTEN AND CONNECT BETTER\n\n\nWhen you listen, there is much more to the conversation than just what's being said.\nYou have to think about the other person's emotions and do your best to direct their emotions and yours.\nBy mastering body language, facial cues, and tone of voice, you’ll build stronger connections, avoid misunderstandings, and achieve better results in every interaction.\n\n\nLISTEN WITH EMPATHY TO BUILD TRUST AND UNDERSTANDING\n\n\nActive listening is about truly understanding what people are saying. It's the process of hearing together with thinking about what is being said. It's also about suspending your own biases so you can better understand the other person. To be truly listening, you must be mentally present in the moment, and understand how the other person feels and how the topic of conversation impacts the other person's life.\nYou’ll learn exactly how to achieve that effortlessly, so it becomes a part of your personality.\n\n\nACTIVE LISTENING IS NOT JUST A PROFESSIONAL SKILL, IT IS A PART OF KINDNESS\n\n\nTruly listening takes a significant effort. We only truly listen if something is very important to us or when we are actively caring about the other person, and giving them our full care and attention.\nWhen you practice active listening, you show kindness, build trust, and make others feel valued—all while strengthening your personal and professional relationships.\n\n\nTHE LIFE-CHANGING BENEFITS OF ACTIVE LISTENING\n\n\nMost of us want to get better at talking. But the REAL power tool for influencing others, leading, collaborating, having an impact, and being an an-all-around-better person is active listening. While regular listening can look like being blank and silent, Active Listening is engaged, creative, and responsive. It’s impactful!\nGain both the internal awareness and external skillset that are the foundation of active listening. You will be able to have far more satisfying, interesting, successful conversations.\n\n\nTHE COURSE IS PRACTICAL, NOT THEORETICAL\n\n\nThis is not a theoretical course, you can immediately apply active listening in this course and see results.\nEvery lesson will give you practical ideas that you can apply in your next conversation.\nThese are the same listening techniques that I have applied in my professional life and that I have shared with my clients in coaching, and that you can apply too.\n\n\nHOW LISTENING HELPS ME (AND HOW IT CAN HELP YOU TOO)\n\n\nAs a professional, I know I need to keep improving everything about my work. I am also aware of having blindspots. I am human, and I don't always understand all the ways I need to improve. No one knows every way they need to improve. But we can learn.\nThis is why we must listen to cues from other people and various situations in life. People don’t often tell us directly what they want or what they would like us to improve. With active listening every conversation becomes more clear!\nWhen we listen to others about how we can improve, and when we read subtle cues, it makes us better long-term.\n\n\nHARNESS THE POWER OF REFLECTIVE LISTENING\n\n\nReflective listening is a term that is often used interchangeably with active listening, but it means going a step beyond just listening, but also reflecting on what the other person might be feeling and going through. Reflective listening helps you reach a deeper level of empathy.\n\n\nGIVING AND RECEIVING FEEDBACK WITH IMPACT\n\n\nActive listening is a critical skill in the workplace, especially when it comes to feedback. When you’re leading a team, collaborating with colleagues, or discussing performance, you’ll often find yourself giving and receiving feedback.\nEnroll to learn how to truly understand the other person’s perspective when receiving feedback, so you can respond constructively and grow from every interaction.\n\n\nLISTENING REDEFINED: TAKE YOUR SKILLS TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL\n\n\nYes, you already know how to listen—but this course transforms it into a life-changing skill. It’s most useful if you are leading a team, resolving conflicts, managing projects, or simply building better relationships. Active listening has an immediate impact.\nYou’ll be able to deal with tough feedback at work, read non-verbal cues in meetings, or truly understand a client’s needs—all with ease.\nIn just a few hours, you’ll master principles so simple yet powerful that anyone can apply them, no matter your current level of emotional or social skills.\nThis course is perfect for beginners but advanced enough to elevate even seasoned professionals.\nIt’s fast to learn, easy to implement, and relevant in every role.\nStart today and see the difference active listening makes in your career and life.\n\n\nDEVELOP YOUR SOFT SKILLS FOR BUSINESS\n\n\nIn professional settings, we often compete with co-workers or other businesses that have similar skillsets. Soft skills like leadership, communication skills, self-management, personal development, time management, and productivity will help you get ahead.\nImprove your soft skills, and watch your business or career skyrocket.\n\n\nRESPONSIVE AND CARING INSTRUCTOR: WORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT\n\n\nIf you have questions that come up while taking this active listening course, know that I am here to help! I answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours. Many students tell me that other instructors don't respond. Well, I do because:\n1) I care about my students.\n2) I feel a responsibility to make sure that students get their money's worth from the course.\n\n\nInvest in yourself. Enroll today!",

      "description": "We are top Udemy instructors in the personal development category. Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\n\n\nDo you ever feel distracted, anxious, or frustrated dealing with conflict with your coworkers or your boss?\nOr, are you a manager who has to address conflict with your employees or between team members?\nThe truth is that conflict is an inevitable part of work life, and it does not only affect those who are directly involved, it impacts the entire team, department, and organization. How you, and the organization you work for, manage conflict is what ultimately determines the level of productivity and fulfillment you will experience at work.\n\nAs a manager or business executive, workplace conflict should be a high priority issue because it leads to decreased productivity and high employee turnover.\nIn fact, research has shown that conflict on the job was cited as the reason people leave their jobs in 50% of cases.\nAnd, studies have revealed that the average U.S. employee spends 2.8 hours a week dealing with conflict. Between those two factors, that is a huge loss of revenue and potential growth.\nConflict at work can be caused by a number of factors, including misunderstandings, miscommunication, perceived threats, personality clashes, a competitive environment, or different values or beliefs.\nBut, the biggest problem caused by conflicts are not the conflicts themselves, but rather the way conflicts are handled—and in many cases not handled at all. Humans are psychologically wired to seek pleasure and avoid pain. So, naturally, we avoid dealing with conflict. The problem is avoiding or mishandling conflicts causes bigger problems with long-term consequences that can be detrimental to our psychological well-being and the success of any team or organization.\nBut, not all conflict is inherently bad—in fact it can be both healthy and beneficial.\nWhen an effective system for managing differences of opinion is put into place, conflicts can be the source of tremendous growth and creativity. When the corporate environment is one of trust and openness, individuals see disagreements as an opportunity to find common ground and conflicts as a source of creative solutions. When the fear of win-lose situations is eliminated, win-win situations become a common goal.\nSince conflict is a normal part of business life, it is essential to develop the skills to be able to prevent and manage it. The best way to manage conflicts is to:\nStay ahead of conflict by being prepared\nHave a clear process for handling conflict\nProvide employees with the tools and skills need to deal with conflict\nIn this course, you will:\nDevelop an understanding of common sources of conflict and awareness of what signs to look for, so you can prevent or minimize conflict by catching it early.\nFind out your natural conflict management style—whether you withdraw, back down, compete, compromise, or truly collaborate and how to change your reactions to be more effective.\nCreate a psychologically safe work environment in which individuals and teams feel confident expressing themselves, making mistakes, and speaking up because they trust that they will not be reprimanded or ridiculed, and that they will be supported in their quest for improvement.\nKnow when to intervene and the best and worst times to approach handling the conflict,, including how to de-escalate a conflict that has become heated or emotional, while not reacting emotionally yourself.\nFacilitate conflict resolution conversations, using powerful communication techniques and knowing important mistakes to avoid.\nYou’ll also learn the 6 Steps to Conflict Resolution, including important conflict resolution skills like:\nEffective listening and communication techniques\nEssential problem-solving strategies\nStrategies for following-up and moving forward in a way that ensures resentment doesn’t linger and conflicts don’t re-occur\nWe’ll also provide additional insights for handling conflicts depending on who your conflict is with, such as a conflict with your boss or manager, your employees, or within a team.\nSo, are you ready to transform your work environment, experience and relationships?

We'll look at different dimensions of cultural diversity and how they impact our priorities, perceptions and how they can cause mis-understandings. After a short excursion to some of the brain science that further manifests the power of culture as a filter for reality, we'll look at different cases and what we can do to communicate more effectively in environments that are saturated with cultural diversity in order to create something remarkable.

You can become a captivating speaker and presenter after you earn the techniques of expert storytelling.\nBecoming good at storytelling is not a difficult art reserved for highly talented and gifted. Speaking expert TJ Walker breaks down all the steps needed to become comfortable and skilled at storytelling.\nThis comprehensive storytelling course is the longest and most thorough of any on this platform. The course will not only serve you well in the short term but provide a handy reference for you on every aspect of storytelling for years to come.\nAttention: TJ Walker will personally critique your storytelling abilities. Each student is asked to post several videos of themselves delivering stories. This is the most meaningful and helpful part of the storytelling course.\n****\nPlease note: this is a course on how to tell stories while presenting and delivering speeches. The instructor demonstrates and teaches this storytelling skill by speaking directly to you, the student. If you are looking for a course with lots of graphics, edits, sound effects, and other distractions, this course is not for you.\n\n\nHere is what Udemy students say about this course:\n\"I've always been a storyteller and it's been a blessing to me. But still, it's really important to polish these skills and T.J. Walker puts lights on the missing or forgotten details! It's easy to throw rock's but I'm going to move emotional mountains with my stories- chin- chin!\" Kim Thomas Wroldsen\n\"So much content so well organized and beautifully delivered\" Mahesh Yadav\n\"I think TJ has over-delivered in every aspect, I have taken multiple courses in this category but I think TJ's course is one of its kind and is a complete guide and beats many. I love his delivery, suggestions, and style.\" Umair Maqsood\n\"This man is my father figure. I admire him and love him as if he were family. It’s a strong word but through the passion of engagement, I believe we are kin. These seed(s) he’s planted in this course and into our conscious are the seeds that will empower us to make an ever-lasting effect on others in the world! Truly a remarkable course. It would be an honor to one day meet this guy.\" Matthew Martinez\n\"The most complete storytelling course, It is long because ideas are reinforced by providing lots of examples which for me is the best way to learn.

The best so far is learning the trick to get the Audience to Ignore the mistakes that you might make..\"  Belinda Steeneveld\n\"This is totally imho: a very good and useful (for me) course. It consists of several smaller courses, so information repeats from time to time, but you can skip it if you wish. Video-timing is convenient. Tips are understandable and easy, you won't find here super-extraordinary techniques, but you will find things that do work (which may seem obvious, but people do not often use them). It is obvious that (and why) TJ is a great professional. I've carried out a lot of useful information and definitely like this journey, thank you a lot!\" Alexandra Shafran\n\n\nThis course is designed to help students improve in the following additional areas: Selling with stories, virtual sales presentations, pitching yourself, virtual interviewing, remote selling using stories, sales training, and communicating to drive change.\nAnd so much more...\n\n\nThis Storytelling course is ideal for anyone searching for more info on the following: storytelling - storytelling for business - story - public speaking.

This is a course for people who are truly willing to understand instead. A course for people who would rather do it right than hustle and hassle people. Once you work your way through the more than 45 lessons, your strategy will become more clear, your empathy will deepen and you'll begin to see the market as it is, instead of merely wishing it to be what you want. This video-highlights course includes all the lessons, but not the case studies or discussions.\nMore than 15,000 people have worked together learning from Godin's Marketing Seminar, but you might prefer the solitude and adjustable pace of a solo course. If that's what you're looking for, this is a great place to begin.\nHere's what marketing legend Jay Levinson had to say about Seth:\nTake Leo Burnett, David Ogilvy, Bill Bernbach and Mark Twain.

      "description": "Hi, I'm David Nihill. I've spent over 10,000 hours on stage. Here's how I can help you:\nI've always been afraid of public speaking but I'm lucky enough to have the option to get paid to do it. Wacky I know. To try and overcome my own fears I spent the last 11 years on every stage I could find. I've won storytelling and standup comedy competitions, have a talk on TED, spoke at many of the world's largest tech and business conferences, recorded a comedy special, and taught this topic at some of the world's leading institutions, like Stanford Business School and University of Oxford. I wrote a bestselling book on the not so sexy subject and run a high level ghostwriting company that's behind many of the world's highest profile leaders talks.\nI've applied a lot of what I've learned to help thousands of students manage fear of public speaking, give TED talks, be the one who speaks at conferences on behalf of their company, get promoted, get paid to speak (and get paid more to speak), deliver more engaging lectures, tell better and more impactful stories, and nail that wedding speech, job interview or non profit funding. Everything I learned clocking up over 10,000 hours on stage you'll learn in a fast and fun way. It will save you years of learning the hard way and is the most fun and laugh out loud way to become a better and more engaging public speaker.\n\n\nWhat they're saying about it:\n“My audiences were engaged, emotional, and laughing out loud. David Nihill is a master.” Blake Irving - Former CEO and Board Director of GoDaddy\n\n\n“I've given quite a few talks and David's content is the most helpful I've found on becoming a better speaker. Plus it made me laugh out loud!.” Justin Mares - Bestselling Author, Speaker, Founder of Kettle & Fire\n\n\n“This course is great. I haven’t taken it yet but David drew a picture when he was 6 years old of a penguin drinking beer in a Chinese restaurant and it was clear the potential for slight wisdom and misguided creativity were there.” —Marita Nihill, David’s Mother\n\n\nMost Presentations Are Glorified Snoozefests! Let's Change That\nAside from making your day a little less fun, boring presentations are also bad for business. Now, more than ever, your message is competing against hungry pets, rambunctious children, and everything happening on Tiktok. The good news: knowing a few techniques will make sure yours are never dull. The even better news: The bar out there is pretty low. No matter what your experience level, you can stand out fast. This course will make sure you do just that and in a fast and fun way, no matter what level you are. This is everything you'll ever need to know about public speaking in one place.",

It affects how well we build and maintain relationships, teach and manage, sell and persuade, and appreciate and understand. Our business and personal lives are often determined by it. As a species, we have been listening to survive and thrive throughout our millions of years of evolution - until recently.\n\nListening is not a natural skill: it takes focus and consciousness to do it well. And yet we don't teach it in schools, so in our always-on, multi-tasking world it is a skill that many people simply have never developed. The result of this is a restricted ability to communicate and engage, particularly among the young who have grown up using text-based communication as their primary and preferred mode of expression.\n\nAs an international speaker and author on these skills, I understand the impact of listening on communication, success and wellbeing. My TED talk on conscious listening is in the rare group that have achieved millions of views, and my book How To Be Heard is an award-winning bestseller.  I live to listen, and look forward to sharing the secrets of listening with you.\n\nSo join me as I help you become a master of Conscious Listening and bring confidence and control to your communication.",

Especially if you’re a smart, educated graduate who is having to adapt from an academic style to a new way of writing.\nAs a Udemy instructor since March 2015, I’ve taught over 145,000 students how to communicate more effectively with the written word. What's more, in October 2019, Udemy bestowed their Student Success award on me for my dedication to my Udemy students.\nAs a writer myself, I understand the importance of grabbing your audience’s attention - and keeping things to the point. And, as you’ll discover, as an instructor, I practise what I preach. The words students use most often in reviews of my Udemy courses  are ‘clear’, ‘concise’ and ‘engaging’.\nMy goal with Business Writing For Busy People is to show you the writing techniques that will win you similar plaudits for your work.",

      "description": "Emotional intelligence has been identified as a fundamental leadership skill in the 2020's.\nUsing emotional information appropriately builds relations and supports critical thinking and problem solving.  Decisions are confidently made that are ethical, authentic and empathetic.\nCritical thinking refers to the ability to analyse information objectively and make a reasoned judgement. Good critical thinking involves the evaluation of sources, such as data, facts, observable phenomena, and research findings.  Good critical thinking also considers unconscious bias and how this impacts upon logical thinking and systems thinking.\nCritical thinking and problem solving abilities are among the most sought-after skills in almost every industry and workplace.\nOften thinking is considered separate from emotions, but good critical thinkers use emotional intelligence to draw reasonable conclusions from a range of information sources determining what is useful and what isn’t.\nUsing emotional intelligence as a part of critical thinking means that the impact of this thinking is considered with empathy.\nCritical thinking is often confined to systems thinking, but to be an effective critical thinker involves understanding how emotions can help and hinder thinking processes.  This course explores the connection between critical thinking skills and emotional intelligence skills considering how they can be applied to strategic thinking skills in pragmatic and applicable ways. Combining critical thinking with emotional intelligence makes for a powerful combination.\nAlthough the course is based on scientific research, it does not go into detail around the research.  We explore the concepts in a straightforward, pragmatic manner to understand what they mean and how they be applied in the workplace.\nUnderpinning critical thinking skills is your cognitive bias - your unconscious bias.  Self-paced online programmes are widely regarded as one of the most accessible, and effective forms of building awareness about unconscious bias in the workplace.  The course investigates unconscious bias to develop your awareness.  Training in unconscious bias will not mean that you will not have biases.  They will remain, by definition, unconscious.  The course seeks to build your awareness of their existence and highlights when to look out for them.\nThis is not an introductory course on emotional intelligence. There are many courses by a range of good instructors that explain the some of the fundamental basics of emotional intelligence. This course explores emotional intelligence at a deeper level exploring its application to critical thinking.\nThere are four practical activities within the course.  These require you to apply both your critical thinking and emotional intelligence skills in different ways.\n\nReflecting about this Course\nExploring your Unconscious Bias\nAn Exercise in Critical Thinking (with the answers)\nThree Good Things to Improve your Emotional Intelligence as a Critical Thinker\nCompleting the course (including the practical activities) will give you the understanding and capabilities to meet future requirements of leadership as markets and industries evolve over the next few years.\nExplore and recognise thinking styles in problem solving and decision making, the information in emotions, the role of emotions in learning, unconscious bias, thinking distortions and much, much more.\n\n\nThis course is a Udemy highly rated course.  Despite this, it has recently received a few low ratings without comments.  I am not sure the reasons behind this.  Criticism and giving feedback with emotional intelligence is covered in the course (Critical Thinking and Criticism - free preview lecture 8).  Low raters who don't leave comments are not exercising their critical thinking skills nor their emotional intelligence!\n\n\nAll PDFs can be completed online and are Section 508 / ADA Accessibility compliant.\nAll videos are High Definition recorded in 1080p.\nAll videos have grammatically correct English captions.\nInteractive AI Role Play Exercise.\nLatest update - September 2025",

      "description": "Anyone can write a successful novel.\nYou just need to understand what makes a novel successful…\n\nHave you ever noticed that your favorite books and movies follow a similar pattern? Have you noticed that there’s something specific that happens about 25% of the way through the story that sends the story in a new direction? Or that huge plot twists tend to come right in the dead center of the story? Or that 75% of the way through there’s usually distinct “low point” or “rock bottom” where all seems lost for the main character?\nIf you have, then you’ve stumbled upon the secret storytelling code.\nThe secret storytelling code can be found in all great stories ever told. Movies, novels, novellas, plays, memoirs, short stories. Wherever there’s a narrative being told, the code is there, hidden beneath the surface.\nThis code (which inspired Blake Snyder’s famous Save the Cat! plotting method) is made up of 15 key story “beats,” or “plot points.”  The beats are markers along the path of the story that are used to track a character’s journey and ultimate transformation. And strung together, in the right order, these 15 beats make up a blueprint that anyone can follow to write a successful novel.\nSince discovering these 15 key story beats and harnessing their immeasurable power, bestselling author and award-winning writing instructor, Jessica Brody has sold more than 17 novels to major publishers like Simon and Schuster, Random House, and Macmillan. Her novels have been translated and published in over 23 countries and two are even in development as major motions pictures. Also, Jessica is repeatedly hired by Disney Press to develop and write novels based on popular Disney properties like the Disney Princess and the Disney Descendants franchises.\nJessica Brody is a certified instructor of the Save the Cat! plotting method and, in the past five years, has taught thousands of novelists from around the world how to harness the power of the 15 key story.\nNow, in this one-of-a-kind online master class on plot and story structure, Jessica Brody shares her profound knowledge on the topic of novel writing and expertly guides writers (new and seasoned alike!) through the elements of plot, story structure, and character transformation, and ultimately helps them discover the secrets to what makes a novel really resonate with readers.\n\n\n\"This course is a must for anyone trying to write an amazing story.\" - CHLOE, UDEMY STUDENT\n\n\"Absolutely brilliant.

He was also rated among the top 10% of most engaging Udemy instructors.\nIn this newly extended version of his flagship program, Shani reveals to non-journalists the \"superpower\" tactics of the world’s best editors. Learning their secrets will help you stand out in almost any field of writing.\n“Cuts through everything to the heart of excellent writing... the best course of its type that I’ve seen…” — MICHELLE BULLAS, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Mr. Raja brings crystal clear enlightenment and a power to writing that many, who have not discovered his teaching, are unaware they can achieve…” — CS. LAWRENCE, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Taught me in a few hours writing principles that would have taken me years to learn on my own…” — SEBASTIAN, UDEMY STUDENT\n“The most complete writing course I have taken. I’m really blowing away the competition at work…” — EDE OMOKHUDU, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Learned more from Shani about the art of writing than I ever did at school... was hooked right until the end…” — NIC JONES, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Improved my technique exponentially…” — NESTOR ARMSTRONG, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Unravels the problems many of us face when writing…” — STEPHEN, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Saw a noticeable difference in the length of time visitors stayed on my blog…” — PREM KUMAR, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Carries the weight and authority of experience…” — SEAN COOK, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Simple, clear, elegant and evocative…” — CLIFTON ZHUO, UDEMY STUDENT\n“His experience as a writer as well as a teacher shines through…” — NAINA MERETE HOLSVE, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Writing is no longer uncertain, confusing and ambiguous for me…” — RUDYARD VON, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Can see why this instructor’s course is a bestseller…” — ANNEGRET HERGERT, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Phenomenal course…” — DAN BALLMER, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Tremendous value…” — ELLIOT FINK, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Groundbreaking…” — MAXIM VOROSHILOV, UDEMY STUDENT\n“Wow…” — DANIEL BACALLAO, UDEMY STUDENT\nJust Imagine being able to write with the style and flair of journalists on top newspapers, who are skilled at producing punchy and potent articles for millions of readers every day.\nWhat could having such a rare talent do for your career, your business, or your dreams of becoming a successful author or blogger?\nIn this program, Shani introduces you to a range of exquisite writing tricks and tactics that most people outside the journalism profession are ignorant of, but which can make the difference between copy that is dull and flat, and prose that is lively and captivating.\nIn this acclaimed, 7-hour intensive writing training, Shani reveals how such accomplished editors do their magic. Fortunately, it boils down to mastering just four basic ingredients: simplicity, clarity, elegance and evocativeness.\nShani shows how a proper understanding of this \"secret sauce\" is all you need to become exceptional in virtually any field of writing.\nA complete writing system\nIn this program, you won't get the usual “writing tips” you can find all over the internet and in other similar online programs. The four ingredients form the basis of a complete writing system designed to drive you to the summit of slick writing — very fast.\nThe training may turn you into a confident author of blogs, books and business writing in as little as a few weeks. At the very least, you will understand how to infuse power and beauty into the soul of your writing to make it stand out dramatically.\nWhatever your writing ability now, you'll find yourself quickly transformed into an artistic composer of prose, whose copy sparkles with a rare sort of quality few people will understand, let alone be capable of emulating.\nThe “secret sauce” of flair\nIn the course, you will learn how to optimise each of the four ingredients so that, just like the world's finest editors, you can turn humdrum writing into something extraordinary every time. As a result, your copy will always be punchy, sharp, graceful and stimulating — the hallmarks of pretty much all exceptional prose.\nIn the SIMPLICITY section, you'll discover how to…\nWrite in plain, upbeat language\nSteer clear of official words that weigh your writing down\nShun redundant words that make your sentences move slowly\nDiscard filler and hedging language that produce \"hot air\"\nAvoid needlessly complex sentences that bog readers down\nStop yourself rambling and repeating yourself unnecessarily\nEliminate pointless distractions that obstruct comprehension\nClear away \"sentence clutter\" that can throw readers off\nIn the CLARITY section, how to...\nRecognise “fuzzy” and out-of-focus ideas that blur your message\nPrevent readers from getting confused or ever going blank\nSteer clear of imprecise jargon\nMake clear distinctions between contrasting ideas\nAvoid randomly mixing up time elements (past, present, future)\nEradicate ambiguity and double-meanings\nPlace \"modifying\" words carefully\nAvoid tangled and \"curly\" writing that may baffle readers\nUse potentially confusing words like \"this\" and \"that\" more carefully\nIn the ELEGANCE section, how to...\nMaintain an elegant consistency throughout your writing\nKeep sentences neat and parallel\nCraft graceful, flowing narratives\nCreate delightful sentence rhythms\nAvoid inelegant \"word echoes\"\nSmoothly transition between ideas\nConstruct \"pretty\" paragraphs\nPresent your copy ultra-professionally\nAnd in the EVOCATIVENESS section, how to...\nAvoid soul-killing clichés\nAdd variety to sentence structures\nBring a fresh scent to your prose\nAvoid the boring passive voice\nStop tiresomely \"reversing\" into sentences\nMake your writing more dramatic\nCreate spectacular imagery\nMaster the tone of your writing\nGive life and character to your copy\n\"A compass for those who set out bravely to explore the distant shores that only stories ever spoke of. To the North, Shani will guide you to the austere mountains; simplicity. To the East, Shani will guide you to the crystal forests; clarity. To the South, Shani will guide you to the golden palace; elegance. To the West, Shani will guide you to the hidden alchemists; evocativeness. Do not rush. Shani has charted a course that you may journey for many years to come. Congratulations, you have stumbled upon one of Earth's rare skeleton keys. Don't overlook this auspicious opportunity...\" — JULIEN MCLAREN, UDEMY STUDENT\nWelcome to the world of “elite” writing\nGood writing isn’t just another nice-to-have skill. It’s one of the most important ones you need for conveying a professional image at work, landing a high-profile job, and getting your online content noticed.\nBut while plenty of people can write, few can do so with style and flair of top journalists, who are familiar with heaps of fancy tricks and tactics that lift their writing above the ordinary.\nAfter taking this course, you’ll be able to do the same.\nImagine having the power to leave readers spellbound by your writing, the same as one might feel after reading a gripping story in a newspaper like The Economist.\nIn this course, Shani teaches you how to craft such impossibly beautiful prose by revealing not just the key ingredients of good nonfiction writing, but also by sharing the mindset of the elite writers he has worked with and also trained.\n“If Shani Raja was a baseball player, he hit the ball out of the park. The curriculum, into which he obviously poured years of successful writing and editing know-how, is comprehensive, engaging and experiential…” — JEAN, UDEMY STUDENT\nOnce your mindset has been appropriately shaped, Shani will reveal the four ingredients of exceptional writing in all their glory — proving that simplicity, clarity, elegance and evocativeness are the only qualities needed to create standout writing.\nShani has used this powerful formula to train journalists in top news organisations, as well as to boost the writing skills of his hundreds of thousands of Udemy students.\nSoon, you too will know how to magically enhance your  blogs, essays, books, business writing, or indeed any other type of nonfiction prose.\nTHE COURSE COMES WITH A 30-DAY, NO-QUESTIONS-ASKED, FULL MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE, SO THERE IS NO RISK IN ENROLLING TODAY AND SEEING IF IT’S FOR YOU.\nSo, join the hundreds of thousands of students who’ve already invested in discovering these and many more powerful writing secrets from an accomplished news editor.\n\"Better than any course I took in college...\" — ANNA TIERNEY, UDEMY STUDENT\n“There are twenty courses in my Udemy folder, of which seventeen are in some genre of writing. Eight of those courses are Shani’s, and I've learned more from those than from all the others combined…” — SCOTT RALSTON, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"The caliber of instruction one might receive from a traditional university...\" — DAVID NICHOLAS TAYLOR, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"If you are looking for a writing course that is outstanding look no further...\" — MATT SPRENGER, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Worth more than the months I slaved over books and other online writing courses...\" — CONOR WELLMAN, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Stunning course... delivered masterfully...\" — PEDRO CARROGGIO ZOIO, UDEMY STUDENT\nSlick writing can change your life\nTo make a mark in any field, you need to be able to do what most people can’t do: write with punchiness, precision and poise.\nOn the flip side, lacklustre writing can hold back your career, dent your company’s image, and prevent your books or blogs from getting attention online.\nWhat’s more, brilliant writing can mark you out as a smart thinker with the ability to succeed as an employee, a business owner, or a “thought leader” in your field.\nA well-composed cover letter, for instance, can say everything about the type of person you are and your long-term potential.\nStrong business writing, in everything from reports to emails, can bolster your reputation at work and help you impress clients.\nBeautifully written blogs have a better chance of being heard amid the cacophony of content on the internet.\nIn that case, how might your prospects for success improve if everything you wrote came out as beautiful as something you might read in, say, The Economist or The Wall Street Journal?\nFew people are able to write with the style and finesse of top journalists, who are trained to weed out fluff from their writing and make it consistently sharp and stimulating.\nThis is a unique chance for you to discover how such journalists perform this sorcery, and to make your own writing sizzle by incorporating their tactics.\nThe result will be a more refined style of writing that will leave your readers awestruck.\nThe best part is that after completing this newly expanded edition of Writing With Flair, you won’t just be aware of the ingredients that go into making your copy stand out. You'll know how to apply the “secret sauce” with the flamboyance of a master chef.\n\"Most great teachers can't write, and most great writers can't teach. Shani Raja is one of the few who excels at both. I managed dozens of reporters and editors during my 12-year career at Bloomberg. Now he's the person I go to when I want help with my writing...\" — NICOLAS JOHNSON, A FORMER EDITOR AT BLOOMBERG NEWS & THE GLOBE AND MAIL.\n\"As a young reporter my prose might have been robotic and jargon-laden if not for Shani's watchful eye. Beyond the standard reporting skills — like accuracy, clarity and integrity — I also learned refinement. Shani teaches you how to write well, and with grace...\" — HAWA ALLAN, JOURNALIST & FICTION WRITER\nKnowing these elite writing skills will help you to...\nMake your business correspondence shine\nMake sales prospects instantly “get” your product\nMake your marketing copy captivating\nAttract more readers to your blogs and books\nGet more clicks and conversions on your website\nGet your resumes to the top of the \"must see\" pile\nMake your essays the most stylishly written in your class\nAnd also to rediscover a love of writing...\nIf you’ve hated writing until now, or found it hard going, there’s a good chance you'll leave this course with a new appreciation for what might have seemed like a mysterious process.\nBetter than that, you’ll discover a newfound joy for sculpting your own prose to an immaculate standard.\nYou’ll emerge from the program a thoughtful designer of words and sentences. And if you apply yourself well throughout the course, you will almost certainly emerge a better and more confident writer.\nThe best editors on the planet\nWriting With Flair is the first in a series of programs designed to supercharge your writing ability. It is a foundational course that others — including Ninja Writing and Editing Mastery — build upon.\nYou’ll also learn how to develop the mindset of a standout writer, which includes guidance on how to write with integrity, to care deeply for your readers, and to approach your copy with a clear awareness of your intent.\nAlso, this updated version of the course comes equipped with an editing workbook, helpful lecture summaries, “live” edits, and suggestions for further reading. There are heaps of examples and exercises, too, which will help you apply each technique with even greater skill.\nDon't let pass this once-in-an-age opportunity to get the highest quality training from someone who has crafted riveting stories for millions of global readers and coached many accomplished journalists in his time.\n\"Simply amazing class...\" — SONIE SANDHU, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Blown away by quality of material...\" — TRISTAN DONOFRIO, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Reveals the secret of exactly how to make your writing stand out in a crowded jungle of information...\" — TAFFILIAE, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Great look into the mindset of a higher level writer...\" — BRAM BARBER, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"Learned more in a few hours than I did throughout many years of formal education...\" — LEE FRAMPTON, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"I considered myself a decent writer before taking this course...\" — MIA TURPEL, UDEMY STUDENT\n\"As a published author I have taken no less than 10 courses in improving my own writing skills.

Hear what others have to say...\n\"I figured Jason Teteak might have a few new tricks—but not much that I hadn't heard before. I was wrong. Jason integrates the latest research on presenting, learning, and audience dynamics with a captivating style that plays with the ironic fact that he is doing presentations… about presentation skills. And therein lies the secret to this marvelous program.\"\n- Philip Deloria- Professor and Associate Dean, University of Michigan\n\"It's pretty simple. Jason Teteak walks the talk.

Some of the biggest benefits received from Jason are tactics, ideas and methods that are immediately implementable. Watch Jason's program before your competition does.\"\n- Al Lautenslager- Best-selling Author, Guerrilla Marketing in 30 Days\n“I have been to several seminars on public speaking and giving presentations, including Dale Carnegie training. I truly went into this thinking that I couldn't possibly learn anything new, but I found myself scribbling notes like a mad woman during the presentation. I quickly realized that these were tips and techniques that I had never heard before, and that I could use immediately upon my return to the office.\"\n- Joey Monson-Lillie- Human Resources Manager\nAnd in case you’re skeptical, we even include case studies like this one to prove just how effective this system is…\n“I consider myself a pretty good presenter. Large group, small group, whatever; I rise to the occasion. And this isn’t just my opinion; I get good evaluations from my internal classes! So other people tell me I’m a good presenter. That said . . . I was looking over the offerings today. I came across Jason’s Dazzle program. Jason started the program by saying he was going to teach all 157 of us how to give an amazing presentation. That’s some chutzpah. But he followed through. Wow! Just before watching his program, I finished a PPT that I’ll be delivering to Yale at their kickoff next week. Now I want to tear half of it up. This program ought to be required for everyone. Best . . . class . . . ever!”\n- Craig Joseph -- EHR Physician Advisor (MD)\n“There are so many different things in this program from the power of the pause to facial expressions and body language that I think are just phenomenal strategies and things that we don’t necessarily think about but I think as presenters we owe it to our audience.”\n- Joe Crabtree -- Administrator\nI truly want to help you give more effective presentations and this is the perfect time for you to start improving your success with public speaking, and Dazzle is the most powerful program available to help you do it.\nInstead of NOT being invited to the table…\nInstead of NOT being looked at as a subject matter expert…\nInstead of LOSING them early on or boring them later on…\nYou can feel confident and command a room, even if you don’t have all the answers…\nYou’ll have the 117 advanced public speaking skills you need to present anything…\nWith a proven system for being an amazing speaker.\nInstead of trying to research and learn all of these advanced public speaking skills on your own…wasting your time, patience, and valuable confidence dollars trying to figure out how this process works…\nYou can simply follow our PROVEN 13-module system to start seeing results almost instantly!\nAnd you can do it all today, by getting access to Dazzle: Public Speaking and Presentations Pro…No Beginners Allowed!\nSo, to go from good to great, here’s what you should do:\nClick the button and start connecting with your audience TODAY…\nAnd like all our Rule the Room trainings, this one is protected by our 30-day, no-questions-asked guarantee…so if you aren’t happy for any reason, just let us know and we’ll give you your money back…no questions asked.\nWe know this process works, because it’s the same system that helped hundreds of our clients spread their ideas.\n…and you’ll get to see me model exactly how to do it with a real live audience!\nAnd as your audience grows…\nYou’ll be able to talk in front of bigger and BIGGER groups…delivering a confident, articulate, eloquent talk that reflects the true thought leader that you are...\nThat’s because, there’s a value loop of first the talk, then the opportunity, then more talks, then more opportunities, and on and on and on…\nStephen Covey once said:\n“Until a person can say deeply and honestly, \"I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday,\" that person cannot say, \"I choose otherwise.”\nIt’s time for you to choose otherwise…take action now to elevate your speaking to elite thought leader status!\nClick the button and start connecting with your audience TODAY…\n\n\nAbout Your Instructor\nInternational Public Speaking Coach, TEDx Speaker and Best Selling author Jason Teteak has taught more than one million people how to flawlessly command attention and connect with audiences in their unique style.\nHe’s won praise and a wide following for his original methods, his engaging style, and his knack for transferring communications skills via practical, simple, universal and immediately actionable techniques.\nOr as he puts it “No theoretical fluff”.\nJason gained recognition at EPIC Systems in the medical software industry, where he was known as “trainer of trainers of trainers.”\nHe has developed more than fifty presentation and communication training programs ranging in length from one hour to three days that serve as the basis for The Rule the Room Method.\nIn 2014-2019 he was named #1 Best Selling coach on Public Speaking for his on-demand video teaching tools that quickly took off for over 1,000,000 online students around the world.\nTeteak has flipped the model and changed the approach to great Public Speaking for even the most seasoned veterans.",
