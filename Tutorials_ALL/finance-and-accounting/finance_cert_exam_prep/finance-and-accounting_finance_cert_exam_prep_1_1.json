      "description": "The Certified Management Accountant (CMA) certification is a globally recognized credential that signifies expertise in financial management and strategic management. The CMA program is divided into two parts, and Part 1 focuses on Financial Planning, Performance, and Analytics. Here's a brief description of CMA Part 1:\n1. External Financial Reporting Decisions\nThis section covers the basics of financial reporting, including the preparation of financial statements, recognition, measurement, valuation, and disclosure of specific items. The goal is to ensure candidates understand how financial reports are prepared and can interpret these reports accurately.\n2. Planning, Budgeting, and Forecasting\nThis area emphasizes the importance of strategic planning, budgeting processes, forecasting techniques, and budget methodologies. It teaches candidates how to prepare budgets, perform cost-volume-profit analysis, and apply various forecasting methods to aid in decision-making.\n3. Performance Management\nCandidates learn about different tools and techniques for managing and measuring performance. This includes understanding cost and variance measures, responsibility centers, reporting segments, and performance measures that align with organizational strategies.\n4. Cost Management\nThis section delves into cost concepts, behaviors, and allocation. It covers topics such as overhead costs, job costing, process costing, activity-based costing, and operational efficiency strategies. The objective is to equip candidates with the knowledge to manage and control costs effectively.\n5. Internal Controls\nUnderstanding internal controls is crucial for managing risks and ensuring the integrity of financial information. This segment covers the types, components, and limitations of internal control systems. It also addresses corporate governance, internal audit, and system controls and security measures.\n6. Technology and Analytics\nThis newly emphasized area reflects the growing importance of technology and data analytics in the accounting profession. It covers information systems, data governance, technology-enabled finance transformation, data analytics, and decision analysis tools. The focus is on equipping candidates with the skills to leverage technology and analytics in financial planning and decision-making.\nCMA Part 1 is rigorous and requires a deep understanding of financial principles, strategic planning, and analytical skills. It's designed to prepare candidates for roles that require expertise in financial management and strategic decision-making within organizations. Achieving a CMA certification, starting with Part 1, can significantly enhance one's career prospects in the field of management accounting and finance.",

      "description": "Are you preparing for the CDCS exam? Have you registered for the exam but did not pass on the first try? Are you confused with the articles in the UCP600? Wondering how to interpret the paragraphs of ISBP 821? Are you struggling to understand ISP98 rules? Are you already in the letter of credit business but can not make decisions yet?\n\n\nThen this course is for you. You are in the right place!!!\nYou will get\n\n\n41 lectures which cover the basics of a Letter of credit and an explanation of all 39 articles of UCP600\n23 Lectures which cover the overview of ISBP and explanation of all the paragraphs of ISBP 821.\n23 Lectures that cover the basics of Standby Letter of credit and an explanation of all 10 rules of ISP98\n4 short quizzes of 10 questions each to get familiarise with CDCS questions based on UCP600\n1 Practice test, where you can get hands-on experience with the model questions of the CDCS exam\n\n\nWelcome to the UCP 600, ISBP 821, and ISP 98 Decoded course for CDCS preparation!!!\n\n\nA letter of credit and a standby letter of credit are two of the most widely used instruments in international trade finance.\nUCP600 is a set of rules that govern the issuance and operation of a letter of credit. CDCS certification is a highly sought-after certification for letter of credit practitioners, and UCP600 is the most important rule that makes up almost 60% of the CDCS curriculum. If you do not understand UCP, it will be challenging to progress. However, understanding UCP is a lengthy process throughout CDCS preparation.\nSimilar to UCP 600, ISBP 821, or International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under Documentary Credits, is a set of guidelines issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) to help in the uniform interpretation and examination of documents presented under letters of credit.\nFurther, ISP98 is a set of rules that governs the issuance and operation of Standby letters of credit and is also a part of the CDCS exam syllabus with 10% weightage. It is a common perception that ISP98 is too difficult because of the lengthy and complicated sentence structure used throughout the document.\nTherefore, I have created this course to cover all 39 articles of UCP600, all the paragraphs of ISBP 821, and all the 10 rules of ISP98 in an easy-to-understand and concise manner to save you time before you start preparing. I have added examples, case studies, and graphical representations in all possible cases to explain the articles and other facts during the course. I assure you that by the end of this course, you will have an in-depth knowledge of UCP600, ISBP 821, and ISP98 that will help you achieve certification on your first attempt. Although this course is specifically designed for CDCS aspirants, understanding UCP, ISBP, and ISP is equally important for anyone working in or intending to work in the field of trade finance.\nMost importantly are you afraid to proceed with your CDCS preparation because you have no trade finance experience? Do not worry. I am an example of someone who passed the CDCS exam on the first try without having much trade finance experience. Keep learning!!!",

      "description": "2025 - 2026 CMA Part 2 Change\nNew content: Business Ethics, Sustainability and Social Responsibility\nDeleted content: Off-Balance Sheet Financing, Bankruptcy, Tax Implications of Transfer Pricing\nThese will involve some shifts in coverage, as well as the addition of some new LOSs. Domain A: Financial Statement Analysis and Domain E: Investment Decisions will both see coverage reduced by 5%, while Domain C: Decision Analysis and Domain F: Professional Ethics will both see coverage increases of 5%. Domain F’s coverage increase is due, in part, to the inclusion of new LOSs on “groupthink”, “diversity of thought”, “ethical leadership and traits of ethical leaders”, and “facilitating payments”.\nGiven the increase in coverage of Professional Ethics, we can see that the ICMA is placing more value on workplace ethics, including the “tone at the top.” Additionally, the title change to Part 2 of the exam emphasizes the CMA’s evolving role as an important strategic asset to a company/organization rather than someone who simply does calculations and reporting.\n\n\nCMA Part 1 vs. Part 2\nAssessing and comparing the difficulty of part 1 and part 2 of the CMA exam isn’t going to yield consistent results. This is because the difficulty will depend — as with any test — on your personal mastery of the subject matter. As a general rule of thumb, if you’re an accounting major, start with Part 1, but if you’re a finance major, start with Part 2.\nFrom an objective standpoint, the pass rates on each part are the same: part 1 has a 50% pass rate and part 2 has a 50% pass rate. This means some may find part 1 or 2 easier. With an equal pass rate, it is likely that the parts are similar in difficulty.\nBoth parts have 100 multiple-choice questions and an essay portion. Each section also must be completed in the same amount of time.\nIf your experience falls under the realm of accounting, you may find part 1 easier. If your specialty is in finance, you may prefer part 2.\nThere is no definitive answer for which section will be easier. So long as you dedicate an equal amount of time to studying for each part, you should be well-prepared to pass with flying colors.\n\n\nCMA Part 2 Exam topics and format\nWhile the CMA exam follows the same format for both parts, the topics are different.\nCMA Part 2 is all about Strategic Financial Management. In this 4-hour long exam, you will have to complete 100 multiple choice questions and two essay scenarios.\nTo make it to the essay portion of the exam, you will have to earn at least 50% on the multiple-choice section.\nThere are six topics covered in CMA Part 2:\nFinancial Statement Analysis – 20%\nCorporate Finance – 20%\nBusiness Decision Analysis – 25%\nEnterprise Risk Management – 10%\nCapital Investment Decision – 10%\nProfessional Ethics – 15%",

Students will learn how to measure risk in investment portfolios and apply concepts like Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). These tools help students understand how risk and return are balanced in investment decisions. By studying risk-return trade-offs and diversification strategies, students will develop the ability to create resilient portfolios that minimize potential losses.\nCorporate risk management is another significant component of the course.

Students will learn to assess these risks using structured methods and implement strategies to mitigate them effectively.\nThe course also offers a comprehensive overview of financial market risks, including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk. Students will explore how financial institutions manage these risks using sophisticated tools and strategies. Additionally, the section on asset-liability management (ALM) provides insights into liquidity risk, interest rate sensitivity, and the metrics used to gauge ALM performance in banking and financial services.\nOperational risk management is addressed by exploring the risks inherent in business processes and technologies. This section emphasizes the importance of managing human error and fraud, as well as the growing role of technology in risk mitigation. By understanding these challenges, students will be better equipped to implement solutions that safeguard organizations from internal and external threats.\nThe course also prepares students to handle emerging risks, such as those posed by cybersecurity, climate change, and geopolitical instability. As businesses face increasingly unpredictable environments, the ability to anticipate and respond to new threats is vital. The course encourages students to think strategically about risk, equipping them with the foresight needed to manage emerging challenges.\nFinally, ethical considerations in risk management are explored, ensuring that students understand the importance of professional conduct and integrity in decision-making.

This course is designed to help aspiring internal auditors master the core principles and practical skills required for certification and professional success.\n\n\nCourse Coverage: All Four Domains of the 2025 CIA Part 1 Exam\nFoundations of Internal Auditing (35%)\nLearn the purpose, authority, and responsibilities of internal audit activities. Understand assurance vs. advisory services, audit charter requirements, and the internal auditor’s role in governance and risk.\nEthics and Professionalism (20%)\nExplore the IIA Code of Ethics, objectivity impairments, conflict of interest scenarios, and how to promote ethical behavior. Develop key soft skills including communication, critical thinking, and change management.\nGovernance, Risk Management, and Control (30%)\nDive into governance frameworks, risk types and processes, COSO and ISO 31000 models, and internal control design and evaluation. Learn how culture and ethics shape control environments and how to assess control effectiveness.\nFraud Risks (15%)\nStudy fraud schemes, red flags, investigation techniques, and the internal auditor’s role in fraud detection and prevention. Practice applying controls and coordinating with fraud investigators.\n\n\nWhy This Course Stands Out\nFully Updated for 2025\nAligned with the latest IIA syllabus and Global Internal Audit Standards.\nInteractive Learning\nCase studies, simulations, and real-world scenarios reinforce key concepts and ethical decision-making.\nExam-Day Strategy\nIncludes study plans, time-management tips, and self-assessment tools to ensure you're ready.\nCareer-Ready Skills\nGo beyond the exam with practical insights to become a trusted advisor in your organization.\nThis comprehensive CIA Part 1 prep course is designed to equip aspiring internal auditors with the knowledge, skills, and confidence needed to excel on exam day and in real‑world audit environments. Spanning all four domains of the IIA’s Part 1 exam blueprint—Foundations of Internal Auditing, Independence and Objectivity, Proficiency and Due Professional Care, and Quality Assurance and Improvement Programs—this course weaves together theory, standards, practical examples, and interactive case studies to create a rich, engaging learning experience.\n\n\nYou’ll begin by exploring the purpose, authority, and responsibilities of the internal audit activity, including alignment of the audit charter with organizational objectives. Lectures on the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) expose you to authoritative guidance, attribute and performance standards, and the Code of Ethics, ensuring you understand how to apply these in diverse organizational settings. The course then delves into the structures of governance and risk management, covering board oversight, management responsibilities, risk appetite, and the internal auditor’s role in evaluating culture and tone at the top.\n\n\nThrough detailed sessions on internal control frameworks (with emphasis on COSO), you will learn to assess design effectiveness, operating effectiveness, control limitations, and compensating mechanisms. A strategic review of control evaluations links your technical findings back to governance objectives, helping you advise leadership on strengthening control environments. The course also provides end‑to‑end coverage of the audit lifecycle, from planning and engagement scoping to reporting lines, coordination with other assurance providers, and use of assurance mapping tools.\nEthics feature prominently throughout: dedicated modules guide you through real‑world dilemmas, whistleblowing protocols, and methods for promoting an ethical culture. Rich case studies illustrate how conflicts of interest and confidentiality issues arise in practice and how to navigate them with integrity.\n\n\nA special fraud track introduces you to the fraud triangle, asset misappropriation schemes, risk assessment techniques, and preventive controls. You’ll practice conducting preliminary investigations, reporting findings, and participating in fraud‐prevention strategies, all through realistic scenarios that reinforce lesson concepts.\n\n\nBeyond technical mastery, this course emphasizes exam‑day readiness: you’ll acquire proven study strategies, mindset techniques, and time‑management tips, culminating in practical guidance on how to self‑assess readiness and develop an action plan for success. A full‐course recap ties together key takeaways, while final reflections help you internalize best practices and chart your post‑exam professional growth.\n\n\nWhether you’re new to internal auditing or seeking to solidify your expertise, this course delivers a structured, engaging, and practical pathway to achieving your CIA® Part 1 certification and becoming a trusted advisor within your organization.",

Highly recommended. - Nazila A.\n\n\nYou will get SIX high-quality practice exams to be ready for your certification\n\n\n\n\nQuality speaks for itself:\nSAMPLE QUESTION #1 (Scenario-based):\nMichelle a risk-averse buyer is looking to secure a $400,000 mortgage and is evaluating offers from four different lenders. Here are the options:\n\nLender X: 3.9% fixed-rate, no finder’s fee, no loyalty programs.\nLender Y: 4.1% fixed-rate with a 0.5% finder’s fee, a points program redeemable for travel, and an annual 0.05% rate reduction for each year of on-time payments up to 5 years.\nLender Z: 4.0% variable-rate with no finder’s fee, an annual cap on rate increases of 0.25%, and a cash-back program offering $2,000 upon signing.\nLender W: 4.2% fixed-rate with a 1% finder’s fee, comprehensive insurance coverage, and a flexible payment option allowing for lump-sum payments up to 20% of the mortgage per year without penalty.\nMichelle values both short-term cost savings and long-term benefits and plans to stay in the house for at least 10 years. What should her mortgage agent recommend?\nA. Recommend Lender X for its stability, lower initial rate, and absence of additional fees, prioritizing long-term cost savings.\nB. Recommend Lender Y for the points program and potential rate reductions, despite the higher initial rate and finder’s fee.\nC. Recommend Lender Z for the cash-back offer and variable rate, assuming rates remain stable, despite potential increases.\nD. Recommend Lender W for the comprehensive insurance coverage and flexible payment option, despite the higher rate and finder’s fee.\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER:\nCorrect Option: A.\nDetailed Explanation:\n\n\nWhy Option A is Correct:\nFixed-Rate Stability:\nLender X offers a 3.9% fixed-rate, which means Michelle’s monthly payments will remain consistent throughout the term of the mortgage. This stability is advantageous, especially for a risk-averse buyer who values predictable payments over time.\nNo Additional Fees:\nThere are no finder’s fees or additional costs with Lender X. This eliminates upfront costs and maximizes the initial savings, making it financially advantageous over the life of the mortgage.\nLong-Term Savings:\nOver a 10-year period, the lower initial rate will likely result in significant savings compared to the other options, especially when compounded over the term of the mortgage.\n\n\n\n\nIncorrect Options:\nWhy Option B is Incorrect:\nHigher Initial Rate:\nLender Y offers a higher initial rate of 4.1%, which means higher monthly payments compared to Lender X. Over a 10-year period, this higher rate can result in substantial additional costs.\nFinder’s Fee:\nThe 0.5% finder’s fee adds to the upfront cost, reducing the initial financial advantage.\nRate Reduction:\nWhile the annual rate reduction of 0.05% per year up to 5 years might be beneficial, the initial higher rate still impacts long-term savings. The total reduction over 5 years is relatively minor compared to the overall cost of the mortgage at a higher starting rate.\nPoints Program:\nThe travel points program may offer additional value, but it is secondary to the financial cost of the mortgage. For a risk-averse buyer focused on long-term savings, this benefit might not outweigh the higher initial rate and fees.\n\n\nWhy Option C is Incorrect:\nVariable Rate Risk:\nLender Z offers a 4.0% variable rate, which means the rate can fluctuate over time. Even though there is a cap on annual rate increases (0.25%), there is still a risk that rates could increase significantly, leading to higher monthly payments in the future.\nCash-Back Program:\nThe $2,000 cash-back offer is attractive but does not compensate for the potential risk of rising interest rates. For a risk-averse buyer who values stability, this variable-rate option might be too uncertain.\nLong-Term Costs:\nOver a 10-year period, the variable rate could end up costing more if interest rates rise, despite the initial cash-back incentive.\n\n\nWhy Option D is Incorrect:\nHighest Rate:\nLender W offers the highest fixed-rate at 4.2%. This results in the highest monthly payments compared to the other options, leading to increased overall costs over the life of the mortgage.\nFinder’s Fee:\nThe 1% finder’s fee adds to the upfront cost, reducing the initial financial advantage.\nBenefits vs. Cost:\nWhile the comprehensive insurance coverage and flexible payment options are valuable, they do not outweigh the cost of the higher interest rate and additional fees. For a buyer focused on cost savings over a long term, these benefits are less impactful compared to the higher overall costs.\n\n\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION #2 (Calculation-based):\nMaria is looking to purchase a property priced at $500,000 and has provided the following information for her mortgage application:\n\n\nDown payment: $35,000\nAnnual Income: $96,000\nIncome: From a full-time salary with a 4-year history, including overtime and bonus amounts\nCredit score: 730, with no late payments and a 10-year credit history\nThe current interest rate with an A lender is 4.0% for a 5-year term and 25-year amortization.\nDoes Maria qualify for the mortgage based on her information?\n\n\n\n\nA. Yes, their GDS is below the required 32%.\nB. Yes, their TDS is below the required 40%.\nC. No, you will need to find a private lender with a 7.0% interest rate.\nD. No, you will need to ask for additional down payment or additional income to bring the GDS below 32%.\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER:\nCorrect Option: D.\nDetailed Explanation:\nTo determine if Maria qualifies for the mortgage based on her information, we need to calculate her Gross Debt Service (GDS) ratio and Total Debt Service (TDS) ratio.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Calculation:\n\n\n1. Determine Mortgage Amount:\nProperty price: $500,000\nDown payment: $35,000\nMortgage amount = Property price - Down payment\nMortgage amount = $500,000 - $35,000 = $465,000\n\n\n2. Monthly Mortgage Payment:\nMortgage amount: $465,000\nInterest rate: 4.0%\nAmortization period: 25 years\nMonthly mortgage payment calculation using the formula for a fixed-rate mortgage:\n\n\nM = [P x r x (1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n-1 ]\n\n\nwhere:\nM is the monthly payment\nP is the loan principal (mortgage amount)\nr is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)\nn is the number of payments (amortization period in years multiplied by 12)\nPutting numbers in, The monthly mortgage payment will approximately be $2,452.34.\n\n\n3. Property Taxes and Heating Costs:\nEstimate annual property taxes at 1% of the property value: $500,000 x 1% = $5,000 per year\nMonthly property taxes: $5,000 / 12 = $416.67\nEstimate monthly heating costs: $100 (common estimate)\n\n\n4. Calculate GDS Ratio:\nGDS = (Monthly mortgage payment + Property taxes + Heating costs) / Gross monthly income\nMaria's gross annual income is $96,000 from her salary, including overtime and bonuses.\nGross monthly income = $96,000 / 12 = $8,000\nGDS = (2,452.34 + 416.67 + 100) / 8,000 ≈ 0.371 ≈ 37.1%\n\n\n5. Calculate TDS Ratio:\nAssume no other debt payments.\nTDS = (Monthly mortgage payment + Property taxes + Heating costs + Other debt payments) / Gross monthly income\nTDS=(2,452.34 + 416.67 + 100) / 8,000 ≈0.371 ≈37.1%\nAnalysis:\nGDS ratio: 37.1% (exceeds the required 32%)\nTDS ratio: 37.1% (below the required 40%)\n\n\nMaria's GDS ratio exceeds the required 32%, indicating she does not meet the typical qualification criteria for an A lender. However, her TDS ratio is below 40%, which suggests she could still potentially qualify if other mitigating factors are favorable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your Mortgage Agent Level 1 exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nThis is a huge original question bank\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-days money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe Mortgage Agent Level 1 course and all related trademarks are owned by the Real Estate and Mortgage Institute of Canada Inc.

Practice questions allow you to apply what you’ve learned in a practical context, helping you to retain information better.

      "description": "ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) is the global body for professional accountants.\nThe syllabus for Performance Management (PM), builds on the knowledge gained in Management Accounting (MA) and seeks to examine candidates’ understanding of how to manage the performance of a business.\nIt also prepares candidates for more specialist capabilities which are covered in Advanced Performance Management (APM). The syllabus begins by focusing on the information needs, technologies and systems required by organisations to manage and measure performance in the modern, competitive environment.\nIt is vital for an accountant to understand how information systems and developments in technology influence the management accounting techniques employed and how vital information systems are in the mechanisms of managing and controlling an organisation.\nThe syllabus then introduces more specialised costing and management accounting topics. There is some knowledge assumed from Management Accounting (MA) – primarily overhead treatments. The objective here is to ensure candidates have a broader background in management accounting techniques. The syllabus then considers decision making.\nCandidates need to appreciate the problems surrounding scarce resource, pricing and make-or-buy decisions, and how this relates to the assessment of performance. Risk and uncertainty are a factor of real-life decisions and candidates need to understand risk and be able to apply some basic methods to help resolve the risks inherent in decision-making.\nBudgeting is an important aspect of many accountants’ lives. The syllabus explores different budgeting techniques and the problems inherent in them. The behavioural aspects of budgeting are important for accountants to understand, and the syllabus includes consideration of the way individuals react to a budget. The preparation of fixed, flexible and incremental budgets is assumed knowledge from Management Accounting (MA).\nStandard costing and variances are then built on. All the variances examined in Management Accounting (MA) are assumed knowledge in Performance Management (PM). Mix and yield variances, and planning and operational variances are explored here and the link is made to performance management. It is important for accountants to be able to interpret the numbers that they calculate and ask what they mean in the context of performance.\nThe syllabus concludes with performance measurement and control. This is a major area of the syllabus. Accountants should appreciate the importance of both financial and nonfinancial performance measures in management and should also appreciate the difficulties in assessing performance in divisionalised businesses and the problems caused by failing to consider external influences on performance. This section leads directly to Advanced Performance Management (APM).",

      "description": "Process costing is used by organizations that can't identify the customer before building the product or service. Instead, these organizations build inventory now that is sold later when customers purchase completed products. Determining the cost of producing a product or service basically involves summing up the costs going into the production process and dividing by the number of units that complete the process. Since organizations using process costing can't track production costs and production output to a particular job or customer, the costs and outputs are tracked to a period of time (a day, a week, a month, etc.).\nThe challenge with using a period of time to track costs is the problem of partially complete units of work. Organizations with process costing systems need to solve this problem before production costs can be divided by output in order to create cost-per-unit measures needed in accounting and management processes. The challenge of partially complete units of work is handled by using “equivalent units” of production.\nProcess costing is used by organizations with production processes that make it impractical to identify the customer's product or cost as a “job” during the process. Without a potential customer to target costs moving through the accounting system, the process costing method uses a production period of time to group together costs and output until they are eventually transferred to the finished goods inventory. The challenge in this approach is that there tends to be partially complete products or services at the beginning and/or end of a production period. Dealing with this challenge requires the computation of equivalent units of production.\nCost are then tracked on these equivalent units as they move through the production process. This lesson worked through a series of computations to track costs of goods manufactured and transferred forward, and computations to measure the value of the ending balance in the work-in-process inventory account. Both the first-in-first-out (FIFO) and weighted-average (W/A) methods of process costing were demonstrated.",

      "description": "WHAT IS GST ?\nGST stands for “Goods and Services Tax”, and is proposed to be a comprehensive indirect tax levy on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods as well as services at the national level.\nIts main objective is to consolidates all indirect tax levies into a single tax, except customs (excluding SAD) replacing multiple tax levies, overcoming the limitations of existing indirect tax structure, and creating efficiencies in tax administration.\nThe introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) would be a very significant step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax, it would mitigate cascading or double taxation in a major way and pave the way for a common national market.\nFrom the consumer point of view, the biggest advantage would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 16%-18%.\nIntroduction of GST would also make our products competitive in the domestic and international markets. Studies show that this would instantly spur economic growth. Last but not the least, this tax, because of its transparent character, would be easier to administer.\nTax payers need to be GST compliant to be able to test system changes in time. Depending on the operating geographies, size and sector, the changes would be substantial and may require proactive planning with a time-bound action plan.\nIn order to prepare for the implementation of GST, companies need to understand GST policy development and its implications for scenario planning and transition roadmap preparation. We at clearTax aim to  provide our learners with all the information and tools required to prepare themselves to face the new tax regime",

This may involve defending a tax return, assisting a client during an audit, or even representing them in an appeal. Enrolled Agent is the highest credential awarded by the IRS and allows you to practice in all 50 states and territories, without limitation on who you can represent.\n\n\nBecoming an Enrolled Agent is more accessible than you may realize. How quickly you go through the process depends greatly on your current tax knowledge and experience. It only takes most people between three months to a year to pass the EA Exam and become fully credentialed.\n\n\nThese are the basic steps:\nGet your Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) from the IRS website.\nPass the Enrolled Agent Exam\nSubmit your application, including a “suitability check” (criminal background check + tax investigation) to the IRS.\n\n\nEA exam\nThe IRS EA exam is a comprehensive three-part test that tax preparers must pass in order to become an IRS Enrolled Agent. After tax preparers pass all three Enrolled Agent exams and complete the other requirements (there aren’t many!), the IRS distinguishes them with the EA designation. It signals a high level of expertise and allows them to practice before the IRS.\n\n\nEach of the three EA tests has 100 multiple-choice questions and a 3.5 hour testing time. The Enrolled Agent test is administered at Prometric testing centers, which are located in the US and internationally.\n\n\nPart 1 - Individuals\no Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data – 14 questions\no Income and Assets – 17 questions\no Deductions and Credits – 17 questions\no Taxation – 15 questions\no Advising the Individual Taxpayer – 11 questions\no Specialized Returns for Individuals – 11 questions",

      "description": "Passing the Series 7 exam is essential for launching a successful career in the securities industry. The key to success in this exam is practice, and the most effective way to prepare is by continuously testing yourself. This course offers a series of timed practice exams that replicate the exact format, topics, and timing of the actual Series 7 exam. After each practice test, you'll receive immediate feedback with detailed explanations of your answers. You can retake the tests until you achieve a perfect score, ensuring you are thoroughly prepared for the real exam.\nThis course is designed to help you maximize your score by improving your test-taking efficiency, accuracy, and speed. You will also learn strategies for handling the pressure of timed exams and tips for approaching difficult questions with confidence.\nThe Series 7 exam consists of 125 multiple-choice questions, which you must complete in 3 hours and 45 minutes, plus an additional 10 research questions that are not scored. The timed practice tests are designed to mirror these conditions, so you can gauge your progress and refine your approach.\nKey topics covered in the exam include:\nFiduciary Accounts\nHypothecation\nRoth IRA\nInsider Trading\nShort Selling\nSIPC\nFINRA Code of Procedure\nDiscretionary Brokerage Accounts\nFannie Mae\nCertificates of Deposit\nSEC Act of 1934\nCyclical Industries\nShort Interest Theory\n401k Plans\nForeign Mutual Funds\nNew York Stock Exchange\nCombination Privilege\nStock Split\nMargin Trading\nBenefits of Stock Ownership\nREITs\nAuthorized Stock\nCompany’s Net Worth\nBook Value vs. Market Value\nStock Certificate\nWarrants\nAmerican Depositary Receipt\nDividends\n\nYou will get TWO high-quality practice exams to be ready for your certification\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\n\n\nQuestion:\nAll of the following occur when a customer exercises a call option EXCEPT:\nThe customer pays the strike price for the asset.\nThe customer buys the underlying asset at the strike price.\nThe customer takes delivery of the underlying asset.\nThe customer sells the underlying asset at the market price.\n\n\nAnswer: D.\nExplanation:\nWhen a customer exercises a call option, they have the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price. They take delivery of the asset and pay the strike price for it. However, they do not sell the underlying asset at the market price. That would be a separate transaction. Exercising a call option is about buying, not selling.\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhich TWO methods are commonly used to quote municipal bond prices?\nI. Dollar price (percentage of par)\nII. Discounted cash flow method\nIII. Yield to maturity (basis price)\nIV. Net present value calculation\nII and III\nI and II\nIII and IV\nI and III\nAnswer: D.\nExplanation:\nMunicipal bond prices are commonly quoted in two ways: as a dollar price, which is a percentage of par value, and as a yield to maturity (basis price), which represents the bond's overall return if held to maturity. Discounted cash flow and net present value are valuation methods but not typically used for quoting prices. Therefore, I and III are correct.\n\n\nQuestion:\nA customer complaint involves a broker failing to disclose a conflict of interest. If improperly handled, what could be a consequence for the broker?\nA warning letter\nRequired to pay a fine only\nSuspension or termination\nMandatory re-training\nAnswer: C.\nExplanation:\nMishandling complaints involving conflicts of interest can lead to disciplinary actions, including suspension or termination.\n\n\nQuestion:\nRank the following technical indicators from shortest to longest in terms of typical time frames analyzed:\nI. Intraday trend lines\nII. Moving averages (50-day)\nIII. Moving averages (200-day)\nIV.Consolidation periods\nII, I, III, IV\nI, IV, II, III\nIV, I, II, III\nI, II, III, IV\n\n\nAnswer: D.\nExplanation\nArrange these technical indicators by their typical time frames. Intraday trend lines are the shortest, focusing on price movements within a single trading day. Moving averages (50-day) look at the average price over the past 50 days, a medium-term view. Moving averages (200 days) provide a longer-term perspective, averaging prices over 200 days. Consolidation periods, where prices trade within a range, can last for extended periods, making them the longest.\n\n\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your FINRA Seris 7 exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nThis is a huge original question bank\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\nWe hope that by now you're convinced!\nHappy learning and best of luck with the FINRA Series 7 exam!",

      "description": "2026 CIA EXAM\nThe CIA continues to have three parts. Not that different from the previous syllabus, Part 1 focusses mainly on the standards, and Part 2 on the internal audit process. Part 3 is a significant departure from the current syllabus and now covers managing the internal audit function. We will discuss in more detail below.\nOther than being updated to align to the new standards, the syllabus still includes Fraud Risk even though that falls outside the IPPF.\nFor the exams, Part 1 continues be 125 questions to be answered in 150 minutes, with Parts 2 and 3 also unchanged at 100 questions in 120 minutes. The pass mark remains 600/750, or 80%.\n\n\nStandards\nIt is impossible to definitively align the parts of the CIA syllabus to the IPPF as there are too many interdependent elements. The IPPF, after all, is intended to be a single framework and it is important that you keep this in mind as you study the CIA and prepare for the exams.\nAlso remember that the Glossary forms part of the IPPF and so is also examinable as part of the CIA syllabus.\n\n\nCIA Part 1: Internal Audit Fundamentals\nThese core knowledge areas are crucial for every internal auditor to understand in order to execute their duties proficiently.\nSection A: Foundations of Internal Auditing draws on Domain I of the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF), where the purpose statement of internal auditing is found. Section A then references Domain III, focusing on Principles 6, 7, and 8, though these areas are covered briefly and do not require an in-depth understanding.\nSection B: Ethics and Professionalism encompasses the entirety of Domain II, covering integrity, objectivity, competency, due professional care, and confidentiality.\nSection C: Governance, Risk Management, and Control reflects Standard 9.1 of Domain IV, rather than Domain III.\nSection D: Fraud Risks is somewhat of an anomaly as it does not directly reflect the IPPF, given that fraud risks are not explicitly addressed in the standards. Nonetheless, this is essential knowledge for an internal auditor and thus included in the syllabus.\n\n\nAmong the three parts, this is indisputably the least altered exam. Section A now contributes more than double the amount of questions compared to the 2019 syllabus. Although the section now encompasses the internal audit mandate, as well as the role of the Chief Audit Executive (CAE) and the board in establishing the mandate, this alone cannot explain the increased exam coverage.\nSection B elaborates on the knowledge, skills, and competencies outlined in the 2019 exam, however the overall size of this section is smaller than in the 2019 syllabus. This section now also addresses confidentiality when using information during engagements, and any ensuing privacy concerns. The section dealing with the Quality Improvement and Assurance Program (QIAP) moves to CIA Part 3.\nSection C, which addresses Governance, Risk Management, and Control, sees a slight reduction in exam coverage. Nevertheless, this section now includes performance management and the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Section D remains relatively unchanged, although the exam coverage increases slightly to incorporate a broader list of risk types and a focus on risk management processes within risk management frameworks.",

      "description": "2024 - 2025 CMA Exam Part 1 Changes\nMany small changes are coming to Part 1 of the CMA Exam.\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nIn Section A.1., the IMA added information about consolidated financial statements.\nWith respect to consolidated financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, the candidate should be able to:\ndefine consolidated financial statements\ndefine the two types of consolidation models: variable interest entity model and voting interest model\ndemonstrate an understanding of the three types of consolidation accounting: full consolidation, proportionate consolidation, and equity consolidation\ndemonstrate an understanding of intracompany balances and transactions that should be eliminated in consolidation\nContribution Margins\nIn Section C.2., on responsibility centers and reporting segments, two points were added in regard to contribution margins:\ncalculate a contribution margin\nanalyze a contribution margin report and evaluate performance\nTypes of Costs and Cost Behavior\nIn the Measurement Concepts section, a simple update changes “Cost Behavior and Cost Objects” to “Types of Costs and Cost Behavior.”\nProcess Costing and Other Costing Systems\nIn section D.2, Process Costing was removed. This is considered Level A knowledge and is covered under the new “Other Costing Systems” section.\nCorporate Overhead\nIn section D.3., the language has changed from “plant-wide overhead” to “corporate overhead.”\nTheory of Constraints\nIn Section D.4., the theory of constraints is no longer covered.\nBusiness Process Improvements\nIn Section D.5., there are three changes. Both “activity-based management” and “efficient accounting practices” were deleted, and “best practice analysis” was updated to “benchmarking and best practice analysis.”\nGovernance, Risk, and Compliance\nIn Section E.1., two topics were added: “testing methods for internal controls” and “control deficiency remediation.”\nData Management\nIn Section F.2. on data governance, topics related to data management were added.\nData Analytics\nIn Section F.4., “Data Analytics” was updated to “Types of Data Analytics” and now asks the test taker to:\nexplain the challenge of fitting an analytics model to the data\ndefine the different types of data analytics, including descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive\n\n\nCMA Part 1: Financial Planning, Performance, and Analytics\n(4 hours – 100 questions and 2 essay questions)\n15% External Financial Reporting Decisions\n20% Planning, Budgeting, and Forecasting\n20% Performance Management\n15% Cost Management\n15% Internal Controls\n15% Technology and Analytics\n\n\nCMA Part 2: Strategic Financial Management\n(4 hours – 100 questions and 2 essay questions)\n20% Financial Statement Analysis\n20% Corporate Finance\n25% Business Decision Analysis\n10% Enterprise Risk Management\n10% Capital Investment Decisions\n15% Professional Ethics\n\n\n2024 - 2025 CMA Exam Part 1 TIPS\nThe best preparation you can make for taking the exam is thoroughly studying the material and content covered by the examination. Beyond that, however, there are several strategies you can use while taking the test that will help to maximize your performance.\n1. Answer the questions that you know first.\nTry to avoid dwelling on any particular question(s) for extended periods of time. This will give you the opportunity to answer all of the questions you may know and also allow you to see how much time you have to devote to the questions that are more difficult for you.\n2. Mark the difficult questions for later review.\nYou should approach the test with the expectation that you will encounter at least some questions that you cannot immediately answer. Keep in mind that each question is worth the same number of points (i.e., 1 for correct and 0 for incorrect), regardless of its difficulty. Do not agonize over any particular question, but mark those questions you are unsure of so that you can readily locate them when you are ready to look at them a second time.\n3. Read each question carefully, noting any key words.\nPay close attention to the wording of the question. Words such as except, least, and most in a question will have a significant bearing on the correct answer. Think each question through very carefully before answering. You may want to jot down key words that appear in the question, or to rephrase the question in your own words if you are having trouble understanding it.\n4. Try to answer the question in your mind before actually looking at the options.\nThen see if the answer you formulated exists among the options. Doing this could serve as a sort of verification of the correct answer. You should still carefully review the other options as well, to be certain there isn’t a more appropriate answer than the one you selected.\n5. If you are uncertain about an answer, try to make an educated guess.\nYou are likely to know something about the topic presented in the question and are, therefore, often able to eliminate at least one incorrect option. If you come across an item for which you truly do not know the answer, try to eliminate those options that you deem likely to be incorrect. This will increase your chances of selecting the correct answer.\n6. Answer ALL of the questions.\nThe CMA exams do not employ a penalty for incorrect answers. Points are not deducted from your score for an incorrect answer. There is nothing to gain by leaving questions unanswered; therefore, answer all questions on the exam.\n7. Keep scratch paper organized.\nYou will be given a booklet similar to a college “bluebook,” to be used as scratch paper for doing calculations or other notes. Label these notes clearly, and show your work clearly. The scratch paper booklet is turned in at the end, and is not used in scoring your exam. However, when you go back to review your work, it is much easier and quicker if you do it neatly.\n8. Keep track of time\nWhen taking the multiple-choice test, plan the amount of time given vs. the number of questions that will be presented. Watch the time you invest in each question—don’t get stuck for too long on one question. Keep moving through the questions.\n9. Use the full time allotted to you.\nIn a similar vein, there is no advantage in ending the test early. Make the most of any remaining time you may have by reviewing your work, making corrections, or going back to more difficult questions. It is possible that during such review time, you will recall some fact or information which you may have previously overlooked on one or more questions. Though it may seem like a relief to end the test early, bear in mind that the allotted time will end soon enough, and you will want to make the most of the few minutes you have remaining to you to help maximize your score.",

      "description": "2026 CIA EXAM\nThe CIA continues to have three parts. Not that different from the previous syllabus, Part 1 focusses mainly on the standards, and Part 2 on the internal audit process. Part 3 is a significant departure from the current syllabus and now covers managing the internal audit function. We will discuss in more detail below.\nOther than being updated to align to the new standards, the syllabus still includes Fraud Risk even though that falls outside the IPPF.\nFor the exams, Part 1 continues be 125 questions to be answered in 150 minutes, with Parts 2 and 3 also unchanged at 100 questions in 120 minutes. The pass mark remains 600/750, or 80%.\n\n\nStandards\nIt is impossible to definitively align the parts of the CIA syllabus to the IPPF as there are too many interdependent elements. The IPPF, after all, is intended to be a single framework and it is important that you keep this in mind as you study the CIA and prepare for the exams.\nAlso remember that the Glossary forms part of the IPPF and so is also examinable as part of the CIA syllabus.\n\n\nCIA Part 3 Internal Audit Function\nPart 3 covers the management of the internal audit function, and as expected is therefore closely aligned to Domain IV, the exception being 9.1 which was covered in Part 1.\nSection A: Internal Audit Operations aligns to Standards 9.2 and 9.3 of Domain IV. The resource requirements in the syllabus are aligned with Standard 13.5 and also references Principle 10.\nSection B: Internal Audit Plan covers Standards 9.4 and 9.5.\nSection C: Quality of the Internal Audit Function covers are aligned to Principle 12, while the responsibility of the CAE are set out in Standards 8.3 and 8.4.\nSection D: Engagement Results and Monitoring address Principle 15.\n\n\nThe syllabus for Part 3 has been completely transformed and none of the areas that were previously in Part 3 have remained. The Part 3 syllabus now addresses the management of the internal audit function. From the old Part 2 syllabus, Managing the internal audit function has been moved to Part 3 and now forms the bulk of the Internal Audit Operations section, and Quality which was previously dealt with in Part 1 is now also included in Part 3.\nThe following areas previously in Part 3 are no longer included in the syllabus:\nManagerial accounting concepts\nCosting systems\nVarious costs\nNetwork administration\nIT infrastructure concepts\nSystems development",

You have made a good decision to do so but it will be an arduous journey.\nThere are hundreds of learning outcomes that the IMA publishes that could be tested on the  Part 1 exam. I have turned these learning outcomes into questions that past (successful) CMA candidates have researched the answers to. Their answers are provided but I recommend that you research the answers yourself as that will help you in mastering the content.\nI have over five hundred multiple-choice questions with answers and analysis at Level A, B and C. You can practice answering these questions in a number of 10-minute quizzes or 13 minute assignments.Look for quizzes and assignments in each module of this course. Also, there are two mock exams to practice.\nThis course is a comprehensive study program to help you pass the Certified Management Accountants exam. It begins by first understanding how a professional organization such as the Institute of Management Accountants of America sets and marks the exams that lead to the professional designation as a Certified Management Accountant, The exams are offered three times a year - January, June and September.\nI will be continually adding material to help you master the content.\nDr John",

      "description": "The FINRA Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam is a foundational requirement for those aspiring to work in the regulated securities industry. Passing this exam is a prerequisite for taking further FINRA licensing exams, such as the General Securities Representative (Series 7) exam and others. Even individuals not pursuing a licensed position but interested in a career in finance will find that completing the SIE exam demonstrates valuable industry knowledge to potential employers.\nThe most effective strategy for success is practice, practice, and more practice. Each set of practice questions mimics the format, topics, and timing of the official exam, helping you build familiarity and confidence. You will receive immediate results after completing each practice test, with detailed explanations of the answers and the option to retake the test until you achieve complete accuracy.\nThe official exam consists of 85 multiple-choice questions, requires a passing score of 70% or higher, and must be completed within 1 hour and 45 minutes. However, this practice series includes 510 questions, providing extensive preparation to ensure mastery of the material.\nPlease note that these practice questions are not actual questions from the official SIE exam. While they are designed to be similar in structure and content, the material here has not been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by FINRA, and no affiliation with FINRA is claimed or implied.\n\n\nFeatured Reviews\n\nBilly M.\nRating:  5\nSIE exam practice tests effectively simulate the exam, covering key topics like securities and regulations. I am getting an idea of why some answers are right and others are wrong. While some questions may be more difficult than the exam, these tests offer valuable preparation and boost confidence for test day.\n\nGloria P.\nRating:  5\nThe practice questions were really clear compared to the actual exam. I appreciated each explanation provided with each answer—they helped me understand much better.\n\n\n\nYou will get SIX high-quality practice exams to be ready for your certification\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nQ. If XYZ declares a 1-for-4 reverse stock split, how many shares will an investor who had initially held 200 shares of XYZ stock priced at $ 10 each be left with, and what will be the new price per share?\n800 shares at $40 per share\n200 shares at $2.50 per share\n50 shares at $10 per share\nAnswer: 50 shares at $40 per share\nExplanation\nA 1-for-4 reverse split cuts the number of shares in half, while the price of a share increases fourfold. The investor will have ownership of 50 shares with a value of $40 each.\n\nQ2. A person employed by a brokerage firm who neither handles client transactions nor provides any service in the form of financial advice would be classified as:\nA compliance officer\nA non-registered person\nA registered person\nA licensed advisor\n\n\nAnswer: A non-registered person\nExplanation:  In the securities industry, individuals who handle client transactions or provide investment advice are required to be registered with FINRA (or a relevant regulatory body) and hold the appropriate licenses.\nA person who does not handle client transactions or provide financial advice does not need to be registered. Therefore, they would be considered a non-registered person.\nWhile a compliance officer does not typically provide direct financial advice, they are a registered person and would need to hold a relevant securities license.\nThe key point is that individuals who perform purely clerical, administrative, or back-office functions that are unrelated to client transactions or investment recommendations, do not need to hold a securities registration, classifying them as a non-registered person.\n\n\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your FINRA Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nThis is a huge original question bank\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\nWe hope that by now you're convinced!\nHappy learning and best of luck with the FINRA Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam!",

This course cover the important quantitative techniques essential in financial analysis which are used throughout the CFA Program curriculum.I will cover all important topics including Time Value of Money, Discounted Cash Flow Applications, Probability Concepts, Common Probability Distributions, Sampling and Estimation, Hypothesis Testing, and Technical analysis. In ten short lectures of 10 to 15 mins I will help you revise the Quantitative methods course in around two hours and make you confident of passing the exam.\nSection 1 lectures will cover several tools of quantitative analysis such as time value of money, descriptive statistics, and probability. Time value of money calculations are the basic tools used to support corporate finance decisions and to estimate the fair value of fixed income, equity, and other types of securities or investments. After this Discounted Cash Flow Applications and descriptive statistics are reviewed which provide essential tools for describing and evaluating return and risk. In the final lecture of section 1 probability theory concepts are needed to understand investment decision making under conditions of uncertainty.\nSection 2 reviews discrete and continuous probability distributions most commonly used to describe the behavior of random variables. Probability theory and calculations are widely used in finance, for example, in the field of investment and project valuation and in financial risk management. Furthermore, this section explains how to estimate different parameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation) of a population if only a sample, rather than the whole population, can be observed. This lecture on Hypothesis testingpresents techniques that are used to accept or reject an assumed hypothesis (null hypothesis) about various parameters of a population. The final lecture goes over the fundamentals of technical analysis and illustrates how it is used to analyze securities and securities markets. Technical analysis is an investment approach that often makes use of quantitative methods.\n\nBe aware that this course is not a substitute for reading the CBOK. I urge you to read it to get a good understanding of Quantitative Methods and then use these lectures for quick and confident review before the exam.",

These ways include: loss aversion, framing effects, and risk domain specificity.\nUnderstanding prospect theory and knowing how to formulate its components, including loss aversion, diminished value sensitivity, and reference point dependence.\nHow framing and mental accounting factor into the decision-making process.\nApplying aspects of prospect theory to make better financial decisions. From horse betting biases to the disposition effect, we learn about how prospect theory can be applied in various domains.\nThis course includes nearly 3 hours of lectures and included all course notes - both students notes and full instructor notes. Each of the three sections include a quiz at the end of each section for students to demonstrate their learning. Additional exercises (and solutions) are included as well.\nUnderstanding these key concepts will give students the ability to better understand themselves, but also the world around them, whether its family/friends, colleagues or clients.\nWhether you are new to finance or a financial professional, this course is for you!",

      "description": "This ACCA SBL course is based on  Dr. Dino's Award Winning (Accounting Awards 2020 Athens, Europe) globally adopted SBL flowchart which organises SBL's material in a logical sequential manner based on his practical Flowchart methodology. Learn all important business models in short videos along with their descriptions, understand what is expected during the exam, gain tips on how to pass SBL, how and when to use the theories, learn what the examiners expect, how to manage your time in reading the case, tips on writing style, all in a series of over 55 simple videos for a total of app. 4 hours (230+ minutes). Videos offered with descriptions:\n\n\n1. How does the programe work”: A short video on how to make the best use out of the videos and my SBL course\n\n\n2. “What is SBL all about?”: A 5 min video about the exam itself, what it is all about, its structure, what is expected from candidates, its main characteristics and some key tips on handling the content and requirements.\n\n\n3. “Managing your time for passing the SBL exam”: Managing time in a 4 hour exam is crucial and therefore this video explains how to make the best use of your planning time, how to scan exhibits, when to check requirements and other critical points on SBL time management.\n\n\n4. “Flowchart – ACCA SBL’s This content areas explained”: This is probably the most important video as it explains all SBL content in about 15 minutes. Therefore, it is important to go over it and remind yourself on how the topics of the course relate to each other, so have a good look while also downloading the flowchart to have in front of you while i am speaking. The flowchart is a very useful tool in understanding the logic of the paper, especially when you have done your studies and are close to taking the exam!\n\n\nACCA SBL Flowchart – How to understand SBL’s content based on the Award Winning Flowchart by Dino: - Amazing for revising the whole course!

Part 6/6\n\n\n11. “Planning your answer”: This video helps you in how to plan and write your answer based on best practices and content/info from the examiner's report up to early 2020. You need to make sure that you do certain things in order for your answer to include the elements expected by ACCA as well as understanding the 'feel', 'layout', 'logic' in terms of planning.\n\n\n“5 Ws by Dino for SBL”: A simple exam technique to use to answer an SBL requirement. Check it carefully to ensure your answer is effective!\n\n\nHow to write professionally for SBL: An extremely useful video on how to write effectively based on the reporting layout. What the examiners expect, how to space your answer, introduce, conclude, make a slide and other useful tips in gaining marks.\n\n\n14. “A simple way to understand the skills for SBL”: The skills for ACCA's SBL are 5 and they are Communication, Evaluation, Analysis, Commercial Acumen and Scepticism. In this 5 minute video, I explain the competencies in a simple, yet effective way to help you understand what is expected by the examining team.\n\n\n15. “Common layouts for SBL”: For SBL, you will be asked to write your answer in a specific layout such as a 'report', a 'press release' a 'letter' a \"Project Initiation Document\", a briefing paper or even make Powerpoint slides. This video explains what is expected from candidates and how to write as well as the type of layout in each and every style. Remember, writing effectively, following instructions and using the correct layout give points and these are crucial in passing the exam!\n\n\n16. “Description of how to know which model to use in SBL”: This is a 'key' video in understanding WHICH MODEL or THEORY to use based on KEY WORDS from SBL's material. For example, the word competition leads to using 5 forces theory while evaluation of strategies leads candidates to use the \"Suitability, Acceptability. Feasibility\" (SAF) model. There are 25 key words to remember so take notes!\n\n\n17. Can I pass SBL just by using common sense?: Given that SBL is all about simulating the workplace and being 'professional' and acting in a professional manner, many students ask if it is possible to pass purely by using common sense and not using any model and theory to support their answers. The quick answer is YES they can. Listen to this short, yet interesting video on this point.\n\n\n“ACCA SBL FAQs” – Answers to student questions about the SBL exam: This video goes over – and answers specifically – common questions that students ask about ACCA’s SBL exam. For example, can a student use 2 theories? Can you gain more than 1 mark for a valid point etc. Check it out! ALSO GOOD FOR YOUTUBE\n\n\nREPLACED with PREVIOUS with same title: Why candidates fail ACCA’s SBL: Candidates fail because they usually fail to analyse and extend their answers. Watch this video to ensure you do not make these mistakes and how to ensure you do pass at first attempt. – ALSO GOOD FOR YOUTUBE PLEASE\n\n\n20. “Corporate Governance”: is the starting point, as it is the way in which companies are directed and controlled in the best interests of stakeholders. The logic in the course is to start analysing a company from TOP to bottom. From Governance and Structure along with Ethics to Implementation.\n\n\n21. “Key concepts of corporate governance”: A 'must see' video as the content in this video can be used for almost EVERY answer relating to corporate governance and business ethics. This video can give you additional marks if used in such questions/requirements.\n\n\n22. “Stakeholders”: Understanding Stakeholders, mapping them and checking their conflict is crucial for every organization. Stakeholders are those individuals and groups that have an interest and/or can influence the organization. It is important for the organization to SATISFY them all to ensure its smooth operations. Remember that.\n\n\n23. “Agency theory” (or relationship) is the foundation upon which governance exists. Companies have 'agents' working on behalf of the owners. These agents need to always work in the best interest of the company and protect the company's interests.\n\n\n24. “Board of Directors”: The most CENTRAL element in Governance. Most companies, especially listed companies have a board (or even 2 boards), that supervise, create the mission and strategy of the organization and have to collectively protect the company. This video has all the relevant information about the board in less than 4 minutes, such the role of Non Executive Directors, the types of boards, the reason for committees, diversity and other important elements.\n\n\n25. Board Diversity: A very interesting video on why a board needs to be Diverse. People with different expertise, know-how, from different backgrounds, yound and old, men and women, different religions, from different geographical areas always help in providing different viewpoints, ideas and challenging concepts. A good board is a diverse board.\n\n\nChairman & CEO: A short video on the difference between the Chairman and CEO, their roles in a business and it is best practice for two people to hold these positions and not the same person (segregation of duties)\n\n\n27. “Corporate Governance Country Frameworks”: Every country has its own laws and therefore countries can provide the framework within which listed companies need to operate. This video explains the main differences between the UK's Corporate Governance Code and the USA's Sarbanes Oxley Act and why codes matter along with their pros and cons.\n\n\n28. “Risk Management Process”: A very concise video on the Risk Management Process. Extremely important in understanding how to Manage Risk in a logical sequence. This video can help you answer Risk Management requirements in the exam.\n\n\n29. “Code of Ethics”: Codes of Ethics are very important for organisations. Watch this video to understand why and how they play an important role for companies, how they support professionalism of employees and what some classic 'contents' would be if asked to prepare an outline.\n\n\n30. “Corporate Responsibility” is an element of effective Corporate Governance. In this short video, CR is explained, defined and also some of the most important responsibilities of companies are noted to remember for the exam.\n\n\n31. “CPD – Continuing Professional Development”: A short video to watch WHY board directors need to also continue to update their knowledge the same way ACCA members should. The rationale is the same. Changes happen dramatically these days and therefore it is essential to be able to cope and stay up to date in order to be effective.\n\n\n32. “Vision and Mission” begins the Strategic part of SBL. Every company must have a vision and a mission. The terms are 'abused' unfortunately in the real world, however their importance remains and they are 'different'. Vision is the grad idea and Mission how to get there. Recent theories also talk about the mission being the PURPOSE of the organization (see SInek, 2007 - Start with Why).\n\n\n33. “External Analysis”: A short video on what \"EXTERNAL ANALYSIS\" means. As you have probably seen in the previous videos as well as in the FLOWCHART, companies can be broken into 2 sections, External and Internal. External means everything happening outside the company's doors and Internal everything that happens within the company's doors. This is useful as if there is a requirement in the exam that has to do with environment or competition, you should know where to look and what to use from that area of the flowchart.\n\n\n34. “PESTEL”: This video explains one of the most 'classic' models in business, PESTEL which can be used if the requirement asks you to analyse, or evaluate the 'environment' in the case. Of course you may also be asked to demonstrate understanding of 'commercial acumen' which implies - in most cases - understanding the way an organization operates within its environment. Don't be afraid to use this model alongside other 'external' models as indicated in the flowchart.\n\n\n35. “5 Forces Theory”: A concise video on understanding Michael Porter's 5 forces theory which is used to evaluate the competitive environment or the 'profitability' of an industry. As Porter suggests, every industry is different but this model can be used to understand where the organization can actually make money in its industry and where it is probably losing money (i.e. supplier power forcing margins down or high customer power due to low switching costs etc.). Extremely important for the exam.\n\n\n36. “Porter’s Diamond”: An amazing model explaining why and how COUNTRIES (not companies) can have a national competitive advantage. As it can be assumed, if a country has some unique resources (i.e. oil, climate, know-how etc.) it can have a competitive advantage thus making organisations operating in such an environment possibly benefit from this uniqueness by operating in that country or even taking PART of their operation in their supply chain to that country. For example, Apple designs phones in the USA taking advantage of the US's talent in innovation and design, while it assembles the phone (at least until the time of publishing this course) in China, thus taking advantage of the top quality resources (talent) in China in terms of technology know-how, scalability for production and market.\n\n\n37. “Internal Analysis”: A short video on understanding what \"internal\" analysis means - along the lines of \"external\". Here, I include elements and theories that relate to \"INSIDE\" the company (like strategy, Critical Success factors, Value chain, Portfolio, strategy etc.)\n\n\n38. Critical Success Factors & Balanced Scorecard: This video explains the concept of Critical Success Factors and why it is important for companies to focus on what ‘Really” matters in business. The basis upon which the Balances Scorecard was developed in 1990 was the CSFs, and therefore an explanation on what the Balanced Scorecard is, is provided.\n\n\n39. “Big Data”: An extremely important video on the topic of our era (big data). Data is the new 'oil' and companies need data to understand trends, forecast demand, make budgets and make predictions based on the data they collect and 'mine'. In the 21st century data is becoming more and more important as it is coming very fast (Velocity), is of different kind (Variety) and we are overwhelmed by how much data is being produced (volume) due to the fast pace of our world, globalisation and 24/7 connectivity. The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to create more data...\n\n\n40. “Porter’s Generic Strategies”: Companies need to have a 'generic strategy' to compete in its market. This video explains the Generic Strategies model in an extremely simple way to help you understand what it is all about along with examples.\n\n\n41. “The BCG Matrix” (Boston Consulting Group Matrix) examines a company's portfolio of services or products but can also be used for a company's subsidiary products. Understand in this video what cash cows, stars, question marks and dogs mean in strategy terms.\n\n\n42. “Value Chain”: The value chain is based on the assumption that VALUE is CREATED or ADDED when 9 activities within companies are COORDINATED well. These activities are broken down into 2 groups (support and primary) and only if these activities are based on the company's generic strategy/philosophy and work in a coordinated, effective and efficient way, the company can add value.\n\n\nBenchmarking: This video explains the concept of benchmarking, how it is used, its advantages as well as its disadvantages for organizations. It also mentions some examples.\n\n\n44. “Culture”: If there is a question on culture in the exam, you can use the 7 elements of the Cultural Web, a very useful model/theory that examines 7 areas to understand a company's culture.\n\n\n45. “Market Segmentation”: Among the top areas that are important to know in marketing is segmentation. Companies need to know the profiles of their customers and when organising them into homogenous groups, this is called segmentation. Watch this video to understand the area and explain it in the context of the SBL case if it comes up.\n\n\n46. “Marketing Mix – 7 P’s”: This video talks about and explains probably the most important marketing theory in the world, the Marketing mix, also known as 7 P's. In the older days it was called '4P's however if an organization is offering a 'service' 7 P's may be more appropriate.\n\n\n47. “6 I's Elements” in Marketing refers to the characteristics and advantages for Marketing on-line in a digital way. All elements start with an \"I\" so we can remember them better.\n\n\n48. “SWOT analysis”: One of the most well-known business models of all time. You may not be asked to undertake a SWOT analysis for the exam but you may be asked to state the POSITION of the company. If you see this word, it implies SWOT which is a static but very important model to list and analyse the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats of a company. Remember to ANALYSE the points raised within the context of the case, not just list them. Strengths and Weaknesses are usually internal areas (found from inside the company), while Opportunities and Threats are from outside the company (External areas).\n\n\n49. “Directional Policy Matrix”: This video explains how many directions a company can take towards growth. The simplicity of Ansoff's model featured is amazing. After the SWOT analysis comes growth usually and the direction chosen is based on the SWOT (position). After directions, methods follow.\n\n\n50. “Methods for Growth”: This video explains the various methods a company has to grow after the direction from Ansoff's model is chosen. Practically speaking there are about 7 methods that companies use: Licensing, Franchising, Merger, Acquisition, Joint Venture (or Alliance), Organic and Exporting. In the exam, if you are asked to EVALUATE a strategy such as one of these you need to examine it by asking 3 words: Suitability, Acceptability and Feasibility (next video in sequence).\n\n\n51. “Suitability, Acceptability, Feasibility (SAF)”: This video explains how to evaluate a strategic direction chosen. For example, if a company decides to acquire another company, is this strategy Suitable for the organization? Is it Acceptable? is it Feasible? In your answer you need to know the pros and cos of acquisitions and ask yourself questions such as is this idea acceptable to the stakeholders of the company? Is it feasible? Does the company have capabilities? Resources? know-how? Does the company have cash etc. etc.\n\n\n52. “Change Management”: A very important topic of our era. What is change? Why is it important? Why are people resistant? How can we manage change? Watch this video to get the basics on change and some examples that you can use for the exam.\n\n\n53. “Project Management”: This video is a Mini Project Management course on the \"basics of project management\". It includes what projects are, their constraints, the role of the project manager, the business case, the PID, the lessons learnt, the tools Project Managers use and other important points to help you understand the topic towards preparing for the exam.\n\n\n54. Leadership: A video on a very challenging topic. It goes over the difference between leadership and management, the traits of a good leader and some of the basic theories and styles of leadership like the situational leadership model;",

If so, you are not alone; the Series 7 is one of the most stressful and challenging tests in any industry, and often times, one's future employment depends on passing the exam the first time around.  Perhaps the most challenging section of the test involves Options and how they work, as well as the investing and hedging strategies that are available through their use - and few sections prove more difficult for Series 7 students. Unfortunately, the Options section often represents between 10-12% of all the questions on the entire test, so mastering this material is critically important.\nThis Fundamentals of Options Seminar will begin at the beginning, emphasizing the conceptual underpinnings of Options - what they are, how they function, and how they are used to achieve certain desired investment outcomes. Without a clear and strong understanding of these fundamental principles, it is extremely difficult to master Options, and passing the Series 7 then becomes even more challenging.\nOnce you've taken this course you'll have a much stronger grasp of the key principles regarding Options. But in order to help you understand and master the more complex applications and strategies using these contracts, I created my Intermediate Options Seminar - which will further strengthen your understanding of Options and help make you a more confident and effective test taker.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Financial Accounting and Reporting course by Uplatz.\n\n\nUplatz provides this comprehensive training on Financial Accounting and Reporting.\nThis Financial Accounting & Financial Reporting course will demonstrate the key accounting concepts and principles to be able to prepare financial statements and unlock critical insights into business performance and potential. You will explore how financial advisors, managers, analysts, and entrepreneurs leverage accounting to drive strategic decision-making. The Financial Accounting course will help you master the functional and technical skills needed to analyze financial statements and disclosures for use in financial analysis, and learn how accounting standards and managerial incentives affect the financial reporting process. By the end of this Financial Accounting & Reporting course, you’ll be able to read the three most common financial statements: the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. Then you can apply these skills to real-world industry scenarios.\n\n\nFinancial Accounting is essentially the process of preparing financial statements that organizations use to show their financial performance and position to people outside the company including investors, creditors, suppliers, and customers. Financial reporting can be defined as the standard practices to provide stakeholders a clear depiction of an organization's finances, including their revenue, expenses, profits, capital, and cash flow, as formal records that provide in-depth insights into financial information.\nFinancial accounting ensures the legal compliance for how businesses track, recognize, and measure revenue, costs, depreciation, intangible assets, goodwill, and the like. Since the investors as well as regulatory bodies want all businesses to be measured on the same grading stick and to have confidence that financial measures can be compared across businesses, hence financial accounting assumes great importance. While the occasional pro-forma statement may be issued, financial accounting is primarily dealing with accounting for historical transactions. Everything must be accounted for and should match on both sides of the accounting ledger.\nFinancial accounting differs from management accounting, in the sense that financial accounting is for external parties which by contrast management accounting involves preparing detailed reports and forecasts for managers inside the company. In simple words, managerial accounting information is aimed at helping managers within a company while financial accounting is aimed at providing information to external parties.\nThe basic goals of financial accounting involve analysis, preparation, publication of:\nFinancial statements/accounting/reporting, cash flow analysis\nAccounting theory/practice/cycle\nIncome/retained earnings statements, balance sheets\nGAAP, international reporting standards, standards convergence\n\n\nFinancial Reporting simply refers to the financial results of an organization that are released to its stakeholders and to the public. This reporting is a key function of the controller, who may be assisted by the investor relations officer if an organization is publicly held. Financial reporting typically encompasses the following documents and postings:\nFinancial statements, which include the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows\nAccompanying footnote disclosures, which include more detail on certain topics, as prescribed by the relevant accounting framework\nAny financial information that the company chooses to post about itself on its website\nAnnual reports issued to shareholders\nAny prospectus issued to potential investors concerning the issuance of securities by the organization\nFinancial reporting utilizes financial statements to disclose financial data that indicates the financial health of a company over during a specific period of time. The information is vital for management to make decisions about the company’s future and provides information to capital providers like creditors and investors about the profitability and financial stability of an organization.\nInternal financial reporting is a business practice that involves compiling financial information on a frequent basis for use within the organization. The documents may contain confidential information, such as business indicators or KPIs, financial performance, performance indicators, etc.. These are designed to help those individuals working within the company to make informed decisions.

      "description": "Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance refers to a type of insurance that covers physical property and liability. This type of insurance helps protect individuals and businesses from financial losses resulting from events such as theft, damage to property, or injury to others. P&C insurance can include a variety of policies, such as: Homeowner's insurance: Covers losses to a personal residence and its contents. Auto insurance: Covers losses resulting from car accidents or theft. Business insurance: Covers losses to a business's property, liability, and vehicles. The coverage, terms, and conditions of P&C insurance policies can vary widely, and it is important to review the specifics of a policy and consult with an insurance agent to determine the right coverage for your needs.\nProperty insurance and casualty insurance are types of coverage that help protect the stuff you own — your home or car, for example — and also provide liability coverage to help protect you if you're found legally responsible for an accident that causes injuries to another person or damage to another person's belongings.\n\n\nThe phrase “property and casualty insurance” is bandied about quite a bit, especially between insurance brokers and clients discussing business insurance alternatives. However, many people still don’t know what it means.\n\n\nIf you’re a small business owner, it’s important to understand the various types of insurance options available to you.\nProperty and casualty insurance are types of coverage that protect the things you own (like your home, car, and other belongings, or even your pets). These insurances also include liability coverage. This helps protect you if you’re found legally responsible for an accident that causes injuries to another person or damages to their property.\nProperty and casualty insurance, or P&C insurance, is an umbrella term to describe a bunch of different types of insurance, covering your personal property and offering liability coverage. Types of P&C insurance are homeowners insurance, condo insurance, co-op insurance, HO4 insurance, liability insurance, pet insurance, and car insurance.\nP&C insurance does not include other types of insurance coverage such as life insurance, health insurance, and fire insurance.\nProperty Insurance\nBroadly speaking, property insurance refers to your personal belongings ie. stuff you own. However, depending on the type of insurance policy you hold, property insurance can be defined differently. For example, in a renters policy, your property is referred to as personal property. In the policy it’s referred to as Coverage C, and it applies to your stuff in the event of a covered loss.\nProperty insurance is a popular insurance policy for business owners and protects the business property in the case of vandalism and theft, covering the structure, and its contents. Another variation is pet insurance, which is surprising since pets are part of our families. But since your insurance reimburses you for the costs of your cat’s or dog’s care it’s considered property insurance as well.\nTL;DR: Personal property coverage (aka contents insurance) part of any standard renters or homeowners insurance policy, helps you recover the cost of your lost or damaged stuff for a bunch of different scenarios, which we’ll dive into in the following sections.",

Through comprehensive practice, you will gain confidence, hone your skills, and become fully prepared to excel in your certification journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll questions are high quality, original and have been written from scratch!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\nQuality speaks for itself:\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION #1 (Conceptual-based):\nJane wants to invest in bonds with lower price volatility. Which bond characteristic should she consider?\nA. Shorter maturity and higher coupon.\nB. Longer maturity and higher coupon.\nC. Shorter maturity and lower coupon.\nD. Longer maturity and lower coupon.\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER:\nCorrect Option: A.\nExtracted from Unit 5 | Types of investments:\nCorrect option: \"Shorter maturity and higher coupon.\"\n\n\nShorter maturity and higher coupon bonds are less sensitive to changes in interest rates, leading to lower price volatility. This is because:\nShorter maturity: Bonds with shorter maturities have less exposure to changes in interest rates, as they are repaid sooner. Thus, their prices are less affected by interest rate fluctuations.\nHigher coupon: Bonds with higher coupon rates return more cash to investors through periodic payments, reducing the bond's duration (a measure of interest rate sensitivity) and making the bond price more stable.\nWhy other options are incorrect:\nLonger maturity and higher coupon:\nAlthough a higher coupon reduces interest rate sensitivity, the longer maturity increases price volatility, as the bondholder is exposed to interest rate changes over a longer period.\nShorter maturity and lower coupon:\nWhile shorter maturity reduces interest rate sensitivity, the lower coupon means fewer periodic payments, increasing the bond's duration and making it more sensitive to price volatility compared to bonds with higher coupons.\nLonger maturity and lower coupon:\nThis combination leads to the highest price volatility, as longer maturity amplifies exposure to interest rate changes, and lower coupon payments mean less cash flow to offset changes in bond prices.\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION #1 (Scenario-based):\nSarah, an investor,  submits a purchase request for a mutual fund at 6 p.m. EST on May 10. what are the valuation and settlement dates for her purchase, respectively?\nA. May 10, May 11.\nB. May 11, May 11.\nC. May 11, May 12.\nD. May 11, May 10.\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER:\nCorrect Option: C.\nExtracted from Unit 8 | Mutual funds administration:\nCorrect option: May 11, May 12.\n\n\nTo determine the valuation date and settlement date for Sarah's mutual fund purchase, we need to consider the following:\nOrder Submission Timing:\nMutual fund orders are typically processed at the next available Net Asset Value (NAV), which is calculated after the market closes at 4:00 p.m. EST on business days.\nSince Sarah submitted her purchase request at 6:00 p.m. EST on May 10, her order missed the cutoff time for same-day processing.\nTherefore, her order will be processed based on the NAV calculated at the close of the next business day (May 11).\nValuation Date:\nThe valuation date is the date on which the NAV used to process the order is calculated.\nFor Sarah, this will be May 11, the next business day after her order submission.\nSettlement Date:\nMutual fund purchases typically follow a T+1 settlement rule (one business day after the trade date).\nFor an order processed on May 11, the settlement date will be May 12, assuming no holidays or weekends interfere.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\nSAMPLE QUESTION #2 (Calculation-based):\nEmily, a financial analyst, is examining XYZ Corporation's financial statements. She observes that the company's retained earnings at the beginning of the year were $175,000. After earning a profit of $55,000 during the year and paying $30,000 in dividends on common shares, what is the company's retained earnings at the end of the year?\nA. $100,000.\nB. $175,000.\nC. $200,000.\nD. $225,000.\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER:\nCorrect Option: C.\nDetailed Explanation:\n\n\nRetained earnings at the end of the year can be calculated by adding the profit earned during the year to the retained earnings at the beginning of the year, and then subtracting any dividends paid out.\nIn this case, the calculation would be as follows:\nRetained Earnings at End of Year = Retained Earnings at Beginning of Year + Profit − Dividends\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\nRetained Earnings at End of Year= $175,000 + $55,000 − $30,000 = $200,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your Canadian Investment Funds iCourse (CIFC) exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nThis is a huge original question bank\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-days money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\nDisclaimer:\nThe trade-marks AFP, AIS, BCO, CIM, CSI, CSC, CPH, DFOL, FP1, FP2, FPIC, FPSU, IDSC, IFC, CIFC, NEC, OLC, PFP, PFSA, PMT, WME, Wealth Management Essentials, Branch Compliance Officer, Canadian Securities Course, Conduct and Practices Handbook Course, Investment Funds in Canada, New Entrants Course, Wealth Management Essentials, Personal Financial Services Advice Reading, Financial Planning 1, Financial Planning 2, Financial Planning Supplement, Applied Financial Planning, and Personal Financial Planner are owned by the Canadian Securities Institute (CSI®).

      "description": "The aim of the SBR syllabus is to discuss, apply and evaluate the concepts, principles, and practices that underpin the preparation and interpretation of corporate reports in various contexts including the ethical assessment of management’s stewardship and the information needs of a diverse group of stakeholders.\nThe syllabus for Strategic Business Reporting assumes knowledge acquired at the Applied Skills level including the core technical capabilities to prepare and analyse financial reports for single and combined entities.\nThe syllabus requires students to examine corporate reporting from a number of perspectives, not only from the point of view of the preparer of corporate reports but also from the perspective of a variety of different stakeholders such as finance providers and investors. The syllabus further requires the assessment and evaluation of the reporting decisions made by management and their implications for a range of stakeholders and entities. It also explores the professional and ethical responsibilities of the accountant to these stakeholders.\nThe subject matter of the syllabus requires students to have a cohesive understanding of the IASB’s Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting and to use the Framework as a basis for judgment in applying International Financial Reporting Standards in corporate reports. The syllabus considers both the principles and practices of IFRS Standards and uses these principles as a basis for the preparation of the financial statements of single entities and groups.\nThe syllabus requires students to reflect on the usefulness of corporate reports to stakeholders including developments in narrative reporting such as Integrated Reporting and sustainability reporting and to discuss the nature of the information that would help stakeholders assess the future prospects of the entity. This involves the analysis and interpretation of corporate reports and the provision of advice on the reporting implications of transactions.\n\n\nThe penultimate section of the syllabus addresses current developments in corporate reporting and the implications of any potential changes. This includes a discussion of the deficiencies of existing accounting standards and the ability to explain the implications for a business and its stakeholders of significant changes to reporting frameworks. Question scenarios will be based on contemporary business settings, however, candidates will not be required to have detailed knowledge of these businesses. Question scenarios will be current and relevant for example the impact of climate change.\n\n\nThe final section of the syllabus contains outcomes relating to the demonstration of appropriate digital and employability skills in preparing for and taking the SBR examination. This includes being able to access and open exhibits, requirements, and response options from different sources and being able to use the relevant functionality and technology to prepare and present response options in a professional manner.",

It is designed to assess the competency of individuals who want to become registered representatives and engage in the sale of a broad range of securities products in the United States. Passing the Series 7 exam is a requirement for professionals who wish to work as General Securities Representatives, handling client transactions involving stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, and other investment products.\nThis course is designed to provide a complete and in-depth understanding of the concepts and regulations required to pass the Series 7 Exam and succeed as a General Securities Representative. It covers a wide range of topics essential for securities professionals, including financial regulations, investment products, trading strategies, client suitability requirements, and ethical responsibilities.\nStudents will begin by exploring the role of a General Securities Representative, learning about key job responsibilities, client interactions, and the regulatory framework governing the securities industry. A strong emphasis is placed on compliance with FINRA and SEC regulations, providing a foundation for understanding the broader legal environment in which securities professionals operate. Major securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, will be examined in detail. Additionally, students will gain insight into more recent regulatory developments, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, and their impact on corporate governance and financial system stability.\nA crucial aspect of the course is understanding different types of client accounts, investment recommendations, and the regulatory obligations related to suitability and the \"Know Your Customer\" (KYC) rule. Students will explore how to open, maintain, and manage various account types, including individual, joint, corporate, trust, and retirement accounts, while learning the importance of proper documentation and compliance with regulatory standards. Key topics such as trading authorizations, discretionary accounts, and margin accounts will also be covered to ensure students understand the rules governing client transactions.\nThe course delves into investment products, beginning with equity securities, including common stock, preferred stock, stock splits, dividends, rights, warrants, and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). It also provides a comprehensive overview of debt securities, exploring corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury securities, municipal bonds, agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and the significance of bond ratings. Special attention is given to advanced bond features such as convertibility options, call and put provisions, and the risks associated with various fixed-income investments.\nOptions trading is another critical component of the course, introducing students to calls, puts, strike prices, expiration dates, and basic and advanced options strategies such as covered calls, protective puts, spreads, and straddles. The course also highlights the risks and suitability considerations for options trading, ensuring students develop a thorough understanding of risk management techniques and regulatory requirements.\nInvestment companies and pooled investment products, including mutual funds, unit investment trusts (UITs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and exchange-traded notes (ETNs), are covered in detail. Students will explore different fund structures, share classes, fee structures, performance evaluation methods, and the tax implications of investing in these products. The course also examines retirement plans and tax-advantaged accounts, such as traditional and Roth IRAs, employer-sponsored 401(k) and 403(b) plans, and education savings accounts like 529 plans and Coverdell ESAs.\nTrading and market-making concepts will be thoroughly discussed, including order types, execution strategies, trading venues, broker-dealer operations, market making, settlement and clearing processes, and the rules governing margin accounts. Students will gain practical knowledge about how securities transactions are executed and settled in the financial markets.\nThe final sections of the course focus on quantitative analysis, including time value of money concepts, bond pricing and yield calculations, stock valuation methods, modern portfolio theory, and economic indicators. These topics will help students develop a solid foundation in financial analysis, enabling them to assess investment opportunities and market conditions effectively.\nEthics and professional conduct are central to a securities professional’s role, and the course concludes with a discussion on ethical obligations, prohibited practices, insider trading regulations, and the consequences of market manipulation. Understanding these ethical and legal responsibilities is essential for maintaining integrity and compliance in the financial industry.\nBy the end of this course, students will have a thorough understanding of the Series 7 Exam content and be well-prepared to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.\nWhether pursuing a career as a General Securities Representative or seeking a deeper understanding of securities markets, this course provides the essential tools and expertise needed for success.\nThank you",

      "description": "A Certified Management Accountant is an accounting professional that uses their expertise in management accounting to help businesses make calculated decisions.\nThey are strategic thinkers that use their analytics skills to improve the overall success of the company they serve. CMAs work for corporations, not-for-profits, government organizations, and other businesses.\nCMAs tend to hold leadership roles and might have the title of financial analyst, financial planner, cost accountant, corporate controller, or even CFO.\nSome of the primary support they provide includes:\nPerformance management\nCost management\nRisk management\nFinancial analysis\nDecision-making support\n\n\nWhy Get a CMA Certification?\nConsider the following benefits of investing in a CMA certification.\n\n\nEarn a Higher Salary: Accountants with CMA designation tend to make more money than those without it. According to an IMA survey in 2021, the median compensation for CMAs was 58% higher than non-CMAs.\nSet Yourself Apart: CMA certification is one of the top designations a management accountant can earn. Many consider it the professional standard for management accounting. Earning a CMA verifies that you are an expert in accounting and financial management, giving you a leg up when searching for a job.\nBuild Global Recognition: The CMA designation holds global recognition. CMAs can use their knowledge and skills outside of the United States, making it valuable for accountants who want to work abroad.\n\n\nWhat Does the CMA Exam Cover?\nCMA exam-takers can take parts one and two in any order. Part one covers financial planning, performance, and analytics. Part two explores financial management. Each part breaks down as follows:\n\n\nPart One: financial planning, performance, and analytics (100 multiple-choice questions, two essay questions - 4 Hours)\nExternal financial reporting decisions (15%)\nPlanning, budgeting, and forecasting (20%)\nPerformance management (20%)\nCost management (15%)\nInternal controls (15%)\nTechnology and analytics (15%)\nPart Two: strategic financial management (100 multiple-choice questions, two essay questions - 4 Hours)\nFinancial statement analysis (20%)\nCorporate finance (20%)\nDecision analysis (25%)\nRisk management (10%)\nInvestment decisions (10%)\nProfessional ethics (15%)\n\n\nEach exam part takes four hours to complete, entailing 100 multiple-choice questions and two 30-minute essays. After completing and exiting the multiple-choice section, test-takers cannot go back. Candidates access the essay questions either after completing the multiple-choice section or after three hours, whichever comes first.\n\n\nTest-takers must answer at least half of the multiple-choice questions correctly for each part of the CMA exam to move on to the essay section. The essay section poses 10-12 written response or calculation questions. Essay questions comprise two scenarios describing common business situations.\nScoring the Exam\nScoring a 360 out of 500 is considered \"passing\" for the CMA exam. Candidates do not have to pass each part of the test. Passing or failing depends on each person's total score for both parts of the exam. For the sake of consistency and fairness, CMA exam scores are weighted.\n\n\nTips for the exam day:\nOn the day of the CMA exam, test-takers should do the following:\n\n\nArrive at the testing center 30 minutes before the exam.\nSign the Prometric log book.\nProvide a fingerprint.\nBring a valid ID. Accepted forms of ID include a passport, U.S. passport card, driver's license, military ID card, and credit card.\nBring an accepted calculator.\n\n\nIn this Preparation course, we offers the Latest, Exclusive and the most Recurrent Questions in addition of 2 case studies & detailed Explanation by mastering the accounting language and understanding all accounting professional terms.  (New material has been added to this course recently in 2025)\nBe reminded that the exam windows are Jan/Feb - May/Jun - Sep/Oct of each year for Part 1 and Part 2.\nPass Your Exam on the First Try (Latest Exclusive Questions & Explanation)\nFor targeted training on a specific section of the CMA exam, I offer two specialised courses: CMA Part 1 is available on the platform now, and CMA Part 2 will be launching soon.\nGood Luck !",

It has no sponsorship or affiliation requirements, meaning you do not need to be associated with a FINRA-member firm to take the exam. Open to anyone aged 18 or older, the SIE has no specific educational or work experience prerequisites, making it accessible to students, career changers, or anyone exploring opportunities in the financial services sector. Registration, which includes an $80 fee, can be completed through FINRA’s system or authorized testing centers like Prometric. While passing the SIE demonstrates foundational knowledge of the securities industry, it does not qualify an individual to conduct securities business; additional qualification exams, such as the Series 6 or Series 7, and association with a FINRA-member firm are required for registration as a representative."

Increased demand for exports and improved economic performance.\nB. Decreased demand for imports and decreased government spending.\nC. Decreased demand for exports and political instability.\nD. Increased supply of imports and trade deficits.\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER:\nCorrect Option: A.\nDetailed Explanation:\n\n\nWhy option A is correct:\nIncreased Demand for Exports:\nWhen a country's exports are in high demand, foreign buyers need to purchase that country's currency to pay for the goods and services. This increased demand for the currency drives up its value in the foreign exchange market.\nImproved Economic Performance:\nStrong economic performance often leads to higher interest rates, as the central bank may raise rates to control inflation. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment, as investors seek better returns on investments denominated in that currency. This inflow of capital increases demand for the currency, boosting its value.\n\n\n________________________________________\nSAMPLE QUESTION #2 (Calculation-based):\nEmily believes that the price of XYZ Inc. stock will significantly decline in the near future. She decides to purchase 5 XYZ December 60 put options at the current price of $3.50. What is Emily's maximum potential profit per share if the price of XYZ stock drops to $50 at expiration?\nA. $5.50.\nB. $6.50.\nC. $3.50.\nD. $10.00.\nWhat's your guess?

      "description": "CLF-C02:AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Test Course\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nOur security team is reviewing encryption options for data stored in Amazon S3 and needs to know which types can be used to protect objects at rest. Which encryption types meet this requirement? (Choose two.)\nA. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)\nB. Server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS)\nC. TLS\nD. SSL\nE. Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)\nCorrect Answer: A and B\nExplanation:\nThe correct answers are A and B.\n*   A. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3):  This is a server-side encryption option where Amazon S3 manages the encryption keys.  It's a simple and effective way to encrypt data at rest in S3.\n*   B. Server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS): This option also provides server-side encryption, but you manage the encryption keys using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This gives you more control over your encryption keys.\n*   C. TLS and D. SSL: TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are used to encrypt data *in transit*, not data at rest. They protect data while it's being transmitted over a network, but don't encrypt the data once it's stored in S3.\n*   E. Transparent Data Encryption (TDE): TDE is typically used for databases, not object storage like S3.  It's a method of encrypting data at the database level.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nOur data governance team needs to identify any sensitive data within our large AWS data repository. Which AWS service can help us discover and classify this sensitive information?\nA. Amazon Inspector\nB. Amazon Macie\nC. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\nD. Amazon CloudWatch\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation:\nAmazon Macie is the correct answer. Macie is a data security and privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and classify sensitive data in AWS data stores, primarily Amazon S3.  It helps identify sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI).  The other options are not designed for this purpose:\n*   Amazon Inspector: Inspector is a vulnerability management service that helps improve the security and compliance of your applications running on EC2 and container images. It doesn't directly identify sensitive data within your data stores.\n*   AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM controls access to AWS resources.  It's about who can do what, not about identifying the sensitivity of the data itself.\n*   Amazon CloudWatch: CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service. It collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events, but it doesn't have built-in capabilities for identifying sensitive data.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nOur company's security auditor needs a list of all IAM users, including the status of their credentials and access keys. What is the simplest way for us to provide this information?\nA. Create an IAM user account for the auditor, granting the auditor administrator permissions.\nB. Take a screenshot of each user's page in the AWS Management Console, then provide the screenshots to the auditor.\nC. Download the IAM credential report, then provide the report to the auditor.\nD. Download the AWS Trusted Advisor report, then provide the report to the auditor.\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nThe IAM credential report provides a downloadable CSV file containing a list of all IAM users and the status of their credentials, including access keys. This is the most direct and efficient way to fulfill the auditor's request. Creating an IAM user for the auditor (A) grants excessive access and is a security risk. Taking screenshots (B) is inefficient, prone to errors, and difficult to manage. The AWS Trusted Advisor report (D) provides recommendations on cost optimization, security, performance, and service limits, but does not contain the specific IAM user and credential information requested.\n\n\n\n\nAre you ready to pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam?\nOur AWS CLF-C02 Practice Test Course is designed to help you master AWS cloud fundamentals and confidently pass the certification exam.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Cost & Management Accounting course by Uplatz.\n\n\nCosting, as defined by the Institute of Cost and Works Accountants, England is basically “The technique and process of ascertaining costs.” It can also be described as classifying, recording and appropriate allocation of expenditure for the determination of the costs of products or services, and for presentation of suitably arranged data for the purposes of control, and guidance of management.\nCost Accounting is a method of accounting wherein all the costs involved in performing any process, project or product are noted and analyzed. Such analysis helps the management in taking strategic decisions. Cost accounting uses various techniques to make an organization cost effective.\nUplatz provides this comprehensive course on Costing and Cost & Management Accounting.\n\n\nCost accounting and product costing are two accounting methods for determining the cash needed to create goods and services. A company's decision to use either accounting technique can have lasting implications on how the business interprets financial data and makes business decisions. Product costing may work better for a business lacking modern manufacturing facilities, while cost accounting better suits a company using large-scale production methods.\nProduct costing is the accounting process of determining all business expenses pertaining the creation of company products. These costs can include raw material purchases, worker wages, production transportation costs and retail stocking fees. A company uses these overall costs to plan a variety of business strategies, including setting product prices and developing promotional campaigns. A company also uses product costing to find ways to streamline production costs to maximize profits. For example, choosing raw materials that are more cost-effective can allow a company to increase profit from retail sales by lowering its product creation costs.\nJob costing is an accounting tool that allows businesses to track costs by individual jobs. Job costing is calculated by accumulating the cost of labor, materials and overhead for a specific project.\nCost accounting is the process of collecting, classifying and recording all the costs associated with accomplishing a business objective or particular company project. A business uses cost accounting to analyze data collected from completing a business task to determine the fair value or selling price of the product created from that task. Cost accounting can also help a company streamline its production process to reduce costs and return a greater profit on individual product sales.\n\n\nAdvantages of Cost Accounting\nCost accounting overcomes the problems associated with adjusting projections to suit modern manufacturing techniques or counting individual inventory components. This allows cost accounting to deliver detailed reports regarding the cost of each phase of production. An organization can use these reports to specifically target areas of the company for cost reduction or efficiency improvement. Additionally, cost accounting focuses solely on the cash spent to create goods as an economic factor of production. This means a business using cost accounting views money as the single factor affecting the company's ability to produce goods and services.\n\n\nGoals of Costing\nTo determine the exact cost of each article.\nTo determine the cost incurred during each operation to keep control over workers’ wages.\nTo provide information to ascertain the selling price of the product.\nTo supply information for detection of wastage.\nIt helps in reducing the total cost of manufacture.\nIt suggests changes in design when the cost is higher.\nTo help in formulating the policies for charging the prices of the product.\nTo facilitate preparation of estimate for submitting the rates in tenders or quotations.\nTo compare the actual cost with the estimated cost of the component.\n\n\nElements of Cost\nIn general, the costs are divided into:\nMaterial\nLabor\nOther expenses\nEach of these costs can then be further classified into direct and indirect costs.\n\n\nCosting and Cost Accounting - Course Syllabus\n\n\nCost and Management Accounting\nMaterial Costing\nEmployee Cost\nOverheads - Absorption Costing Method\nActivity Based Costing\nCost Accounting System\nCost Sheet\nJob & Contract Costing\nJoint and By-product\nUnit & Batch Costing\nBudget Costing\nMarginal Costing\nProcess & Operating Costing\nService Costing\nStandard Costing\nCost Management for specific sectors\nPricing Decision\nDivisional Transfer Pricing\nCost Management Techniques\nDecision Making",

Thanks. - Vedant L.\n\n\n\n\nYou will get SIX high-quality mock exams to be ready for your certification\n\n\n________________________________________\nQuality speaks for itself:\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION #1 (Scenario-based):\nMichael, a stock analyst, confidently believes that by carefully analyzing a company’s financial statements and having a deep understanding of the industry, he can consistently predict future stock price movements. He often shares this belief with his clients, assuring them that his analytical approach gives him an edge in the market. However, some of his colleagues disagree with his approach, arguing that his belief conflicts with a well-known market theory.\nWhich market theory does Michael's belief most directly conflict with?\n\n\nA) Random Walk Theory\nB) Rational Expectations Hypothesis\nC) Strong form of Efficient Market Hypothesis\nD) Semi-Strong form of Efficient Market Hypothesis\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER:\nCorrect Option: D.\nDetailed Explanation:\n\n\nThe Semi-Strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) asserts that all publicly available information, including financial statements and industry data, is already reflected in stock prices. Therefore, according to this theory, analyzing a company’s financials or understanding its industry cannot consistently lead to above-average returns because the market has already incorporated this information into the stock price. Michael’s belief that he can predict future stock price movements by analyzing financial statements directly conflicts with the Semi-Strong form of EMH, as it implies that publicly available information can still be used to outperform the market, which EMH suggests is unlikely.\n\n\nReason Other Options are Incorrect:\n\n\nA) Random Walk Theory: While the Random Walk Theory also suggests that stock price movements are unpredictable, it does not specifically address the use of publicly available information like the Semi-Strong form of EMH does.\n\n\nB) Rational Expectations Hypothesis: This hypothesis relates more to economic behavior and decision-making based on all available information, but it doesn't directly conflict with the belief in predicting stock prices through financial analysis.\n\n\nC) Strong form of Efficient Market Hypothesis: The Strong form of EMH asserts that all information, both public and private, is reflected in stock prices. While Michael’s belief also conflicts with this form, it more directly conflicts with the Semi-Strong form, as his belief is based on using publicly available information, which the Semi-Strong form addresses.\n________________________________________\nSAMPLE QUESTION #2 (Conceptual-based):\nWhat scenarios could lead to an increase in the price of a currency in the foreign exchange market?\nA. Increased demand for exports and improved economic performance.\nB. Decreased demand for imports and decreased government spending.\nC. Decreased demand for exports and political instability.\nD. Increased supply of imports and trade deficits.\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER:\nCorrect Option: A.\nDetailed Explanation:\n\n\nWhy option A is correct:\nIncreased Demand for Exports:\nWhen a country's exports are in high demand, foreign buyers need to purchase that country's currency to pay for the goods and services. This increased demand for the currency drives up its value in the foreign exchange market.\nImproved Economic Performance:\nStrong economic performance often leads to higher interest rates, as the central bank may raise rates to control inflation. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment, as investors seek better returns on investments denominated in that currency. This inflow of capital increases demand for the currency, boosting its value.\n\n\nIncorrect Options:\nWhy option B is incorrect:\nDecreased Demand for Imports:\nWhile reducing imports can positively impact a country's trade balance, it does not directly increase demand for the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market. The reduction in imports might have a stabilizing effect, but it doesn't necessarily lead to a significant increase in currency value.\nDecreased Government Spending:\nLower government spending could lead to slower economic growth, potentially decreasing investor confidence. This could reduce demand for the currency, making this scenario less likely to lead to an increase in the currency's value.\n\n\nWhy option C is incorrect:\nDecreased Demand for Exports:\nA drop in demand for a country's exports reduces the need for foreign buyers to purchase the domestic currency. This decrease in demand typically leads to a decline in the currency's value.\nPolitical Instability:\nPolitical instability tends to decrease investor confidence, leading to capital outflows as investors seek safer, more stable currencies. This scenario would likely result in a depreciation, not an appreciation, of the currency.\n\n\n\n\nWhy option D  is incorrect:\nIncreased Supply of Imports:\nWhen a country imports more goods, it needs to purchase foreign currencies to pay for those imports, increasing the supply of its own currency on the market. This increased supply generally puts downward pressure on the currency’s value.\nTrade Deficits:\nA trade deficit occurs when a country imports more than it exports, leading to a net outflow of currency. This reduces the currency's value as it indicates that more of the currency is being sold than bought on the global market.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\nSAMPLE QUESTION #3 (Calculation-based):\nIf a mutual fund distributes a $2.00 per unit dividend and the NAV per unit is $20.00 before the distribution, how many additional units does an investor with 500 units receive after reinvestment?\nA. 55.56 units.\nB. 50 units.\nC. 44.44 units.\nD. 40 units.\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER:\nCorrect Option: A.\nDetailed Explanation:\n\n\nStep-by-Step Calculation:\n\n\nTo determine how many additional units an investor receives after reinvesting the dividend, you can follow these steps:\n\nCalculate the total dividend received:\nThe investor holds 500 units.\nThe dividend distributed is $2.00 per unit.\nTotal dividend received = 500 units × $2.00 = $1,000.\n\nCalculate the NAV per unit after the distribution:\nThe NAV per unit drops to $18.00 after the distribution.\nDetermine the number of additional units received:\nAdditional units = Total dividend received / NAV per unit after distribution.\nAdditional units = $1,000 / $18.00 = 55.56 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your Canadian Securities Course 2 exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nThis is a huge original question bank\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-days money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\nDisclaimer:\nThe trade-marks AFP, AIS, BCO, CIM, CSI, CSC, CPH, DFOL, FP1, FP2, FPIC, FPSU, IDSC, IFC, NEC, OLC, PFP, PFSA, PMT, WME, Wealth Management Essentials, Branch Compliance Officer, Canadian Securities Course, Conduct and Practices Handbook Course, Investment Funds in Canada, New Entrants Course, Wealth Management Essentials, Personal Financial Services Advice Reading, Financial Planning 1, Financial Planning 2, Financial Planning Supplement, Applied Financial Planning, and Personal Financial Planner are owned by the Canadian Securities Institute (CSI®).
