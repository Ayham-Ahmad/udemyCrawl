Our process is proven, trusted, and designed to help you succeed.\nAll questions have been designed from scratch to match the latest exam requirements, and we are continuously updating our question bank to keep it current and relevant.\nYou can read some of the amazing testimonials from our students who have successfully passed the real exam:\nExam Overview:\nCategory: Associate\nExam Duration: 130 minutes\nExam Format: 65 questions; either multiple choice or multiple response\nCost: 150 USD. Visit Exam pricing for additional cost information, including foreign exchange rates.\nTesting Options: Pearson VUE testing center or online proctored exam.\nLanguages Offered: English, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Simplified Chinese, and Spanish (Latin America).\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nYou have migrated an on-premise SQL Server database to an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) database attached to a VPC inside a private subnet. Additionally, the related Java application, previously hosted on-premise, has been moved to an AWS Lambda function.\nWhich of the following should you implement to connect the AWS Lambda function to its RDS instance?\nUse Lambda layers to connect to the internet and RDS separately.\nConfigure Lambda to connect to the public subnet that will give internet access and use a Security Group to access RDS inside the private subnet.\nUse environment variables to pass in the RDS connection string.\nConfigure Lambda to connect to a VPC with a private subnet and Security Group needed to access RDS.\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect Answer: 4.\nCORRECT OPTION:\nConfigure Lambda to connect to a VPC with a private subnet and Security Group needed to access RDS. This approach allows your Lambda function to securely access private resources during execution. When a Lambda function is connected to a VPC, it creates an elastic network interface for each combination of the security group and subnet in your function's VPC configuration. This is the proper way to enable RDS access for your Lambda function.\nINCORRECT OPTIONS:\nUse Lambda layers to connect to the internet and RDS separately.\nLambda layers are used to pull in additional code and content, such as libraries, custom runtimes, or dependencies. However, they do not provide connectivity to RDS instances, making this option incorrect.\nConfigure Lambda to connect to the public subnet and use Security Group to access RDS inside the private subnet.\nConnecting a Lambda function to a public subnet does not provide internet access or a public IP address. To enable internet access, the VPC must have a NAT gateway (or NAT instance) in a public subnet. This setup will not enable the Lambda function to access RDS in a private subnet.\nUse environment variables to pass in the RDS connection string.\nEnvironment variables are helpful for securely storing secrets and adjusting function behavior without modifying the code. However, they do not provide connectivity to RDS.\nInstructor:\nIntroducing We Learn, a passionate community of professionals dedicated to transforming the way individuals approach learning and professional growth.

      "description": "Big data is a collection of large datasets that cannot be processed using traditional computing techniques. It is not a single technique or a tool, rather it has become a complete subject, which involves various tools, techniques and frameworks.\nThus Big Data includes huge volume, high velocity, and extensible variety of data. The data in it will be of three types.\nStructured data − Relational data.\nSemi Structured data − XML data.\nUnstructured data − Word, PDF, Text, Media Logs.\nBig Data Challenges:\nThe major challenges associated with big data are as follows −\nCapturing data\nCuration\nStorage\nSearching\nSharing\nTransfer\nAnalysis\nPresentation\nTo fulfill the above challenges, organizations normally take the help of enterprise servers.\nBig Data Technologies:\nBig data technologies are important in providing more accurate analysis, which may lead to more concrete decision-making resulting in greater operational efficiencies, cost reductions, and reduced risks for the business.\nTo harness the power of big data, you would require an infrastructure that can manage and process huge volumes of structured and unstructured data in realtime and can protect data privacy and security.\nThere are various technologies in the market from different vendors including Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, etc., to handle big data. While looking into the technologies that handle big data, we examine the following two classes of technology.\nOperational Big Data:\nThis include systems like MongoDB that provide operational capabilities for real-time, interactive workloads where data is primarily captured and stored.\nNoSQL Big Data systems are designed to take advantage of new cloud computing architectures that have emerged over the past decade to allow massive computations to be run inexpensively and efficiently. This makes operational big data workloads much easier to manage, cheaper, and faster to implement.\nSome NoSQL systems can provide insights into patterns and trends based on real-time data with minimal coding and without the need for data scientists and additional infrastructure.",

      "description": "MB-920 Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals (ERP) certification is designed to validate foundational knowledge of enterprise resource planning (ERP) capabilities within the Microsoft Dynamics 365 suite. This exam focuses on core financial and operational business processes and how they are implemented using Microsoft Dynamics 365 applications like Finance, Supply Chain Management, Business Central, and Commerce. It is ideal for business professionals, functional consultants, and students who want to demonstrate their understanding of ERP concepts and Microsoft’s approach to integrated business solutions.\nThe exam covers key principles of Microsoft Dynamics 365 ERP applications, including how they support financial management, procurement and sourcing, inventory and warehouse operations, production control, and retail management. Candidates are expected to understand how these solutions interconnect and provide visibility and control across different departments. For example, Dynamics 365 Finance handles budgeting and accounting, while Supply Chain Management focuses on logistics and inventory. Understanding the role each application plays within a complete ERP solution is essential to passing the MB-920.\nAnother crucial area of MB-920 is learning how Microsoft’s cloud-based ERP solutions integrate with other services like Microsoft Power Platform, Microsoft 365, and Azure. These integrations allow businesses to automate processes, gain insights using data analytics, and enhance productivity. MB-920 places emphasis on how ERP solutions work in real-world scenarios, such as streamlining order-to-cash and procure-to-pay cycles, optimizing supply chains, and managing financial operations with real-time reporting capabilities.\nThe certification exam is structured to assess theoretical understanding rather than deep technical implementation. It tests a candidate’s ability to recognize Dynamics 365 ERP application functionalities and how they align with standard business practices. This makes MB-920 a great entry point for individuals who are new to Dynamics 365 or those planning to specialize in functional consulting roles related to finance, operations, or retail solutions.\nBy earning the MB-920 certification, individuals demonstrate their commitment to learning Microsoft business applications and their ability to support ERP transformations in organizations. It also lays the groundwork for further certifications such as MB-300 (core finance and operations) or application-specific exams like MB-310 (Finance) and MB-330 (Supply Chain Management). As organizations increasingly adopt cloud-based ERP systems, professionals with this foundational knowledge become valuable contributors to digital transformation initiatives.\nIn summary, the MB-920 exam serves as a stepping stone into the world of Microsoft Dynamics 365 ERP applications. It provides learners with the conceptual framework to understand how modern ERP systems drive business efficiency and agility. Whether you're a business user looking to optimize processes or a new consultant preparing for implementation projects, MB-920 offers the knowledge foundation needed to work confidently with Microsoft’s ERP ecosystem.",

      "description": "Getting ready for the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) exam?\nThese are hands-on practice exams to help you prepare and test your skills.\n\n\nThese practice tests cover all major CKS domains, including:\n\n\nCluster Setup (15%)\nCluster Hardening (15%)\nSystem Hardening (10%)\nMinimize Microservice Vulnerabilities (20%)\nSupply Chain Security (20%)\nMonitoring, Logging and Runtime Security (20%)\n\n\nEvery question is written to feel like the real exam, helping you spot gaps in your knowledge and build confidence.\n\n\nThis set of exercises is for anyone who wants practical, no-fluff preparation. Each question comes with a detailed solution explaining why it's correct, references Kubernetes documentation, and points out common exam pitfalls. You practice, learn, and understand Kubernetes security at the same time.\nAll questions are original and more are added over time to stay up-to-date with the exam objectives. Think of this as your final check before the real CKS exam, a place to improve speed, accuracy, and confidence.\nSample topics include using Falco and Cilium for network policies to restrict pod-to-pod access, applying CIS benchmark recommendations, setting up TLS for Ingress and Istio mTLS, implementing role-based access control, enforcing Pod Security Standards, protecting nodes and workloads, managing secrets, and monitoring runtime security through audit logs, etc.\n\n\nNote: These tasks are not official CNCF/CKS exam content. They are community-inspired practice materials intended for personal learning and exam preparation.\n\n\nBy completing this course, you'll gain hands-on experience, deepen your understanding of Kubernetes security, and practice solving real exam-style tasks.\nThe CKS exam is challenging, but I passed both CKA and CKS by really focusing on the core concepts and practicing thoroughly. With the same approach, you can succeed too.\n\n\n===\nSAMPLE QUESTIONS:\nDescription:\nEnforce a prepared AppArmor profile on a specific worker node and deploy a Pod using it:\nApply the nginx-profile-2 AppArmor profile on the worker node node-01.\nEdit the Pod manifest to reference this profile.\nDeploy the Pod on node-01 and ensure the profile is applied correctly.\n---\nDescription:\nCreate a new Kubernetes user, approve its certificate, and assign namespace-specific permissions:\nCreate a user john and generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).\nApprove the CSR and retrieve the signed certificate.\nCreate a Role john-role in namespace john to allow list, get, create, and delete on pods and secrets.\nCreate a RoleBinding john-role-binding to attach the Role to user john.\nVerify permissions using kubectl auth can-i.\n---\nDescription:\nA Pod token-demo is running in the default namespace and uses the default mounted token.\nModify the default ServiceAccount to disable automatic token mounting (automountServiceAccountToken: false).\nEdit the Pod to:\nUse this ServiceAccount.\nMount a projected volume with the ServiceAccount token manually at /var/run/secrets/tokens/token.jwt.\n---",

      "description": "*** Part of the best selling course: CCNA Cyber Ops Tools: Sec Onion, Wireshark, and Kali Linux ***\nIt is estimated that there will be about 1.5 million unfilled jobs in cyber security by the year 2020. A more recent statistic increased this number for cyber security unfilled jobs to be 3.5 million by the year 2021. In addition, recent article highlights Cisco Systems intention to become a cyber security force. For these reasons, Cisco created the CCNA Cyber Ops certification, which can become one of the most certifications in demand in the near future. Furthermore, Cisco created a scholarship program for this certification, which emphasis its importance.\nIn this course you will learn about the tools that you can use for your study of the CCNA Cyber Ops certification and the current Cisco CyberOps Associate certification. Learning the theory side is important, but the hands on side is more important, since the main purpose of your study is to apply your knowledge in production, and since your hands on will enforce your theory knowledge. You can not teach someone how to drive a car by showing him or her how to do it, but you have to let him try and practice how to do that. Furthermore, showing you hands on labs and how to use tools without teaching you how to create these labs and install these tools, might not give you the ultimate benefit from your study . For this reason, I have created this course to teach you how to create your own home labs, and to understand the core usage and important features of the tools used in them. I believe in the saying: \"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime\". If you have access to online labs, such as that offered by Cisco through their scholarship, you still need to know how to create your own home labs to continue practicing and experimenting, which is what this course will help you to achieve. On the other hand, this course will prepare you to go through these online labs quickly, and with confidence, since you will be familiar with the tools used in them.  And not just online labs, but any other hands on Cyber Ops courses, like what I intend to publish in the near future.\nKali Linux is an advanced penetration testing Linux distribution used for penetration testing, ethical hacking and network security assessments. And penetration testing is the practice of safely testing a computer system, network or application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. And Black hat hackers use the same tools in Kali Linux, but we as the  pen-testers or white hat hackers will use them safely and with authorization from the organization we conduct testing for. So knowing how to use these tools included in Kali Linux will be very useful for us as security analysts.\nThis course include the following lectures:\nIntroduction to Kali Linux\nDownloading & Installing Kali Linux\nExploring Kali Linux\nWorking with the Metasploitable VM\nIntroduction to Nmap\nWorking with Nmap and Zenmap\nIntroduction to the Metasploit Framework\nWorking with the Metasploit Framework and Armitage\n\n\nI hope that you will join me in this course and start your Cyber security journey. Happy learning!",

But I can make sure I know something very clearly. So I would like to share some information to you guys, actually this course is my training courses in China, whole course has 2 parts, one is about \"what's robot\" ,what's service robot, one is about \"the intelligent performance \" on robots, now i directly use it and edited an English voice(English narration)  for it,and  it has English and Chinese subtitles both ,  I would like to give you inspirations that how to test the intelligence of robots ,no matter you are student or a worker in robotics field or someone one who is just interested in robots , I think it would be helpful. Thank you. now let's do it\n大家好，我是一名机器人工程师，这是我线下机器人培训课程中的一门课程，原来是中文的背景声音，目前更改为了英文的，字幕是中英文都有。整个课程主要是围绕“什么是机器人”？“什么是服务机器人”“机器人的智能性研究”来展开，你如果想进入机器人这个行业，这是很好的一个入门课程，后续会根据反馈情况开发一些标准解读或者机器人检测认证相关的课程。谢谢你的时间。\n1. First of all, we need to understand some basic conditions of service robots. Here I would like to ask you a question, \"What is a robot?\" Everyone must have their own answer. In fact, it is defined in our standard GBT12643-2013 Robot and Robot Equipment Vocabulary, \"A robot is capable of Two or more programmable axes, and some degree of autonomy, an actuator that can move within its environment to perform the intended task\", this definition has two emphasis, namely axes and autonomous capabilities, axes That is, the direction line that the robot moves in a straight line or a rotary manner.\n2. first I have a question ,what’s intelligence? In the relevant literature and dictionaries, the definition of intelligence is as follows: Intelligence, that is, the ability to have human or human-like intelligence characteristics, and human or human-like intelligence characteristics is in the process of achieving a purpose, always experience a Multiple processes or process cycles of perception, decision-making, and execution, and through continuous learning, improve one's ability to achieve goals and the efficiency and effect of achieving goals. There is a key point here, the characteristics of human-like intelligence, so we can think about whether we can regard a robot as a human, and use the human benchmark to evaluate its intelligence? Well, the answer is yes. Have you ever heard of the Turing test scientific research experiment? The experiment was invented by Alan Mathison Turing, the father of artificial intelligence. As shown in the figure, let the computer pretend to be a person as the answerer A. If there are more than 30% of the questioners mistakenly thought that the person who was speaking to him/her was our respondent B, not the computer respondent A, then this computer, the respondent A, passed the test and was considered to have human intelligence. Therefore, the method of using human wisdom to judge whether a robot has human-like intelligence works, but there is another question, how do people make scientific judgments?",

      "description": "STEM refers to the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. As the pace of technology accelerates, the public and private sectors look to the STEM workforce to build innovations that will power society now and into the future.Footnote1\nCovering a broad range of disciplines, topics in STEM vary significantly. STEM encompasses everything from biological and physical sciences to computer programming and mechanical engineering. These disciplines may require more vigorous coursework than other educational paths. But pursuing education in STEM subjects can position learners to compete for the jobs of tomorrow and learn valuable, transferable skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, and teamwork. STEM programs can offer an interdisciplinary, hands-on approach to solving problems, making for an immersive and engaging learning experience.\nLearn about many different STEM topics, with edX’s catalog of STEM programs, trainings, and courses open to learners of all levels.\nMany educational institutions emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of STEM topics and their real-world applications. Instead of teaching an individual discipline like chemistry or computer science in a vacuum, course instructors may now focus on providing a comprehensive foundation of STEM knowledge and integrating that knowledge with relevant technology. This helps to effectively breaking down the barriers that once existed between certain scientific or mathematical disciplines.Footnote2\nBecause STEM covers a variety of subjects, many learners still choose to specialize in a particular area. For instance, pursuing a degree in engineering can prepare learners with advanced STEM skills that they could then apply to a related subdiscipline, such as aeronautics or electronics.\nThere’s a great deal of crossover between individual courses, too. Foundational mathematics courses, for example, may dive into the problem-solving skills that serve as the basis for further scientific inquiry in many other STEM fields, while technology courses may include lessons in computer engineering. edX offers a variety of STEM courses and learning options created for learners of diverse backgrounds, abilities, and career paths.\nIf you’re planning to teach STEM subjects and want to further your skills as a STEM teacher, you may find it helpful to take a course designed to introduce fundamental STEM principles into K-12 and post-secondary education curricula and classrooms.",
