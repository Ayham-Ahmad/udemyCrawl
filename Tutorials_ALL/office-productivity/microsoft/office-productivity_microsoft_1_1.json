      "description": "Master Data Visualization Using Microsoft Excel\nWhether you've just started working in Excel or you've been using it forever, chances are you've heard about data visualization and understand how important is. More than that, you've probably made a few charts you were proud of.\nI was there, too. I could make any basic Excel chart my boss asked for. But I knew my charts - and many of those that I saw presented - did a poor job communicating data. Looking back, I think I was being asked to make charts just so we would have more to present.\nSound familiar? I've been where you are.\nSo I wanted to create a data visualization course for the business analysts who work with a lot of data and use Microsoft Excel regularly within their workflows. Chances are - you can already create a bar chart, a pie chart, and more. If that's you, read on.\nBecause I think a course for people like us has been missing. So I decided to distill everything I knew into a course that shows:\nThe important research behind which charts show the best information.\n\n\nThat way you're always communicating the best results. And when your boss challenges you, you can point to the research. (Just point him or her to the module on why Pie Charts are the worst!)\n\n\nHow to create advanced charts not included in Excel.\n\n\nMost business problems can't be captured in Excel's native chart library. Do you know how to create Bullet Charts? Charts with multiple banding? This course will show you how.\n\n\nHow to create charts for analysis and how to create charts to tell a story.\n\n\nIn this course, we'll talk about the difference between data graphics and info graphics. The former is for investigation, the latter for narration. You won't find this content elsewhere - I know, because I came up with it organically while working as a management consultant.\n\n\nHow to layout your charts and info graphics when you deliver them to executives.\n\n\nI'll introduce you to the camera tool, one of Excel's most powerful features. You'll see how it will allow you to drag-and-drop a chart, much like in Power BI.\n\n\nLabs and Quizzes\n\n\nIt's not enough to learn this information. You need to apply. I have created labs and quizzes based on the content. Take the quizzes to reinforce your knowledge. Complete the labs and then use them immediately in your own work.\n\n\nNo VBA or Macros\n\n\nI love VBA and Macros too but they're way over deployed. In many cases, the advanced chart you're thinking of making doesn't need lines and lines of code. I'll show you how quickly.\nHere's what you can look forward to in this course:\nData visualization principles including closure, proximity, common group and preattentive attributes\nTheory and practice for why data visualization is so important\nWhy 3d charts cause issues when communicating data\nProblems pie charts present to the audience\nHow to create charts with graded banding in Excel\nHow to create Bullet Charts in Excel\nHow to create Progress Meter Charts in Excel\nHow to create Waffle Charts in Excel\nMicrosoft Excel's camera tool\nResources to help you continue your learning\nLike you, I work in the trenches, hustling to solve every new data challenge that comes my way. I wanted to create a course for people like me to learn from. If you want to stand out in the crowd and take your Excel and data skills to a whole new level, then you're the person I created this course for.\nSee you there,\nJordan",

      "description": "The course explained in one sentence:\nLearn to use ChatGPT and write correct prompts to generate content for your PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Apple Keynote presentations.\n\n\nWhy ChatGPT + PowerPoint?\nChatGPT - Researching the topic is the most tedious part of creating or preparing for a presentation. By using Chat GPT to research,  explore, learn, and generate content you are streamlining your workflow. It makes you more efficient and gives you more time to design and think of how to present the content.\nPowerPoint - We will be using it as our design software here. Microsoft PowerPoint is still the leading presentation software that allows you to craft beautiful and trendy designs. With my guidance, you will craft a powerful, good-looking PPT presentation live as we go through the content. You will learn interesting power point tips and tricks while working through the course.\n\n\nWhat will I learn?\nChatGPT - Writing prompts in Chat GPT that result in usable content for presentations and slides\nPrompt Engineering - we will learn effective prompt creation, how to modify and re-iterate prompts for great results\nPowerPoint Presentation creation - Master PowerPoint along the way. We will create a complete and ready-to-use PowerPoint presentation with the content we have generated with our AI tool.\n\n\nI divided the content into a few stages for natural progression. We will learn and implement everything gradually throughout the lectures. We will first learn concepts about ChatGPT, talking with AI and generating results, and then bring that to life inside of PowerPoint by creating a high-quality presentation. Creating a PPT presentation is always the bread & butter in my MS PowerPoint courses and with smart ChatGPT usage it can be quick and entertaining.\n\n\nAre there resources?\nYes, I have prepared unique resources for this course, mainly two things\nThe PowerPoint presentation (so you can work on my template if you wish)\nPrompting instructions (This is to recap everything I'm teaching about writing prompts during this course)\n\n\nHow can I check your credentials and the quality of your course?\nYou are most welcome to watch the promo video and free preview lectures of either this or any of my other courses! I especially encourage you to watch any of my MS PowerPoint content to make sure I'm the right teacher for you. If you like what you see, like my editing (like showcasing shortcuts, zooming in, using arrows and rectangles, using spotlights to highlight important things, my humor) you are very welcome to join. PPT can be a powerful software if you use it properly, let me show you how. No matter if you know just a bit or want to get advanced PowerPoint knowledge this course pushes you in that direction.\n\n\nThere is a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you risk nothing in case push comes to shove!\n\n\nI hope I got you a little fired up and excited.\nEnroll now and we see each other inside!",

I am sure everyone using Excel will have to upgrade their knowledge soon. Thanks for the enlightening journey.” Dheeraj\n\n\n★★★★★ “Very well organized and implemented course. It was easy to follow along yet challenging enough to learn. As an example, I had never used the CHOOSE function which was your solution in one of the advanced challenges. Still wanting to try and figure out the solution on my own (without seeing yours first), I tried watching a video from another YouTube instructor on that specific function. Unfortunately, I didn't really get it until I watched your instruction. The way you break down the components of a complex formula, showing various examples of how they work, before building up to the complete solution is a great method of teaching. Your advice for spilling component results next to the source data is an excellent method for troubleshooting formula problems...if I could only get the hang of it and remember to do it!” Stephanie\n\n\n★★★★★ “I give you a big 10 for the explanation of this course, I learned a lot from it.” Jos\n\n\nThere's a 100% money back guarantee.

He's so very clear with each tiny thing he's teaching you. He sounds quite like a gentle and patient friend or mentor walking you through step by step. He also repeats things (not monotonously) which helps you retain what you're learning. When I first registered for this course, I thought 'oh my goodness, what have I done'... when you look at the 'your progress' dropdown at the upper right corner of your dashboard and see that you're on #21 of 518(!), it can seem a bit intimidating. But, no -- I think with this particular instructor's gift of friendly teaching, we'll all do fantastically well!\"\n- Celine Barton",

Everybody wants to learn Excel Macros and Excel VBA. They can make Excel work like magic. But most Excel users never use them. Others spend several days on a multi-hour course or working through a 1000-page book, getting overwhelmed with information. So why waste a great deal of time learning things you may never use?\nIn this course, my goal is to help you learn ways to create Excel Macros that won’t burst your brain. Also to convey the main principles of VBA language and allow beginners, taking their first steps, to learn without requiring individual training.\n\n\nContent and overview\nA macro is a sequence of instructions that automates some aspects of Excel so that you can work more efficiently and with fewer Errors. Macros are written in VBA, which stands for Visual Basic for Applications, which is a programming language developed by Microsoft.\nIf you think Excel VBA programmers are smarter or more gifted than you, then you’re mistaken. Yes, macros can be intimidating, and yes, programming is a huge topic. If you saw a course on Excel programming with hundreds of lectures, would you really watch all of them?\nBut wait a minute…\nWhat about people who may not have a programming background but aspire to reap the utmost from the program? Are there any programming principles and well-guarded secrets that you can learn and use to create any Macros you want?\n\n\nIn this course, you will find several short, to-the-point lectures covering Excel Macros and VBA entertaining and accessible to non-techies. The goal is not to make you a star Excel programmer. If you want to be that, go for it! But I’ll give you some best practices and make this course extremely practical. After all, you are not a programmer, you just need to write an Excel Macro to help you get your work done.\n\n\nWhy is this course different?\nIt's super practical. Free downloadable Excel working files are included to allow you to follow along using the same material I use throughout the lectures. You can download all of them.\nIt's comprehensive and fast. Microsoft Excel Macros and VBA are complex, that's why the course is broken down into bite-sized pieces\nI update the Excel class monthly with new lectures!\nIt has a Homework-Quiz after the section so to prove that you have learned the material.\nYou will learn the most current version of Microsoft Excel (2019), but the concepts are compatible with Excel 2007, Excel 2010, Excel 2013, and Excel 2016\nCompatible with Microsoft Office for Macintosh\n\n\nAre you looking to learn practical Macro and VBA techniques you can put to use instantly? If so, then this is the course for you. It’s entirely project-based and it’s full of examples that are fully explained and easy to understand. It has been recorded with the brand new Excel 2019 in full HD 1080p. If you get stacked don’t worry. I have fast and full support through the discussion board. And if you don’t like the course simply return it. There is a 30-day money back guarantee. At the end of this Microsoft Excel class you will be given a Certificate of Completion\nWhat are you waiting for? Enroll now! (it is 100% no risk deal)",

      "description": "If you're a business professional, who uses (or will be using Microsoft Excel) on a daily basis, this is the course for you!\nThe Course will Help You Build a Strong Foundation in Excel & Solve Complex Problems Fast - This is How:\nUse my top 10 tips to save time\nLearn the top 10 formulas for quick and dynamic analysis\nThis course includes a detailed downloadable PDF of the top 10 Tips & Formulas - together over 90 pages! Now you can READ, WATCH or do BOTH!\n\nThe top 10 will increase your awareness of the most useful Excel features to work faster and smarter. Only when you know the extent and possibilities Excel offers you, only then are you able to handle any type of analysis with the best method.\n\nIn Their Own Words:\nCarlo says: \"Excellent course featuring loads of easily understood content. It helped me become very competent and comfortable with pivot tables along with a host of other functionality. It's easily understood and also easy to follow. Instructor speaks clearly and explains things well, very helpful so the information is easily retained.\"\n\nSahar says: \"Very very helpful tips. Anyone who uses Excel should learns these to let them get more benefits of the embedded functionalities.\"\nSteven says: \"Well explained, excellent material and topics. Definitely very helpful for my everyday work.\"\nAdvanced Excel skills are highly relevant in business. No matter which role you’re currently in or you’re planning to take on. Whether you’ll be in Finance, consulting, IT, in project management, your advanced Excel skills will set you apart from the competition.\n\nWhat is the difference between an Advanced Excel and Average Excel user?\nAn advanced Microsoft Excel user is aware of the tools and features available and can apply the right tools for the right task, instead of relying on their go-to tools and making them work for every situation.  Advanced Excel users, always find the optimal solution for every task, and they find it fast!\n\nWhat differentiates this Microsoft Excel course from the others?\nThe reason I created this specific Advanced Excel course, is because there are many advanced Excel users who are unaware of key features & formulas in Excel. I understand that when you take an Excel training it can be so broad, and a lot of courses cover too many topics. It’s easy to get lost. You might also not immediately appreciate why some features are useful and how you can practically apply them. We are creatures of habit and it’s difficult to get our head around learning new techniques. As a result you might be missing out on some features that can majorly simplify the way you use Excel.\nDifferentiation factor #1\nFocus - The top 10 brings focus to the key Excel features which will provide you with a solid & a strong foundation in Excel.\nDifferentiation factor #2\n\nLearn by doing - This Advanced Microsoft Excel course is well structured and organized. You can download my Excel Demo workbook which I use to demonstrate each feature and practice along with me. You can then do an exercise from the Excel Exercise workbook to test your knowledge. Real learning happens when you attempt to solve problems on your own. Answers are provided, but do ask any questions if you get stuck. Your questions will always be answered.\nDifferentiation factor #3\n\nEngaging - I have made every attempt to keep the course interesting and engaging by mixing talking head explanations with screencast demos. Each course is split by topic & feature. This allows you to easily pick what you want to learn now or review later.\nSummary\nMy main goal in this training is to increase your awareness of the top tools and formulas in Excel to help you solve complex problems. Users are not aware of what they don’t know. Only when you know the extent and possibilities Excel offers you, only then are you able to handle any type of analysis with the best method.\n\nBecoming advanced in Excel takes practice, readiness to learn new methods and willingness to apply these to practical cases. Take this course to get a head start!",

      "description": "This course builds upon the skills learned in the first course in this series DAX Power Pivot – 10 Easy Steps for Beginners.\nYou have already gotten your hands dirty with Power Pivot and seen how awesome it is. Now you are ready to take your skills to the next level by delving deeper and acquiring a more thorough understanding of how “Disconnected” or “Parameter” tables can be utilised to gain additional insights in your data models.\nThe first part of the course addresses Microsoft’s change to the DAX engine that now makes editing queries a challenge if you aren’t an expert in SQL. Therefore, you learn to use Get & Transform to import data and in doing so, reduce the size of your data model file size considerably.\nYou will draw upon your beginner DAX skills to delve deeper into the real meaning behind “Initial Filter Context”, “Filter Context” and “Context Transition” with explanations, diagrams, examples and practice exercises.\nTo leverage the capabilities of “Disconnected” tables, I introduce you to the concept of thresholds, cut-offs and banding. This really does open the door to a wealth of possibilities and you’ll learn some useful techniques to gain some powerful new insights along the way.\nThroughout the course, you are building your skills and understanding – taking you to the next level at each Step – 1-10.\nI’ll have a couple of surprises for you along the way – not only to boost your brownie-points at work but for your own piece of mind around administration of your data models!\n\n\nI've included a BONUS section featuring 7 Power Query exercises that tackle what to do with typical messy data table layouts that require manipulation even before you start! A GREAT start to getting to grips with the magic that is Power Query!\nHere's what others said about the course:\n“Gilly. Did it again with the Addition of Dax PowerPivot-10 easy steps for intermediate course. This intermediate Course adds more formulas and Dax functions and even disconnected slicers and cube formulas to add your learning base and continues to build off the previous two courses. Gilly is a brilliant teacher who clearly has an in-depth understanding of how power pivot works. She can break it down and simplify Dax so you know how functions works and understand how to use it in your day-to-day excel work. If you follow along and do the exercises when you’re done with a lesson you fully understand how to complete and use the Dax formulas in your data work. If you want to understand and learn Dax, Gilly courses are what you want to start with. I recommend Gilly courses, you will be pleased with your results afterwards. Well done Gilly. Thanks”\n- SD\n\"OUTSTANDING COURSE Love the exercises, really enforces the instruction Learning so much, will go over the course again reinforce learning Everything is explained in easy to understand terms\"\n- JM\n“A lovely paced course with the different elements nicely segmented and of a good length. Certainly liked the extra surprise of Cubes. Will aid in displaying data that does not fit well with the confines of a pivot table. Cheers Gilly!”\n- GB\n“Do Love the way you teach. Hope to learn more from you for advanced DAX course with real world case studies. Bravo!”\n- HA\n“Trainer explains concepts really well without using too much tech talk. The many examples support the good understanding of the subjects. The speed is ok for advanced users but too fast if you did not follow the basic course. Course is complete and every important subject is explained.”\n- R\n“Gilly does a great job of explaining complex concepts and makes her points using thought-provoking analogies. Excellent instructor!”\n- SA\n“The course continued to build on the 10 Easy steps for Beginners. Detailed Instructions and real-world examples. Deep dive into advanced Power Pivot Formulas.”\n- CJ\nWhat you will learn in this course:\nGet & Transform – building the Data Model\nDAX Iterators & Aggregator Functions\nInitial Filter Context\nFilter Context\nContext Transition\nVALUES()\nALL(), ALLSELECTED() & ALLEXCEPT()\nIF() & HASONEVALUE()\nDisconnected/Parameter Tables\nCreating/Adding Disconnected tables\n“Harvester” Measures\nConversion Measures\nThresholds/Cut-offs\nBanding\nKPI’s\nI provide examples that we work through together. Then it’s over to you with practice exercises for you to help embed and consolidate your skills. I always provide video solutions – so, you’re never on your own.\nPower Pivot is the perfect tool for those working in finance, statistics, project, business and market analysis or any data reporting role who have a need to create and produce Business Intelligence style dashboard and Insight reports.\nI have used Excel 2016 to demonstrate this fantastic tool but you can follow along in Excel 2010 & 2013 - I'll do my best to point out the differences. If you have any questions about the course, feel free to message me here or check out the FREE preview lectures to learn more.\n\nThanks for taking the time to check out my course.

All questions in my course are addressed and we work with students together to find solutions for their problems or at least the best possible ones out there :) Learn Microsoft PowerPoint with me and don't look back!\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ):\nQ: I'm a total beginner in PowerPoint, is this course right for me?\nThis course will teach you all the basics and advanced tools, but it's not PowerPoint 101 for beginners. I mention basic tools and techniques, but I assume you are computer savvy and know how to find your way around PowerPoint already. BUT! If you aren't then I have prepared a completely FREE PowerPoint basics course, which will equip you with the knowledge necessary to take this one. It's available on my profile under free courses. It's called PowerPoint for Beginners - Program & Animation Basics FREE\nQ: I'm enrolled in your PowerPoint Masterclass - Presentation Design & Animation course. Should I get this one or is the other one enough? Which one is better?\nGood Question! Both courses are top PowerPoint courses that teach you the knowledge and tools to create outstanding presentations, animations, and templates. They are just two different versions that use different slides and unique content respectively. The benefit of that is you can follow a different design path on each course. Students who finished the first master's course were asking me for more, and I'm happy to provide more if there is demand for it. If you already feel super comfortable with PowerPoint, one course is enough. But if you seek even more design ideas and slides, and if you like my content and the way I teach, you won't go wrong by taking both courses. Each of those two courses has several unique sections that allow them to expand their knowledge in their way.\nQ: I've been using PowerPoint for 15+ years and think I know it already. Will I learn anything new?\nI'm an experienced PowerPoint instructor with over 250 YouTube tutorials and more than 10 published PowerPoint courses and series. Over the past few years, I have learned from both beginner and advanced students which areas to address to best influence your workflow in a positive and impactful way. My courses help you to boost your efficiency, using shortcuts and on-trend designs to help you reach a modern, top-level standard of quality. If you need something that is not already in the course, you can always ask me about topics to add to courses that interest you.\nQ: I'm still not sure if I want to invest in this course. I don't know if I want to focus on design or animation. Is there any fall-back plan?\nOf course! First, you should watch the promo videos and watch the free preview lessons. They will give you a good understanding of the course content, pace, and what to expect from taking the course. Apart from that, you have Udemy’s 30-day Money Back Guarantee with no questions asked!\n\n\nStop waiting days to get your presentation back from a designer or from your co-workers. Instead, take your presentation into your own hands with this PowerPoint 2016, PowerPoint 2019, and PowerPoint 365 course. Don't wait to sign up. ENROLL NOW!",

You can write macros which perform repetitive tasks saving your organisation, or your clients, time and money.\nWord users learn VBA macro programming for a number of reasons: some people are looking to enhance their career prospects; some are looking to save themselves time; others are aiming to save their company money and increase productivity.\nPerhaps you are an advanced Microsoft Word user looking to venture beyond the use of the macro recorder.\nPerhaps you are a Microsoft Office specialist looking to enhance your skills portfolio and make yourself truly indispensable in the workplace.\nPerhaps you have already learned how to automate Microsoft Excel using VBA and you are now looking to do the same with Microsoft Word.\nWhatever your reasons for wanting to learn to write Word VBA macros, this course will equip you with everything you need to get started and feel confident about writing your own Word VBA code.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nSarahjane:\n\" I had no previous training on Word VBA coding but had used Word VBA code to create a complex Userform & document; primarily by copying and pasting from example code found on the internet - this was very time consuming and I found it almost impossible to customise and debug my code because I didn't really understand how the code worked. This course has broken down the concepts of code and syntax and shown me how to create useful and efficient interactions between the various code parts of my project - I can now see much better ways of structuring and coding my Userform & document and will be rewriting the majority of it... \"\n_______________________________________________________________________________",

      "description": "You’ll learn the essentials of Excel in just 2 hours.\nHaving worked at Microsoft and on Excel, we focus on the core functionality that most people use to make you productive as quickly as possible vs. digging into every single feature available. This way, you’ll have a strong foundation to start getting insights from your data.\nBuild a strong foundation\nWe start with the absolute basics. When you first open Excel, it may appear somewhat intimidating with so many different buttons and controls. It may even feel like the cockpit of a jet plane. To demystify Excel, we begin by walking through the interface and covering how you can easily get back to the controls that you use most often.\nNext, we delve into how you can enter data efficiently and format it so that it looks good. We then save the workbook in a way that lets us collaborate with others in real time and gives us access to something called version history so you can easily jump back to earlier versions.\nFormulas and functions made easy\nOnce we save our workbook, you’ll learn all about formulas and functions to help you answer those critical business questions. Here too we cover the basics, like how to use the status bar for simple metrics, how to enter a formula by referencing cells, and how to reference cells relatively, absolutely, or with naming.\nFrom there, we move on to some of the most used Excel functions, like SUM, MAX, MIN, COUNT, AVERAGE, VLOOKUP, and XLOOKUP. You’ll understand how functions work and how to make sense of other functions not covered in this course, as there are over 500 functions in Excel.\nVisualize your data with charts\nWe then launch into how to visualize your data using charts and conditional formatting. Charts make it easy to see trends and anomalies in your data that you might otherwise miss by just looking at your data.\nExplore your data with sorting, filtering, and pivot tables\nSorting and filtering come next, which lets you manipulate how to view your data. You’ll also discover how pivot tables work and how you can analyze data simply by dragging and dropping fields. With the magic of pivot tables, you don’t even need to enter in formulas or functions to quickly summarize your data.\nFocus on just what matters\nThroughout this course, you’ll learn quick shortcuts to make you more efficient, like how you can flash fill to separate or merge columns, how to split panes to view far away rows at the same time, and even how to print just what you need.\nBy the end of this course, you'll gain a strong foundation in Excel & you’ll be well on your way to understanding the story behind your data. Join me, your host, to master the essentials of Excel.",

NO OTHER book, tutorial or course offers these unique set, anywhere on the internet.\nBefore you read further, see what my students are saying about my Microsoft Project courses:\nFrom an esteemed learner: \"I'm a 7-year veteran of the videogame industry and have spent most  professional career working on agile/scrum/kanban development teams.  This course has been a great, cost-effective way for me to broaden my  project management toolbox to include traditional waterfall scheduling  techniques and resource allocation modelling. I will be using these  skills to help plan multi-million dollar development efforts on small to  medium (50-500 person) development teams.\"\n\n\n\"This was probably one of the best online courses I have taken so far, on any subject. I did not have any previous knowledge on MS Project before I started taking the course and today I feel very confident about it.\" - another esteemed learner\n\n\n\"Lecturer not only provides excellent teaching skills, but also provides  so much insight that sometimes you feel he was actually  involved in MS  Project's development itself. Samples, case introductions and other material is  well-prepared and perfectly executed in a systematic order, where pupil  is encouraged to experiment further and work on provided sample msp  files. I highly recommend this to anyone using the software or prepare  for a PMP or similar certificate.\" - review from an esteemed learner\n\n\n\"Full marks - met and exceeded expectation. Gladly recommend to anyone grappling MS Project. The PDUs are a great bonus too...\" - Leila Barton\n\n\"One of the best course ANYWHERE.... Thanks instructor for shaping our career\" - by Taha Syed\n\nIMPORTANT: \"How to download Microsoft Project\" is answered later below in FAQ section. Keep reading.\n--------------\nMicrosoft Project is a beast of a software application - almost 30 years of history! Released mid-1980's on MS-DOS.  So, it has every imaginable feature built into it by now - and then even some more.\nMy promise to you: By the end of this course - you will be incredibly comfortable with Microsoft Project - and you will be able to use Project like a BOSS. You will be able to create, manage and track world class schedules - with complex requirements of resources,  allocations, budgets, reporting and tracking - all the way to project completion!!!\n--------------\nDo you want to Master the World's Most Popular Project Management tool?

A complete course is a detailed to perfection which i did not came  across many courses. Srikanth as a tutor/ trainer is very good. Highly  Recommended !!!!!\" - by Hasib Patel\n--------------\nLearn Microsoft Project to create INCREDIBLY POWERFUL project schedules.\nLearn to Use Project in EVERY STAGE of project management - Initiation, Planning, Execution & Control - and finally Closing.\nIdentify REAL LIFE problems - scheduling, costing, resourcing, work allocations!\nUse DYNAMIC REPORTS - powerful, automated, DYNAMIC reports and dashboards\nSave Hundreds of hours and Thousands of dollars - by using resources OPTIMALLY, identifying, preventing and mitigating RISKS\nLearn to Resolve the #1 PROBLEM that Project Managers face with Schedule Management - Resource Over Allocations.  8+ techniques shown in this course - Push dates - Adding Delays, Increase working hours, Balance allocations, Leveling, Work Contours, Use Team Planner view, Use \"Assign Resources\" feature, Splitting Tasks\nDe-mystify the 100s of features in Microsoft Project - Views, Tables, Charts, Formatting, Multiple detail windows etc.\nFrom another learner:\n\"Thanks for this superb course - I needed to get fully hands on with MS Project fast - and this course has me up and running like nothing else.  Have become quite proficient and have others in the office asking my  help. Highly recommend this course.\" - by Chia Lin\n\n\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\nA step-by-step HD video tutorial starting from the absolute basics - all the way to advanced EXPERT level topics.\nVideo lectures, extensive resources, downloadable exercise Project files, PDFs etc - over 120 separate lessons, 9+ hours of instruction\nTEN COMPLETE EXERCISES - every one has different scenarios, objective and overview files, WBS explained.\nEVEN MORE: exercise files have BEGIN and FINISH versions - which allows you to REPLICATE EXACTLY what is shown in the lecture.\nEVERY concept is LOADED with tips, tricks, pitfalls from years of hands-on experience\nPractice Assignments in exercises, quizzes to self-test your knowledge\n--------------\nImportant information before you enroll:\n\n--how to download ms project ------------------\nMicrosoft only allows download through Office 365 portal, which requires a valid registration.\n\nAll the steps to install are on the official Microsoft site, and should be googled for.  URLs and Microsoft offerings are changing on a high frequency as I write this in 2020.\n\nThe whole process is unfortunately complex. You should register first, then log into the Office portal and finally download and install Project.\n\nFAQ: Can I do this course with MS Project XX?\n\nANY which version of MS Project you use, this course will be beneficial to you. I mainly use 2016 standalone (desktop) Project Professional for teaching, but occasionally show the latest UI (only when required). This course teaches logic and techniques universal to all major versions of Project in the market today. There will be about ~10% variation in the UI and minor tweaks, but all the critical logic and techniques will be the same.\n\nFAQ: How to get help with installation?\n\nIf your office provides Project for you, then seek it from your System Administrator. Else, if you run into issues with the installation, you should seek the help of Microsoft's excellent and live help support system from within the Office portal. And this help is only available through the steps provided in Microsoft's link above. As far as I am aware, this is the only secure and recommended way to get a trial version.\n--end of \"how to download ms project\"------------------\n\n\nIn case you find the course useless for your career, don't forget you are covered by a 30 day money back guarantee, full refund, no questions asked!\nOnce enrolled, you have unlimited, lifetime access to the course!\nYou will have instant and free access to any updates I'll add to the course.\nCheck out the curriculum and the FREE lectures for a course preview\n\"Excellent course. A well-chosen level of information: from the basic (but not obvious) to  advanced (but without a huge amount of details, which are not possibly  to remember). Very good way of communication. No inconveniences often encountered in  other courses like the useless movements of the mouse, clicking on  everything what’s possible, repeating sentences several times etc...Thank you very much.\" - by Mr. P.

It's about featuring some of the most powerful and effective tools & techniques used by data analytics professionals and Excel pros, and sharing them through crystal clear demos and unique, real-world case studies.\n\n\nUnlike most Excel courses, this one is non-linear and constantly evolving. This means that you can jump to different sections or individual lectures freely, and explore brand new Excel tips added on a regular basis.  Each video is designed to be an independent and self-contained Excel demo, to help you learn these tools and techniques in quick, bite-sized lessons.\n\n\nI've also included a downloadable Excel workbook and solution file containing all Excel demos and datasets covered in the course, ranked by difficulty (1-5 stars), organized by category, and hyperlinked for quick and easy access.\n\n\nThe Excel tips and techniques covered in this course fall into six core categories:\n\n\nExcel Productivity Tips (navigation, flash fill, cell protection, advanced sorting & filtering, etc.)\nExcel Formatting Tips (freeze panes, row/column grouping, advanced custom formats, etc.)\nExcel Formula Tips (formula auditing tools, fuzzy lookups, detecting duplicates, randomization, etc.)\nExcel Data Visualization Tips (sparklines, filled maps, custom templates, Excel form controls, etc.)\nExcel Pivot Table Tips (slicers & timelines, custom layouts, value calculations, etc.)\nExcel Analytics Tips (outlier detection, monte carlo simulation, forecasting, CUBE functions, etc.)\n\n\nWhile the level of difficulty varies considerably, the Excel demos generally start simple and become progressively more complex within each section. There are no strict prerequisites for this course, but keep in mind that some demos may be challenging without a strong foundational knowledge of the underlying Excel concepts (like Excel Pivot Tables or formulas, for example).\n\n\nIt's time to start working smarter, not harder. If you're looking to maximize your efficiency, supercharge your productivity, and become an absolute Excel POWER USER, this is the course for you.\n\n\nJoin today and get immediate, lifetime access to the following:\n10+ hours of high-quality video\nDownloadable PDF ebook\nExcel project files & solutions\nExpert-support and Q&A forum\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\n\nHappy learning!\n-Chris (Founder, Maven Analytics)\n\n\nNOTE: Most Excel demos are compatible with Excel 2007, Excel 2010, Excel 2013, Excel 2016, Excel 2019 or Office 365 (some may be unavailable in Excel for Mac or Excel Online)\n\n\n__________\nLooking for our full course library?

      "description": "WHAT’S YOUR STORY?\nAre you a business professional needing to up-skill?\nAre you struggling to get a pay-rise and/or promotion?\nAre you a recent graduate with an empty looking resume and no job experience?\nHave you recently been laid off, fired or had a contract end?\nIf you answered 'yes' to any of the above then having “Expert Microsoft Office Skills” will get you closer to your goal of either landing your first job, a new job or progressing further in your current role. Here's why.\nThe job market has never been more volatile. Statistically, people are changing jobs more often now than they ever have before and that also means people are also losing jobs to newcomers who are far more skilled. So if you’re not up-skilling, you’re falling behind. It’s scary I know. I’ve experienced this myself.\nA study released by Microsoft and the IDC showed that among 14.6 million job postings, proficiency in Microsoft Office was ranked 2nd as the most desired skills by employers leading up to 2020. Microsoft Office proficiency ranked higher than Project Management skills, Sales Experience, Time Management, Analytical Skills, Interpersonal Skills and Work Ethics.\nThis is because we live in the digital age, meaning employers are looking for proficient data handlers who process data faster, are more data-organised and can communicate effectively via digital channels. These are skills everyone should have no matter the discipline because they are transferable skills. It makes you more adaptable and more valuable in the long-term. This brings us back to Microsoft Office. It is the oldest, most well-known, most affordable and most trusted data management tool available and hence everyone uses it. So to be noticed and taken seriously in your job or job application, proficiency in these programs is compulsory.\nONLINE TRAINING AND THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS\nOne of the most common problems with online learning content is that there is so much of it now and it’s difficult to know where to start or who to turn to. Many go the YouTube route and piece together videos from hundreds of tutorials from hundreds of tutors hoping to become an expert at the end of it all. This simply won’t happen and will just waste your time.\nMany take the route you’re about to take, they decide to enroll in an online training course. Many charge hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars for their courses which is simply unaffordable for university students, recent graduates, the unemployed or those looking for a career change. That is the reason why I have decided to keep this course as low as possible even though I’m offering substantially more content than most of my competitors here on Udemy.\nCOURSE DELIVERY STYLE\nI have been using Microsoft Office for over 20 years. I know the in’s and out’s and the simplest ways of doing things. My delivery philosophy is simple, if I can’t get a 6 year old to follow along and understand, than I’m not teaching correctly. I hate complicated language and so do you. Nobody likes trainers who focus on impressing rather than teaching and giving value to students. That is also why my lecture videos are as short as can be and divided into small sections for easy consumption. So you won’t get unnecessary chit chat or nonsense. I also assume that all my students are near-sighted and as such, I use a special software tool that allows me to draw on the screen to show exactly what I’m about to press as well as zoom in on small area’s so you don’t miss a thing.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL LEARN IN THIS COURSE\nPivot Tables are extremely powerful analytic tools available in Microsoft Excel. I shall share an example of it's use using my favorite lunch time chocolate snack, M&M's!\nIf you don't know what M&M's, firstly you haven't lived, and second, they're awesome chocolates that come in little bite size forms in a variety of colors. So imagine someone gives you 100 M&M's. It's your job to sort them by color, by type and by size. Obviously, this will take a long time as you have to sift through the M&M's one by one. However, imagine you had some magical tool that will instantly sort the M&M's however you like. By type....No worries! By colour....even easier!\nPivot Tables sort, group and summarize information similar to sorting M&M's by colour, size or shape. It's so easy to use and even easier to learn! In this course I'll teach you how to setup your data, how to create your first pivot, apply the different types of parameters using the pivot module, change data sources, refresh links and much more.\nSo what are you waiting for, sign up today!\n\n\nABOUT ME\nMember of the Udemy Council\nCo-Founded Paperclip Learning which teaches Microsoft Office\nOver 60,000 students and over 17,000 students for this course alone\nOver 130,000 enrollments\nOver 5,000 Positive Reviews and over 1,000 Reviews for this course\nOver 20 courses on Udemy\nTeaching is my passion and my creative outlet. I have been using the Microsoft Office package since I was a child and have been using it consistently throughout my life. My teaching experiences span from teaching primary school students, high school students, university graduates and business professionals. Professionally, I am trained in Aerospace Engineering, Database Design and Business Analytics.\nTESTIMONIALS\nYu Hui Jun Yu - The courses are simply amazing and I can learn them rapidly.

You can use the workbooks to practice what you learn and as a quick reference guide later on.\nThe course covers advanced features of Excel Dashboards, such as display and visualization principles for clear dashboard creation, using interactive controls to keep information informative and relevant, analyzing and automating information for a fully functional and complete dashboard. It also includes key considerations for distributing dashboards like password protections, locking and unlocking cells and protecting workbooks.\nUpon completion, students will have a variety of techniques and examples that can be applied to their own datasets. Students will be able to choose the right chart for their data, write easy to interpret reports, know which areas of the dashboard will get the most attention, animate charts using VBA, create interactive reports (so users can change views and filter information), among a host of other abilities taught in this course.",

This PDF document is a quick reference guide for whenever you need to create any of the charts in this training.\nIf you use Excel to generate reports and graphs, my hands-on Excel training provides you with an extremely advanced toolkit worth of knowledge that will take the design of your Excel charts, tables and reports to the next level. It will provide you with the best tricks to create dynamic charts. It will save you tons of time of manually updating your Excel graphs on a monthly basis. The visualization techniques introduce you to some unusual methods to handle and create charts which will enhance readability of your reports as well as impress your readers.\nLauren says: \"I wish she had more courses on advanced excel and access that are formatted like this one. She frames the content in ways that are applicable to my current job. I will be able to improve my current processes and project turnaround time as well as the look/feel of my tables and charts.\"\nJohn says: \"Leila does a fantastic job of walking you thru the process of creating various charts from scratch. From which formula to use to step by step chart creation. As a bonus you have actual exercises to practice your new skills, Absolutely one of the best instructional courses I have taken\"\nPaul says: \"Course is clear, to the point and very dynamic. Excellent!\"\nTypes of Excel Charts & Excel Graphs are presented:\nThe content and type of Excel charts presented are those that are typical to corporate reporting. Given my background in controlling, finance and project management, I designed the training with this audience in mind and the typical methods used to report, communicate, analyze, check and plan quantitative information.\nIf you are a student taking this course, rest assured that you are well equipped with advanced Excel visualization & chart design techniques to impress any employer who requires you to create graphs & reports in Excel.\nDemonstration will be done using Excel 2010, but all methods will be compatible with older as well as future versions of Excel unless otherwise stated in the video. My main focus is to introduce you to new “methods” of doing things which you can do no matter which Excel version you have.\nWhy this course is different to other Excel courses:\nI will not only demonstrate to you, but you will be able to follow each demonstration in your own Excel workbook. To make sure you have understood the techniques, you will complete an exercise at the end of each section (answers are included but you have to try on your own first).\n\nI place great value on keeping the training not only informative but also interesting. I know technical courses can be boring, especially when taken online. For this reason, I have mixed screen-casts together with talking head and flip chart type of demonstrations to get it as close to a classroom training style as possible.\nI have also been told by many students that I have the ability to explain complex topics in an easy to understand manner. I think you will benefit from that.\nThis course is split to 5 major parts:\nMethods to effectively communicate and present data trends – In this section I will also provide you with a crash course in best practices for table and graph design.\nBehind the scenes secrets of dynamic charts in Excel, where I introduce you to key functions you need to use to never manually update your Excel charts again –The functions you learn here go beyond graphs and charts. They enable you to do complex look ups in large data tables.\nTechniques that highlight Excel chart and table elements to direct the reader attention where it is needed most.\nNew ways to compare performance: as in Actual data versus Budget, forecasts and previous year\nEffective Chart Combinations that are pivotal to management reports\nThis is an Excel Advanced Chart Course BUT you will be surprised how simple the techniques are once you know them!",

It includes:\nOver 50 Microsoft Excel VBA & macro examples. These are solutions my clients have needed through the years. They are likely to be useful for you too.\nUsing the right VBA syntax is the most difficult part. An important topic which isn't covered enough in other VBA courses. In this course you understand why you write things in certain ways.\nCreate 3 Complete Excel VBA Tools. We go from idea to final product and cover each step.\nOver 100 pages of documentation (including useful code) so you can easily refer to it when in need.\nSimple explanations for complex concepts.\nHigh quality video and different delivery methods to keep things interesting.\nLots of ideas to automate your current tasks.\n\n\nLearn from Google or from this Course?\nI've been there! I first learnt VBA from Google.\nIt was truly a light-bulb moment, when I realized that Google has some answers - it could give me some of the code I was looking for - but there two things missing:\nThe WHY - why does the code work in one situation but not another.\nStructure - topic sequence, real-case examples, workbooks, documentation.\nDon’t waste your time\nDon't waste your time on poor quality videos and confusing explanations. In this Excel VBA course, complex topics are taught in a simple way by an instructor with 17 years of experience. The content has been carefully crafted and clearly organized. The videos are high quality and include animations to emphasize points. Most importantly you learn VBA by doing.\n\"I have already tried some VBA classes but so far I was never able to apply what I learnt to my own work. This course is different. I have already used some of the techniques Leila is teaching and applied it to my work files. I was able to reduce manual work for me and my colleagues by creating my own macros from scratch. Highly recommended!!!\" -- Randy Taylor\n\"Leila is the real deal... there are many VBA courses on Udemy (some of which I've taken) that merely demonstrate the functionalities. Leila explains the important foundation concepts and how the model is set up allowing you to truly create VBA code from thought rather than copying and pasting from various places. Her class is professionally constructed, with resources and content for each lecture, practice content for you to try things yourself and good Q&A opportunities to answer specific questions. Trust me, this is the course you want to take.\"  -- Justin Fazzio\n\nWhat you can look forward to in this course:\nUnderstand how to use the right syntax in VBA\nUseful Excel VBA codes you can directly use for your work\nUse the macro recorder for simpler tasks and improve the code\nWorking with the Visual Basic Editor\nDebugging tools and error handling methods\nDifferent ways to reference ranges and cells\nDifferent methods to loop\nHow to work with data types\nPivotTables in Excel using VBA\nImporting data from other files and exporting data to text files\nInteracting with other applications (Word, PowerPoint, Outlook)\nActiveX and Userforms to enhance the Excel interface\nBasically all the knowledge you need to automate tasks in Excel",

      "description": "Learn from more than 15 hours of relevant instructional video content, with the only complete beginner to expert guide on Microsoft SharePoint Online. SharePoint is the collaboration tool from Microsoft.\n\n\nEmpower your team with SharePoint. Manage content and create a centralized site for everyone in your organization to increase collaboration, engage your staff, and transform business processes.\n\n\nMore than 200K organizations and 190M people use SharePoint\n\n\nIntegrate SharePoint with other Office 365 apps. In this course, you will learn how to also integrate SharePoint with Power Automate to create customized sophisticated workflows, Power Apps to create customized forms, and more\n\n\nThis is the only complete guide to Microsoft SharePoint, from beginner to expert. This course is not only comprehensive (it covers everything you need to know right from the start / beginner level) but is also instructional in nature, meaning that as we learn new concepts, we are also integrating them in SharePoint. Don't just learn concepts, learn how to actually apply them. That also means that whether you are a beginner or expert, there's something for you in this course.\n\n\nThis course is structured in a way that helps you learn all the concepts. For each concept, we first cover it in theory and then apply it using a real life example. We also progressively learn more and more advanced concepts, so that you never feel overwhelmed and can achieve your goals. I also respond to questions, and have an interactive portion in the course!\n\n\nAgain, this is the complete guide to SharePoint - you won't ever need another course.\n\n\nWhat is SharePoint?\nSharePoint is a platform that organizations use to create internal websites (called team sites) that empower teamwork and improve collaboration. SharePoint allows organizations to seamlessly organize, share, manage, and access content and knowledge across their businesses. More than 200,000 companies use SharePoint and 190 million people use SharePoint. SharePoint is provided by Microsoft.\n\n\nWhat is SharePoint Online?\nThere are several different versions of SharePoint, which can be both on-prem or online. SharePoint online is the most popular, and is a cloud-based service which is hosted by Microsoft, and for businesses of all sizes. Note that all modules and features discussed in this course also apply to previous versions of SharePoint due to backwards compatibility. So, this course is also designed for users in SharePoint 2016 and SharePoint 2019 (SharePoint Server 2016 and SharePoint Server 2019)\n\n\nWhat are the main features of SharePoint?\nContent management - easily and securely share and manage content across your business, whether it's files, news, workflows, or data, with sophisticated metadata and organization\nSocial features - share ideas across your organization, collaborate, and make decisions with built-in social features like shared calendars and comments\nIntegration with Office 365 - integrate SharePoint with Office 365 apps to make the most of the cloud, with sophisticated linkages with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Power Automate, Power Apps, and Microsoft Project\nDatabase - hold unstructured and structured content with Microsoft's intuitive, accessible, and powerful database system called SharePoint Lists; create views, validation rules, forms, and dashboards\nTransform business processes - use SharePoint to automate common and routine business processes, with conditional and approval workflows to truly reach digital transformation across your organization\nPersonalization - make SharePoint yours; design your site to your liking with customized design features\nPermissions - Manage access to content through Microsoft's sophisticated permission management system, which includes security roles, approval workflow / gateways, and utilize Microsoft's single sign on\nReach and scale - More than 90% of businesses already use Office 365; leverage cloud resources to scale SharePoint from small start-ups to F500 organizations\n\n\nWhy learn SharePoint?\nIncrease collaboration by creating a one-stop shop - SharePoint improves efficiency in an organization by having a centralized location for all your content, knowledge, news, and workflows (called Team Sites) - leverage this technology to empower your team\nRevolutionize business processes - Processes in SharePoint can easily be accessed and managed by multiple people in your organizations, and sophisticated workflows and custom apps can be created to fully revolutionize business processes\nGet hired / increase your employability - SharePoint is used by more than 200,000 organizations for a reason; it increases efficiency - learning how to create SharePoint sites is an invaluable skill to boost your pay rate and deliver value\nImprove your toolkit - add this to your list of Microsoft skills - this is very powerful in conjunction with other Microsoft products (PowerApps, Power Automate, Office, Power BI, Azure, 365, etc.)\n\n\nWhy choose this course?\nComplete guide - this is the 100% start to finish, zero to hero, basic to advanced guide on SharePoint. There is no other course like it that teaches you everything from start to finish. It contains over 15 hours of instructional content!\nFully instructional - we not only go through important concepts, but also apply them as we are building our application so that we can solidify them. This is not only a walkthrough of the SharePoint features, but a course that actually builds applications with you\nStep by step - we go through every single concept in a sequential order (from beginner to expert). This improves your probabilities of learning SharePoint rather than going haphazardly through each feature.\nLearn to learn - during the latter parts of the course, we go through situations where we encounter new features or errors, and work through how we would use the documentation to resolve them. In this way, you not only learn about SharePoint inside and out, but learn how to resolve your own issues as they come up\nIntegrations - we go even beyond SharePoint in the expert section and integrate it with other Office 365 apps, such as Outlook, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Power Automate, and Power Apps\nTeacher response - if there's anything else you would like to learn, or if there's something you cannot figure out, I'm here for you!\nReference material - follow along! I provide all reference material directly to you so you can follow along in your learning journey\n\n\nCourse overview\nIntroduction - learn about SharePoint, its features, and how to succeed in the course\nEnvironment - create a SharePoint account, understand the environment / layout, and create your first site\nBeginner - manage document libraries with increasing sophistication, create beautiful and informative web pages, modify the default design, and create multiple linked sites via site collections\nModerate - organize and build data using SharePoint Lists, manage access using permissions, explore other functionality such as customized search, and learn about build-in social networking features\nExpert - transform and automate business processes using workflows and Power Automate, create customized forms using Power Apps, build other integrations with Excel and Outlook, and install other external applications\nConclusion - earn your Microsoft SharePoint Online certification, and read about next steps\n\n\nIf you want to learn Microsoft SharePoint Online, this is the course for you. We're looking forward to having you in the course and hope you earn the certificate.\n\n\nMusic: Bensound",

      "description": "Do you want to DESIGN TOP-NOTCH SLIDES like a professional designer?\nDo you want to GET COMFORTABLE WITH ANIMATION in PowerPoint?\nDo you want to CREATE VIDEOS in PowerPoint that are ready to publish online?\nWould you like to GET BETTER AS A DESIGNER, entrepreneur, business professional, or?\nThis course will prepare you with all the tools, knowledge, and skills that you need to reach the goals in the questions above. With this course, you can master PowerPoint and become a more capable and complete designer!\n\n\nAvoid frustration by learning an efficient workflow from a professional designer. I will take you by the hand and teach you to design great presentation templates and slides with confidence. You can be sure that your end results will be of the highest quality.\nGreat presentations involve far more than just making nice PowerPoint slides – they influence your branding, appearance, personal skills etc. so you want to make sure that those are on the highest level.\n\n\nThis course has a core of six comprehensive chapters to teach you everything you need to know:\n\n\n1. POWERPOINT BASICS - Learn to use the software properly and get a brief grasp of its most important components and tools. I will show you the essentials, so we can work swiftly in PowerPoint going forward.\n2. ANIMATION BASICS – Learn how to properly use animation. Discover the different types of animation and how to properly work on the animation timeline. This will make your animation work much easier.\n3. SLIDE DESIGN – This chapter is the main slide and presentation design section of this course. Since you already learned the basics in the previous chapters, it's time for us to roll out the big guns and design like a madman (or woman)! I will teach you a consistent, well-prepared design to give you a great starting point for your PowerPoint presentations.\n4. ANIMATION DESIGN – In this chapter, we’ll animate some of the slides we prepared and then you’ll learn how to make simple explainer videos or kinetic typography in PowerPoint. I will show you several outstanding tricks that you can use in your daily workflow!\n5. VIDEO CREATION - Learn how to create explainer videos and online lectures using only PowerPoint. I’ll show you how to record a presentation with your microphone and export a video that will be ready to publish anywhere online\n6. POWERPOINT TEMPLATES - Every respected PowerPoint designer knows how to create PowerPoint templates. For your business, your clients, or products for sale, making templates is an essential skill to have and utilize!\nAFTERWARDS: MORE SLIDE DESIGN, MORE TRICKS, MORE ANIMATION PROJECTS! Once you have a solid foundation of slide design and animation, we can explore other possible projects to do. We will create a few more animations, text reveals, and videos that are useful for creating more of your content.\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing this course, you will:\nHave a solid understanding of how to work efficiently in PowerPoint without wasting time and effort\nBe able to produce top-quality slides and presentations (including videos) to the highest industry standards\nGain complete control of the animations you want to create\nGet better at designing, presenting, and animating to help you advance as an active entrepreneur, creator, and content publisher\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ):\nI'm a total beginner in PowerPoint, is this course right for me?\nThis course will teach you all the necessary basics and advanced tools, but it's not PowerPoint 101 for beginners. I mention basic tools and techniques, but I assume that you are computer savvy and know how to find your way around PowerPoint already.\n\n\nI'm enrolled in your Master PowerPoint Presentations course. Should I get this one or is the other one enough? Which one is better?\nGood Question! Both courses are top PowerPoint courses that teach you the knowledge and tools to create outstanding presentations, animations, and templates. They are just two different versions that use different slides and unique content respectively. The benefit of that is you can follow a different design path on each course. Students who finished the first master course were asking me for more, and I'm happy to provide more if there is demand for it. If you already feel extremely comfortable with PowerPoint, one course is enough. But if you seek even more design ideas and slides, and if you like my content and the way I teach, you won't go wrong by taking both courses.\nWith both courses, you can reach a similar level of PPT knowledge, but in different ways and different designs. Each of those two courses has several unique sections that allow them to expand their knowledge in their own way.\n\n\nI've been using PowerPoint for 15+ years and think I know the most already, will I learn anything?\nI'm an experienced PowerPoint instructor with over 250 YouTube tutorials and more than 10 published PowerPoint courses and series. Over the past few years, I have learned from both beginner and advanced students which areas to address to best influence your workflow in a positive and impactful way. My courses help you to boost your efficiency, using shortcuts and on-trend designs to help you reach a modern, top-level standard of quality. If you need something that is not already in the course, you can always ask me about topics to add to courses that interest you.\n\n\nI'm still not sure if I want to invest in this course. I don't know if I want to focus on design or on animation. Is there any fall-back plan?\nOf course! First, you should watch the promo videos and watch the free preview lessons. They will give you a good understanding of the course content, pace, and what to expect from taking the course. Apart from that, you have Udemy’s 30-day Money Back Guarantee with no questions asked!",

Are you using Microsoft Teams every day at work (or are about to use it)? This course is going to walk you through the entire Microsoft Teams application and teach you how to make the most of all of its features: chat, meetings, organizing your team, the activity feed, sharing resources in Teams, PowerPoint integration and Outlook integration.\nI have been teaching the entire suite of Microsoft applications for many years privately, to my corporate clients and on YouTube. I have an easy to follow pace and provide all the necessary information on a topic, and no more!\nIf you are new to Microsoft Teams or are looking to expand your expertise, this detailed course taught by a Microsoft Certified Master Instructor will get you up to speed in no time.\nThis course takes a progressive approach. We start off with an overview of the Teams interface, finding out where stuff is, what it's called and why it's there.\nThen we take a look at the Activity Feed and why you should start your morning there. We move on to Teams Chats, one-on-one chats or group chats. Then I show you how to start a video call.\nTeams Meetings takes up a good portion of my course, because we do spend a lot of time in meetings, so we look at scheduling meetings, the meeting controls, roles in a meeting, sharing content and more.\nFinally, we go through Microsoft Teams integrations with external applications - PowerPoint or Outlook, as well as Apps from the Teams Apps marketplace.\nFurther, the course is frequently updated with new sessions. Microsoft Teams changes fast, new features are being added every month and sometimes it can be hard to keep up. I will be updating this course with new sessions frequently and this way, you will always be up to speed with what's new, what's changed and the best practices for making the most out of your Microsoft Teams.",

Upon completing this course you will receive 2 Certificates of Completion, a Microsoft Teams Certified Digital Badge you can add to your CV, LinkedIn Profile or any other online profile & access to the most dynamic Agile Community in the world.\nThis Microsoft Teams course will help you get you up and running quickly with Microsoft Teams. Think of it as a Teams fundamentals and essentials crash course for the workplace.\nAs part of the Office 365 suite of applications, Microsoft Teams is one of the most important and widely used Microsoft productivity apps in businesses around the world. It is also Microsoft's fastest growing application and has even surpassed the likes of Slack (another widely used business productivity application).\nAt the workplace, I use Microsoft Teams on a daily basis, multiple times a day every single day. And that's not a coincidence. Teams is just intuitive, modern, easy to use and a perfect fit for the interactions we have with people at the office.\nMicrosoft Teams allows you to communicate, collaborate, share files, work on files concurrently, make business decisions, solve business problems, manage your tasks and projects and more, a lot more.\nThe sky is the limit when it comes to Microsoft Teams. It's just that powerful, trust me. But beyond that, allow me to show you why it's so powerful and fun to use. And why so many businesses and people use it.\n\n\nTeams is the hub for teamwork within Office 365. Teams fulfills the collaboration and communication needs of a diverse workforce, including chat, meetings, voice, and video. The look and feel of these functions is modern, intuitive, fast and fluid, has low-overhead, and is instantly familiar since it doesn't differ too much from other applications employees use in the modern world outside the office.\nTeams integrates with all the apps you already use at the workplace. Teams integrates with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, SharePoint, Planner, Stream and even Power BI, so employees have the information and tools they need available at their fingertips. Team members can also include other apps and services in their workspaces, for the team and organization.\nTeams allows the ability to customize workspaces with tabs, connectors, and bots. For the developer community at Microsoft and elsewhere, Teams has an extensible platform for building apps that takes functionality further and allows teams to reach their goals and objectives.\nTeams offers a complete and modern meeting experience. Prior to starting a meeting, team members can review conversations; during a meeting, teams can share content and use audio conferencing and video. Teams supports private and group meeting capabilities, scheduling capabilities, and free/busy calendar availability.\nTeams has integrated security. Teams comes with the enterprise-grade security integrated with the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center and Azure Active Directory. It fits neatly into your primary solution for identity and access management, and allows you to maintain control over our data and environment.\nTeams, in combination with Office 365, creates a hub for modern collaboration and effective teamwork. It empowers employees to engage with the business and each through a diverse set of channels, providing higher productivity and velocity in communication.",

      "description": "WHAT’S YOUR STORY?\nAre you a business professional needing to up-skill?\nAre you struggling to get a pay-rise and/or promotion?\nAre you a recent graduate with an empty looking resume and no job experience?\nHave you recently been laid off, fired or had a contract end?\nIf you answered 'yes' to any of the above then having “Expert Microsoft Office Skills” will get you closer to your goal of either landing your first job, a new job or progressing further in your current role. Here's why.\nThe job market has never been more volatile. Statistically, people are changing jobs more often now than they ever have before and that also means people are also losing jobs to newcomers who are far more skilled. So if you’re not up-skilling, you’re falling behind. It’s scary I know. I’ve experienced this myself.\nA study released by Microsoft and the IDC showed that among 14.6 million job postings, proficiency in Microsoft Office was ranked 2nd as the most desired skills by employers leading up to 2020. Microsoft Office proficiency ranked higher than Project Management skills, Sales Experience, Time Management, Analytical Skills, Interpersonal Skills and Work Ethics.\nThis is because we live in the digital age, meaning employers are looking for proficient data handlers who process data faster, are more data-organised and can communicate effectively via digital channels. These are skills everyone should have no matter the discipline because they are transferable skills. It makes you more adaptable and more valuable in the long-term. This brings us back to Microsoft Office. It is the oldest, most well-known, most affordable and most trusted data management tool available and hence everyone uses it. So to be noticed and taken seriously in your job or job application, proficiency in these programs is compulsory.\nONLINE TRAINING AND THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS\nOne of the most common problems with online learning content is that there is so much of it now and it’s difficult to know where to start or who to turn to. Many go the YouTube route and piece together videos from hundreds of tutorials from hundreds of tutors hoping to become an expert at the end of it all. This simply won’t happen and will just waste your time.\nMany take the route you’re about to take, they decide to enroll in an online training course. Many charge hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars for their courses which is simply unaffordable for university students, recent graduates, the unemployed or those looking for a career change. That is the reason why I have decided to keep this course as low as possible even though I’m offering substantially more content than most of my competitors here on Udemy.\nCOURSE DELIVERY STYLE\nI have been using Microsoft Office for over 20 years. I know the in’s and out’s and the simplest ways of doing things. My delivery philosophy is simple, if I can’t get a 6 year old to follow along and understand, than I’m not teaching correctly. I hate complicated language and so do you. Nobody likes trainers who focus on impressing rather than teaching and giving value to students. That is also why my lecture videos are as short as can be and divided into small sections for easy consumption. So you won’t get unnecessary chit chat or nonsense. I also assume that all my students are near-sighted and as such, I use a special software tool that allows me to draw on the screen to show exactly what I’m about to press as well as zoom in on small area’s so you don’t miss a thing.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL LEARN IN THIS COURSE\nI built this course so that you can immediately use PowerPoint once you finish the first section. It contains all the basic elements you need to build and present your presentation. Following that section, each section will get progressively harder until you become an expert. I will show you:\nAll basic elements of PowerPoint slide design\nImage Control and Manipulation, Artistic Effects, Shapes and SmartArt\nHow to help yourself when you encounter a specific problem\nStandard Printing, PDF Printing Options, Email and Sharing\nQuick Access Toolbar Setup, Productivity Techniques and Keyboard Shortcuts\nSlides Transitions, Object Animations and Complete Effect Customization\nPost Review Functions including Spell Checking, Thesaurus, Researching, Window Duplication and Password Protection Protocols\nVideo Uploading from your Computer and YouTube, Video Trimming, Audio Recordings and Screen Casting\nPresentations Do’s and Don’ts which teaches you Slide Design and Structure, Sequencing, Logistics and Communication Tips\nTable Design, Object Linking and Excel Connections\nComplete Chart Design including Elements, Styling and Control\nHeader and Footer Design for Document Tracking\nMaster Views for Template Control\nAnd much more……\n\n\nABOUT ME\nMember of the Udemy Council\nCo-Founded Paperclip Learning which teaches Microsoft Office\nOver 60,000 students and over 17,000 students for this course alone\nOver 130,000 enrollments\nOver 5,000 Positive Reviews and over 1,000 Reviews for this course\nOver 20 courses on Udemy\nTeaching is my passion and my creative outlet. I have been using the Microsoft Office package since I was a child and have been using it consistently throughout my life. My teaching experiences span from teaching primary school students, high school students, university graduates and business professionals. Professionally, I am trained in Aerospace Engineering, Database Design and Business Analytics.\n\n\nTESTIMONIALS\nYu Hui Jun Yu - The courses are simply amazing and I can learn them rapidly. The hints presented were also very useful. I like the 'mini-lesson' format. Fast and efficient. The instructor's direction is very detailed and easy to understand. I can immediately start using this program.

      "description": "This course introduces Microsoft Excel's powerful data prep, modeling, analytics and business intelligence tools: Power Query, Power Pivot, and Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).\n\n\nIf you're looking to become a power Excel user and absolutely supercharge your Excel analytics game, this course is the A-Z guide that you're looking for. I'll introduce the \"Power Excel\" landscape, and explore what these Excel tools are all about and why they are changing the world of self-service analytics and business intelligence.\n\n\nTogether, we'll walk through the Excel BI workflow, and build an entire Excel data model from scratch:\n\n\nFirst we'll get hands-on with Power Query; a tool to extract, transform, and load data into Excel from flat files, folders, databases, API services and more. We'll practice shaping, blending, cleaning and exploring our project files in Excel's query editor, and create completely automated loading procedures inside of Excel with only a few clicks.\nFrom there we'll dive into Data Modeling 101, and cover the fundamentals of database design and normalization (including table relationships, cardinality, hierarchies and more). We'll take a tour through the Excel data model interface, introduce some best practices and pro tips, and then create our own relational database to analyze throughout the course.\nFinally, we'll use Power Pivot and DAX to explore and analyze our Excel data model. Unlike traditional Excel Pivot Tables, Power Pivot allows you to analyze hundreds of millions of rows across multiple data tables (inside of Excel!), and create supercharged calculated fields using a formula language called Data Analysis Expressions (or \"DAX\" for short). We'll cover basic DAX syntax, then introduce some of the most powerful and commonly-used functions – CALCULATE, FILTER, SUMX and more.\n\n\nIf you're ready to take your MS Excel game to new heights and join the leading edge of analytics & business intelligence, this course is for you. It's time to stop fighting with tedious, manual tasks and struggling with \"old-school\" Excel; join me on this journey and emerge a certified excel analytics NINJA.\n\n\nSee you in there!\n-Chris (Founder, Maven Analytics)\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Power Query and Power Pivot are currently NOT available in Excel for Mac. You'll need a PC version of Excel that is compatible with Power Pivot (Excel 2010 with plug-in, Excel 2013, Excel 2016, or Excel 2019 Standalone, Office 365 Pro Plus, Enterprise E3/E5, Office Professional 2016, etc.)\n__________\nLooking for our full course library? Search \"Maven Analytics\" to browse our full collection of Excel, Power BI, SQL, Tableau, Python, Alteryx & Machine Learning courses!\n\n\nHear why this is one of the TOP-RATED Excel courses on Udemy, and the #1 Excel Power Query + Excel Power Pivot course:\n\"I am a self-taught Excel Power Query user and it took me a while to understand what each tool does and how it interacts with others. Thanks to your introduction I finally nailed it in a very clear, unambiguous way. You helped me build a method that I can confidently apply to my data in Excel. Thank you so much!\"\n-Francesca C.\n\n\n\"I'm less of an expert at breathing than Chris is at Excel. This course is thorough and well-planned, and he presents in a manner that simplifies the complicated. Well worth your time if you want to master Excel power query and power pivot!\"\n-Tim B.\n\n\n\"I'm geeking out, this is so cool. Where has this been all my life???\"\n-Karen P.\n\n\n*This course includes Excel project files, quizzes & homework exercises, 1-on-1 instructor support, LIFETIME access and a 100% money-back guarantee!",

      "description": "Learn more than the basic structures in Access. Learn the\nconcepts underneath\nand how they relate to and work wth Excel. Learn Access from an instructor with years of experience teaching Access and creating custom databases for businesses.\n\nFrom a recent Student Review:\n\n5 Stars - I finally have a grasp of Access and relational databases!\nThanks to Bruce's course, I can confidently say I have a good grasp of what Microsoft Access is, how to use it effectively and how it differs from Microsoft Excel.\nBruce is clear and concise in his lectures. I enjoyed the hands-on/real world example style of teaching with downloadable Access & Excel files. - Joey Sullivan\nYou will build a strong foundation in Access by understanding the logic behind its structure:\nCreate tables and learn how to properly structure them.\nExtensive Training on ALL types of queries.\nCreate reports from scratch instead of relying on wizards.\nLearn how to create advanced reports based on queries.\nLearn everything you need to know to build powerful and attractive forms.\nBuild subforms and learn how to move in and out of them.\nLearn about simple macros.\nMake basic command buttons in forms.\nLearn a simple way to make multi value lookups on forms.\nAnother Student Review:\n5 Stars - Fantastic Course!\n\nI have been trying to come to grips with Access for some time now, but each time I became frustrated and eventually gave up. This course is structured in a way that gripped my interest and motivated me to complete it. Bruce has extensive knowledge and the way that he presents the material, makes it easy to follow and understand and it is a very valuable resource. - John Ovens\nThese Powerful Skills Will Skyrocket Your Value in the Marketplace!\nBy learning how to use Access WITH Excel, you will rise to a level of skill that few others have. Learning Access gives you incredible power over your data, no matter how large your data files are. Nightmare editing tasks will no longer bother you as you use your knowledge of queries to update thousands of records in minutes! Employers are waking up to the power of Access and those who have this knowledge will be in high demand with your current employer or other businesses. The practical skills taught in this class will give you the capability to double or triple your productivity!\nThere is a\nHUGE need in the marketplace\nfor people with these skills! This is your opportunity to break away from the pack of people who try and do everything with Excel, instead of learning that for many tasks, Access is the proper tool. This could be your shortest path to increasing your income!\nFrom a Student Review:\n\"This is an amazing class/series. Bruce does a fantastic job explaining each concept and does so with such concern for the student. Just in presentation one can identify that this is a passion for Bruce and not just read from a script. I cannot wait to put this education to use within my career!! Thank you for creating this material!\" - Rick WIlliams\n\nContent and Overview\n\nAll you need to do the course is basic experience with Windows programs. If you have or are using Excel, that is even better. Much of the course is presented as a comparison to Excel and explains what tasks each program is best suited for.\nEven though there are many lectures and several hours of content, each section focuses on one set of concepts so it is easy to do one section at a time, when your schedule allows. You will find that each chapter builds on the previous one as you build your understanding of Access, one step at a time.\nBy the time you have finished the course you will have done so much with Access and it will be so familiar that you will be ready to tackle your own data tasks immediately, putting your new learned skills into practical use and impressing your boss and coworkers.\nThe course is complete with working files and finished samples for everything that is covered. You will be able to work alongside the author as you work through each lecture and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.\nClick the Take This Course button\nto take your first step towards quickly increasing your income! Also, remember that if you don't think the course is worth what you spent, you have a full 30 days to get a no questions asked refund!\nFrom Another Student Review:\n5 Stars - Absolutely the Best Course I Have Taken\n\nI am not one to write many reviews, but when a course has reached beyond my expectations, I had no choice but to give compliments to the author Mr. Bruce Myron.\nThe content of the course was extremely comprehensive and informative in which every student will walk away having the best foundation of MS Access one can get. The clarity and tone of each video had me eager to learn more and has already assisted me with applications I had at work. With the knowledge I have gained, not only will it help separate myself from my co-workers, but allow me to increase my income over time.\nThe greatest treat one will get in this course is the interaction from Mr. Myron. He is absolutely the difference maker from any other course I had taken and made me feel that I was not alone while taking this course. I cannot wait to begin the other courses to get to the next level of my career.\nTrust me, when it comes to learning MS Access from the ground up through Mr. Myron's courses, starting with Excel To Access: Intro to Access for Excel Users, one will be ecstatic with the results. - David Richardson\nAnother Student Review:\n5 Stars - Brilliant piece of work!\n\nThanks Bruce for making these lectures. They are very well done, relevant and clear. I have literally copied line for line of many of these lectures into a project i am working on. Highly recommended also are the other videos which also contain golden nuggets: Access to Excel to Outlook, Access to Excel-Instant Reports and pivot tables, Microsoft Access vba for non programmers. And as a bonus, Bruce has been very helpful in answering, guiding and explaining content from his lecture when i asked for clarification.\nBrilliant Bruce, thanks again - Steven Kawuma\nRequired Software\nYou should have Office 2010 or later. The course was created using Office 2013.",

      "description": "13,000+ Students have enrolled in my 13 Courses!\nThe 4.8 Rating from student reviews shows the value packed in this course!\nPracticality: This course has 7 Downloadable Spreadsheets  so that you can follow along with every Section!\n\"I wish I was good at Excel, but it's too technical for me\"\n\n\"Excel confuses me with all those formulas\"\n\"I picked up an Excel book to start learning, hopefully I'll get a better grasp of it soon\"\nI hear excuses and bad approaches when it comes to learning Excel all the time. Here's the truth - Excel is extremely complex and is not an easy thing to master. However, I truly believe that you can hack your way through learning it - that is, know exactly what the most important aspects in Excel are and master them one by one. That's why I organised this course into so-called \"Hacks\", so that you can focus on the most important information first and foremost.\nHave you ever been confused by the sheer complexity of Excel? Ever struggled with an annoying problem that you couldn't solve fast enough? Or maybe you're just looking to start learning to use Excel and master it quickly...\nA lot of the Excel Trainings out there throw a bunch of formulas at you and teach you how to use them. However, they neglect to tell you their practical applications and what the most important shortcuts are.\nA few years ago I was an Excel rookie. I thought I knew how to use it (what's so hard right?), but found out about my limitations as soon as I started a job in a Financial Controlling role. Everything that I have learned in Excel came as a result of the challenges that I faced on the job and my relentless drive to discover solutions that were more and more efficient.\nThe truth is I didn't have one of the most efficient learning curves because nobody told me what the most efficient path to mastering Excel was.\nWhat do experts do on a daily basis? What are the key formula combinations for particular situations? What sort of tips & tricks do they use to be faster & more efficient when using Excel?\nThose questions led to this course. I bundled all of my knowledge in a way that prioritises the most important Excel Hacks. This will ensure that you will get to your best Excel level in the fastest possible time. Doesn't that sound better than sitting through boring Excel Training Seminars for 8 hours during a whole day?\nHere's what this course covers:\nThe Excel Essentials - discover the quickest ways to navigate and manipulate data in Excel so that you can master the basics straight away\n20+ Quick & Killer Hacks - These are individual lectures focused on particular Excel hacks which boost your productivity & use of Excel\nBulls-Eye Formula Blueprint - master Excel Formulas by shifting the focus away from HOW they work to WHAT their usability is in practical scenarios\nAnd much, much more. Just have a look at the Learning Outcomes.\nThe Excel Mastery Guarantee\nI'm extremely confident that if you take action and follow these steps, you will revolutionise your Excel skills at a very fast pace. However, if for any reason you're not satisfied with this course, then I will personally jump on a 30 Minute Skype Call with you and help you get to the next level.\nNobody can give you a Magic Pill for learning Excel - it takes time & practice. However, if you're aware of the most important shortcuts from the beginning, that will end up saving you countless hours of your precious time. Take this course now and join me in this exciting journey!",

Although I consider myself an experienced PowerPoint user, I learned a lot through the ultra express approach, that N&B teaches here. Worth every single penny!\" - Phil\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nARE YOU DROWNING IN POWERPOINT SLIDES?\nAre you finding that the slides you build (and those of your colleagues and clients) require an ENORMOUS amount of time, energy and frustration to build, update and edit?\nAre your colleagues and clients constantly asking you to make updates and changes to their PowerPoint presentations?\nThe reason that most people struggle in PowerPoint and waste away in the office past their bedtimes, is that they go about building and editing their slides the wrong way!\nYes, they more-or-less know where all the PowerPoint commands are, but they lack specific strategies and techniques to QUICKLY build (and untangle) high quality, scalable slides that are easy to update and manage when things change.\nAs the saying goes, \"just because you can pick up a chisel and hammer doesn't make you a Michelangelo\"…\nWell, just because you can drop a few shapes on your slide and type some text, doesn't make you a high flying consultant or the go-to PPT guru (regardless of what your boss thinks).\nFINALLY ADVANCED MICROSOFT POWERPOINT TRAINING\nAdvanced PowerPoint includes 7 hours of sequenced videos teaching you a step-by-step unique methodology to quickly build robust, scalable slides for the corporate environment.\nAdvanced PowerPoint assumes you are already semi-savvy in the program and have the basics down: you've read the standard PowerPoint books, you've taken a course or two, maybe you've attended conferences like the Presentation Summit and now you are ready to take your presentation skills to the next level and start blasting through your slides and graphics.\nThis is where the rubber meets the road...\nAnd just imagine how excited you'll be the next time you sit down at your desk with your trusty side-kick cup of Joe, fire up PowerPoint and KNOW that you'll finish your deck three times faster than it would have previously taken you...and be significantly better (technically sound) too.\nIt may sound like hype...\nBut in Advanced PowerPoint you'll build the SKILLS and HABITS to do exactly that without using any 3rd party-software, whiz-bang templates or over-hyped add-ins (you don't need them).\nAnd this course works for all PC versions of Microsoft PowerPoint, including PowerPoint 2010, PowerPoint 2013, PowerPoint 2016 and the latest version too, PowerPoint 2019 (the Microsoft Office 365 subscription).\nThat way you don't have to take a bunch of different PowerPoint training courses to keep up-to-date.\nTRIPLE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY OR PLEASE ASK FOR A REFUND\nHere is how you will TRIPLE your productivity in PowerPoint...guaranteed:\n3 Core Frameworks that revolutionize how you tackle your PowerPoint presentations by simplifying the number of decisions you need to make. These frameworks work regardless of which version of the program you are using and will never be outdated with the next version of Office.\nDrills to Master 60+ PowerPoint shortcuts that double your output and increase the quality of your slides (including a shortcut PDF cheat sheet to keep at your desk)\nDownload my EXACT Microsoft PowerPoint customizations. It took me over 5 years to figure out this EXACT setup (down to the order that you list your commands in)... and it's wicked fast\nLots of drills and exercises to build good working habits so that you can navigate PowerPoint almost entirely from your keyboard (for PC users)\nAnd much MUCH more!\n______________________________________________________________________\nWHAT STUDENTS ARE SAYING\n\"The Best Time-Saving Guide for Heavy PowerPoint Users\" - Yong\n\"Best PowerPoint course I've ever taken\" - Sven\n\"PowerPoint Power Course\" - Bronwyn\n\"Tremendous course, especially for aspiring consultants!\" - John\n\"Essential PowerPoint Speed Training\" - Charles\n\"You will get 10Xs your money's worth by taking this course and then some... I'm only 66% complete and I can tell you with certainty that I have gotten that much value. Take the course... don't even bother wondering if it's worth it. I don't get a dime by endorsing Taylor: I get the satisfaction of seeing less crappy PowerPoint slides.\" - Dominic\n\"100% convinced of the core message - use your keyboard if you want to be fast! This has been my own mantra for the last 20 years. And I have now learned so many new keystrokes and tricks! I'm amazed (who would've thought of =rand() function) - THANKS!\" – Oliver\n\"This course is fantastic! I am only halfway through the course and it has already been worthwhile!\" - Megan\n\"Yesterday I've finished the orientation and unit 1 still in unit 2 the course is freaking awesome :) :) I can’t even describe how much I love it!\"  - Maria\n\"I am doing presentations for over 10 years, and I thought I know almost everything about PowerPoint, but after watching this course, I almost doubled my working speed! There is a ton of useful tips, tricks and routines that can really improve EVERYONE'S PowerPoint skills and technique. I really recommend this course.\" - Aleksandar\n\"Am half way through the course and loving it. It's already improved my productivity. I wish there was a Nuts and Bolts Course for Excel, Word, Visio and Outlook (and MS Project if possible). @Taylor : please think about it :D. I am SUPER glad I took this course (mainly out of curiosity). This is the time I have taken a course and actually taken the time to add a review mid-way. 10 stars to the course. Definitely recommended.\" - Divisha\n\"I was really surprised by the quality of instruction here. There are some really good pointers here on increasing your ability to quickly build decks - especially with regards to slide alignment - as well as structure them.\" - Li\n______________________________________________________________________\nHOW MUCH FURTHER ARE YOU GOING TO GET ON YOUR OWN IN POWERPOINT?\nAre you the go-to person at your company for PowerPoint, and looking for new strategies and techniques that will make you EVEN better?\nAre you an analyst bogged down at your job creating and editing PowerPoint presentations, and you want to learn how to fast track through your decks so that you can spend your time on higher value-added tasks that will help you get promoted?\nAre you an undergraduate or MBA student looking to get into investment banking or consulting, and you want to get a jump start on that \"proficient at PowerPoint\" line on your resume so that you can hit the ground running when you land the job?\n______________________________________________________________________\nADVANCED POWERPOINT SKILLS YOU CAN BANK ON FOR LIFE\nSpend Less Time Formatting: 40% or more of people's time spent building PowerPoint presentations is currently wasted on repetitive formatting and alignment tasks…I'll show you how to eliminate many of these.\nBecome a Keyboard Jockey: Everyone knows that power users use their keyboard for just about EVERYTHING… I'll show you exactly when and where to use your keyboard, and help you build the muscle memory so that it sticks.\nMake Better Deck Decisions: Many great \"dream\" slides become re-haul \"nightmares\" when you have to update or rework them later… I'll teach you how to make better decisions about the presentations you build on the front end of your deck so that your slides are easy to update and manage when things change… as they always do.\nUniversal across all PC versions of Microsoft PowerPoint: These Speed Training strategies and techniques work in all the latest versions of PowerPoint including PowerPoint 2016 and PowerPoint 2019. That way you can train yourself up once (even if you are using PowerPoint 2007 or 2010), and use the skills forever in the program.\nAnd Much, MUCH More: It takes people years of trial and error sitting at their desk to pick up great a few great hacks and tricks… I'll save you the trouble and show you the best of the best that I've collected over my career building slides.\n______________________________________________________________________\nADVANCED MICROSOFT POWERPOINT COURSE OUTLINE\nChapter 1: Using Your Keyboard For Just About Everything\nIn Chapter 1, I'll show you how to use your keyboard for just about everything in PowerPoint, how to optimize the PowerPoint environment for speed and the many flavors of shortcuts we'll be covering.\nThis is the LAST place people look to improve their speed and efficiency, yet this is THE critical first step if you want to build slides (from scratch) in less than 3 minutes.\nI've spent years testing ways to minimize repetitive tasks and optimize the PowerPoint environment for speed and I'll reveal everything that I've learned.\nChapter 2: Strategically Building Scale-able Layouts\nIn Chapter 2, I'll walk you through how to rapidly create, format, and manage the core building blocks of professional presentations (shapes, lines and text boxes). You'll also learn the core frameworks that will help guide you in making better deck decisions that will save you time now and in the future.\nAfter Chapter 2 you will be able to quickly manage and manipulate the objects of a slide to quickly generate new layout ideas without breaking a sweat.\nI'll also show you exactly where most people's layouts go wrong and how to quickly troubleshoot and fix them so that they are more robust in the future.\nChapter 3: Making Everything Perfect\nIn Chapter 3 I'll show you how to align ANYTHING in PowerPoint by focusing on 'technically' impossible alignment issues that most people use guesswork to get into place.\nThis chapter will ensure that your slides maintain the highest level of professionalism by avoiding common (and often embarrassing) alignment issues that most people think are impossible.\nChapter 4: Demystifying the Common Issues with Lines in Hierarchies and Flow Processes\nIn Chapter 4 I'll show you how to solve the many inconsistencies of working with lines in PowerPoint that destroy most people's layouts (and create hours of reworking issues).\nIn addition, I'll show you a step-by-step process for tackling a real-world connector mess, as you'll likely encounter lots of them during your career. I won't let other people's disasters slow you down.\nChapter 5: Building rapid-fire layouts with boxes and flying carpets\nIn Chapter 5 you'll learn how to polish slides in less than 2 minutes using my famous boxing things up technique. The scenario is you have been given new slides that you MUST include in your presentation…and they suck. The trouble is you don't have a lot of time to invest as you are running out the door...now what?\nIn this chapter you'll learn how to quickly build box layouts, how to default your formatting so that you can build your layouts faster as well as looking at how to build out alternative layouts with implied boxes (using flying carpets) and odd shape boxes.\n__________________________________________________________________\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\nIs this a workshop about all the different features of PowerPoint, how to save a presentation, where to find the picture formatting tools, etc.?\nWe assume you're already computer savvy and know how to find your way around. Unlike many other courses out there, this workshop focuses entirely on how to use PowerPoint in the real world, rather than simply where all the different features are located. Each unit is packed full of strategies and techniques you can use every single time you work in PowerPoint. If it isn't useful for completing tasks today, we don't cover it.\nDoes the workshop include public speaking tips, crafting a better presentation (how many slides, how many bullets, etc.), story-boarding, or general tips on how to develop a better message?\nThis workshop focuses specifically on the technical applications of being 3x Faster working in PowerPoint. For all intents and purposes, this workshop assumes that you already know what you want to include in your presentation, and focuses on showing you how to build it as quickly as possible. If you are looking for guidance on how to build and deliver a \"Steve Jobs\" presentation, this workshop is not for you.\nIs the workshop about building \"warm and fuzzy\" PowerPoint slides that entertain or dazzle an audience?\nThis workshop assumes your job is to build professional-grade slides to impress your boss or colleagues in professional settings, not to build slides to show your holiday photos to friends on the weekend.\nWill I learn how to create animations and slide transitions?\nThis workshop focuses on content-heavy slides that are sent via email or printed for review...the types of slides where animations and slide transitions are irrelevant and a waste of time.\nI've been using PowerPoint for 9 + years, will I learn anything?\nIf you can complete our Speed Challenge in less than two minutes, then you do not need to take this course. Otherwise, you will learn a repeatable system you can use to build slides, like those in our Speed Challenge, in record timing.\nHow fast can I become building presentation slides?\nHow much you get out of this workshop depends on how much you put into it. The goal is to teach you a systematic, repeatable system to quickly build content. If you are willing to learn our system and follow along with us, you'll have all the tools to build slides like the Challenge Slides in less than two minutes. To get a sense of how fast you are now, take our Speed Challenge (download or watch below), and compare your time to ours.\nWhy the focus on shapes, lines and text boxes?\nWe focus on improving the speed with which you accomplish everyday tasks in PowerPoint, using the core building blocks of professional presentations: shapes, lines and text boxes. These objects account for at least 80% of all the objects used in content-heavy slides in the professional world, so being able to manipulate these core building blocks quickly and effectively is critical.\nMy company uses set templates. Will I still be able to get something out of this workshop?\nAbsolutely. Most templates are built using shapes, lines and text boxes, so learning our system will help you become an expert at manipulating your templates.\nCan I take this course if I'm using a Mac?\nAlthough a PC version of Office is used to teach this course, students have taken the course using the Mac version of Office and been extremely happy.\nThe primary difference between the two versions is the quick access toolbar and the keyboard-driven ribbon, so a number of the speed tricks covered do not work on a Mac. That said, all the strategies and techniques for building your slides are 100% applicable to the Mac version of PowerPoint and will save you time.\nIf you are using a Mac version of Office, I encourage you to try the course as is and if you are not satisfied for whatever reason, refund the course within 30 days of purchase.\nWhich version of Microsoft PowerPoint do I need to follow along?\nYou can follow along with any PC version of PowerPoint 2007 or later. On top of that, I just UPDATED the course for PowerPoint 2016 and PowerPoint 2019 (Office 365 subscribers) too. Throughout the workshop, I use the latest PowerPoint 2019, but I make a note of any differences between the different versions so that you can follow along regardless of which version you are using on a PC.",

Concise, yet comprehensive and informative. The instructor has a gift for teaching in an old-world, grade school type of way, which I find particularly useful. He explains each new concept quite clearly and then builds upon the concepts to establish a very strong foundation. Remarkable class and presentation. I highly recommend this instructor. Brilliant.\" - Kevin Ward (May 2020)\n\n\n“Course is more than I expected. Instructor provides in depth knowledge of Excel and is effective at communicating it. This course, practice and effort are making me an Excel WIZ ! Thanks Alan.” – Tom Howard (April 2020)\n“This course is by far the best course on Excel. Alan is a great instructor and has an art of teaching from the grassroots level and gradually building up to the advanced level which I think is a great way for the concepts of Excel to sink in the brain.” - Kshipra Jawdekar (April 2020)\n\n\nExcel is the most in commonly used and in demand tool for making sense of data. When you can harness that power, you will be a sought after employee and YOU CAN EARN MORE MONEY!.\nIf you run a business, being proficient in Excel can help you see your business in a completely different light.\n\n\nCongratulations!\nIf you are reading this, you have already taken your first important step. You want to learn Excel from the ground up, and go from a complete beginner, to super user, to being part of the few Excel Elite, and being able to program your very own full blown applications using VBA (including automating not only Excel, but Outlook, Word, Powerpoint and even Windows itself!).\nThis complete course contains all the lectures, quizzes, projects, and downloadable resources contained in Levels 1, 2 and 3. In fact, everything you will need to go from novice to coder! There's no need to buy one course after another to become an Excel master...it's all here!\n\n\nYes, but 27 hours, Alan?\nDon't worry! We have a very (very) active student forum, so new lectures are regularly added in the SQA Sections (Student Questions Answered). If I can't explain something in a post, or I get a particularly interesting question, I'll make a video for you to walk you through your own specific sticking point!\n\n\nYou can find the detail of each section below, but here's a summary of how it breaks down:\nLevel 1 Beginners: Base course - 3 hours, SQA - I hour\nLevel 2 Advanced: Base course - 6.5 hours, SQA - 2 hours\nLevel 3 VBA Programming: Base course - 11.5 hours, SQA - 3 hours\nThe course is structured so you can dip in and out whenever you want...you don't have to do it all at once :)\n\n\nHere's what you get inside...\n\n\nIn Excel Essentials: Level 1 Basics - Master Excel Step-By-Step\nAverage review HIGHER than the other Microsoft courses on Udemy!\nAverage minutes viewed 27% HIGHER than other Microsoft course!\nNew students join THIS Excel course EVERY DAY!\nGreat news!

Just drop a message in the discussion board, and if I can't answer it in a simple message, I'll make a video just for you!\n\n\nWhat other students are saying:\n\"This is the most comprehensive course I've seen on Udemy...\" - Renato Ferreira\n\"This course is a must and it could be the only one you need, if you want to master Excel for any reason. It is well organized, it covers all topics of Excel, from the fundamentals (formatting, writing data, put that data to use, etc...), continuing to a more advance use of the program, like applications for the formulas included in the app. But the part that outstands in the course, is the macro-programming part. It helps you to start programming in VBA in a step by step fashion. The instructor explains every lesson quite well, he is easy to follow, and you can notice he knows the app and have lots of experience with it. He is also very responsive and will reach you as soon as he can in case you have any doubt about the topics covered in the course. For me is a five stars course, thumbs up for a well roundup course.\" - David Garcia Silvarrey\n\"This is the best Excel course ever! I like that the topics are broken down into few minutes at a time\". - Sheryl Blosel\n\"This course is wonderful. If you were and absolute beginner like I was, this is the course that you should take. This course starts at the absolute beginning and shows you in detail how to use the program and how to make it do what you need it to. I am almost through section 2 and I cant believe how much I have learned and I couldn't imagine taking an Excel course from anyone else. If you are thinking about getting an Excel course for refreshing your skills, or just starting from the beginning, this is the course for you\" - Jake Rose\n\n\nNext to soft skills, being able to use Microsoft Excel well is probably one of the most sought after skills employers are looking for in today’s competitive market. Make sure you can compete…\nDo you want to master one of the must have skills for any work place?\nAre you willing to invest a little time now for your own future?\nWant to learn powerful, little known tools most users don't know about?\nDo you want to get ahead of your competition?\nIf you are a complete beginner looking to master Excel, or you just want to brush up on the basics, you've come to the right place. If you want to earn more money by developing a skill set that today’s employers demand, this is the course is for you!\nGetting to grips with Excel will give you a distinct advantage in whatever work you currently do, and can open the door to new opportunities.\nMany of my students have gone on to get better paying jobs, change career, or even start their own businesses, using the very skills you will soon master.\n“I spent over 30 years mastering Excel, so you don't have to!”\nIn this course we cover in detail all of the basic functions of Excel, and you will learn not only how to use it, but some powerful tools to allow you understand how it works. There is a difference between repeating something and understanding it.\n\n\nWho is this course aimed at?\nComplete beginners, and those who want to build a solid foundation upon which to build their skills.\n\n\nHow is it structured?\nTogether we concentrate on building a single complete project from beginning to end, using all the basic functions and give you a thorough understanding.\nI know your time is valuable, so most lectures are between 3-5 minutes, allowing you to dip in and out when it's convenient for you. This also maximizes your learning, and makes it easy if you ever need to go back to refresh your memory...no need to click through a 40 minute lecture to find the part you're looking for!\nThere are screencasts, lots of quizzes, presentations, pdfs, downloadable files...all designed to optimize your learning.\n\n\nWhat do I get with this course?\nLifetime access to over 4 hours of HD content.\nOver 50 bite-size lectures, each covering a specific topic in detail. Some of which I have never seen taught before!\nMultiple quizzes to ensure you cement your learning!\nDownloadable source file, practice file, and pdf cheat sheets that you can take with you and quickly refer back to if you are away from home.\nAccess to the Q&A forum, so if you have any questions, you can ask me!\n\n\nWhat other students are saying:\n\"This course is exactly what I was looking for. Simply explained, and in a level of detail I could follow. I really enjoyed it, and will recommend it to all my friend\"s – Beatrice\n\"This course [Level 1] gives a solid foundation for a beginner who wants to develop their skills...To sum up Folks, this is a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED course. I will be shortly enrolling myself in the next course with Alan of course\" – Alex\n\"Fantastic course! The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and the way he organized the course makes it extremely easy to follow. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to increase their knowledge of Excel.\" – Dan Hughes\n\n\nSo, Why take THIS course?\nI have been using Excel for over 20 years, but there is a difference between being good at something and being able to teach it. In that time I have taught thousands of people how to master its power. Because I have taught so many people, I know not to assume you already understand something, and I have probably already heard every question you are likely to have.\nThis course took over 4 months to produce, and has been tested extensively with hundreds of people. If something didn't work, or wasn't clear, it was revised until it did, to make this the best possible course on Excel.\nOf course, we never stop learning, and I will continue to develop this course, and your skills, with your feedback. And remember, if you have a question, post it in the Q&A and I will answer it for you personally.\n\n\n\n\n***************************************************************************************************************\nIn Excel Essentials: Level 2 - Intermediate/Advanced:\nTHIS course will take your Excel skills to the next level!\nNew \"Student Questions Answered\" added\nThe HIGHEST RATED Excel Level 2 course on Udemy!\nAverage minutes viewed almost triple that of other Microsoft courses!\nSo, you have an understanding of the basics, but would you like to use Excel like the professionals?

You will learn how to build complex solutions using the very same methods I use.\n\n\n\n\n***************************************************************************************************************\nIn Excel Essentials: Level 3 - VBA Programming:\nIf you really want to harness the full power of Excel, then learning how to program in VBA is ESSENTIAL!\n\n\nIf you got this far, it's because:\nYou want to join the Excel elite, and program your own solutions?\nMaybe you want to automate most of your work, do more in less time with less effort?\nCould be you want to earn more money?\nPerhaps you may even fancy a career change?\nIf you answered yes to any of the above, I want you in my student community!\nIn this course you will learn everything you need to know about coding in VBA, even if you've never looked at a line of code before!\n\n\nWhat other students are saying:\n\"This is a great course! ...I can't wait to start using it. I will certainly be using the emailing program! And reports. My mind is reeling!\" - Nickie Student!\n\"Taught in easy bite size chunks makes the learning fun as well as informative\" – Joe Long\n\"If you are serious about learning how to make excel work for you, you should take this course\" - Beatrice\n\n\nIntroducing Visual Basic For Applications\nVisual Basic for Applications, or VBA, is included with Excel, so there's nothing more to buy. If you have Excel, you already have access to VBA.\nVBA is the powerhouse. It's the code that lives under the hood where the magic happens.\nA lot of people can record a Macro, but being able to program in VBA is quite a different thing. It separates the good from the truly amazing, and I want you to be amazing!\nNow, one of those words in \"Visual Basic for Applications\" carries more weight than the others. And no, it's not \"Basic\" (though coding the way I will teach you is simple!).\nNo, it's \"Applications\". In fact, it's the \"s\" at the very end. The significance is that VBA works across ALL MICROSOFT APPLICATIONS! Word, Outlook, Access, PowerPoint, Internet Explorer, and even WINDOWS ITSELF!\n\n\nIn this course I will not only teach you how to code for Excel, there are even THREE, no...FOUR Bonus Sections:\nControlling Word\nControlling Outlook\nYes, even controlling Windows\nand now...Automating PowerPoint!\n\n\nWhat Makes Me Qualified To Teach You?\nWell, I'm a regular guy. I don't have a University degree, but what I do have is the drive to learn new things and never be beaten by a problem...a lot like you, I guess.\nWhat I also have is over 20 years of experience in using Excel, and programming solutions with VBA.\nI have built simple helper systems to make life easier for my colleagues. I've programmed complete MRP systems to run the procurement division of a £1.3b company, and everything in between.\nSo, I can do it, does that mean I can teach you?\nYou bet! I have taught hundreds of students one on one, and even more in groups. Many of my students have gone on to better paying jobs, start their own businesses, or at the very least made their work lives less stressful! One of my most recent students got a promotion and a 15% pay rise just 16 weeks after learning how to code! Not bad, hey?\n\nWhy Is Your Course Different, Alan?\nI'm glad you asked!\nIf you got this far, you already know you get:\nOver 15 hours of HD video lectures\n72 downloadable resources\nQuizzes\nAll the source code for the course + more!\nProgramming projects\n\n\nThere are lots of great courses on coding in VBA. There are even lots of free videos on YouTube. Many of them show you all the basics in kind of a \"little bit of everything\" approach. I looked at what was available, and I knew I had to create something different. Of course, I still cover all the basics, just like the other courses, but we will go beyond the basics, and cover in depth the \"missing bits\".\nIn addition, I will teach you my step-by-step process, the actual methods I use to build powerful solutions easily and quickly. I'm sure programming can be difficult, but not the way I do it!\nYou will learn how streamline your code for efficiency (and make it execute faster!) from the beginning. After we've covered all the basics, we will go on to create 6 separate projects using those very tools and techniques, where we will pull together all of your earlier learning, and give you the confidence to program your own solutions as soon as you finish the course!\n\n\nWhat other students are saying:\n\"I'm coming close to finishing this course...This course has given me the knowledge and confidence to succeed, get promoted and think seriously about building a career based on what I can learn from great teachers like Alan.\" - Thomas Heaton\n\"Alan is an excellent tutor, goes very deep into every single thing, and he is not bothered to repeat even the smallest tricks and tips along the way. I feel like I got amazing new skill, this course has opened my eyes on how I should \"see\" excel from now on. Definitely the best course I have ever taken on Udemy\" - Aleksandar Stankovic\n\n\nWith So Much Power, What Will You Create?\nWith the skills you will learn in this course you will be limited only by your imagination.\nIf you can describe it, you can most likely code it. What will YOU create?\n\n\nLet's see. Enrol now, and I look forward to welcoming you to the course!",
