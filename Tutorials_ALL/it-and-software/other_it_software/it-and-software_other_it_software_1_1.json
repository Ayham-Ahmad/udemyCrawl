You have to arrange your own Mainframe ID.\nWelcome to the most detailed and elaborate course about Mainframe on the whole internet. The course offers exclusive content about Mainframe in movies and other media.\n\n\nThe course has been BESTSELLER since its launch in January 2017. It is the top reviewed and most sought-after course about Mainframe on Udemy. I made this course exclusively for UDEMY.  You will not find content like this on the internet.\n\n\nThis course also includes some amazing facts about Mainframes like FIFA world cup brazil used Mainframes to detect whether a goal has been scored or not, and the most recent New Jersey Unemployment department needs COBOL programmers during the COVID-19 corona crisis.\n\n\n\n\n=========================================================================================\n\n\nAbout Me:\nI am the original creator of the Mainframe courses on Udemy. I have been creating content since January 2017. After seeing my success many other instructors and Training institutes have started their own courses. Most of these are training institutes that just launch courses to earn more and more money.\nI am NOT a Training institute. I am an instructor on Udemy. Training institutes just launch many courses under many different topics to earn more and more money. They also have physical training institutes where they teach. They then create content and launch on Udemy to earn extra income.\nI do not do this. I only create content related to Mainframes and Electronics. I create content exclusively for my website and Udemy.\nYou can go to my YouTube channel and you will find free content and courses worth many hours related to Mainframes.\n\n\nI had 3 courses in 2017\n\n\n1. TSO/ISPF\n2. JCL\n3. VSAM\n\n\nI had announced that I will release 3 more courses soon\n\n\n1. COBOL\n2. DB2 SQL\n3. CICS\n\n\nOther instructors started releasing courses under the same title as mine. They added some extra information to make their courses look better.\n\n\nI have 8 years of experience in Mainframes. I was also the community partner for IBM Z day which was organized by IBM on Nov 21. More than 300 students from this course joined that event. You can search for IBM Z day and on the landing page of the event you will find \"Mainframe Nation\", that is me.\n\n\nSo be rest assured that you are learning from an authentic Udemy Instructor and not from a Training institute.\n\n\n===========================================================================\nThis course is a collection of 4 courses.\n\n\nIt covers TSO/ISPF commands in detail. The ISPF commands taught in the course are exhaustive.\nAfter TSO/ISPF it covers Job Control Language basics.\nIt then teaches COBOL basics.\nVSAM is covered in detail.\nCICS along with 2 projects is explained at the ending of the course.\n\n\nAfter this course, you will have a full overview of the Mainframe environment.\n\n\nMonthly updates: I provide monthly updates to the course. I keep adding new content to the course, so you can keep learning new things about Mainframes.\n\n\nAll this comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\n\nHeard about Mainframe but are not sure how to get started? This course will teach you what you want to know. This is the first step for anyone who wants to learn about Mainframes so you can start a new career as a Mainframe Professional.\n\n\n\n\nThis Course is DIRECT and TO THE POINT.\nOver 19 hours of video content and 200+ lectures.\n5 COBOL Assignments, 2 Mini projects in CICS, and a Practice Test.\nGet all the presentations in the course, so you don't have to take notes while watching the lectures.\nI also UPDATE this course periodically to include even more Videos. New Resources and Articles are also added.\nJoin Over 6,200+ Students Who Have Enrolled in this Udemy Course.\nIf you ever have any questions please feel free to message me directly and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible!\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nBuild a foundation in Mainframe with this tutorial.\nYou will Learn:\nWhat a Mainframe Computer is.\nThe various Technologies and Terminologies associated with Mainframes.\nRunning TSO/ISPF Commands on a Mainframe\nCreating datasets and performing operations on them\nIdentify the different programming languages and Operating systems used on mainframe\nISPF commands\nTSO commands\nJCL in detail\nVSAM in detail\nBasics of CICS\nBasics of COBOL\nand much much more......\n\n\nMainframe is extensively used in large corporations which deal with huge amounts of data every day. Over 70% of the global Fortune 500 companies use Mainframe to run their business for everything from cloud to mobile to big data and analytics. Now, there are 1.1 million customer transactions per second on Mainframes compared with just 40,000 searches on Google per second. IBM is the leading manufacturer of Mainframe Systems.\n\n\nContent and Overview  Through this course of over 18 hours of content, you’ll learn about the Mainframes and establish an understanding of the mainframe system.\nStarting with an overview of the Mainframes, this course will take you through the types of datasets, Operating systems, and data processing used on mainframes.\nWith these basics mastered, the course will take you through TSO commands, will introduce you to ISPF commands, allocation of datasets, and then the different operations you can perform on the datasets.\nIt will then cover JCL, VSAM, COBOL, and CICS.\nUpon completion you will be literate in Mainframe terminology, understand how datasets are created, and how you can use commands to operate on the data in these datasets. You will gain enough knowledge to self-learn further Mainframe topics such as CICS.",

      "description": "General Description & Background Information:\nIn this course, we'll develop a feature rich WiFi based application using the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework), Integrate an ESP-IDF Components & Sensors Library and configure the ESP32 to connect to AWS IoT and Publish/Subscribe messages via AWS IoT Core using the MQTT protocol.\nWiFi is commonly incorporated into many IoT and Industrial IoT solutions and is the basis of the application developed in this course which enables AWS IoT cloud connectivity (or any compatible cloud framework that you choose).\nThe ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power, SoC (system on a chip) series of microcontrollers with integrated WiFi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP-IDF is Espressif's official IoT Development Framework for the ESP32. It provides a self-sufficient SDK (software development kit) for any generic application development, using programming languages such as C and C++. ESP-IDF currently powers millions of devices in the field, and enables building a variety of network-connected products, ranging from simple light bulbs and toys, to big appliances and industrial devices.\nThe ESP-IDF runs FreeRTOS, which is widely used in embedded systems, so the techniques and knowledge you gain while developing IDF-based applications for the ESP32 will translate well should you use other MCUs running FreeRTOS. Additionally, the FreeRTOS kernel of the ESP-IDF is modified for multicore support and we will utilize both cores of the ESP32 in this course.\nIf you are interested in working with the ESP32 and are serious about improving your embedded software development skills while getting to know this incredible SoC, then harnessing the capabilities of the ESP-IDF directly, is an excellent way to go.\nThe IDF is well designed, and once you get going, implementing new features becomes a breeze. Further, any new updates, bugfixes, or changes to the ESP-IDF can be immediately available to you in a flexible way without having to wait for the Arduino port to be written.\nAbout the Course:\nFor many, the best way to learn is to start with a project, which is why in this course, I have created a robust WiFi based application that is able to connect to a cloud framework (AWS IoT in this case), as a learning tool - as opposed to demonstrating tiny examples that you could easily find online.\nThe intended outcome of this course, is that you become comfortable developing applications using the ESP-IDF, gain insight from the application code, inspiration for your own projects and ultimately, save you time in learning to use various components of the ESP-IDF.\nBy working through this project, programming step-by-step through each lesson, I'm confident that you will feel comfortable developing an extensible WiFi based application and integrating a cloud framework using the ESP-IDF, or any application using the ESP-IDF, as it will become apparent how to create a plan of action when using Espressif's IoT Development Framework -> utilizing the Espressif documentation, looking up the API reference and relevant functions, and applying what makes sense to accomplish your goals.\nFurthermore, in this course we will not focus on theory as this is a practical application programming course where you learn by doing. However, I will briefly present background information about the ESP-IDF application programming interface that applies to each section and a brief overview of the application requirements for each section. These overviews will describe what will be accomplished and how we are going to accomplish it using the ESP-IDF.\nLastly, I have chosen to develop this project utilizing the ESP-IDF Eclipse Plugin (or Espressif IDE), which is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and provides an all-in-one installation that includes the Eclipse IDE, and all prerequisites required for ESP32 development; enabling us to get started with programming, flashing and monitoring the ESP32 directly after installing. The setup process is quite easy and efficient, especially for Windows users...\nOther Noteworthy Highlights:\nModular programming style used.\nUtilize both cores of the ESP32 and create tasks using xTaskCreatePinnedToCore.\nUse FreeRTOS message queues for inter-task communication.\nAnd, FreeRTOS binary semaphore for signalization from an interrupt service routine (ISR).\nState machine in WiFi application allows for future growth and customization.\nUse Non-Volatile storage for saving and loading WiFi credentials for connecting the ESP32.\nLearn an efficient workflow for developing an HTTP server and web page.\nLearn how to implement an OTA (over the air) firmware update over the WLAN by sending the update file via a web page to the ESP32.\nLearn how to integrate a cloud framework - we will integrate the ESP AWS IoT framework to enable communication with AWS IoT Core.\nLearn how to publish data (e.g., temperature, humidity and WiFi  RSSI) from the ESP32 to AWS IoT using the MQTT protocol.\nLearn how to subscribe & publish data to and from the AWS Dashboard.\nLearn how to integrate an ESP-IDF Components & Sensors Library.\nHardware:\n- ESP32 DevKit\n- RGB LED and Resistors\n- DHT22 Sensor or any sensor(s) from the ESP-IDF Components & Sensors Library\n- Jumper Wires\n- Breadboard\nSoftware:\n- ESP-IDF Eclipse (Espressif IDE)\nWe'll use Google Chrome for testing the web page functionality",

If you are a Udemy Business user, please check with your employer before downloading software.\n2022 Update: Ready for Apple Silicon (M1 arm64) and Raspberry Pi's!\nTaught by an award-winning Docker Captain and Kubernetes expert, this Course is the result of a collaboration between Bret Fisher, creator of the #1 Docker & Kubernetes course on Udemy, and Jérôme Petazzoni who is a full-time Kubernetes instructor, as well as one of the original Docker Inc DevOps Engineers! We designed the course to take your Kubernetes skills from first-time user to using K8s in production.\nUpdates are a thing! You can count on it. Kubernetes is a huge topic and constantly evolving. As a result, this course will get updated and evolve with it.\nJust starting out with Kubernetes? Perfect. This course starts out assuming you're new to container orchestration.\n[five stars] \"Because Bret knows, lives, breaths and loves his technology stack. The passion and belief always comes through in all of his courses which is why I will always recommend his work.\"  -- Steven Hunt, Udemy Student\nAlready a Docker Mastery student and want to know what's different between the two courses? This course assumes you know Docker and dives deeper into Kubernetes and the community of tools around it. Unlike Docker Mastery, which starts with container 101 and takes you through a lot of tools like local development setups, docker-compose, registry, Docker Hub, Swarm basics, Kubernetes basics, and general Docker best practices... this course starts with Kubernetes 101 and has you learning and practicing each feature and workflow you'll need for running your own Kubernetes clusters, and like all my courses, it focuses on how to use those features with a DevOps mindset and workflow.\nBONUS: This course comes with Slack Chat, Discord Chat and monthly YouTube Live Q&As with me!\n\"...Bret is amazing. You can tell he knows exactly what he is talking about and enjoys helping others. I have never seen someone so involved with his user base as Bret. ...I would seriously buy any course the Bret puts out because I have no doubts that it will be excellent.\"  -- David Olson, Udemy Course Student\nWhy should you learn from me? Why trust me to teach you the best ways to use Kubernetes?   (Hi, I'm Bret, please allow me to talk about myself for a sec):\nI'm A Practitioner. Welcome to the real world: I've got 20 years of sysadmin and developer experience, over 30 certifications, and have been exclusively focused on DevOps and the container ecosystem for my consulting clients and my own companies since Docker's early days. Learn from someone who's helped run thousands of containers across dozens of projects and organizations.\nI'm An Educator. Learn from someone who knows how to make a syllabus: I want to help you. People say I'm good at it. For the last few years, I've trained thousands of people on using Docker & Kubernetes in workshops, conferences, and meetups. See me teach at events like DockerCon, O'Reilly Velocity, GOTO Conf, and Linux Open Source Summit.\nI Lead Communities. Also, I'm a Docker Captain, meaning that Docker Inc. thinks I know a thing or two about containers and that I do well in sharing it with others. In the real-world: I help run two local meetups in our fabulous tech community in Norfolk/Virginia Beach USA. I help online: usually in Slack, Discord, and Twitter, where I learn from and help others.\n\n\n\"This guy is out of this world. I love his patience and carefulness he puts in all of his lessons.\" -- Evan Baird, Udemy Student\nGiving Back: a portion of my profit on this course will be donated to supporting open source and protecting our freedoms online! This course is only made possible by the amazing people creating open source. I'm standing on the shoulders of (open source) giants! Donations will be split between my favorite charities like Electronic Frontier Foundation and Free Software Foundation. Look them up. They're awesome!\n\nThis is a living course and will be updated as Kubernetes features change.\nThis course is designed to be fast at getting you started but also to get you deep into the \"why\" of things. Simply the fastest and best way to learn the latest container skills. Look at the scope of topics in the Session and see the breadth of skills you will learn.\nAlso included is a private Slack Chat group with 40,000+ students and a Discord server with 12,000+ members for getting help with this course and continuing your Docker and DevOps learning with help from myself and other students.\n\"I am really loving your approach to training so far. Concepts are really simplified and easy to understand. Thank you.\"  -- Yemisi Omoijo, Udemy Student\n\nSome of the many cool things you'll do in this course:\nDeploy a microservice app using both CLI and YAML\nInvestigate running apps using CLI, logs, and events\nTest out different local Kubernetes installs like Docker Desktop, microK8s, and minikube\nUse Stern to view multiple container logs at once\nTry different load balancer types with Kubernetes Services\nTroubleshoot container and network performance\nCreate custom labels for controlling load balancer connections\nUse the new Server Dry Run to test changes with the API\nRecover from a failed update, and rollback updates to previous versions\nTest different healthcheck probe types\nUse various app config options with built-in Kubernetes features\nQuickly patch YAML with a single command\nSplit up and deploy YAML from git repos using DevOps practices\nDeploy the Kubernetes Dashboard web GUI securely\nAnd so much more...\nAfter taking this course, you'll be able to:\nKnow when to use Kubernetes for solving real-world problems\nStep through the proper decisions to make when creating healthchecks\nUnderstand how to test healthchecks to ensure they don't create problems\nKnow when to use different types of app configuration like args, envs, ConfigMaps, and more\nDesign a ConfigMap with the Downward API for more flexible deployments\nMake Kubernetes YAML manifests and deploy using infrastructure-as-code DevOps methods\nProtect your keys, TLS certificates, and passwords with encrypted secrets\nLead your team into the future with the latest Kubernetes container skills!\nExtra things that come with this course:\nAccess to the course Slack team, for getting help/advice from me and other students.\nBonus videos I put elsewhere like YouTube, linked to from this course's resources.\nLive Q&A with me on YouTube.\nTons of reference links to supplement this content.\nUpdates to content as Kubernetes changes the features on these topics.",

At the end of the course, you will be able to take my virtual Power BI Developer Internship program that also comes with a Certificate.\n“In God we trust, all others must bring data”.\nThe famous quote by W. Edwards Deming has never been more true than it does in today's world.\nFar gone are the days business decision makers take critical decisions based on haunches, intuition and gut feelings.\nThese days, everyone has come to realize that better and more accurate decisions can be made when data is put into good use. And there is data everywhere. The problem is, there is a shortage in the number of people who can put it into good use.\nThe Power BI course is designed to arm participants with knowledge on using the most highly rated Data Analytics and Business Intelligence Tool, Power BI to go from data to insights.\nParticipants will quickly learn from a Microsoft Certified Trainer and 5 times MVP,  the bolts of the key concepts required to be a Power BI expert.\nComplex concepts are described in simplified manner to make the learners' journey easier.\nAnd not just that, the facilitator will be on ground, supporting any participant with challenges working with Power BI afterwards.\nThis course covers the essentials of Power BI Desktop including:\nData Preparation\nData Modeling\nData Visualization\nDAX\nIn the Data Preparation section, I explained the rules for clean data structure. I also show how to connect Power BI to a system Folder, an approach that eases data updates for reports.\nThe Data Modeling section shows how you can eliminate redundant data from a large data set by separating the tables into Fact and Dimension Tables. You will see how to do this from scratch using a methodical approach.\nIn the Data Visualization section, I have included a write up that will guide you in ensuring that you always select the right kind of charts for your reporting and dashboards\nAlthough, I have created a separate dedicated course for more in-depth explanations on DAX, the DAX content here is an excellent place to start your DAX Knowledge.\nEnjoy the course!",

Dive right in!\nCrave step-by-step explanations for the industry's hottest interview questions? We've got you covered.\nLooking to up your game in competitive programming? Buckle up for a thrilling journey!\n\n\nWelcome to the course!\nIn this course, you'll have a detailed, step by step explanation of hand-picked LeetCode questions where you'll learn about the most popular techniques and problems used in the coding interview, This is the course I wish I had when I was doing my interviews. and it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee\n\n\nWhat is LeetCode?\nLeetCode is essentially a huge repository of real interview questions asked by the most popular tech companies ( Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and more ).\nThe problem with LeetCode is also its advantage, IT'S HUGE, so huge in fact that interviewers from the most popular companies often directly ask questions they find on LeetCode, So it's hard to navigate through the huge amount of problems to find those that really matter, this is what this course is for.\n\nI spent countless hours on LeetCode and I'm telling you that you don't have to do the same and still be able to get a job at a major tech company.\n\nCourse overview :\nIn this course, I compiled the most important and the most popular interview questions asked by these major companies and I explain them, in a true STEP BY STEP fashion to help you understand exactly how to solve these types of questions.\nThe problems are handpicked to ensure complete coverage of the most popular techniques, data structures, and algorithms used in interviews so you can generalize the patterns you learn here on other problems.\n\n\nEach problem gets multiple videos :\nExplanation and intuition video(s): we do a detailed explanation of the problems and its solution, this video will be longer because we will do a step by step explanation for the problems.\nCoding video(s): where we code the solution discussed in the explanation video together.\nWalkthrough video(s): where we go over each line of code and see what it does\n\nWe will use basic python for this course to code our solutions, previous knowledge in python is preferred but NOT required for the coding part of the course.\n\nThe problems are categorised for easier navigation and will be regularly updated with more popular and interesting problems.\n\n\nSome of the stuff this course will cover are :\n\n\nArrays and Strings interview questions.\n\n\nSearching interview questions and algorithms.\n\n\nDynamic Programming interview questions.\n\n\nBacktracking interview questions (  With step by step visualisation ).\n\n\nTrees and Graphs interview questions and algorithms.\n\n\nData structures Like Stacks, Queues, Maps, Linked Lists, and more.\n\n\nIn other words, this course is your one-stop-shop for your dream job.",

Whether you're a complete beginner with only basic computer knowledge, or a professional who already uses MySQL but wants to understand advanced features like transactions, user permissions, triggers and stored procedures, this course can help you.\nDatabase skills are highly in demand in the I.T. industry; everything from websites to multiplayer games are likely to make use of some kind of database.\nMySQL is a free, industrial-strength relational database, very widely used all over the world. In fact, the MySQL Community Server (which this course covers to an advanced level) is the world's most popular open-source database, used by millions of websites.\n\n\nMaster Advanced MySQL Features, Starting from the Ground Up\n\nIn this course you'll begin by learning the basics of creating, querying and adding data to databases using SQL with MySQL. As the course progresses, we'll move on to advanced features, vital for getting the most out of MySQL, including transactions, indexes, isolation levels, views, triggers and stored procedures.\nYou'll learn how to create powerful and efficient databases using SQL, how to read and create EER diagrams, how to understand and implement table relationships like \"many to many\" and \"one to many\", and even how to design databases visually using the free MySQL Workbench client tool.\nBy the end of the course you'll understand MySQL's powerful features to a greater level than probably most professional software developers, and you'll have an understanding of SQL that will help you get to grips with any relational database. You'll be able to create and query your own databases and use transactions, stored procedures, constraints, indices, views and other features to ensure your database is efficient and secure.",

You wrote new code, and after your hard work is done, you find that you broke features that used to work? And you had to waste more hours finding and fixing the bugs... This problem can get solved in most cases by using automated tests, especially unit tests.\nNo experience with automated testing is required. Very basic C++ knowledge is needed, nothing too sophisticated.\nIf you are completely new to Google Test, this course is just for you! If you already have some knowledge, look at the course content and see if you find some more advanced features that you didn't know about.\nGoogle Test works on multiple platforms. You can use any platform you like. In this course, I am doing it on:\nWindows (Visual Studio)\nLinux (CMake or compiling directly from the command line)\nOther platforms will be added if you suggest them to me\nThere are slides and hands-on coding examples in each section. I recommend that you try the examples and play around with them.\nHere's a brief presentation of the course content:\nOptional videos: Setting up on Windows (Visual Studio) and on Linux (CMake and GCC)\nBasics of unit testing:\nUnit test structure\nAssertions - numeric, string, exceptions\nReusing code between tests (test fixtures, SetUp() and TearDown())\nParameterized tests:  generate multiple tests by writing one single function.\nMocking - replacing real objects with fakes that you can control):\nBasics\nSetting the behaviour of mocks\nMatchers",

Sustaining without OOPS knowledge is difficult for any ABAPer. Now a days all clients/companies are preferring to develop their projects in object oriented approach. Object orientation simplifies software design to make it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) represents a different way of thinking in writing software. The beauty of OOP lies in its simplicity.\nProvide properties like data hiding(encapsulation) & code reusability(inheritance) with more data security. Better performance with less consumption of time. Helps in future orientation. Simple and it much easier to maintain as compare to procedural ABAP programming. OOPS language allows to break the program into the bit-sized problems that can be solved easily (one object at a time). The new technology promises greater programmer productivity, better quality of software and lesser maintenance cost. OOPS systems can be easily upgraded from small to large systems.\n\n\nAdvantages of OOPS Concept in ABAP:\nIn OOABAP, programs are divided into objects leading to better and powerful data management.\nProvide properties like data hiding(encapsulation) & code reusability(inheritance) with more data security.\nBetter performance with less consumption of time.\nHelps in future orientation.\nSimple and it much easier to maintain as compare to procedural ABAP programming.\nRelatively flexible & adaptable to changing business needs.\nObject Oriented programming languages include features such as “Class”, “Instance”, “Inheritance” and “Polymorphism” that increase the power and flexibility of an object.",

After following this training you can add this precious skill to you resume.\nOur mission is to ensure you can start using terraform with Azure in your organisation to automate the provisioning of cloud infrastructure. After taking this course, you'll have the confidence of using Terraform in your organisation.\nLet's go and happy learning!\nTerraform allows you to write your cloud infrastructure setup in code. If you have used Microsoft Azure before, you'll know that setting up your infrastructure using the Microsoft Azure Portal (the Web UI) is far from ideal. Terraform allows you use Infrastructure as Code, rather than executing the steps manually by going through the correct steps in the Microsoft Azure Portal.\nThis course will teach you how to write HCL, the HashiCorp Configuration Language, to bring up your infrastructure on Microsoft Azure. Terraform is cloud agnostic, so the terraform skills learned in this course are easily transferable to other cloud providers. After teaching you the terraform basics, the course will continue setting up simple architectural patterns, like VMs, to get you used to how terraform works. Once you have a good feeling of how you can use terraform, we dive a bit deeper into the possible Microsoft Azure Services you can spin up, like Autoscaling, LoadBalancing, MSSQL & MySQL, CosmosDB, Storage Accounts, Azure AD, and others. Also covered is advanced terraform usage, like using remote state, for/foreach loops, and conditionals/functions.",

      "description": "Here is what students of this course have to say about it:\n\"Absolutely what a software architect needs to know about Microservices architecture, great explanation!!\" - Saibal\n\"Amazing course, love all the knowledge i learn and it's really interesting understand how this work. Good job!\" - Tomas\n\"This course ticked all the boxes. It was presented well, good examples and a good mix between theory and real examples\" - Shafiq\n\n\n\n\nMicroservices Architecture is the most popular Software Architecture style these days.\nAlmost every new software designed and built, is doing so using Microservices. And not just that, but there are a lot of legacy applications that are being migrated to Microservices Architecture.\nCompanies such as Netflix, Amazon, Facebook. Uber and lost more have migrated to Microservices, and it became the de-facto standard for Software Architecture.\nThat means that a lot of Software Architects are looking for resources about Microservices, but until now - there was no a single, comprehensive course that covered all aspects of Microservices.\nAnd this course does just that.\nIf you'll take this course, you'll know everything there is to know about Microservices.\nWe start from the very basics - why do we need Microservices and what problems do they come to solve? - and go to the most advanced concepts such as Service Mesh and CI/CD.\nBy the end of this course you'll become a real expert in Microservices, and you'll be able to design advanced, robust Microservices-based systems.\nHere is a partial list of what we'll talk about in this course:\n- History of Microservices\n- Problems they solve\n- The 9 attributes of Microservices\n- The Architecture Process of Microservices\n- Testing\n- Service Mesh\n- Common Anti-Patterns\nAnd lots and lots more...\nBut I want to make this course as practical as possible, and for this reason - I've included in it a real-world case study. In this case study we'll design, together, a system from the ground up using the concepts we've learned in this course, since I really believe theory alone is not enough.\n\n\nBut that's not all...\nAt the end of this course, you'll be able to download the Microservices Architecture Checklist, a comprehensive checklist that will guide you through the process of designing Microservices systems, and provide a great summary of what we'll learn in this course.\nUsing this checklist will help you design the best Microservices Architecture possible, will help you decide whether you should actually utilize Microservices, and, most important - will make you a better architect.\n\n\nThis course takes you from the absolute basics of Microservices to the most advanced topics, known only to few. Completing this course will give you all the knowledge required for designing Microservices systems, and, as a bonus, will put you in a great position when looking for your next job.\nNo other course covers this topic in such a comprehensive and thorough way. I've put all my 20+ years of experience with hundreds of clients in this course, and I'm sure you will greatly benefit from it.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do my students have to say about my courses?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"well done - The course was very practical\" - Sam\n\"Good explanation on the topics covered, \"Soft Skills\" section is a great addition of topics\" - Sergio\n\"[The course] given me the confidence to go out to the market and advertise myself as such [an Architect]\" - Mathew\n\"Life Changing\" - Arivazhagan\nAnd lots more...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is this course for?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAny person who is involved in Software Architecture & development, even system analysts, can profit from this course.\nThat includes:\n- Software Architects\n- Junior developers\n- Senior developers\n- Architects\n- Anyone who is interested in software architecture.\nIf you're not sure if this course is for you - drop me a note!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat are the prerequisites for this course?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIt's a good idea to have some basic knowledge about software architecture, but it's not a must.\nIn any case, you don't have to have any prior knowledge of Microservices!\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Me\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been in the software industry for more than 20 years, and a Software Architect for more than 17 years, working with a variety of clients - Fortune 100 enterprises, start-ups, govt. entities, defense, telco, banking, and lots more.\nI'm an avid speaker and trainer, having trained thousands of students in various courses.\nI love what I do, and my greatest passion (well, besides my family...) is designing modern, practical, and reliable systems for my clients, using the best possible architecture patterns.",

      "description": "With more than 400,000 customers worldwide, SAP has established itself over the years as a reference in terms of ERP.\nRare are the software so powerful, and allowing to adapt to all types of business.\nIt allows a notable improvement of the processes, increases the performance of the companies and especially increases the communication and the exchange of information between service with its single data base.\nTraining on SAP today is clearly an excellent choice for the future. The application areas are constantly expanding and the need for companies to improve productivity and quality is growing.\nHowever, it must be recognized that it is as powerful as it is complex, which may seem disconcerting at first.\nThis training, mainly focused on SAP Warehouse Management, a module widely used in companies, addresses in a clear and detailed way all its functionalities in the latest version of SAP ERP.\nWho is this training for?\nThe topics covered are not only of interest to those who work directly with the WM module of SAP. It will be of interest to all those who work in relation with it, such as the Material Manamgement (or MM) module, the Production Planning (or PP) module or the Quality Manamgement (or QM) module.\nBut not only!\nIt should also be of interest to warehouse managers, supervisors or managers in the distribution industry who would like to understand in depth the functionalities that are already implemented in their company, or the functionalities that they should consider for the future, as the software offers so many possibilities.\nSince this course covers the basics necessary to understand the entire module, people wishing to make a career change in IT and more specifically in SAP are welcome.\nHowever, I advise you to have a taste for logistics as well as a minimal knowledge of SAP. If this is not the case, I refer you to my training \"Initiation SAP beginner - The Basics\" before venturing into this one.\nWhat will I learn?\nThis course is designed to be very complete and is divided in an optimal way to allow you to follow at your own pace and to easily consult each small chapter.\nWe will cover the following topics:\nThe basic function of a warehouse\nInventory Management\nStock movements\nGood Receipt Process\nGood Issue Process\nStock Transfer / Bin to Bin\nPicking strategies\nPutaway strategies\nIntegration with other modules (PP / QM)\nThe different inventory procedures\nStorage unit management\nHazardous products\nAnd much more (Waehouse Monitor, Mobile Data Entry, RFID or EWM)\nA test of 25 questions ends this training, inspired by the SAP LE-WM certification. All answers are clearly detailed and accompanied by a Print Screen\nEach part of the course contains downloadable documents that summarize the concepts covered in the video.\nNo need to take notes, we did it for you!\nHow will I learn?\nThe video materials, articles and downloadable documents have been created to make learning enjoyable.\nNo reading of Powerpoint or other documents !\nWe wanted to make it more modern, more polished.\nIn addition, each concept will be clearly explained before moving on to the \"Software\" part with the help of these explanation videos.\nYou don't need to have SAP installed on your PC. Everything will be shown to you directly in a real environment.\nFor those who would like to go further and practice directly in the software, I can recommend the Michael Management website, to get a \"Live Access\" pass in the ECC 6 with ehP 8 on HANA environment. You will find the link in the last section of the course.\nIt is with this solution that we have created this course.\nWhat's next?\nAt the end of this training, you will have learned a lot, not only about the SAP WM module but also about other modules such as IM, PP or QM. But also, you will have learned about Supply Chain.\nYou'll have everything you need to become a WM consultant.\nBut as we know that it is sometimes difficult to go beyond the teaching and that, in concrete cases, one can easily get lost, we continue to give you our help and support:\nBy updating our training courses on a regular basis according to your feedback\nBy an exchange system via Udemy, notably the Q&A but also by message\nBy an email address, for more complex cases where it would be necessary to send us files\nWe want to be close to our community, and above all, to support you in your success.\n\"What you are tomorrow depends on what you do today\".\nSo take the plunge. Don't hesitate. The best investment you can make is to invest in yourself!\n\n\nKey User Training Team\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Our SAP training courses on Udemy are created by experienced consultants who are certified in their chosen field.

It is the next generation Big data engine for Stream processing. If Hadoop represents 3G and Spark is 4G, then Apache Flink can be seen as the 5G in Big data stream processing frameworks. Unlike Spark which was not a true Stream processing framework (rather a makeshift), Apache Flink is a TRUE Streaming engine with added capacity to perform Batch, Graph, Table processing and also to run Machine Learning algorithms.\nApache Flink is the latest Big data technology and is rapidly gaining momentum in the market. It is assumed that same like Apache Spark replaced Hadoop, Flink can also replace Spark in the coming near future.\nDemand of Flink in market is already swelling. Many big companies from multiple industry domains have already started using Apache Flink to process their Real-time Big data and thousands other are diving into.\nWhat's included in the course ?\nComplete Apache Flink concepts explained from Scratch to Real-Time implementation.\nEach and Every Apache Flink concept is explained with a HANDS-ON Flink code of it.\nIncludes even those concepts, the explanation to which is not very easily available online.\nFor Non-Java developer's help, All Flink Java codes are explained line by line in such a way that even a non -technical person can understand.\nFlink codes and Datasets used in lectures are attached in the course for your convenience.\nAll the codes are updated with latest Flink version.\nImplement 3 Real-time Case Studies using Flink.",

      "description": "Fact: Kubernetes Is The Most In-Demand Skill Of 2019 In The IT Industry.\n\n\nAnd it looks to be the same again in 2020.\n\nIf you find it hard to keep track of how everything is working together in Kubernetes…\n\n\n… or you feel overwhelmed trying to understand the fundamental structures of all the Kubernetes objects and how they interact with each other…\n\n\nI’ve got you covered.\n\n\nThis course is designed to get you straight into action without an endless amount of complex theory and reading.\n\n\nHi, I’m TJ Addams.\n\n\nWith nearly 10 years in IT project roles, I spent a lot of time teaching over 16,000+ people on- and offline. So they can become ready to use their skills in production, even without prior experience.\n\n\nI simplify all the processes new students need to understand. And I provide a clear roadmap on what to learn to produce results fast.\n\n\nEverything I teach is based on what is used in industry and cutting out what isn’t.\n\n\nI operated in lead support roles to Project Sponsors, Platform Engineers, Solutions Architects, Developers, and Testers & have worked with UK Government partners to develop real-time systems underpinned by Terraform. I also have operated in diverse sectors including consulting, technology services and digital transformation; private online healthcare; and biomedical research.\n\n\nThis allows me to bring you unique insights way beyond the trivial \"hello world\" type of examples...\n\n\n... coupled with lots of demos, tips, and advice on how it’s used in industry. I cover the nitty-gritty to help you stand out from the crowd and learn the things most engineers don't even know about.\n\n\nWho Else Wants An Understanding Of K8S Concepts The Easy Way?\n\n\nDiscover how to set up your environment to follow along with the exercises. Be able to create and deploy production-ready Kubernetes Clusters and much more…\n\n\nThis course is designed to give you a fast track solution, so you can apply what you learn in under 3.5 hours.\n\nIt takes you through creating your first resources from the ground-up and gives a clear picture of how you would use Kubernetes on the job with exclusive insights from a DevOps consultant. By the end of the course you will be a Kubernetes master!\n\n90% Hands-On / 10% Theory / 0% Wasting Time\n\n\nLike all my other courses, this one focuses heavily on real hands-on experience from the get-go.\n\n\nSo instead of sleep-inducing PowerPoint slides, you’ll get step-by-step video tutorials coupled with quizzes and challenges to get you comfortable with your newly acquired knowledge immediately.\n\nNo more overwhelm. No more long hours trying to understand complex theory. No more wasting time.\n\n\nSo even if you’re a Kubernetes beginner who wants to start using Kubernetes for real projects quickly, this is the course for you.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Get Inside This Course\n\n\nA rock-solid guide to Kubernetes\n\n\nTools of the trade: how to setup Clusters\n\n\nLatest DevOps insights and exclusive looks at the next tool to change the industry\n\n\nEXPERT LEVEL breakdown on auto-scaling—a MUST-WATCH if you work with Java (You won’t find this anywhere else on why you can’t scale Java apps and why so many people fail)\n\n\nThe industry best-practices on how to use Kubernetes\n\n\nFull breakdown on networking—easily the biggest area people new to Kubernetes get stuck with\n\nA 30-day 100% money-back guarantee\n\n\nHere’s What Other People Say About This Course:\n\n\n“Thank you very much for delivering such a great course on K8s. The way you explained concepts and demos are really awesome.”\n\n“I'm a novice when comes to container-based deployment. This course is really awesome and just enough to get you going with some basic concept, some useful gotchas, and basic concept to embark on the journey of container deployment/orchestration using Kubernetes. Thank you so much for putting together such wonderful training content. Thumbs up !!”\n\n\n“I had some casual Kubernetes experience from doing a few deployments here and there but having someone with experience actually explaining what the concepts mean is far better. Amazing.”\n\n\nBy the end of this course you’ll…\nCreate pods, replica sets and deployment\n\n\nIndustry best-practices\n\n\nAdvanced Kubernetes networking\n\n\nHow to setup ingresses, load balancers, node ports and cluster IP's\n\n\nPVs, PVCs, ConfigMaps and more storage\n\n\nHow to create and deploy production-ready Kubernetes clusters\n\n\nHPAs and their limitations based on real-world experience\n\n\nMuch, much more\n\n\nGet your synapses ready to learn your next high in-demand skill for 2020 and beyond.\n\n\nBuy now.",

      "description": "PS: Please READ all the points before proceeding\n\n\n***Composer - DEPRECATED - it is NO more supported for Fabric updates***\n\nBut it is still a GREAT way to learn Fabric Blockchain fundamentals & for carrying out POC. For production grade apps It is suggested that you take a look at my course \"Mastering Chaincode Development using GoLang ....\"\n\nPlease do NOT join the course if you are NOT comfortable with coding\nFocus of the course is Composer based application development. Course will NOT teach you how to use ALL the various utilities/tools for hypereldger infrastructure component setup.\nCourse is NOT for Operators or Infrastructure engineers *but* you are welcome to try as it would help you in building a strong foundational knowledge. Take a look at my other Fabric courses if you are an Operations person.\nYou MUST have a basic understanding of Blockchain technology. Do take a preview before joining.\nThis course will NOT teach you Javascript or any Javascript framework to develop UI\nYou MUST be comfortable in installing software & tools on your machine. Course requires many tools to be installed.\nPlease read the Pre-Requisites before signing up\nTry out the lectures in preview - if you have difficulty understanding the lectures/accent....I request you NOT to join\nIf you are still with me lets continue :-)\nBackground\nDemand for Blockchain technologists is going up as multiple enterprises (& startups) are looking to achieve efficiency or/and create new business models enabled by the Blockchain technologies. Bitcoin & Ethereum have proven to the world that Blockchain technologies can change the way we do business. The challenge with these technologies is that they were both built ground up for public domain applications and are not always suitable for building an enterprise grade application. Hyperldger project, a Linux foundation initiative is driven by the industry leaders to build Blockchain technology(s) that would provide a platform for creating Enterprise Blockchain Applications.\nBusiness | Enterprise Blockchain Applications\nThe obvious question you may have at this point is, what do I mean by \"Enterprise Blockchain Applications\". The idea is that Blockchain technology for Business (or enterprise) would need to have certain characteristics that do not necessarily apply to the public domain Blockchain technology such as Ethereum. Characteristics that are desired\nPermissioning,\nNetwork support | operation\nSmart contract management\nControl on how transactions are validated\nTrust management\nScaling, Performance, Throughput\n...\nHyperledger Fabric | Composer Framework\nHyperledger Fabric is a \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" a.k.a. Blockchain technology that has been built ground up with the needs of the \"Business Blockchain Applications\" in mind. Composer is a development framework that accelerates the development of Business Blockchain applications of Fabric platform.\nThis course will teach you how to develop Fabtric Blockchain Application using Composer.\nCourse Approach?\nThis course takes the approach of “Learn by doing”. Students are encouraged to try out all aspects of the technologies on their own after each lecture. Almost all of the concepts discussed in the lectures are shown in action by way code samples etc. The demo code used in the lectures is available for download from GitHub so that students can change the code to try out new things.\nMultiple quizzes in each section will validate student’s knowledge. Coding exercises will help them understand the concepts better & gain confidence.\nCourse Outline\n#1 Build a foundation - covers Blockchain concepts + Hyperledger project-fabric-composer\n#2 Introduction to  Hyperledger Fabric & Composer Technology\n#3 Setting up the development tools - (Docker, NodeJS, Fabric, Composer tools ...)\n#4 Fabric under the hood - student will learn how the Fabric technology works\n#5 Learn to use the Composer tools   (Modeling, Yo generators, REST Server, CLI, Playground  ...)\n#6 ACME Airline Blockchain Application : We will develop a Network application for this fictitious Airline\nBusiness network modelling\nSmart contracts development\nTransaction processors - coding in Javascript\nClient side code - in Javascript\nParticipant management\n#7 Composer SDK/API\n#8 Transaction flow in Fabric - unravel some of the mysteries :)\nHow can this course help you?\nMany enterprises today are embarking on building Blockhain applications for their business domain. At this time the focus is on trying out the technologies by way of Proof of Concepts | Pilots. This course can put you on track to build the pilots/PoC in a very short period of time (~3 weeks)\nInformation of Hyperledger frabric (& Composer) is available online and freely.....so why take this course?\nThere are known challenges : The author of this course have gone through the development cycle many times and have taken care of describing the known challenges (& pitfalls) and solutions so, students won't struggle....& spend time on learning rather than searching for solutions on google :)\nLearning curve is steep : Although information is available it would take new students considerable amount of time to digest & understand. The course has been designed to accelerate the learning process without overwhelming the students with too many details.\nCoding guides | experience is limited : For every topic discussed in the course, there is a sample code. Seeing things in action and trying out the code will accelerate the learning\nTime to market : Taking this course will prepare the student for the challenge - delivery of a working Fabric PoC/Pilot in 3 weeks is the goal :)       [Assuming student spends 2 Hour/Day]",

How many times did you change the software and didn't test it all? Testing software is an art. And surprisingly easy! During the videos, we will see many real world classes that need to be tested.\nIn a nutshell, you will see that writing a test is almost like writing all those \"main methods\" you have written during your first programming lessons. Then, you will see how to do it professionally. And by professional, I mean learn how to have a good testing code, how to simulate databases using mock objects, and even how to practice Test-Driven Development, which is about writing the test code prior to the production code (and yes, that are many advantagens when doing it!).\nGood developers write good code. And good code is, among many other things, code that work. Let's learn how to test software and never have a bug again!",

      "description": "This course will teach you all you need to know about Unit Testing and Test Driven Development in Android applications. It's designed to get you up and running with unit testing using Android Studio and JUnit in no time by working through a series of carefully crafted hands-on exercises.\n\n\nWhat's unit testing?\nUnit testing is a practice of writing narrowly scoped automated tests to ensure correctness of your production code. These automated tests allow you to write code that has fewer bugs and is safer to work with in the long term. If you do unit testing, you can write higher quality Android applications that are easier to maintain.\n\n\nWhat's test driven development?\nTest driven development (TDD) is a set of special unit testing techniques that mandate writing the tests before the production code. While TDD might look complicated on the first sight, I'll show you that it's actually the easiest way to do unit testing.\n\n\nWhat's the importance of unit testing in Android?\nUnit testing is widely considered one of the most important skills for senior Android developers to have. It's a great investment into medium- and long-term professional career growth.\nIf bugs slip into your Android application, it can be very challenging to locate and fix them. Furthermore, even after you fix the bugs, it can take days or even weeks until all your users update the app to actually receive these fixes. That's a tough reality of professional Android developer's job. Fortunately, you can greatly reduce the number of bugs in your applications by unit testing your code!\nTo make your applications unit testable, you'll need to write decoupled code that follows best design principles. This automatically guarantees easier long-term maintenance. In addition, unit testing makes developing Android applications easier and spares a lot of time when done right.\n\n\nWhy you should take this course:\nThis course is designed to introduce you to professional grade Android unit testing in the shortest amount of time. I assume that you already know Java and have experience building Android apps. Therefore, this course will not waste your time on Java and Android basics.\nYou'll practice what you learn in this course with carefully designed exercises and gradually build up your unit testing skill.\nThis course is aimed at professional Android developers who have no prior experience in unit testing. However, I'm confident that even experienced Android unit testers will find much new and valuable information in it.\n\nSo, if you're interested in learning professional grade unit testing in Android apps - this course is for you.",

      "description": "A product backlog is an artifact that captures the entire body of work pertaining to an application. This is the most significant artifact for a Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban or any other Agile framework team since all the work that an Agile team does emanates from or is related to what is in their product backlog. And this is why, when it comes to creating, updating, and maintaining a product backlog, it needs to  ample diligence and focus. This 2 + hours course is aimed at teaching you all you need to know about creating, updating & maintaining an Agile product backlog. I believe that learning by doing is one of the most powerful ways of gaining knowledge and that is basis of how I designed this course. In this course  you will learn by doing i.e you will learn how to create an actual product backlog for an e-commerce web application. You will see how to create a product backlog from organically from scratch and learn how to incorporate and address various aspects and actions pertaining to a product backlog such as identification and breaking down an application into user stories, epics and themes, writing of such entities, ordering, dependency management, splitting of user stories, etc. The thing that makes this course impactful is that it uses one of the most prevalent type of application in the world - an e-commerce application - to develop a product backlog. The numerous examples that you will see come to fruition from scratch will help further drill down the knowledge.\nOne more thing, The reason I felt compelled to create such an offering was that I simply could not find a course anywhere online that demonstrated how to actually create a product backlog. There are lots of courses on agile and user stories, etc. but all of them, without exception, trade in regurgitating academic information. Again, this is where the course differentiates itself by miles in that it teaches by doing.\nI do believe that this course is very likely still the only course of its kind in terms of its approach and concrete, actionable knowledge that it conveys.",

We use industry-standard real eCommerce RESTful API to practice testing using Python programming language.\nWe will build a framework using one of the most popular testing tools PyTest. The framework we will build will be extendable and scalable to be able to include frontend (Selenium WebDriver) testing.\nThe skills learned here are used in any Web Services testing.\n\n\nBONUS: SQL Crash Course\nYou will learn how to use SQL to read and write to/from databases. We will use MySQL for our main test site so we will use the same database to learn SQL. SQL (sequel) is a critical skill for any test engineer (manual or automation needs to know basic SQL).\nThe crash course in SQL is short and precise. Topics only directly related to automation are covered. Great addition to your resume and interview process.\n\n\nA critical addition to your resume\nIf you are getting into the QA world or you are looking to advance your career, having API testing skills will accelerate your success. Python is one of the most popular languages to use in software testing, and knowing how to use it for API/Backend testing will expand your pool of possibilities.\nIn addition to using Python for API/Backend testing, the tools we will use are a great addition to your resume. We will be using industry-standard tools that can be applied to several tasks beyond API testing.\nAfter completion of this course, you will be able to go through interviews as if you have API testing experience. You will also have plenty of APIs to test and practice.\n\n\nContent and Overview\nIn this course, we will spend some time creating an eCommerce application on our local machine. We will install a package that includes a web server and database. Using this package we will install WordPress and install necessary plugins to make it an eCommerce application. The eCommerce application gives us all the APIs we will test.\nWe have access to the database so we will test API data against the database. We will create an efficiently structured test framework and learn how to use Python to perform our verification.\nWe will also learn how to use a Python test runner tool \"pytest\" see why test runner tools are critical for automation testing.\n\n\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\n35 + lectures (continuously adding more examples)\nPlenty of APIs (endpoints) for you to practice with beyond this class\nEnough material and examples to be able to create a project and maintain a GitHub repo\nIndustry-standard tools to add to your resume.\nLike\nMySQL Workbench\nMAMP (package with Apache, MySQL)\nWordPress\nWooCommerce",

Learn to create a local Ubuntu environment inside Windows efficiently, step-by-step.\nMay 23, 2021 Update – Updated Odoo 14 build with new features, included as a downloadable resource in the first lecture.\nCourse Overview\nMastering Odoo Development – Technical Fundamentals is a comprehensive technical training from Odoo Class. This course takes you from the basics of installing Odoo all the way to developing full applications. You’ll gain a deep understanding of how the Odoo Framework works and build the confidence to create your own professional Odoo modules.\nThe course now includes the complete application built during training. Because Odoo’s API has remained fundamentally consistent since version 8, you can apply what you learn here to Odoo 8–18 with minimal adjustments.\nFor easiest compatibility, following along in Odoo 9 is recommended, but the lessons adapt smoothly to all later versions.\nNote for Subscribers: If you’re an active Odoo Class subscriber, this course is already included in your subscription—simply log in to access it.\nWhy Learn with Odoo Class?\nOdoo Class is recognized as the #1 source of Odoo video training and workshops worldwide. Google “Odoo Class” and you’ll see our long track record of successful, high-quality training programs. Over the past two years, we’ve produced 100+ professional Odoo videos, culminating in this definitive Udemy Master Course.\nIf you want to customize Odoo, become an Odoo developer, or finally connect the dots you’ve been missing while self-teaching, this course is for you.\nWhat Makes This Course Different?\n1. Beginner-Friendly, Even Without Python Experience\nWhile prior Python knowledge helps, it’s not required. We guide you from zero—adding fields to models, customizing views, creating menus and actions—right through to functional Python scripts. Even without coding, you’ll learn multiple ways to customize Odoo.\n2. Hands-On Installation & Setup\nWe walk you through installing Ubuntu (via WSL on Windows), configuring Odoo locally, and preparing a development environment—step-by-step, so you can start customizing within 30 minutes of installation.\n3. Understand the Odoo Framework\nWe go beyond “copy-paste coding” to show how models, views, and actions fit together. You’ll master:\nExtending Odoo models with custom fields\nModifying views to present exactly what users need\nCreating custom menus and search filters\nAdding functional fields and calculations\nUsing domains and context for dynamic applications\nWriting Python scripts to import and translate data\nModifying Odoo reports\n4. Real Business Case Study\nRather than disconnected tutorials, we follow a real-world, requirements-driven example—extending product records to store richer business data.\n5. Continually Updated Content\nWe regularly add new lectures and updates to cover emerging Odoo versions and development practices, ensuring you always have relevant, practical skills.\nTestimonials\n“The videos are great and have really opened my eyes to the capabilities with Odoo.” – Joey K.\n“I recommend Odoo Class for anyone wanting to learn Odoo.

You'll gain the best practice knowledge of how to implement NetApp storage in a real world environment, and the hands-on skills to configure your system.\nI am a full-time professional NetApp instructor who has been entrusted by NetApp since 2007 to develop and deliver training courses for their own engineers and partners. I have also designed multiple training courses for the largest service providers in Asia Pacific such as Verizon, Telstra, and the Australian National Broadband Network. I provide mentoring and support for my company's systems engineers as they deploy NetApp storage systems and I worked in the field for over ten years before focusing on passing my knowledge on to others.\nThe format of the course lessons is a full explanation of the topic theory, then a live demonstration in the lab where I show you the complete configuration using first the NetApp System Manager GUI and then the Command Line Interface.\nWe're going to go through the complete configuration of the system in a logical manner, from taking it out of the box to the final tweaks to ensure best performance and availability, and covering off all the NetApp features as we go.\nAt over 40 hours long taking the course can seem daunting, but because it's laid out in a logical manner you can pick and choose the parts which are important to you. If you're a professional storage engineer who's going to be working on NetApp systems day to day, then skip the beginner sections and watch the rest. If you're new to storage, then just watch the theory part of the lessons and the GUI configuration sections you need.\nIf later you need to know the best practice to configure a feature in your environment and want to see a  step-by-step configuration example, you know it's all here.\n\nThe course is updated to cover the latest features and updates whenever a new version of ONTAP 9 is released by NetApp. The topics covered apply to all versions of the operating system.\nA verifiable course certificate stating you have completed this advanced level NetApp ONTAP training will be provided at the end of the course. This will prove to potential future employers that you have the knowledge and skills necessary to be a real asset to their company.\nAs a student in this course, you will get an answer to every question you ask in the Ask Question section. I love interaction with my students- anything you want to know, please ask.\nThe course comes with an unconditional risk-free 30 day money-back guarantee - that's my personal promise of your success.\nThank you for taking the time to read about the course.

But we also go into detail - you'll be learning how to use Istio in real production scenarios - and you'll be looking at the inner workings of Istio.\nYou can run this course on your own computer, using Minikube (8Gb of Host Ram required) - you don't need a cloud provider, although you can also run the course there - anywhere that you can run Kubernetes!\nAfter a brief talk about what Istio is, we go straight into a hands-on demo, where you'll experience how Istio can solve difficult problems on live projects.\nThen you'll find out the details of:\nTraffic Management\nTelemetry\nVisualisation (with Kiali)\nDistributed Tracing (with Jaeger)\nUsing Grafana to monitor network traffic\nHow to deploy canary releases\nHow to do \"Dark Releases\"\nIstio VirtualServices and DestinationRules\nLoad Balancing and Session Affinity\nIstio Gateways\nResilience testing with Fault Injection\nCircuit Breaking/Outlier Detection\nSecuring cluster traffic with Mutual TLS (mTLS)\nThe \"learning curve\" for Istio is steep - which is why I've designed this course to be as clear and understandable as possible, and I hope with the hands-on demos, you'll also have fun along the way.

Scratch, the programming language we use (developed by MIT), is so fun that it makes programming seem like a game.\nWe'll learn by doing. The course is designed so that you create the games and applications with your own two hands. But what makes this course truly unique is the teaching method I've used live 4+ years. We learn a variety of computer science topics, but we hide the complexity behind characters, animations, analogies and fun!\nThat's because, in these carefully designed lessons, we train our intuition to make sense of what we want to achieve and how to get there. This will help you quickly master the basics. After this course, you'll learn text-based programming languages at a blazing speed and quickly make sense of any piece of code.\nThe content is designed to be fun! We learn to create animations and cool effects and we create clones of some of the most popular games, such as Flappy Bird or Pac-Man. The games are handpicked to optimize learning computer science topics while having fun along the way. I will also update the course on a regular basis with new content - and challenges!\nThis course is designed for\nparents or teachers who want to give their children the best skills and most fun\nkids and beginners who want to learn to code games\nanyone new to programming who doesn't know where to start\nI can't wait to have you in the course!\nThe course is regularly updated with new material, tips and tricks that you can use in your games and projects!\nNote: this course is intended for purchase as an adult.

      "description": "Architecting software systems is a skill that is in huge demand, but it is not a readily available skill. To understand why this skill is rare to find, let's go through a few lines from Martin Fowler's blog on architecture.\nHe says: Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is. It means that the heart of thinking architecturally about software is to decide what is important, (i.e. what is architectural), and then expend energy on keeping those architectural elements in good condition. For a developer to become an architect, they need to be able to recognize what elements are important, recognizing what elements are likely to result in serious problems should they not be controlled.\nIt takes a number of years for a developer to learn enough to become an architect. This learning largely depends on the kind of opportunities that you get in your career. Often these opportunities are limited to specific areas of work only.  However, to be an architect, you must possess extensive technical knowledge of as many areas as possible. You must understand all the complexities and challenges in different parts of a system. You need the ability to make upfront decisions by understanding various trade-offs. You should be able to foresee or anticipate critical problems that a system can face during its evolution.\nThis is where the 'Developer To Architect' course can be very useful for you. It assumes that you already have great development skills, and it builds from there. It extensively covers architecting non-functional properties of a system, handling of large-scale deployments, and internal working of popular open-source products for building software solutions.\nTo give you some details of what is specifically covered:\nArchitecting non-functional properties like Performance, Scalability, Reliability, Security.\nLarge-scale deployment and operations using Docker containers and Kubernetes.\nInternal working of popular open-source products like Node.js, Redis, Kafka, Cassandra, ELK stack, Hadoop, etc for confidently architecting software solutions.\nIn short, this course will help you learn everything you need to become a 'true' architect in a very short period of time.",

      "description": "The ONLY course that teaches all the TypeScript Fundamentals required to work with Angular !\n---\nSample of the reviews:\nVery clear explanation ! Perfect course to begin with Typescript ! -Brice Lallement\nIt was a good starting point for a beginner like me. I did not use JavaScript before, but the TypeScript course was an excellent introduction. Thank you Bharath Thippireddy - Ana Nasture\n---\nAll source code is available for download\nResponsive Instructor - All questions answered within 24 hours\nProfessional video and audio recordings (check the free previews)\n----\nIf you are JavaScript developer who wants to learn TypeScript in depth and also master then this course is for you.If you are a developer with any other object oriented programming language background and want to learn AngularJS in the future then this course is for you too .TypeScript is is used by many popular JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS , VueJS etc by. You should have used JavaScript before you take this course.\nJavaScript does not use structures like classes  to implement object oriented programming.This can be confusing for programmers coming from Java ,C++ or python background.This course covers how TypeScript provides structures like Java ,Python etc that will make our life easier.It will also be easy for you to learn newer versions of JavaScript in like ES 6/7 in the future once you master TypeScript.\nWhat Will I Learn?\nLearn how to define variables using data types\nCreate functions that take optional, default and variable number of arguments\nCreate and use arrow functions\nUse Interfaces to define a contract for objects , functions and arrays\nUse the different types of variable prefixes like let and const\nLearn the key Object Oriented Principles\nCreate objects using classes\nReuse Objects through Inheritance\nUse the different access modifiers\nEncapsulate your classes/objects\nWhat are the requirements?\n\nVisual Studio Code IDE ,Web Browser(Chrome, Firefox, IE etc)",

As the course develops will look at various aspects of Terraform and how we can use these to build our deployment. Alongside this we will use various resources in Azure, I will explain what these are, how these work and then we will deploy these using Terraform. Just set expectations this course isn’t an Azure course. So while I won’t go into any great depth on each Azure resource I do provide an overview of the most salient features.\nThis course has been developed to be as practical as possible, most of the lessons are follow along in nature.

Then Azure databricks is used to transform the RAW data to the most cleanest form of data and then we are using Azure Synapse Analytics to load the clean data and finally using Microsoft Power BI to integrate with Azure synapse analytics to build an interactive dashboard. Also, we are using Microsoft Entra ID ( Previously called as AAD) and Azure Key Vault for the monitoring and governance purpose.

      "description": "*PLEASE READ BELOW *\n\n\nDo you want to build with OpenAI and ChatGPT apps using no-code?\n\n\nHave you heard about the power of ChatGPT and want to use it to create solutions and applications? Do you want to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT into your business applications, like Outlook, Teams, Excel, Power Apps, Power Automate, and more?\n\n\nDo you want to build full enterprise solutions and real-life web applications that use ChatGPT and don't know where to start? Do you want to bring OpenAI's API into your application, platform, solution, or business?\n\n\nDo you want to build full real examples applications and solutions with ChatGPT from beginning to end, including a Cover Letter Generator, a Travel Itinerary Planner, a PPT Stock Generator, and an app that creates its own replies to email?\n\n\nThen this is the course for you. Learn from more than 6 hours of relevant instructional video content, with the only course that will not just teach you how to use ChatGPT to increase your productivity, but also how to build real-life solutions and applications from scratch using ChatGPT. We will leverage this amazing AI model, along with other OpenAI models like DALL-E, to create business software from beginning to end.\n\n\nThis course will teach you how to use the OpenAI's API and integrate it into many different platforms, including Outlook, Power Apps, Power Automate, Airtable, Bubble, and many more. We will then take what we have learned and build some examples of real-life applications and solutions from scratch.\n\n\nWhat is this course all about?\nThis course has one objective: start building applications and solutions with ChatGPT. We do that by first learning more about OpenAI and ChatGPT, and how to use its APIs in our platforms. We then create a serverless function that can take ChatGPT prompts and return responses - the first step to integrate your ChatGPT into your application. After that, we learn to integrate the ChatGPT API into many platforms, like Outlook, Power Apps, Power Automate, Teams, Bubbe, Airtable, and more. Finally, we take all we've learned, and create full applications and solution examples, like TravelPlan, a web application that helps users create itineraries through the power of ChatGPT.\n\n\nWhat is OpenAI?\nOpenAI is the company behind ChatGPT - it's an AI research and deployment company that builds amazing AI models and provides them to the public via API for a per-use fee. It is based out of San Francisco and its investors include Microsoft. In fact, Microsoft has recently invested more than $10B into the company.\n\n\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nGPT-3 is a series of Language Generation models that was developed by OpenAI. Its newest form, called Davinchi, is what is behind the ChatGPT program that we all know and love. It grew to popularity in December 2022 after people started using it and seeing how amazing it deals with any Prompt-Response completion questions like \"write me a slogan for an ice cream company\" or \"explain to me Quantum Computing like I'm five years old\".\n\n\nWhat is OpenAI's API?\nOpenAI has an API (Application Programming Interface) for all of its GPT-3 models, including ChatGPT and Davinchi. It enables any platform to talk directly to OpenAI's model, and this is the tool that lets us program OpenAI into any application or solution that we can think about., like Outlook, Power Apps, and much more.\n\n\nHow do you create business solutions or applications using ChatGPT API?\nWe create applications and solutions by linking ChatGPT's API directly into an application or solution building platform. For example, we learn how to integrate ChatGPT's API into Power Apps. After we do that, we can build any business application we want using Power Apps and it can now integrate ChatGPT. This is the same case for all the other platforms we cover.\n\n\nWhat are the different platforms that we will integrate ChatGPT into?\nWe specifically go through Outlook, Teams, Power Automate, Power Apps, Bubble, and Airtable. We also go through how to add ChatGPT as an Azure Function. This enables us to extend ChatGPT to any single platform we want including React, Webflow, Zapier, Excel, and many more.\n\n\nWhat applications or solutions will we build in this course?\nTchat - a Teams chatbot that you can put into your business to answer any question\nCoverLetterCreator - a Cover Letter generator based on a job description and reading a set of skills from a Resume\nTravelPlan - enables users to create detailed itineraries after specifying a location they are traveling, how long they are going for, and what they want to do\nStockPhotoPPT - creates images that users can put into their slide decks with ease\nPolitelySayNo - craft emails that politely and professionally say no to tough requests from your manager\n\n\nWhy learn how to integrate ChatGPT into your solutions and applications\nImprove your productivity - imagine how easy it would be for ChatGPT to reply to your emails for you, or to create a first draft on your travel itinerary to China. With ChatGPT, you can do that. However, it may be annoying to use the chat feature - so instead why not integrate it directly into the tools you use most like Outlook, Excel, Airtable, and more.\nBuild businesses - many businesses have had AI at their centre. ChatGPT opens the doors for you to create applications and solutions that solve a problem ChatGPT can easily solve. For example, in this course, we create a Cover Letter Generator app that creates cover letters based on a job ad and resume. This can easily be monetized and converted into a successful business.\nWin with AI - let’s face it, AI is the future. It is paramount that you include AI in your daily workflows as it can increase your efficiency and improve your output, no matter what job you have.\n\n\nWhy choose this course?\nComplete guide - this is the 100% start to finish, zero to hero, basic to advanced guide on building solutions and applications with ChatGPT. There is no other course like it that teaches you everything from start to finish. This not only goes through the basics of ChatGPT, but also how you integrate it with other platforms. It has 6 hours of instructional content!\nPlatform driven - we cover all popular platforms and applications that you would want to bring ChatGPT into, including Power Apps, Power Automate, Outlook, Bubble, Airtable, and more. We also showcase how to turn the ChatGPT API into your own Azure function, enabling you to deploy it anywhere, in any single application or solution.\nStructured to succeed - this course is structured to help you succeed. We first go through a crash course on ChatGPT, then we learn how to integrate ChatGPT into different platforms, and then we build real life applications and solutions with these platforms.\nFully instructional - we not only go through important concepts, but also apply them as we are building our application so that we can solidify them. This is not only a walkthrough of all the features and theoretical concepts, but a course that actually builds applications with you.\nStep by step - we go through every single concept in a sequential order (from learning about ChatGPT, connecting it to the platforms, and then creating examples. This improves your probabilities of learning these platforms to build solutions rather than going haphazardly through each feature.\nLearn to learn - during the latter parts of the course, we go through situations where we encounter new features or errors, and work through how we would use the documentation to resolve them. In this way, you not only learn about these platforms and how they interact inside and out, but learn how to resolve your own issues as they come up.\nTeacher response if there's anything else you would like to learn, or if there's something you cannot figure out, I'm here for you! Look at the ways to reach out video.\nReference material - follow along! I provide all reference material directly to you so you can follow along in your learning journey.\n\n\nCourse overview\nIntroduction - learn about the course, how to succeed, and the course roadmap\nCrash course on OpenAI and ChatGPT - learn about the different models within OpenAI and ChatGPT, how they work, and their capabilities\nEnvironment setup - download and install the tools you will be using in this course\nCreate a serverless wrapper API with ChatGPT - connect to OpenAI API and create an Azure function that leverages ChatGPT\nIntegrate ChatGPT with different platforms - learn how to link Open API to different platforms, including Outlook, Power Automate, Power Apps, Bubble, Airtable, and more\nCreate full real solutions and apps with ChatGPT - create 4 full applications and solutions including CoverLetterCreator, StockPhotoPPT, PolitelySayNo, and TravelPlan\n\n\nIf you want to learn how to create enterprise-grade applications and solutions using ChatGPT and other platforms as mentioned above, including ones with no-code, then this is the course for you.

      "description": "Please read the first lecture (reproduced at the end of this course description) before deciding to purchase this course.\nIn short, Enzyme is no longer actively supported. Unless you're interested in learning Enzyme specifically (because you're working on a legacy React project that uses Enzyme tests), I recommend taking a React Testing Library course instead.\n**************************************************************************************************************\nTake your React code to the next level by learning Test Driven Development (TDD) with Jest and Enzyme! Jest is a powerful, flexible testing framework, and Enzyme provides tools to test React and Redux applications. In this course, you will learn to test:\nReact hooks, including useEffect, useState and useReducer\nAsynchronous functions using Axios\nRedux action creators and reducers\nComplex Redux action creators that use Redux Thunk\nReact context, including context with embedded state\nYou will also learn how to make the most of Jest capabilities, including\nMocking and restoring individual properties of modules\nMocking entire modules\nControlling which tests run using, .skip, and .only\nRunning test suites multiple times with different data, using .each\nPlease Note: This course does not cover Jest snapshots, as they are not compatible with the TDD mode of testing.\nWhy Learn to Test?\nTest Driven Development will help you write better organized code that’s easier to maintain, which will save you time in the long run. Your tests provide value to your software development team, since others know they can rely on your code. Employers want developers with testing skills!\nUnit tests and Functional Tests\nThis course focuses on unit tests. Unit tests are tightly coupled to specific areas of code, which leads to easy diagnosis of failures, and a great match for Test-Driven Development. The course also teaches functional tests, which are modeled on user flows (and resulting behavior from the user perspective). Functional tests are not connected to code, which makes them more difficult to diagnose, but more resilient to code refactors.\nLearn the Reasons behind the Syntax\nThis course discusses tradeoffs when considering different approaches to testing, leaving you confident in the testing choices you make. Furthermore, you will deepen your understanding of React, Redux and Context as we dig into how and why we test each aspect.\nPractice your New Skills\nYou will also have opportunities to practice what you’ve learned. There are occasional “quizzes” while we’re building the course projects, where you can apply what you learned, and then watch a video to see the solution. There are also two sets of challenges to extend the course projects, with solutions on GitHub.\n**************************************************************************************************************\n**************************************************************************************************************\nThis lecture/article is reproduced here, since Udemy articles do not preview well. Unfortunately, you will not get the full experience, as links are not available in the course description.\nFirst lecture / article: The Author's Thoughts on Enzyme and React 18\nThe stark reality: Enzyme is not compatible with React 18, and probably never will be.\nThe History\nI started writing this course in March 2018, and it was published in May 2018. At that time, Enzyme was the primary option for testing React components with Jest. React Testing Library (Enzyme's current prime competitor) had just been released in March 2018.\nSince that time, a few things have happened:\nIn June 2020, Enzyme switched from being maintained by Airbnb to being maintained by an individual.\nIn October 2020, React 17 was released.\nAlso in October 2020, an unofficial Enzyme adapter for React 17 was released.\nIn December 2021, the author of the unofficial adapter for React 17 wrote an article entitled Enzyme is Dead, where he stated that he would not be writing an adapter for React 18.\nIn March 2022, React 18 was released.\nIn April 2022, the Enzyme maintainer has stated that he will work on a React 17 adapter before a React 18 adapter.\nAs of April 2022, the official adapter for React 17 has not been released.\n\n\nWhy I currently recommend React Testing Library\nReact Testing Library and Enzyme do the same job: rendering components so that they can be tested with Jest. I recommend React Testing Library over Enzyme for these reasons:\nUnlike Enzyme, React Testing Library does not rely on React internals. This means React Testing Library does not have an adapter that needs to be updated with each release of React, and is far less likely to have issues with new React versions.\nI find React Testing Library to be easier to use than Enzyme.\n\n\nWhat all this means for this course\nNow that React 18 has come out and there's no React 17 adapter in sight, I don't believe there's a future for Enzyme. I would not recommend this course for people who are looking to learn how to test new React applications. Instead I would recommend you find a course on React Testing Library.\nThat said, there are still around 2.4 million downloads of Enzyme a week (as of April 2022). Here are the circumstances under which I would recommend learning Enzyme:\nYou are working on a legacy project that already has a large suite of Enzyme tests, and the project never intends to upgrade to React 18.\nYou are working on a project with a large suite of existing Enzyme tests, and you wish to understand these tests before migrating to React Testing Library (RTL). However, Wojciech Maj, the author of the unoffiical Enzyme adapter for React 17, suggests:\nWhile Migrate from Enzyme support article is available, I suggest you to just start fresh, forgetting that Enzyme has ever existed. RTL is by no means an Enzyme drop-in replacement, so having a completely fresh mindset will help you getting the most of it.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nEnzyme was a great way to test React applications when this course came out; however, I can no longer recommend it. I encourage you to study React Testing Library instead.",

      "description": "Master observability with the Grafana Stack, including Grafana Loki for logs, Grafana Tempo for distributed tracing, Grafana Alloy for telemetry pipelines,  OpenTelemetry (OTel) for collecting and exporting signals from your applications, and Grafana Mimir for large-scale enterprise metrics collection.\nThis course provides a comprehensive, hands-on path to building modern observability systems. It starts with metrics using Prometheus and progresses to logs, traces, alerting, and custom dashboards in Grafana.\nWe begin with the core concepts of observability, telemetry data, and methods for metric collection. Then, you'll dive into Prometheus — learning how to install, configure, and use it like a pro.\nNext, you'll deploy Grafana across Windows, macOS, Linux (including Ubuntu and Amazon Linux), and Docker. Once your stack runs, we cover Grafana dashboard design for real-world use cases: APIs, infrastructure, and microservices.\nIn the logging section, you'll work with Grafana Loki to ingest and visualise logs, including dynamic label extraction from unstructured logs.\nThen we go deeper: you'll learn the fundamentals of OpenTelemetry and set up Grafana Alloy to receive, process, and export OTel metrics and traces. You'll instrument microservices (in Python and C#) and export signals to Grafana Tempo, where you'll trace distributed calls and analyze service graphs with TraceQL.\nNow also included is Grafana Mimir, a highly scalable time-series database for storing metrics at scale. You'll learn what Mimir is, how it works, and how to deploy it locally in monolithic mode and microservices mode into Kubernetes.\nTo make it practical, the course is based on a fictional online retailer, ShoeHub, with mock data, dashboards, alerts, and services that simulate real-world observability use cases.\nNo setup headaches — you'll also get instant access to a browser-based playground powered by Killer Coda, so you can start experimenting without installing anything.\n\n\nIncluded in the course:\n\n\nDocker Compose files for Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alloy, Tempo, Mimir, ShoHub metrics, and Example Microservices Tracing.\nSample dashboards and panel configurations.\nLog generator script in Python.\nSet up guides for multiple platforms.\nBinary executable files for ShoeHub and the example microservices (if you don't want to use Docker).\nOptional cloud lab environment (Killer Coda) for instant hands-on practice.\nI will respond promptly via the Udemy Q&A system if you encounter any issues or have questions.\nHappy learning — and welcome to the world of observability!",

Saleh, Thank you for this amazing course.\nNow some more details about this course - There is a reason ( and this reason is a good one), that Salehs youtube channel is called \"The cloud nerd\". The key word is \"nerd\". Because of my technical background, this course gave me so much info and understanding of GWS. I totally understand for non tech people this course may be a little toooo booooring, because the videos often are not just a brief explanation, but a deep dive, so you not just know, where and what to click, but to realise, how and why this things work.\nSection 18: Migrate to Google Workspace - this section is just enough to buy this course and have it as a handbook and guide. I spent so much time googling for migration guides and you have it all here and so so so well explained.\nThis course IS a 5 star course\" - Mike P.\n\n\n\"A very good match! I've worked with pieces of google before - but wanted a comprehensive course to tie it together. This course is exactly that! I especially like that various ways of doing a task are provided.\" - Susan C.\n\n\n\"Absolutely one of the best Google Administrator courses out there, might as well be a handbook to keep with you – great to refer back to.\nHighly Highly recommend.\" - Liam T.\n\n\n\"Fantastic Course... Strongly recommended for those who wish to know in depth about Google Workspace.\" - Anup K.",

      "description": "Trying to Make Sense of Terraform For AWS?\n\n\nPsst… are you trying to piece together code from awful documentations?\n\n\nGetting lost in endless amounts of theory and reading… wasting hours and hours of your life…\n\nJust to feel overwhelmed once you’re trying to apply your ‘knowledge’?\n\nIf you’re looking for a clear and detailed tutorial that guides you step-by-step through the foundations of Terraform without “death-by-PowerPoint”, look no further.\n\nBecause once you’ve mastered this skill set, you’ll be able to work on your own terraform project or apply for your next DevOps job which is among the HOTTEST and HIGHEST earning roles in IT right now.\n\n\nAnd this course will teach you how to get there.\n\nHi, I’m TJ Addams.\n\n\nWith nearly 10 years in IT project roles, I spent a lot of time teaching over 16,000+ people on- and offline. So they can become ready to use their skills in production, even without prior experience.\n\n\nI simplify all the processes new students need to understand. And I provide a clear roadmap on what to learn to produce results fast.\n\n\nEverything I teach is based on what is used in industry and cutting out what isn’t.\n\n\nI operated in lead support roles to Project Sponsors, Platform Engineers, Solutions Architects, Developers, and Testers & have worked with UK Government partners to develop real-time systems underpinned by Terraform. I also have operated in diverse sectors including consulting, technology services and digital transformation; private online healthcare; and biomedical research.\n\n\nThis allows me to bring you unique insights way beyond the trivial \"hello world\" type of examples...\n\n\n... coupled with lots of demos, tips, and advice on how it’s used in industry. I cover the nitty-gritty to help you stand out from the crowd and learn the things most engineers don't even know about.\n\n\nYour Fast Track To Terraform—From 0 to Ready To Use In No Time\n\n\nThis easy-to-consume course helps you to tie all the key concepts together and fill in any unnecessary knowledge gaps you might have—getting you up to speed with all the foundations you need in no time.\n\n\nThis is NOT about presenting you hundreds of topics with no continuity between subjects, like college textbooks that bore you to death.\n\n\nEverything you’ll see in this course is based on what is used in industry and cutting out what isn’t. So you don’t need to spend long hours studying—especially if you don’t have the time for it.\n\n\n90% Hands-On / 10% Theory / 0% Wasting Time\n\n\nInstead, you’ll get easy to follow step-by-step video tutorials. While watching these videos, you’ll be able to follow along and gain valuable hands-on experience. This will give you a head start for finishing your first very own Terraform project as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\n\nYou’ll complete quick challenges and exercises throughout the course. This helps you digest every lesson and discover Terraforms true capabilities. It ensures you to get you comfortable with coming up with solutions on your own. Exactly like you would in real-life scenarios.\n\n\nThis way, you can be sure to get the clarity and the confidence you need before diving deep into Terraform. So prepare yourself to get your hands dirty!\n\n\nWhat You’ll Get In This Course\n\n\nYou’ll get access to a comprehensive and up-to-date guide that gives you a solid understanding of how Terraform works. You also get the tools and resources you need to start your own Terraform project and produce results TODAY. This includes:\n\n\nFollow along videos to put everything into practice as you learn\n\nOver 40 step by step video tutorials for creating infrastructure like ….\n\n\nDatabases on AWS with RDS\n\n\nConfiguring EC2 instances\n\n\nCreating custom IAM policies with JSON\n\n\nRemote backends using S3 storage\n\n\nSetting up Security Groups\n\n\nDemystifying Terraform modules and creating your own\n\n\nWorking with Elastic IP’s (EIP)\n\n\nManaging dependencies on resources\n\n\nHow to understand the documentation\n\n\nAnd much more\n\n\nUnique challenges to master Terraform quickly and put your new skills to the test\n\n\nNearly 3 hours of on-demand training\n\n\nA 30-day 100% money-back guarantee\n\n\nThe course is in 0.11 syntax (due to re-filmed soon) because that’s what companies are STILL USING. But this course ALSO includes Terraform v0.12, the latest and greatest version so you’re not missing out\n\nHere’s What Others Have To Say About This Course:\n\n“This is a fast track, but for that cannot be considered as a rushed introduction to the Terraform concepts and practices, instead you can expect to be a fast and very accurate pass through the concepts, tips and trick necessaries for starting to produce results today”\n\n“I have taken Terraform course because I might need it in my DevOps role. It is very informative and contents is very details. Love it. Thanks !”\n\n\n“Hey TJ,Brilliant course. I like the small step by step videos but I loved the way you got stuck into the exercises pretty much off the bat. I found it far easier to digest Terraform and learn about its true capabilities having been through some more complex training. A great course for newbies!!! I hope you have some more courses in the pipeline. Thanks again.”\n\nBy The End Of This Course You’ll …\n\n\nAce your next job interview\n\n\nUnderstand the documentation and fly solo\n\n\nMastered modules and how you can use them\n\n\nBe ready to deploy your infrastructure with Terraform\n\n\nHave an advantage over others with your freshly updated CV\n\n\nBe the guy who solves the project you’re working on\n\n\nProgress further in your career\n\n\nSolve problems confidently & comfortable\n\n\nGet your job done quickly and efficiently\n\n\nHave all the tools & resources you need to get started immediately after finishing this course\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat do I need to get started?\n\nLaptop and a desire to learn Terraform--I’ll cover the rest\n\n\nSay Goodbye To Confusing Documentation!\n\n\nBuy now.",

      "description": "Kanban is not a software development lifecycle methodology or an approach to project management.\nIt requires that some process is already in place so that Kanban can be applied to\nincrementally change the underlying process.\n—David Anderson, Kanban\nKanban is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.\nA Kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).\nIt can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!\nThis course will help you explore how working on an Agile project using Kanban has benefits for your development team, your end users, and your organization as a whole.\nWe will identify various process flow related issues including too much work in progress, underutilization of resources, lengthy tasks, unequal sized tasks etc. using simple and easy to understand demonstrations on Kanban board.\nWe will not only identify these inefficiencies but also solve for the same by continuously improving the process flow using Kanban Board.\nHere is a list of the topics we will cover in this course:\nIntroduction to Kanban & Kanban Board\nFinding Inefficiencies in the Process\nLimiting Work in Progress\nUnder utilization of Resources\nUnequal Sized Tasks\nMarking the Tasks\nOther Inefficiencies/Issues\nKanban Practices\nDefining Done\nDaily Stand up\nSpecifying Rules\nKey Agile Concepts\nUnderstanding & Creating User Stories, Theme & Epic\nWhat is Product Backlog\nDifference between Product Backlog & Product Roadmap\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of Agile\nHow Estimation is done in Agile\nWhy Relative Estimation in Agile\nT-Shirt & Fibonacci Estimation\nPlaning Poker in Agile\nUnderstanding & Creating Burn down Charts\nMinimum Viable Product\nTeam Velocity\nThis course is ideal for software developers, project managers, software leadership, or anyone that would have an interest and gain benefit from running an Agile project and delivering maximum value early to your customers.\nNo prior experience is necessary to take this course. So, if even if you don’t know what Kanban is and the various principles and concepts under Kanban and Agile Project Management, not to worry.\nWe will cover all of these concepts from scratch.\nCourse enrollment grants you lifetime access to all the the entire course content including quizzes, practice exercises etc. In addition, you’ll also receive 1-on-1 support for any questions or uncertainties that come up. And this all comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee! You have nothing to lose and so much knowledge to gain.\nOver 104,000 students have enrolled into this course so far and have shared some great reviews about the course:\n★★★★★ \"Amazing! Awesome best accent and I'm in the USA\"\nShaila Bernard\n★★★★★ \"Very detailed and nicely explained with examples\"\nSusant Pattanayak\n★★★★★ \"Simple and Informative content. The pace is smooth. I recommend people to use this course if you are a beginner in Agile and / or Kanban method.\"\nSatrajit Mukherjee\n\n\nI hope that you will enjoy the course, be challenged by it and learn a lot. The primary objective is to build a strong foundational knowledge of the principles of Kanban & Agile.\nIt is suggested that you go through the course at a pace that makes sense for you. The topics build on each other, so it is better to slow down and really learn something than to just move on in order to keep up a certain pace.\nSo, I have the tools needed to get the job done. So, let’s do it, I’ll see you in class. All the best!",

You probably have applications built with Qt running on your computer, smart phone, television, and other electronics.\n\n\nThis course targets Qt5 but is mostly compatible with Qt6 - I am in the process of recording the Qt6 material, anyone owning this course will get a free upgrade to the Qt6 version.\n\n\nNo experience with QML necessary, this is a beginners course that will teach you the foundations QML cross platform development. QML runs anywhere from desktops (windows, mac, linux) to cellphone, and embedded devices.\nWe will start with a short introduction to QML, and then rapidly move on to more complex topics such as layouts, properties and animations.\nThis course is specifically designed for Qt 5 with the QML beginner in mind. These videos take you from knowing nothing about QML to creating intermediate level applications using QML, JavaScript and C++. These videos build on the popular Qt Core series available on Udemy. These videos show many best practices and how to overcome common mistakes. About the author: Bryan has created  hundreds of Qt tutorials available on YouTube and has created official Qt training videos for the Qt Company. Full source code available on GitHub, and runs a Facebook community with thousands of developers that can offer free help 24x7.\nHighly recommended that you have a strong foundation in Qt Core before attempting this course - fear not, I have other courses available on Udemy:\nQt 5 Core Beginners\nQt 5 Core Intermediate\nQt 5 Core Advanced",

      "description": "This is an ISTQB® course for the CTFL (Certified Tester Foundation Level) AGILE EXTENSION certification.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn about Agile. Not only about the differences between testing in more traditional approaches and Agile approaches, but also about Agile in general. As Agile methodologies are used more and more in the software development industry, it is a necessity to know about this and understand how it impacts your job as a tester. At the same time, the certification is a definite plus when applying for a job as software tester\n\n\nThis is not a read-out of the syllabus as is the case in many other courses as I do not see that as a proper course. The information from the syllabus is used in this course, mentioned, explained and wherever necessary examples are given in native-level English. Each chapter contains a quiz at the end which contains actual exam questions in order for you to get used to the way questions are asked on the exam. In each chapter we will also solve several questions together to get you used to the way questions are asked in the ISTQB® Exam. This is an important part as both the questions and answers are sometimes formulated to throw you off.\n\n\nThis course has been written to help (aspiring) software testers, developers and other people interested in software testing grasp the basics and fundamentals of software testing in an Agile software development environment. The entire Agile Tester syllabus is covered and some extra bonus material is also included. All terminology matches the terminology used in the latest ISTQB® glossary.\n\n\nBesides getting you ready for the ISTQB®-CTFL-AT exam with the course, sample exams and tips and tricks, I would really like to teach you about software testing in an Agile environment; things that you can use in your day-to-day work.\n\n\nAs you can see on Udemy, there are various courses already on this subject; so why would you take this course?\n1. The course has been written on the latest syllabus and some interesting subjects from the CTFL course are shortly revisited to refresh your memories;\n2. There are a lot of examples and questions included in the course that will help you greatly;\n3. We will go through questions together in each chapter;\n4. Examples and exercises form a vital aspect of this course;\n5. No false promises about you being a great Agile software tester after you finish this course; however, this course is a very good starting point;\n6. You will learn the basics and should be able to pass the exam without problems in the first go (if you pay attention of course);\n7. Besides getting ready for the exam and most likely passing it on your first attempt, you will get a solid understanding of software testing in an Agile development mindset..\n\n\nIf you have any questions or remarks during the course, please post it on the discussion board and I will answer as fast as possible.",

What are the meanings of the important acronyms like IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS.\nA good understanding will be given about Oracle Cloud , it's Subscription Models , Demos will be done to show the Sign-up & Sign-in to Oracle Cloud.\nThen the discussion will move onto the OCI (Second Generation Cloud ) .Will perform a Deep Dive into the Architecture of OCI. We will take a look into important concepts like : What are Compartments / VCN's / Availability Domains  / Shapes& OCPu's. A couple of demos for the creation of Compartments / VCN's will be done.\nThe next milestone would be getting an understanding around Database Cloud Services like : ODCS / Exadata Service / Exadata Cloud@Customer. After this we shall perform demos : Provisioning Database in OCI & OCI-Classic\nThe last milestone would be related to Understanding ssh connectivity, There will be Demos showing how you create public / Private keys in Unix & Windows , Demo showing the ssh connectivity from Windows server & Unix Sever will be done. Will demonstrate how to connect as Admin User / Root on Oracle Cloud Machines. In the end we will challenge ourselves and will connect AWS EC-2 machine in Amazon cloud to Oracle Database in Oracle Cloud. The last demo will be on Sql Developer connectivity using the SSH Tunnels where the listener port 1521 has been blocked.",

The first two courses are called \"Learn API Technical Writing: JSON and XML for Writers\" and \"Learn API Technical Writing: REST for Writers\", and it's recommended that you first take those courses, unless you are very familiar with API documentation, and how to document reference material.\nThis course teaches how to write conceptual API documentation, such as overviews, getting started sections, and tutorials. For the most part, no programming experience is required, but technical writers with programming experience will still find it useful.\nIn addition to conceptual material, this course covers guidelines for good sample code, tools for making REST requests, and how to find an open source project to document as a way to get into the field of API writing.\nWhat are APIs?\nAPIs (Application Program Interfaces) define how software systems talk to each other, and API documentation is a rapidly growing field. There is a strong need for writers who can understand APIs and explain them so that software developers can understand how to use them. API writers get to be in on the cutting edge of technology in high-paying positions.\nWhat is Conceptual Material?\nAPI documentation consists of reference material and conceptual material. Reference material describes the details of the API: what are the pieces of each request and response, or each class and member. Conceptual material orients developers so that it's easy for them to get started with a new API.\nWhat is in This Course?\nBy the end of the course, you will understand how to write good API conceptual material, how to make REST calls using GUI and command-line tools, and how to find an open source project to document. In this course you'll find:\n8 videos that:\nDescribe how to write good conceptual material\nProvide guidelines for good sample code\nDemonstrates how to use tools to make REST calls\nLeads you through examples of how to find open source projects on the internet\n2 hands-on exercises to lead you through making REST requests using tools\nPowerPoint presentations as a resource for every video lecture\nA PDF with resources for finding open source projects\nThe course takes approximately 1 hours and 30 minutes to complete, depending on how fast you are with the exercises.",

      "description": "Welcome to one of the highest rated course on user stories on Udemy. Period.\nMost organizations that have adopted Agile frameworks are oblivious to the fact that very few people in those organizations know how to actually write sound User Stories. Since User Stories are conversational in their verbiage, it is very hard for the un-initiated to know whether a given User Story is correct and if not, what might be missing in that User Story. Most of the time what gets passed as a User Story is simply a task or a set of tasks OR maybe an end-user's goal but without potential benefit OR a research activity, etc. There are several ways a User Story gets mis-used and totally wasted. This course will teach you to see through all this rut that exists w.r.t User Stories. Not only that, this course will teach you to quickly conceptualize and actually write User Stories.\nAnd most importantly, this course is designed to teach how to think in terms of user stories. This is a super important aspect of this course since as you know, thought precedes action. So, if you can think it, you can write it.\nAdditionally, this course will enable you to write precise Acceptance Criteria which are a must in order for a User Story to be worked on by development team. Moreover, course will also enlighten you on the topics of Epics & Themes to the point that you will also be able to conceptualize and quickly write Epics and Themes. The 2+ hours of course material includes real world examples of User Stories, Epics & Themes and it also has quizzes after each lecture to reinforce key concepts.\nFinally, most courses on User Stories are filled with just academic information on this topic. This is NOT a lightweight course that simply repeats high level information on User Stories, Something, that anyone can read online for free - this course has REAL insights on this topic.",

Was really key in helping me switch teams internally. I’ve recommended it to numerous people since!\"\n\"I just wanted to thank you for your System design course, because of that course I was able to clear my 6 rounds of system design interviews at Google and got the job.\"\n\"Interview prep is even more challenging without proper guidance. This course was a real saver because I was asked every concept that the course discussed. The mock interview was helpful enough to practice your learnings for real world problems. I was able to ace my system design portion of interview and got my offer at Amazon.\nAs a non-CS major student, I struggled to find good resources. The instructor was actually from Amazon and had real interview questions. He focuses on skills that really matter on the interview rather than hacky tricks.

So it makes sense to start there and I provide you with a good understanding in how to use Groovy with Gradle, so you can get the maximum benefit from both. Later in the course I also take a look at using Kotlin as the DSL and what IDE support there is available for this amazing programming language.\nI then set the scene of how Gradle works from the inside out, by looking at the Gradle Lifecycle (... something that is often over looked!!).\nYou'll get to understand that mastering the Gradle Lifecycle and associated Domain Objects is the key to getting that 'A-ha!' moment with Gradle. (This alone will put you streets ahead of other developers.)\nYou'll learn that mastering the wide variety of Domain Objects that come with Gradle and its 'Plugins'  are another key that unlocks the power of Gradle.\nFrom single Java projects to complex Multi-Project Java Web applications – these can easily be handled by Gradle and with the examples used in this course you'll have plenty of guidance and experience to use on you're very own projects and lead the way forward. Creating world class, leading edge build scripts, with arguably the most powerful and modern build tool on the planet!\n\n\nIn this course I cover the basics of the Groovy language used by Gradle, later in the course I also touch upon using Kotlin as well.\nI cover in-depth the Gradle Lifecycle and how to hook into it, so we get the full benefit of Gradles power.\nI cover a variety of  Gradles Domain Objects and how to successfully manipulate them, as well as  'Plugins' – in particular the Java Plugin.\nThe Gradle 'Wrapper is also covered in some detail.\n\nI look at the Buildship plugin for Eclipse and how that works. (The course is mainly based on using this platform.)\n\nThe examples used in this course are various and all Java Projects. From single applications to Multi-Project Web Applications, all built and deployed using Gradle.\nThe ideal student for this course is any Java developer who is looking to expand on their current skills.\nThere're no requirements to enroll on this course, only that you have some prior knowledge of Java,\nI only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn.",

It’s a MUST HAVE to get started in Industry.\n\n\nChances are, you’re busy and don’t have the time to get frustrated over these 30-hour deep-dive courses. Trying to make sense of complex theory and wasting hours of time without any hands-on experience.\n\n\nIf you want to know enough to get started and work with Docker as quickly as possible, this is the course for you.\n\n\nHi, I’m TJ Addams.\n\n\nWith nearly 10 years in IT project roles, I spent a lot of time teaching over 16,000+ people on- and offline. So they can become ready to use their skills in production, even without prior experience.\n\n\nI simplify all the processes new students need to understand. And I provide a clear roadmap on what to learn to produce results fast.\n\n\nEverything I teach is based on what is used in industry and cutting out what isn’t.\n\n\nI operated in lead support roles to Project Sponsors, Platform Engineers, Solutions Architects, Developers, and Testers & have worked with UK Government partners to develop real-time systems underpinned by Terraform. I also have operated in diverse sectors including consulting, technology services and digital transformation; private online healthcare; and biomedical research.\n\n\nThis allows me to bring you unique insights way beyond the trivial \"hello world\" type of examples...\n\n\n... coupled with lots of demos, tips, and advice on how it’s used in industry. I cover the nitty-gritty to help you stand out from the crowd and learn the things most engineers don't even know about.\n\n\nZero-To-Expert In Just Over 90 Minutes\n\n\nDid you know that companies use Kubernetes for managing Docker in production? Yep, no Docker Swarm.\n\n\nSo how smart would it be to learn something you’ll never use? Not smart at all. What should you focus on instead?\n\n\nThis is what this course is all about. To get you up to speed with the essentials quickly from the ground up, even if you have zero prior experience.\n\nSpecifically, you’ll gain a solid understanding of how to work with Docker images, containers, repositories, and some of the most advanced Docker image manipulation tricks of the industry that only a few engineers know about.\n\n90% Hands-On / 10% Theory / 0% Wasting Time\n\n\nEver heard of “death-by-PowerPoint”? It’s where you watch slide after slide while trying your best not to fall asleep. We’ve all been there. And this course is far different from it.\n\n\nIt’s a clear and up-to-date course on what Docker concepts you need to know to get started with your own Docker project today.\n\n\nBroken down into manageable, simple step-by-step videos you can follow along\n\n\nto be as approachable as possible especially when you start from scratch.\n\n\nInstead of simply consuming theory like an info junkie, you’ll gain plenty of hands-on experience by completing small quizzes and challenges throughout this course.\n\n\nIn fact, this course was specifically designed to provide you with lots of practical examples and get you ready and working with Docker in no time even if you’re completely new.\n\n\nPlus, I included tips & questions to get you prepped for even the most difficult interviews and show off your skills.\n\nWhat You’ll Get In This Course\n\n\nExpert Level Docker knowledge\n\n\nRock-solid understanding how it works\n\n\nBest tips and tricks of the industry\n\n\nHands-on challenges to put your new skills to the test\n\n\n1.5h of on-demand training\n\n\nInterview prep and questions included\n\n\nA 30-day 100% money-back guarantee\n\n\nHere’s What Other People Say About This Course:\n\n\n“A lot of useful, hands-on information compressed into as short a time as possible, without the usual banter & time-waste present in many other courses. I will definitely look for more of TJ's courses & recommend to colleagues as well. Thank you.”\n\n\n“Very clear and marvelous composition of Docker concepts!! Thanks TJ and kudos to the way you have explained the things.”\n\n\n“Great; rapidly up-to-speed on what Docker is and how to start using it. I just didn't expect it to be so easy.

You'll be able to follow along with all of the examples, and run them on your own local development computer.\nIncluded with the course is a module covering SparkML, an exciting addition to Spark that allows you to apply Machine Learning models to your Big Data! No mathematical experience is necessary!\nAnd finally, there's a full 3 hour module covering Spark Streaming, where you will get hands-on experience of integrating Spark with Apache Kafka to handle real-time big data streams. We use both the DStream and the Structured Streaming APIs.\n\n\nOptionally, if you have an AWS account, you'll see how to deploy your work to a live EMR (Elastic Map Reduce) hardware cluster. If you're not familiar with AWS you can skip this video, but it's still worthwhile to watch rather than following along with the coding.\nYou'll be going deep into the internals of Spark and you'll find out how it optimizes your execution plans. We'll be comparing the performance of RDDs vs SparkSQL, and you'll learn about the major performance pitfalls which could save a lot of money for live projects.\nThroughout the course, you'll be getting some great practice with Java Lambdas - a great way to learn functional-style Java if you're new to it.",

      "description": "Are you an intern in IT, junior IT engineer or have been an engineer for a while but worked in your own silo? Or maybe you're a non-technical professional working in IT like PM or BA that would like to better understand software development projects (and you are looking for IT for non-IT type of course)?\nThis course is for you!\nBut wait, what if you don't work in IT yet but would like to get into the industry as either technical or non-technical professional? This course is perfect for you too!\n\n\nSometimes the most important problem is WHAT  You should learn. If you don't know the key problems and concepts, then how can You learn about them? More importantly, how can You effectively prepare for conversations about topics You have got no idea about? Time for some answers!\n\n\nSome areas of knowledge in IT are quite complicated - not only for a non-technical person. For me personally some subjects do take A LOT of effort to explore and become productive in. IT is intellectually challenging for everyone including people who might seem to be comfortable with it on the surface. It just takes time and dedication to internalise some things. And that’s ok. As long as we have the right attitude and growth mindset. My objective with this course was to make all of the curriculum topics presented in digestible form, from ground up. Nonetheless, you might still find some sections more challenging than others.\n\n\nThis course is the one-stop-shop for learning about all the different areas of software development. It is packed with key concepts and knowledge. Everything is visualised with animations. No time is wasted for excessive details or talking too broadly. The information you'll find here is useful to understand different kinds of IT projects and what is going on around them. Not least, to understand who is doing what.\n\n\nBased on student feedback the course has been updated with helpful activities! You will write and execute your first line of Python code. Not only that, detailed explanation of what is happening will give you an insight into how programming language syntax is constructed. On top of that, there are 30+ quiz questions to help you persist learned concepts. Actually, you might even learn something new from the quizzes, as even incorrect answers describe and explain actual, real-world concepts.\n\n\nHere is a partial list of the topics that are covered in this course:\npopular programming languages\ndifference between software frameworks and libraries and popular examples\nbasic components of web applications and applicable terminology\ntypes of data and databases\nwhat is cloud and why is it such a big deal\nhow are applications put on the internet or what is deployment\napplication testing and types of tests\napplication environments\nmost popular technologies for some of those basic application components\nwhat is application architecture and how to design it\nhow are engineers collaborating on the same codebase and what is GIT\nwhat is containerisation and how modern software development teams leverage it\nwhy is agile practically the only methodology used to develop software\nhow does scrum come into this\nengineering roles responsible for different components of applications\nmost popular technologies specific engineers work with\n\n\nI've made this course after delivering such training offline internally in the company I work for to a group of non-technical PMs. Some of whom only recently had joined IT. It was received so wall that other departments started asking for it too.\nOne of the participants told me: \"I learned more about IT during those 3 hours than during my 3 years in IT. This should be available online\".\n\n\nConsider signing up now!",

You probably have applications built with Qt running on your computer, smart phone, television, and other electronics.\nNo experience necessary, this is a beginners course that will teach you the foundations of both Qt 5 and C++. This course is meant as a direct replacement for an introduction to C++ class. This course starts off with simple topics such as \"what is a variable\" and ends with some basic Qt classes and how to work with them. The main focus of this course is to get the student a solid foundation to move forward from. At the end of this course you will be able to create basic applications using C++ and Qt 5. This course overs Qt 5. Because Qt 6 has so many changes, I will re-record these lessons using Qt 6 and place them into a different course, check my instructor profile for updates.\n\nWe will start with basic foundational concepts such as variables and each section moves into more complex topics such as templates, classes, error handling and how to use some of the Qt 5 classes includes in the core library. This course uses C++ and Qt Creator which is the best IDE for developing cross platform applications using Qt that can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, embedded devices such as a raspberry pi, iPhone and Android.\n\n\nThis is the starting point for all other Qt 5 courses on that are available on Udemy.\nQt 5 Core Intermediate\nQt 5 Core Advanced\nQt 5 Widgets\nQt 5 QML\nQt 5 Design Patterns",

They can neither go for an interview ( for fear of failure ) nor stay comfortable where they are. Why is that ?\nSay you are already trained or knowledgeable in basic SAP Sales and Distribution (SD ). What next ?\nYou need to go beyond the basics and step into the advanced topics. This course is designed to give you exactly that.\nWhat is the focus of this course ?\nThis course is focused exclusively on one and one area only.\nExplanation of Advanced SAP SD Scenarios in plain English.\nHow are these scenarios delivered ?\nThe goal of this course is to give you detailed explanations of advanced SD configuration. Keeping to that goal, we do NOT focus on the basics - For example, when we talk about group conditions in Pricing, we do not talk about how a pricing scale behaves. If this kind of training throws you off, just go back to the drawing board and finish up a basic SD course.\nThe topics are broken down into manageable pieces - For example, pricing is broken down into multiple sections based on the level of complexity.

Read some of the student's honest reviews...\n\n\n\"Solid course that not only covers the foundations of n8n- interface, working with apis, webhooks etc, but covers advanced use cases integrating voice , AI agents and LLMs. If you're looking for a course that can get you up to speed quickly, this is a great one.\" - Matthew W.\n\n\n\"So far I'm really enjoying this course! I've already been able to build some time-saving personal and business workflows using what I've learned from the lessons. It is easy to understand and beginner friendly. The community has also proven to be a great resource. I went into this course with zero knowledge of AI automation and now I feel so much more confident in my skills so that's a win!\" - Essence H.\n\n\n\"I went through a first pass on this course to get an idea of what n8n can do. I was amazed at what n8n can do. This course gave many ideas on how to use n8n as well as how to get workflows already in the community. This course presented many ideas that can make a 7 figure income. Even if you just implemented one of the ideas in this course, you can get to financial independence. There are several ideas offered and step by step how to implement them. Don't get over whelmed, just pick one idea and use it well. You can alway go back and do another idea later.\" - Howard S.\n\n\n\"Let me give you guys a 5 million of stars, I'm Industrial Engineer and I love Process Automation, including AI and specially N8N has helped me a LOT, though when I went to school I hated Programming and coding classes with all my soul. You guys made this course wonderful, easy to explain, understandable, the exams I was able to pass them in the first try (I always fail because I lack of attention if the course is boring), exceptionally good this course.\" - Nestor F P.\n\n\n\"Really great course! Super practical examples and well-paced content. I liked how it covered both AI automation concepts and real-world builds in n8n without needing to code.\nThe voice agent part was especially cool makes you think differently about how to connect AI tools.\nPerfect for anyone looking to explore AI workflows quickly.\" - Dylan W.\n\n\n\"Just finished the n8n online class and really enjoyed it. The lessons were super clear, easy to follow, and had a lot of real-life examples that made everything click. Even if you’re new to automation, it breaks things down in a way that makes it all feel doable. Definitely recommend it if you’re looking to get started with n8n and save time on repetitive tasks.\" - ABertuchi\n\n\n\"Just started this course and looks really useful. Seems to be oriented towards commercially useful workflows rather than just proof of concepts.\" - Peter J.\n\n\n\"I took this course, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations!\nThe instructor does an excellent job of breaking down complex concepts into digestible lessons, making automation accessible even to beginners. Their enthusiasm and expertise shine through in every session, keeping the learning experience enjoyable and informative.\nIf you're looking for a well-structured, engaging course that will open your eyes to the power of automation with N8N, I highly recommend this one.

      "description": "WELCOME TO MAP ACADEMY! LEARN HOW TO MAKE GREAT MAPS, WITH QGIS\nUpdate: I now have over 8,000 people learning with me, in 160 different countries - thanks so much!\nMillions of people across the world love maps, yet only a small percentage of people know how to make maps - and I'm on a mission to change that. Taking your first steps in geographic information systems (GIS) and digital cartography can be really enjoyable, but if you don't have a guide it can also be a wee bit daunting, so that's why I've launched Map Academy. Using real data from many different countries, this course contains over 140 short lessons to help you get up and running with map making and spatial analysis in QGIS. If you want me to add a new video on a topic of your choice, just get in touch and I'll do my best to create one!\n\n\nQGIS is the world's most popular open source GIS and is used by major corporations worldwide, as well as by national, regional and local governments - and by academics, students and amateur map enthusiasts. It's 100% free, and it works on Mac, PC and Linux. QGIS downloads and installs in minutes and requires no licences or registration - ever.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to make many different kinds of maps and save them as high quality images in a variety of file formats (e.g. pdf, jpg, png, and many more) for use in documents, presentations and other settings. You might be surprised at how much you can learn and how far you can go with QGIS in a short space of time.\n\n\nMap Academy: Get mapping quickly, with QGIS is organised into the following sections:\n\n\nIntroduction\nKnow your way around QGIS\nLet's make a map\nData handling\nLocator maps\n'Heat maps'\nElection maps\nDensity maps\nFun map stuff\nVector tools in QGIS\nWorking with raster data\nQGIS Plugins\nTips and tricks\nRecap\n\n\nOkay, so why QGIS? Yes, it's 100% free, but that's not why I want you to use it. The main reasons we use QGIS in this course are as follows.\n\n\nBEAUTY: you can produce beautiful maps in QGIS, with minimal fuss.\nSPEED: it's fast - it helps you get the job done quickly and meet those pesky deadlines.\nPOWER: its powerful - you can do all kinds of complex spatial analysis with it and go way beyond mapping, if you need to.\nINNOVATION: the QGIS development team are always making improvements and adding enhanced features.\nFLEXIBILITY: QGIS can handle any file type, and works on any operating system.\n\n\nBut what if you only need to make simple maps? No problem - it's great for that too. You can use QGIS to make basic maps, as well as performing more complex mapping and spatial analysis tasks - if you need it, QGIS can do it.\n\n\nLike all software, the initial learning curve can be a bit steep and you can quickly become overwhelmed with words, concepts, data formats and menu options - not to mention the unsettling feeling you can get when you first look at a new user interface. You can find lots of QGIS tricks and tips online, but if you're just starting out with GIS it's often difficult to know what terms to search for, where to look, and who to trust.\n\n\nThis is why I've launched Map Academy here on Udemy. This QGIS course is a systematic, step-by-step introduction that begins with the basics of GIS and data, and guides you all the way through different map types and how to create high quality outputs.\nAlong the way, you'll learn a ton about fundamental GIS concepts and techniques, all based on the idea of doing-as-you-learn and learning-as-you-do. I'll provide a wide range of interesting, in-depth examples from across the world so that you can apply the learning here to your own specific needs. I'll provide all the data you need - as well as showing you where to find more when you need to (a crucial skill for any GIS user).\nI assume no prior knowledge or experience of QGIS, or any other GIS software. So long as you're comfortable using a computer, are enthusiastic about maps, and love learning new things then this course is for you.\n\n\nI look forward to seeing you in class!\n- Alasdair :)",

Thank you!\"\n\"Great course, wish I would have watched it before reading Python Scrapy documentation.\"\n\"I loved this course. It's a great introduction to web scraping! It's short, sweet and to the point!\"\n\"Really impressed about theory and strategies to use.. goes beyond my expectation\"\n\nWeb scraping (also known as scraping, scraping, harvesting and web data extraction), is both the art & craft of extracting data from websites. Data obtained from web-scraping is used for price comparison, business lead generation, and competitive analysis.\nI created this course because I want to improve the quality of web-scraping information available. Most courses assume you know a lot about scraping already, but that's mostly not the case - this course doesn't try to teach you everything, the objective is to give you a solid foundation in the basics so you can start to master the art and craft of web scraping.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you use Python, Java, C# or any other language for webscraping, this short course is light on code, and tries to use imagery and animation whenever possible to get the message across. There are various frameworks that are used to assist in web scraping depending on the programming language you use. Some of these scraping libraries these include Scrapy, Beautiful Soup and others in the Python web scraping world, and JSoup and HtmlUnit for Java for example.\n\nIf you want to learn web scraping with python or any other language, don't take *any other course* until you take this one - you'll be glad you did .. trust me, when you do take your next web-scraping course, you'll be in a far stronger position to get the most from it :)",

      "description": "Mastering Ansible is a step-by-step journey of learning Ansible for configuration management and orchestration.\nThe course is designed as a journey through configuring a realistic application stack from the ground up. Instead of going page-by-page through the Ansible documentation, topics are ordered to align with the growing complexity of our application as we build it up and refactor it.\nIn addition to the core concepts of configuration with Ansible, we spend time on building tools to help us maintain and troubleshoot our application. The goal is to have a workflow where all of the configuration and troubleshooting is done through ansible playbooks that can be committed to a repository and improved over time.\nThe course is divided into 6 sections, starting with initial installation and foundational concepts. Starting in section 3, we build up a sample application environment layer-by-layer, learning a new concept in each lecture. After the application is up and running, we refactor our setup in section 4 with an emphasis on modularity and encapsulation. In section 5, we optimize our code and learn about techniques to reduce the playbook execution time. The course finishes with a final section on troubleshooting and testing.\nFor each lecture, we introduce a new Ansible concept and apply it to our playbooks. For most lectures, we execute the new concept in the demo environment so you can see what the output should look like. In the notes of each lecture, you'll find a link to the relevant documentation pages, along with a snapshot of the codebase at the end of that lecture.\nThis course was built with Ansible version 1.9.3, applied to a 3-tiered web application environment leveraging NGINX, Apache2, Python, and MySQL on Ubuntu Linux servers. We do not cover administering Windows servers in this course.\nThis course is designed as an introduction to Ansible, but also as a guide for engineers interested in configuration management, orchestration, infrastructure-as-code, and devops principles.",

You will explore the capabilities of Fabric, understand how it works, and learn how to use it to build end-to-end data analytics solutions.\nThe course covers a wide range of Fabric experiences, including:\n\n\nOneLake: The concept of OneLake is to unify all of your data into a single repository, regardless of its source or format. This makes it easier to manage your data and to perform analytics across all of your data.\nLakehouses: Lakehouses are a new type of data store that combine the benefits of data lakes and data warehouses. They offer the scalability and flexibility of data lakes, while also providing the performance, structure and governance of data warehouses.\nData Warehouses: A database system that stores data in OneLake and provides a medium to interact with the database using SQL commands or other compute engines.\nDirect Lake: Direct Lake is a new feature for Power BI that provides all the benefits and performance of Import Mode without actually importing any data into your data model.\nData Factory: Data Factory is a Fabric service that helps you to automate the process of data ingestion, transformation, and loading. Data Factory can be used to build pipelines that process data from a variety of sources including sources native to Fabric and outside the Fabric environment:\nDataflows Gen2: A new version of Dataflows that is built on top of Power Query Online. It provides a number of new features and improvements over Dataflows Gen1.\nDelta Parquet files: Delta Parquet files are a new type of Parquet file that support incremental updates. This makes them a good choice for data lakes that are used for streaming data or for data that is frequently updated.\nShortcuts: Shortcuts are a new feature of Azure Data Factory that make it easier to reuse data pipelines. Shortcuts can be used to create a reusable reference to a data pipeline, which can then be used in other pipelines.\nThis course is designed for data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, Power BI developers and other professionals who want to learn how to use Microsoft Fabric to build end-to-end data analytics solutions. No prior experience with Fabric is required.\nThis course is a great way to learn about the latest in data analytics technology and to gain the skills you need to build end-to-end data analytics solutions in Microsoft Fabric.",

      "description": "WHY IS THIS COURSE IMPORTANT?\nThe ability for Healthcare IT systems to communicate with one another in a meaningful way (interoperability) has been an issue for decades in healthcare. Initially, standards were designed to connect large Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, most of which were designed to address the insurance and billing needs of patients and hospitals. These EMR systems have had limited success for providing patients and clinicians the integrated view of healthcare information they need to make accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.\nUntil now... The birth of search engine technology, distributed web based systems and the diffusion of mobile healthcare devices into our everyday lives has made it possible for a much more mature, complete integration of not just our patient records but everything related to our healthcare needs. Ideally we, as patients and clinicians who treat us, would like to ask a healthcare question and have the various healthcare electronic systems \"serve up\" all the data and information related to that clinical question and eventually, through Artificial Intelligence (AI) suggest some diagnoses and treatments.\nThis is the promise of the new FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Standard.\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN IN THIS COURSE?\nIn this course, you will learn:\nThe Issue with our current method of connecting Healthcare IT systems\nThe MPI (Master Patient Index) Issue\nThe document based approach of current EMR systems\nWhat we really want and need\nThe enabling technologies (Web, Search , Mobile devices)\nWhat is an API (Application Programming Interface)?\nFHIR and API\nHow FHIR can make everything better.\nThis course includes:\nVideo lectures\nQuiz to test your retention\nSignificant number of resources to do a deeper dive into his topic.\nWHO IS THE IDEAL STUDENT FOR THIS COURSE?\nYou will learn a lot from this course if you are\nThinking about choosing healthcare as a career\nLooking to advance your career in healthcare\nLooking to expand your knowledge of healthcare to better perform your current job and better understand how it fits into the ecosystem of patient care and better serve those in need\nCurious about everything and want to learn more about healthcare just for the sake of expanding your knowledge base.\nWHAT IS YOUR TEACHING STYLE?\nMy teaching style is a very pragmatic one. I assume you know nothing about this topic and start with the foundation and build from there. Some of these concepts could be challenging, so I sprinkle in as many examples as I can, both non healthcare and healthcare, to assure full understanding of the topic. This is why I have appended \"Plain and Simple\" to all my courses.\nWHY ARE YOU QUALIFIED TO TEACH THIS COURSE?\nI spent 35 years in the designing and launching of medical imaging products and services. My career evolved from leading engineering teams, to becoming VP Marketing and then to president of a Healthcare IT firm. It is also based on 15 years of university teaching.",

Sandeep K.\n\"As a named \"Beginner's guide to Microservices...\" it's 100% true. As for new microservices, all topics are explained very clearly without not necessarily \"going deeper\" while it will come in the next steps. Quick and valuable course\". Adrian W.\n\"Great Experience and Well explained, Kudos for your Presentation.\" Hugo G.\n\"Powerful concept explained simply\". Saurabh S.\n\"Very high level as described but elegantly explained. I enjoyed it\" Grant H.\n\"Simple and effective course.\" Zbigniew M.\n***********************************\nDATA IS THE NEW GOLD. It is gold for companies that can harness the power of technologies and use it while transforming their business models into the digital age and becoming much more data-driven. It is an amazing journey fueled with new technologies, but we need to remember that data by itself is just one part of the equation.\nWhat about the complex software around it? That is supposed to do something useful with the data. To be able to interface with many data sources, store massive data volumes, provide a great user interface, and automatically analyze, and find useful patterns.\nSoftware is the Engine, and data is the Fuel.\nUntil recently, many enterprise-level applications were designed, developed, and maintained as one giant monolithic application. With a once in a year software release cycle, maybe two times in a year. Every small update requires building, testing, and deploying all application modules as one package.\nToday more than ever, this traditional development approach is not good enough. It is not supporting the required agility of a fast-changing business landscape. Software updates should be released and deployed in weeks, days, and even hours.\nMICROSERVICES is a new innovative development style, already being used by companies like Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, and others. Micro-services are the building blocks for creating cloud-native applications, and therefore we will see more companies following this direction.\nThis training is designed to provide you with a solid theoretical understanding of the micro-services concept.\nThe challenges with the old-school development style\nThe industry definition of micro-services and the building blocks of a single micro-service\nThen we will be able to move to the macro level and talk about the concept of a microservices architecture\nWhat are the key benefits of this approach?\nReview some interesting case studies\nWould you like to join the Microservices Revolution?",

      "description": "If your goal is to enter the world of BI, Data Mining and or Data Analysis you have to take this course. All of these environments and roles demand the skills you are about to learn\nMicrosoft PowerPivot is an add on for Excel that provides Business Intelligence functionality and reporting within the familiar environment of Excel.\nThis capability enables manipulation of hundreds of millions of rows of data with the capacity to provide business insights and shorter decision making cycles laughing in the face of the million row threshold of regular Excel\nHere's what others had to say about the course:\n\"This instructor is unbelievable. Not only were the course materials plentiful, but her instruction was full of enthusiasm and encouragement. The format was perfect for me. I never felt like I was being left behind. I'll take any course by Gilly Dow, if it's not completely relevant to something I'm working with at the moment. This course was really amazing.\"\n- Mickey Thorpe\n\n\n\"I purchased your two courses as a review to brush up on my skills Dax Power Pivot 10 Easy Steps for beginners Dax Power Pivot Time intelligence 10 easy steps Both wonderfully explained with very good demonstrated examples. Great refresher courses. You really have a gift for teaching. I took PowerPivot Pro a couple of years back and I find your walk through and demonstrations of the Dax measures so much clearer and to the point. It has been a fun enjoyable refresher for me. This is great course for everyone getting started in PowerPivot Thanks well done.\"\n- Stephen Davanzo\n\n\n\"Thank you so much for making DAX so simple and efficient. This is perfect for everyone would like to start their journey in DAX.\"\n- Ravi Vijay\n\n\n\"she is too good . I would  like to do other courses  even if they are not available on Udemy. Request Udemy to get all her works small or big on the site. Every slide I see my learning and understanding increases by leaps and bounds. I simply love this instructor and my highest regards for her way of explaining the things.\"\n- Vinay Kumra\n\n\"Great course, good testing, good exercises, easy to follow lessons. I'm about 60% complete and the further I go the better it gets. Love the practice exercises and how the instructor goes through the answers in video detail about how the solution was arrived at...great teaching techniques all around. And then, there is the 70+ page guide that is integrated into the lesson plan, makes following the videos and working independently on the practice sessions easy as everything is organized to just follow along and learn by doing. So, watch, listen read do, test, feedback, move to next lesson. Right pace, right tone, right encouragement. Excellent course! Looking forward to the advanced. Marty\"\n- Martin Rini\n\n\n\"I really loved this course because it gave a nice (IMHO) overview for a beginning DAX / Power Pivot course. The Instructor was very very good. She took time to walk-through each step. If she keeps that approach in the upcoming Intermediate and Advanced courses, they will be winners. (She even gave some \"top-tips\" for regular Excel which jogged my memory banks anyway.) I am eagerly looking forward to the release dates her subsequent courses.\"\n- Walt Lierman\n\n\nWhat You'll Learn\n\nTo start with the course focuses on importing data into Power Pivot to create the Data Model. You will learn about calculated columns and other DAX related concepts that will show you how to “shape” the data.\nNext, you will create relationships between tables of data negating the need for VLOOKUP. Reducing the time it takes to “shape” your data -  is one of the major benefits of this awesome tool.\nWith the data model in place, next you delve into the world of DAX measures. These are Data Analysis EXpressions functions that build the formulas to provide the business insights that decision makers and stakeholders dream of.\nThere is no programming involved with DAX - your Excel formulas experience has set you up nicely for the next step in your Excel journey.\nThroughout the course we work together building the data model and measures. At the end of each step you have an opportunity to practice creating your own measures to help you consolidate, embed and reinforce everything you have learned. I provide a solutions video lecture before moving on to ensure you’re on track and ready to move on.\nI provide all the files you need to follow along and a fully supporting, screen-shot enriched 78 pg. user guide pdf packed with all the steps and practice exercises with solutions.\nPower Pivot is the perfect tool for those working in finance, statistics, project, business and market analysis or any data reporting role who have a need to create and produce Business Intelligence style dashboard reports.\nThanks for taking the time to check out my course. I can't wait to help you take the next step in developing your Excel skills. I have used Excel 2016 to demonstrate this fantastic tool but you can follow along in Excel 2010 & 2013 - I'll do my best to point out the differences. If you have any questions about the course, feel free to message me here or check out the FREE preview lectures to learn more.\nTake the first steps to a new and rewarding future by clicking on the TAKE THIS COURSE button, located on the top right corner of the page.",

You have come to the right place. This is an example-based, hands-on training series in SAP MM. The goal of this course is to teach you all the major business processes in Material Management, Procurement, Consumption based planning and Physical Inventory - the key process areas in SAP MM. On top of that this course will also teach you how to perform these transactions in SAP, hands-on.\nIf you are looking to become an SAP MM Functional consultant or an end-user in SAP MM, this course will both \"paint the big picture\" as well as \"show you the weeds\" .\nWhat is this course about ?\nSAP MM is a very vast subject. It takes at least 30 to 40 hours of learning. The goal of the course is to simplify this process as much as possible. The word \"simplify\" - that is really the key. This course does not claim to be the most comprehensive course in MM, nor the most advanced course in MM. It has just one goal - to let you learn SAP MM as simple as possible.\nHow long will this course take to complete ?\n\nThis course is designed to tell you everything you need to know about SAP MM in a very gentle way. Since this course is designed from a freshers' perspective, if you are already an SAP functional consultant ( in other areas of SAP ), then the pace of this course might be a bit slow.",

      "description": "Congratulations! You're going to be a Great Software Architect!\nSoftware Architects have one of the most challenging and rewarding jobs in the industry.\nGreat salary, working with management, dealing with the up-to-date technologies and patterns, working with variety of projects and teams - all these make the Software Architect one of the most desired positions in the software industry.\nBecoming a Software Architect is not easy. but becoming a Great Software Architect is even harder.\nOne of the best methods to become a great Software Architect is to always learn, and see what other architects did in their own work.\nAnd this is exactly what this course is doing.\nIn this course we're going to discuss 4 case studies, based on a real-world, production based systems, that I've worked on in recent years.\nEach case study presents a unique challenge, with a lot of twists in the way, and together - we're going to design the architecture of each and every one of them.\nThe case studies are varied, and we'll discuss classic web app (but with a very interesting twist...), file automation system, and more.\nFor each case study, we're going to go through the whole architecture process, and do the following:\n- Map the components\n- Understand the requirements\n- Define the application type\n- Select the technology stack\n- Design the architecture\n- Add redundancy\n\n\nOur technology stack is also extremely diverse, and we're going to talk about:\n- .NET Core\n- SQL Server\n- Java\n- MongoDB\n- MySQL\nAnd more...\n\n\nImportant Note: This course builds on the foundations laid in The Complete Guide to Becoming a Software Architect course, and uses some concepts taught in it (mainly the architecture process). It is highly recommended, though not mandatory, to to take this course before this one.\n\n\nBut wait, that's not all!\nOne of the most important product of the architect's work are the architecture diagrams. These diagrams are the epitome of the architecture process, and summarize and represent the various aspects of the architecture.\nIn this course, we're going to have 3 architecture diagrams for each case study:\n1. Logic Diagram\n2. Technical Diagram\n3. Physical Diagram\nThese diagrams shows the various aspects of the architecture, and are an essential part of the architect's work.\nAnd the good part?\nYou can download these diagrams for your own use. These diagrams are a great starter for architecture diagrams, and there's a good chance your own system is quite similar to at least one of the case studies in this course. And even if not - you can still use it as a base for your own. Simply put - it's yours to use.\nThis course is the only course that gives you access to real-world, production based architectures, based on systems designed by real architects, developed by real developers, and have millions of $ invested in them. Don't miss this opportunity!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do my students have to say about my courses?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"well done - The course was very practical\" - Sam\n\"[The course] given me the confidence to go out to the market and advertise myself as such [an Architect]\" - Mathew\n\"Life Changing\" - Arivazhagan\nAnd lots more...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is this course for?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nActually, any person who is involved in software development, even system analyst, can profit from this course.\nHowever, the best candidate for this course is a Software Architect that wants to expand her knowledge, or a developer with some experience, preferably 2 years. This experience will help mainly in understanding the terminology used in this course.\nIf you're not sure if this course is for you - drop me a note!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Me\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been a Software Architect for more than 18 years, working with a variety of clients - Fortune 100 enterprises, start-ups, govt. entities, defense, telco, banking, and lots more.\nI'm an avid speaker and trainer, having trained thousands of students in various courses in the past.\nI love what I do, and my greatest passion (well, besides my family...) is designing modern, practical, and reliable systems for my clients.",

Olanrewaju A.\n****************************************************************\nCloud Computing is HERE!\nOver the last couple of years, many business companies decided to use more and more cloud services as part of their digital transformation. They are trying to be more innovative and flexible to the dynamic business landscape by leveraging the power of the cloud. Cloud computing includes a variety of cloud service models, like SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, and FaaS. Each of them is a complete category of cloud services used to solve a variety of business challenges.\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\nThis training is about the IaaS model. The IaaS model provided by large cloud providers is helping companies to transform their private IT infrastructure into a utility service. Reduce the footprint of enterprise applications sitting in private data centers and leverage the capabilities in a public cloud environment.\nAs a first step, we are going to review the key terms in cloud computing to establish a clear understanding of the big picture, and then we will zoom on the IaaS model. What are the building blocks, what are the typical use cases, advantages as well as disadvantages, pricing models, and more!\nWould you like to join the Cloud Computing revolution?",

      "description": "Are you tired of manually copying and pasting values in a spreadsheet?\nDo you want to learn how to obtain interesting, real-time and even rare information from the internet with a simple script?\nAre you eager to acquire a valuable skill to stay ahead of the competition in this data-driven world?\nIf the answer is yes, then you have come to the right place at the right time!\nWelcome to Web Scraping and API Fundamentals in Python!\nThe definitive course on data collection!\nWeb Scraping is a technique for obtaining information from web pages or other sources of data, such as APIs, through the use of intelligent automated programs. Web Scraping allows us to gather data from potentially hundreds or thousands of pages with a few lines of code.\nFrom reporting to data science, automating extracting data from the web avoids repetitive work. For example, if you have worked in a serious organization, you certainly know that reporting is a recurring topic. There are daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly reports. Whether they aim to organize the website data, transactional data, customer data, or even more easy-going information like the weather forecast – reports are indispensable in the current world. And while sometimes it is the intern’s job to take care of that, very few tasks are more cost-saving than the automation of reports.\nWhen it comes to data science – more and more data comes from external sources, like webpages, downloadable files, and APIs. Knowing how to extract and structure that data quickly is an essential skill that will set you apart in the job market.\nYes, it is time to up your game and learn how you can automate the use of APIs and the extraction of useful info from websites.\nIn the first part of the course, we start with APIs. APIs are specifically designed to provide data to developers, so they are the first place to check when searching for data. We will learn about GET requests, POST requests and the JSON format.\nThese concepts are all explored through interesting examples and in a straight-to-the-point manner.\nSometimes, however, the information may not be available through the use of an API, but it is contained on a webpage. What can we do in this scenario? Visit the page and write down the data manually?\nPlease don’t ever do that!\nWe will learn how to leverage powerful libraries such as ‘Beautiful Soup’ and ‘requests HTML’ to scrape any website out there, no matter what combination of languages are used – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.\nCertainly, in order to scrape, you’ll need to know a thing or two about web development. That’s why we have also included an optional section that covers the basics of HTML. Consider that a bonus to all the knowledge you will acquire!\nWe will also explore several scraping projects. We will obtain and structure data about movies from a “Rotten Tomatoes” rank list, examining each step of the process in detail. This will help you develop a feel for what scraping is like in the real world.\nWe’ll also tackle how to scrape data from many webpages at once, an all-to-common need when it comes to data extraction.\nAnd then it will be your turn to practice what you’ve learned with several projects we'll set out for you.\nBut there’s even more!\nWeb Scraping may not always go as planned (after all, that’s why you will be taking this course). Different websites are built in different ways and often our bots may be obstructed. Because of this, we will make an extra effort to explore common roadblocks that you may encounter while scraping and present you with ways to circumnavigate or deal with those problems. These include request headers and cookies, log-in systems and JavaScript generated content.\nDon’t worry if you are familiar with few or none of these terms… We will start from the basics and build our way to proficiency. Moreover, we are firm believers that practice makes perfect, so this course is not so much on the theory side of things, as it adopts more of a hands-on approach. What’s more, it contains plenty of homework exercises, downloadable files and notebooks, as well as quiz questions and course notes.\nWe, the 365 Data Science Team are committed to providing only the highest quality content to you – our students. And while we love creating our content in-house, this time we’ve decided to team up with a true industry expert - Andrew Treadway. Andrew is a Senior Data Scientist for the New York Life Insurance Company. He holds a Master’s degree in Computer Science with Machine learning from the Georgia Institute of Technology and is an outstanding professional with more than 7 years of experience in data-related Python programming. He’s also the author of the ‘yahoo_fin’ package, widely used for scraping historical stock price data from Yahoo.\nAs with all of our courses, you have a 30-day money-back guarantee, if at some point you decide that the training isn’t the best fit for you. So… you’ve got nothing to lose – and everything to gain ?\nSo, what are you waiting for?\nClick the ‘Buy now’ button and let’s start collecting data together!",

Karate is implemented in Java but test-scripts are written in Gherkin since Karate was originally an extension of the Cucumber framework.\n\n\nKarate is built on top of Cucumber, another BDD testing framework, and shares some of the same concepts. One of these is the use of a Gherkin file, which describes the tested feature. However, unlike Cucumber, tests aren't written in Java and are fully described in the Gherkin file.\n\n\nFrom this course, you will learn the following concepts.\n\n\nKarate configuration\n\n\nOverview on API with examples\n\n\nOverview on JSON with examples\n\n\nLive example of API calls\n\n\nKarate Framework\n\n\nGET/POST Request\n\n\nData-Driven with Scenario Outline\n\n\nCreating Parallel runner\n\n\nAssertions\n\n\nUsing match\n\n\nJSON Array matching\n\n\nSchema validation\n\n\nFussy matcher: #string, #number\n\n\ncalling another feature\n\n\nTags and Run with tags\n\n\nkarate runner configuration and karate options\n\n\nReport Generation\n\n\nCucumber Report Generation\n\n\nKarate Report Generation\n\n\nAt the end of this training you will be in a position to work on your project using this framework. This course is designed for beginners who wants to start their career in api automation testing\nSee you in the session, thank you guys\n\n\n#API Automation Testing\n#APIAutomationTesting\n#karate\n#EndtoEndAPIAutomationwithKarateFramework.\n#APIAutomationMadeSimple.\n#End to End API Automation with Karate Framework.\n#API Automation Made Simple.",

      "description": "News and Updates.\nThis is the best-seller course in ROS on Udemy.\nMy course has been upgraded to the latest version of ROS, ROS Noetic, with several new videos explaining the fundamental concepts of ROS with hands-on illustrations. It will also give you the required skills to later learn ROS2 and navigation stack, as presented in my two other courses.\nWhy am I teaching this course?\nTypically, new ROS users encounter many difficulties when they start programming with ROS. Although there are so many tutorials, there are a lot of tips and practical issues that could not be easily found in tutorials and are not discussed and are left to the developer's luck. Although there is much documentation for ROS, several are very broad, and it takes too long to grasp the concepts well. This is where this course plays a role and provides an added value by providing a focused introduction to the BASICS of ROS. The course not only presents the basic concepts of ROS but also addresses two essential fields in robotics: (1) motion and (2) perception. We will apply the general concepts of ROS in the context of robotic motion and perception. The course will provide you with an opportunity to learn about OpenCV, the most powerful computer vision library that promotes robotic perception.\nMy approach is to take you STEP BY STEP through the roadmap of learning ROS so that you learn the concepts in the proper order and help you build an experience from one lecture to the other.\nThis is a course that provides the fundamental concepts and basics of the Robot Operating System (ROS). This course intends to give beginner ROS users a quick and focused introduction to ROS basics and practical tips that help them better manage their first projects with ROS in C++ and Python. In particular, developing with C++ in ROS requires special care compared to Python to configure the compilation and runtime environment well. This is presented clearly in this course.\nThere are mainly three majors steps in the course:\nROS Basics and Foundation: This deals with the general ROS concepts everyone has to know, like ROS topics, Services, Messages, and Nodes, ...\nMotion in ROS: We apply the concepts learned in Step 1 to make a robot move. We will develop a different trajectory in the context of an excellent example simulating a cleaning robot. In particular, we illustrate how to represent the pose (position and orientation) of a robot in ROS and how to send a motion control message to make the robot move. We clearly demonstrate how to implement linear, rotational, and spiral motions and how all of these can be integrated to simulate a cleaning application. This part will give you the background you need to understand robot kinematics and how motion is represented in ROS.\nPerception in ROS: I will introduce how a robot sees the environment using a camera, how the images are collected in ROS, and how they are processed in OpenCV.\nArduino: you will also learn how to use Arduino boards and sensors with ROS using the ROSSERIAL Arduino interface. This will allow you to integrate any Arduino sensor and board into your robot and robotics applications.\nBased on my experience, these are the most important things any new ROS user must know to go further with their own robotics project.\nI also provide some hands-on activities that allow the learner to assess his understanding and push him to practice the concepts he learned.\nMy experience with ROS\nI have been programming with ROS for many years both in academic and industrial projects. I am very passionate about developing a program with ROS. I have also been teaching ROS at the University and providing training programs. I am the leader of the Robotics and Internet-of-Things Lab at Prince Sultan University and also a consultant for Gaitech Robotics. I have developed many ROS packages for robots and drones. I have been leading international scientific activities around ROS, and in particular, I am the editor of three volumes of books with Springer entitled Robot Operating System, The Complete Reference. I gained a lot of experience in what difficulties new users encounter in learning ROS, which contributed to pinning right to the point addressing these problems through the different lectures of the course.\n\n\nWelcome to the World of ROS.",

      "description": "In this course, we’re going to learn how to Design Microservices Architecture with using Design Patterns, Principles and the Best Practices with Iterate Design Architecture from Monolithic to Microservices. We will using the right architecture design patterns and techniques.\nBy the end of the course, you will Learn how to handle millions of request with designing system for high availability, high scalability, low latency, and resilience to network failures on microservices distributed architectures.\nThis course is will be the journey of software architecture design with step by step evolving architecture from monolithic to event driven microservices.\nWe will start the basics of software architecture with designing e-commerce Monolithic architecture that handles low amount of requests.\nAfter that step by step evolves the architecture with;\n3-Tier Architecture\nModular Monolithic Architecture\nMicroservices\nEvent-Driven Microservices Architectures\nand lastly Serverless Microservices Architectures with designing together that handle millions of requests. This is a step-by-step process for software system design and evolve from monolithic to microservices following the patterns & principles.\nWe will discuss microservices architectures with all aspects,\nMicroservices Decomposition\nMicroservices Communications (Sync / Async Message-Based Communication, API Gateways)\nMicroservices Data Management (Databases / Query / Commands)\nMicroservices Transaction Management\nMicroservices Distributed Caching\nMicroservices Deployments with Containers and Orchestrators\nMicroservices Resilience\nwith applying microservices design patterns and practices.\nWe are going to design with together and step by step with refactor architectures with all aspects of microservices pillars.\nWe will start with designing Monolithic Architecture. And you can see that we have Functional and Non-functional requirements that should cover our design and we have patterns and principles toolbox that we will learn and use these principles when evolving architectures.\nWay of Learning — The Course Flow\nWe will always starts with the problem and try to solve this problem with learning and designing new architectures, patterns and best practices.\nProblem -> Learn -> Design -> Code -> Evaluate\nWe will complete this circle for every section of the course. You will find that we will add new requirements in order to handle millions of request and learn new patterns and practices that will use these principles when evolving architectures.\nThat means you're not just passively receiving information. You're actively participating in the architectural decision-making process, seeing the direct impact of each pattern and principle through code. We'll emphasize the 'why' behind every decision,  ensuring you build a deep understanding.\nWe will see full of patterns and principle toolbox is loading with new patterns and apply them into current designs. We will see latest patterns that we use more than 30 patterns and practices with implementing high scalability, high availability and handle millions of request requirements.\nLet me write some microservices pattern which we covered in this course;\nThe Database-per-Service Pattern\nAPI Gateway Pattern, Gateway Routing/Aggregation/Offloading Pattern\nBackends for Frontends pattern BFF\nService Aggregator Pattern, Service Registry/Discovery Pattern\nFan-out Publish/Subscribe Messaging Pattern\nTopic-Queue Chaining & Load Balancing Pattern\nThe Shared Database Anti-Pattern and Polyglot Persistence\nDatabase Sharding Pattern, CAP Theorem\nMaterialized View Pattern\nCQRS and Event Sourcing Patterns\nSAGA Pattern — Choreography-based/Orchestration-based SAGA\nCompensating Transaction Pattern\nTransactional Outbox Pattern\nDual Write Problem\nCDC — Change Data Capture with Outbox Pattern\nEvent Hubs and Real-time Event Streaming in Event-Driven Microservices Architecture\nCache-Aside Pattern for Microservices Distributed Caching\nSidecar Pattern\nService Mesh Pattern\nDevOps and CI/CD Pipelines for Microservices Deployments\nDeployment Strategies for Microservices: Blue-green, Rolling and Canary deployments\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) and usage in Microservices Deployments\nMicroservices Resilience, Observability and Monitoring Patterns\nRetry and Circuit Breaker Patterns\nBulkhead / Timeout / Cache / Fallback Patterns\nElastic Stack for Microservices Observability with Distributed Logging\nMicroservices Health Checks: Liveness, Readiness and Performance Checks\nServerless Microservices Architecture implementation on AWS\nSo the course flow will be the both theoretical and practical information;\nWe will always start with a business problem\nWe will learn a specific pattern, why and where we should use\nAfter that we will see the Reference architectures that applied these patterns\nAfter that we will design our architecture with applying this newly learned pattern with together\nAnd lastly we will decide which Technologies can be choices for that architectures.\nAnd for each section, we will made Code Review for Existing Microservices Architecture Repository on GitHub for practical implementation of microservices architecture.\nSo this course will includes\nHands-on Design Activities\nIterate Design Architecture from On-Premises to Cloud Server-less architectures\nEvolves architecture monolithic to Event-Driven Microservices Architectures\nRefactoring System Design for handling million of requests\nApply best practices with microservices design patterns and principles\nExamine microservices patterns with all aspects like Communications, Data Management, Caching and Deployments\nPrepare for Software Architecture Interviews\nPrepare for System Design Architecture Interview exams.\nI have been joined several famous company's architecture position interviews, also involved software architect positions assessment process more than 50+ interviews collect the architecture requirements for software industry positions.\nSo with this course, you will gain real-world experience about all architecture positions from monolithic to event-driven microservices architectures.\nThis course prepared for the beginner but at least you should familiar with basics of software architectures. This course will have good theoretical information but also will be 90% of hands-on design activities. All course architecture steps will designed step by step and together.\nI hope you'll join me on this journey and develop this project with me.",

Despite not knowing JavaScript well, I can now build cool full stack applications, all thanks to Cursor.\n\nAccelerated Learning with Cursor AI\nCursor enables developers to bridge the gap between backend and frontend development at an unprecedented pace. Key benefits include:\nTransition to full stack development within minutes, not months\nAI-assisted coding to quickly master unfamiliar frontend technologies\nImmediate application of backend knowledge to full stack projects\n\nVibe coding\nVibe coding is an AI-dependent programming technique introduced in 2025. It allows programmers to generate working code by providing natural language descriptions to large language models (LLMs) tuned for coding, rather than manually writing the code themselves.\n\nWhat You'll Learn in This Course:\nCursor, V0, Vercel\nCode FullStack Applications with Cursor : Master frontend technologies even if you're not a JavaScript expert\nCode with the best programming language- English\nFrom Idea to Production: Learn how to quickly bring your backend ideas to life with fully-functional frontends.\nReal-World Full Stack Projects: Build shippable applications that showcase your new full stack skills.\nCursor Features that are covered in the course:\nCursor Settings\nCursor Privacy Mode\nCursor Composer\nCursor Projects\nCursor Notepads\nTab completions, Chat completions\n.cursorfiles\nCodebase Indexing\nBolt IDE\nWindsurf\nVibe Coding\nAbout Cursor AI\nCursor is a next-generation code editor developed by Anysphere, designed to dramatically enhance programming efficiency through AI assistance.

      "description": "The Fourier transform is one of the most important operations in signal processing and modern technology, and therefore in modern human civilization. But how does it work, and why does it work?\n\n\nWhat you will learn in this course:\nYou will learn the theoretical and computational bases of the Fourier transform, with a strong focus on how the Fourier transform is used in modern applications in signal processing, data analysis, and image filtering. The course covers not only the basics, but also advanced topics including effects of non-stationarities, spectral resolution, normalization, filtering. All videos come with MATLAB and Python code for you to learn from and adapt!\nThis course is focused on implementations of the Fourier transform on computers, and applications in digital signal processing (1D) and image processing (2D). I don't go into detail about setting up and solving integration problems to obtain analytical solutions. Thus, this course is more on the computer science/data science/engineering side of things, rather than on the pure mathematics/differential equations/infinite series side.\n\n\nThis course is for you if you are an aspiring or established:\nData scientist\nStatistician\nComputer scientist (MATLAB and/or Python)\nSignal processing or image processing expert (or aspiring!)\nBiologist\nEngineer\nStudent\nCurious independent learner!\n\n\nWhat you get in this course:\n>6 hours of video lectures that include explanations, pictures, and diagrams\npdf readers with important notes and explanations\nMany exercises and their solutions! (Note: exercises are in the pdf readers)\nMATLAB code, Python code, and sample datasets for applications\nWith >3000 lines of MATLAB and Python code, this course is also a great way to improve your programming skills, particularly in the context of signal processing and image processing.\n\n\nWhy I am qualified to teach this course:\nI have been using the Fourier transform extensively in my research and teaching (primarily in MATLAB) for nearly two decades. I have written several textbooks about data analysis, programming, and statistics, that rely extensively on the Fourier transform. Most importantly: I have taught the Fourier transform to bachelor's students, PhD students, professors, and professionals, and I have taught to people from many backgrounds, including biology, psychology, physics, mathematics, and engineering.\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for??\nWatch the course introductory video to learn more about the contents of this course and about my teaching style. And scroll down to see what other students think of this course and of my teaching style.\nI hope to see you soon in the course!\nMike",

In this course we dive into working with data from different sources using Flow expressions.\nIn this course you will learn everything you need to write expressions effectively and figure out how to use Power Automate data operations (Filter Array, Select, Compose).\nAlthough most of the course engages you with writing code and expressions, they are extremely easy to follow and build expressions once you understand the model behind the expressions.\nIf you are new to Microsoft Flow, first complete my beginner course about Microsoft Flow called \"Microsoft Flow Crash Course\" before you start this course.",

      "description": "Here is what my students have to say about this course:\n\"Impressive and full of knowledge\" - Pradip\n\"Well organized and structured material. Also a good case study to get an idea about the usage of the process. Thank you Memi!\" - Gabriel\n\"Memi has given the deeper understanding of security aspect in architecture which is otherwise missing in majority of architectures... Highly recommended course\" - Yashodan\n\n\nSoftware Security is one of the most important aspects of Software Architecture these days.\nAlmost daily you hear about new security incidents which caused data leak, disruption of service, and often - billions of dollar in damages, and some companies even shut down because of that.\nYou, as as software architect, has the responsibility to make sure your architecture is as secure as possible.\nYou simply cannot allow yourself to release a system that is not secure. These days, it's simply unacceptable.\nNow, in order to design secure architecture, you must be well versed in all security aspects of software design.\nAnd this is exactly what this course is for.\nThis course will teach you all you need to know, as an architect, regarding software security. When completing the course, you'll have the necessary knowledge to design secure architecture.\nNow, I strongly believe that talking just about secure architecture is not enough. In order to be a really great architect you must have a holistic view of all aspects of software security.\nAnd because of that, this course covers all the bases of software security.\nHere is a partial list of what we'll talk about in this course:\n- What is Security?\n- The Secure Architecture Process\n- Threat Modeling\n- The Five Perimeters of software security\n- Some common attacks and how to defend from them\n- Authentication and Authorization\n- Encryption\n- Secure Communication\nAnd lots and lots more...\nIn this course you'll learn the terminology of Software Security, and you'll encounter terms such as SQL Injection, MFA, MITM and more. Don't worry - we'll explain everything, and will make sure you fully understand these terms.\nIn fact, you don't have to have any prior knowledge of software security. We'll start from the very beginning.\nAfter completing this course you'll have everything you need in order to design software architecture which is as secure as possible.\n\n\nBut that's not all...\nAt the end of this course, you'll be able to download the Secure Architecture Checklist, a comprehensive checklist that will guide you through the process of designing secure systems, and provide a step-by-step guidance for each step.\nUsing this checklist will ensure your system is as secure as possible, will make your client happy, and, most important - will make you a better architect.\n\n\nThis course takes you from the absolute basics of Software Security to the most advanced topics, known only to few. Completing this course will give you all the knowledge required for designing secure systems, and, as a bonus, will put you in a great position when looking for your next job.\nNo other course covers this topic in such a comprehensive and thorough way. I've put all my 20+ years of experience with hundreds of clients in this course, and I'm sure you will greatly benefit from it.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do my students have to say about my courses?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"well done - The course was very practical\" - Sam\n\"Good explanation on the topics covered, \"Soft Skills\" section is a great addition of topics\" - Sergio\n\"[The course] given me the confidence to go out to the market and advertise myself as such [an Architect]\" - Mathew\n\"Life Changing\" - Arivazhagan\nAnd lots more...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is this course for?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAny person who is involved in development, even system analyst, can profit from this course.\nThat includes:\n- Junior developers\n- Senior developers\n- Architects\n- Anyone who is interested in software security.\nIf you're not sure if this course is for you - drop me a note!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat are the prerequisites for this course?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIt's a good idea to have some basic knowledge about software architecture, but it's not a must.\nIn any case, you don't have to have any prior knowledge of software security!\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Me\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been in the software industry for more than 20 years, and a Software Architect for more than 17 years, working with a variety of clients - Fortune 100 enterprises, start-ups, govt. entities, defense, telco, banking, and lots more.\nI'm an avid speaker and trainer, having trained thousands of students in various courses.\nI love what I do, and my greatest passion (well, besides my family...) is designing modern, practical, and reliable systems for my clients, using the best possible architecture patterns.",

      "description": "Hi there! My name is Ali Gelenler. I'm here to help you learn microservices architecture while applying Clean and Hexagonal Architectures and using Domain Driven Design.\nIn this course, you will focus on architectural aspects of microservices architecture and use Clean & Hexagonal Architecture principles while developing each service. In the implementation of the domain layer you will also apply Domain Driven Design principles.\nYou can always use the latest versions for spring boot, and other dependencies in this course. I will be constantly updating the dependency version in the last section's lectures. You may check that to see the required code and configuration changes for updated versions. Also if you would like to use subtitles during the course, you can turn on the captions on videos as all lectures are updated with hand-written subtitles. You may choose among over 20 different languages. I suggest using subtitles to make it easier to follow the lectures.\n\n\nScott Knox: \"As a working professional, I can already tell this is the holy grail of understanding modern architectures. If your company is struggling to grasp certain concepts, this course will help you help them. Thanks Ali for the excellent explanations!\"\nYou will implement SAGA, Outbox and CQRS patterns using the 4 Spring boot Java microservices that you will develop using Clean and Hexagonal architecture principles.\n\n\nNick Goupinets: \"Great course - gives a deep-dive into microservice development experience with Spring Boot. As an added bonus shows how to deploy it with Kubernetes. At times it felt too detailed, sort of making it hard to see the forest behind the trees. Also Hex. architecture resulted in what looked like an over-engineered overall solution. With that said, Ali did a fantastic job explaining all of the design decisions with clear architecture diagrams that offset that complexity!\"\nYou will also learn and use Apache Kafka as the event store, and use events to communicate between services, and to implement the architectural patterns.\n\n\nNischal Jadhav: \"If u are looking to become an high level developer or an architect, then this is the best course.!\"\nThe concepts that you will be learning and implementing are:\nSpring boot microservices\nClean Architecture\nHexagonal Architecture\nDomain Driven Design\nEvent-driven services using Apache Kafka\nSAGA Architecture Pattern\nOutbox Architecture Pattern\nCQRS Architecture Pattern\nKubernetes on local using Docker desktop\nKubernetes on Google Cloud using Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE)\n\n\nAli Aminian: \"I really like this course. Thanks Ali for complete description and professional coding. I really enjoy to participate this course.\"\nTo communicate with the data stores in microservices you will use Spring Data JPA for PostgreSQL, and Spring Kafka for Kafka.\nYou will be following a hands-on approach and  developing a project from scratch. You will have 4 microservices that communicate using events with Kafka as the event store.\n\n\nr j: \"This is an amazing course. An architect from my team recommended this to me and he's implemented something similar but bigger in our company, the biggest retailer on the planet.\"\nYou will also have multiple choice quizzes in each section to check your progress throughout the course.\n\n\nArindam Majumdar: \"This course helped me immensely to understand the Domain Driven Design approach on Microservices. Its so far the best hands on course I have come across in Udemy so far. Many thanks to Ali. Great job!! :)\"\nAt the end of the course you will understand how to run an event-driven microservices architecture with Clean and Hexagonal Architecture principles and with Domain Driven Design concepts. You will use Spring boot and Java to develop the microservices. You will also learn implementing architectural microservices patterns such as SAGA, Outbox and CQRS. In the end you will be able to deploy your application to Kubernetes on Google Cloud using Google Kubernetes Engine.\n\n\nAnurag tiwari: \"Just started the course but i can already tell that this a good one Ali explains all the concepts like out box ,saga pattern so well. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to take their knowledge about microservices to the next level using different patterns like hexagonal ,saga pattern. I would also recommend this course for beginners as youll learn a ton of stuff regarding microservices and patterns to create agile services as this course is very hands on\"\nI have followed the same clean & hexagonal architectures and domain driven design principles in the implementation of each microservice. If you feel like you want to skip some repeating parts, you may download the source code that I provide in the first lecture of each section starting from section-3 or using the github links that I provided in the course resources. You can then use the provided source code to continue with the section.\n\n\nNarendra Kumar A: \"Its awesome course, I have ever come across in Udemy explaining the DDD, Clean architecture and usage of patterns concepts so cleanly.\"\nFor more detailed information on the progress of this course, you can check the introductory video and free lessons, and if you decide to enroll in this course, you are always welcome to ask and discuss the concepts and implementation details on Q/A and messages sections. I will guide you from start to finish to help you successfully complete the course and gain as much knowledge and experience as possible from this course.\n\n\nJason: \"This course is one of the best I ever had. There are many microsevices courses on Udemy, and most of them are like something that manufactured in the same factory. They all used the same framework and followed the same steps to teach microservices. They never talked about the important concepts behind the microservice. I felt like they just wanted to show off the latest version of frameworks and finish the long courses with them quickly and get paid. The impression after I watched first this lesson was amazing. He actually starts the project with the bare bone java plain object. It was like I'm flying with feather, not fully armed with numerous buzzword frameworks. It might be frustrated at first if you are really new to microservices and never heard of concepts like DDD before. But I'm pretty sure this is one of the courses that make you a \"better\" developer.\"\nRemember! There is a 30-day full money-back guarantee for this course!

      "description": "The OpenAPI Specification (often called \"Swagger\") is currently the most popular way to create definitions of RESTful APIs. With these definitions, you can create sophisticated, autogenerated documentation, generate SDKs in several languages, and do automated testing. Swagger is a set of open source tools that use these Open API Specification definition files.\nThis class is for people in the software industry who are fairly technical, but are not software developers: for example, project managers, API product managers, and technical writers. It assumes that you understand REST and JSON, but that's about all. It is meant to be for people who are new to the Open API Specification and Swagger, rather than for experts. It covers:\nWhat you can do with OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files\nThe YAML file format\nHow to create an OAS file\nHow to specify security\nHow to add documentation\nHow to write an OAS file in JSON\nAlternatives to Swagger and OAS\nThis class does not cover:\nHow to set up Swagger on your own server\nHow to modify Swagger open source code\nIn addition to videos, this course contains 8 hands-on exercises that lead you step-by-step in creating an API definition file, including a final project where you create a file from scratch using documentation from an actual commercial API. It also contains a document with resources on learning more about OAS, Swagger, and alternatives.\nIn addition to the video lectures, expect to spend at least 4 hours doing the exercises. These exercises are key to understanding Swagger and OAS.\nImportant: The course uses OAS 2. A newer version, OAS 3, is starting to be used more, but  many companies are still using OAS 2. There is a lecture that points you to the differences between OAS 2 and OAS 3.",

(Also covered by Servlets, which was way popular before Spring framework) This provides a foundational understanding of the framework's significance in Java web development.\nProject Setup in Spring Boot: The next step involves the setup of a Spring Boot project, essential for initiating our development endeavours. This phase ensures our environment is configured optimally for future application development.\nUnderstanding Layered Architecture: Layered architecture is pivotal for the organisation and scalability of our applications. This concept enables us to structure our code in a manner that promotes modularity and maintainability.\nMaven and Its Lifecycle: Maven serves as a powerful tool for project management and dependency resolution. Understanding its lifecycle is crucial for efficient project development and management of dependencies. We can create Spring boot project using Maven or Gradle, so understanding of this, i think is must.\nController Layer Annotations: Get in-depth understanding of annotations such as @RestController and @RequestMapping facilitates the development of RESTful APIs. These annotations provide directives to Spring Boot, dictating the behavior of our controllers. Covered many other annotation like @RestController @Controller @Responebody @RequetMapping @RequestParam @PathVariable @InitBinder @RequestBody\nBean Lifecycle in Spring Boot: In this you will get to know about BEAN and its lifecycle, I have also explained about IOC (Inversion of Control) which manages those Bean.\nYou will get to know about different ways of creating Bean (@Component and @Bean annotation), Different types when bean get created (Eagerly and Lazily).\n7.

There is no academic course for that, and no formal training.\nYou might assume that being a great developer is enough to become a great Software Architect - but that's not the case.\nA great Software Architect employs a mix of great technical skills, the ability to take a high-level look, and great interpersonal skills.\nYou may find other courses that will teach you programming skills, project management skills and even software design skills. But no course covers all the bases as this one.\nHere is what we will discuss in this comprehensive, 115 lectures length, course:\n- What is a Software Architect and why you want to become one\n- What are the steps you should take in the Architecture Process\n- What are System Requirements and why they are so important for the architecture\n- A proven, tested way of selecting the technology stack\n- How to design the system's components architecture\n- What are design patterns and why does it matter\n- How to design the overall system architecture\n- What is architecture document and why it's so important\n- Super important soft skills every architect should possess\n- Some advanced architecture patterns you should keep in mind\n- And lots more...\n\n\nBut wait, that's not all!\nOne of the cornerstones of the architect's work is the architecture document. This document contains all the information regarding the architecture designed by the architect, including requirements, technology stack. component's architecture, system architecture and lots more.\nCreating the architecture document is a daunting task, that can take months of hard work.\nBut if you take this course - your life will be much easier!\nTowards the end of this course, we'll work together on a real-world case study, one that stems from other projects I've worked on. After discussing the case study, and designing its architecture,  you'll have an opportunity to download a real-world, full blown architecture document, complete with all the information related to the case study. In fact, this is an industry-grade document, which I used in dozens of systems I've worked on.\nAnd the best part? It's yours to use! Feel free to take this document, modify the parts that are relevant to your project, and submit it to your client!\nAgain - you're going to give your client a professional looking, modern, methodical document that covers all the bases, and makes a great impression.\nNo other course provides such a document, and that's because I'm fully confident in the document's contribution to your work and reputation, as I used it extensively in the past years.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do my students have to say about the course?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"well done - The course was very practical\" - Sam\n\"Good explanation on the topics covered, \"Soft Skills\" section is a great addition of topics\" - Sergio\n\"[The course] given me the confidence to go out to the market and advertise myself as such [an Architect]\" - Mathew\nAnd lots more...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is this course for?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nActually, any person who is involved in software development, even system analyst, can profit from this course.\nHowever, the best candidate for this course is a developer with some experience, preferably 2 years. This experience will help mainly in understanding the terminology used in this course.\nIf you're not sure if this course is for you - drop me a note!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Me\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been a Software Architect for more than 17 years, working with a variety of clients - Fortune 100 enterprises, start-ups, govt. entities, defense, telco, banking, and lots more.\nI'm an avid speaker and trainer, having trained thousands of students in various courses in the past.\nI love what I do, and my greatest passion (well, besides my family...) is designing modern, practical, and reliable systems for my clients.",

      "description": "Why Most Performance Testers Fail When It Really Matters ??\n(Discover the performance engineering secrets that 14 years of preventing system crashes taught me – beyond what any tool-focused courses will tell you)\n\n\nEver watched an app crash during a Black Friday sale?\nThat's what happens when software performance testing goes wrong. Or worse – when it never happened at all.\n\n\nBut here's the problem: most performance testers today are just \"tool jockeys\" – they know which buttons to click in JMeter or LoadRunner, but they're lost when real performance challenges strike. And that's exactly why companies are desperately seeking true Performance Engineers.\n\n\nAfter 14 years of preventing digital disasters at major corporations, I discovered something shocking: 90% of performance testing courses out there are teaching it backward. They jump straight to tools without building the foundation that actually matters.\n\n\nThink about it: would you trust a doctor who only knows how to use medical equipment but doesn't understand human anatomy?\nThat's why I created \"Software Performance Testing and Engineering\" course that transforms tool users into Performance Engineers.\n\n\nHere's what makes this course different:\nInstead of just teaching you how to write test scripts, you'll learn to think like a Performance Engineer. You'll understand the \"why\" behind every test, every metric, and every decision. This isn't about memorizing steps in JMeter – it's about developing an engineering mindset that works with any tool, any project, any scale.\nImagine walking into your next meeting and confidently explaining exactly why the system will (or won't) handle next month's product launch. Imagine being the person who prevents crashes before they happen, who can prove exactly how many users your system can handle, who knows precisely where to look when things go wrong.\nThis course is your blueprint for becoming that person.\n\n\nYou'll learn:\n- The core principles that apply to every performance testing scenario (even ones that haven't been invented yet).\n- How to design tests that reveal real problems (not just nice-looking reports).\n- The exact methodology I've used to architect reliable systems for 14 years.\n- Hands-on practice with JMeter that teaches you universal concepts, not just tool-specific tricks.\n\n\nThis course is perfect for you if you're:\n- A developer who wants to build systems that actually scale.\n- A QA engineer ready to move beyond basic functional testing.\n- A DevOps professional who needs to prevent performance problems, not just react to them.\n- An IT professional who wants to specialize in one of tech's highest-paying skills.\n\n\nBut I should warn you: if you're looking for a quick \"certificate mill\" course that just teaches button-clicking, this isn't for you. This is for professionals who want to master the art and science of performance engineering.\n\n\nReady to become the Performance Expert your team needs?\n'Enroll Now' to begin your transformation from just a tool user to Performance Engineer.\n\nThere are many tools in the market to do Software Performance Testing but before you learn any of the tools mentioned below, you must learn the core performance testing & Engineering principles thought in this course first.\n\n\n1. Apache JMeter: An open-source tool that can be used for performance testing and load testing. It supports various protocols like HTTP, JDBC, LDAP, and more.\n2. LoadRunner: Developed by Micro Focus, LoadRunner is a widely used performance testing tool. It supports a variety of protocols and provides a comprehensive set of features for performance testing.\n3. Gatling: An open-source tool that is designed for load testing. It is written in Scala and supports protocols like HTTP, WebSockets, and more.\n4. Locust: An open-source, Python-based tool for load testing. It allows you to define user behavior using code and supports distributed testing.\n5. BlazeMeter: A cloud-based performance testing platform that integrates with various open-source tools like Apache JMeter and Selenium. It provides real-time reporting and analysis.\n6. Neoload: A performance testing tool that supports web and mobile applications. It offers features like dynamic infrastructure scaling and integration with CI/CD tools.\n7.

      "description": "If you spend a lot of time extracting, transforming, or analyzing data from databases, - or you're aiming for one of the many highly paid career paths that rely heavily on this skill - then this course is for you.\nLearning to query databases with SQL is a substantial part of highly paid careers such as Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Analyst, but also provides a strong foundation for even more exotic roles like that of a Data Scientist. Experienced Data Scientists will tell you that the majority of their time isn't spent tuning machine learning algorithms, but rather preparing and cleaning data for use by those algorithms - something SQL does exceptionally well.\nIn this course, I have tried to avoid simply regurgitating an encyclopedia of facts about SQL, an approach that is all too common in introductory books and courses on programming. Instead, I carefully curated certain concepts and techniques that I have found to provide the most \"bang for your buck\" over my decade of experience as a data professional.\nThis enabled me to condense a complete course on SQL into just 36 instructional videos, averaging less than 10 minutes in length. So if you can commit to a video a day, in just over one month you’ll have added an extremely valuable and lucrative skill to your arsenal (and just as importantly, your resume!).\nAnd to make sure all that knowledge sticks, I’ve included exercises...LOTS of exercises. Unlike most courses, which only feature sporadic opportunities to practice what you’ve learned, this course has practice problems after almost every video - so you can reinforce concepts right away.\nTake it from someone who has built their career almost entirely on self-taught technical skills: it’s worth the effort. Several recent surveys have shown that SQL is actually the MOST in-demand tech skill sought after by recruiters!\nIn short, learning SQL can change your life, if you put in the work Let me be your guide to this next step in your career - I think you’ll find the journey a lot less daunting, and maybe even a little more fun, than you would have ever expected.",

Combined with its speed, performance, and integration capabilities, Teradata is the number one rated Data Warehousing product in 2020 by Gartner. Most of the biggest companies in the world use Teradata, including all 17 top communication companies.\nIn this course you learn SQL using Teradata, which is an ANSI-compliant vendor of SQL is a future-focused way of learning SQL. The Teradata SQL skill set is easily transferable to other SQL platforms such as Amazon Redshift, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and others.\n\n\nThis course can help you if you relate with any of these descriptions:\n\n\n1. Are you totally new to SQL?\nLearning Teradata SQL is a great way to learn SQL, especially to distinguish you from the big pack of SQL developers. In my experience in interviewing many SQL candidates and in working with many interviewers, a candidate who knows Teradata SQL shines like a diamond!\nA candidate who knows Teradata SQL, most likely has worked with huge datasets which is already a big plus! It indicates that the candidate has gone beyond the bare minimum SQL. So join this course to upgrade your resume, and stand above the crowd!\n\n\n2. Do you have a background in other SQL platforms (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.) and you need to learn Teradata SQL?\nThis is how I started to learn Teradata myself. Teradata is one of the best relational databases and data warehouses on the planet, but the lack of reliable instructions and tutorials on the internet may drive you crazy!\nThis course is the most complete course on Teradata SQL on the internet! It gives you an overview of the main products of Teradata in data warehousing. Then it focuses on the Teradata Database, the core of the data warehouse. That’s where the core of our course also begins by installing our relational database, and starting to talk to it by its language, Teradata SQL.\n\n\n3. If your role is\n- A Business User or Analyst in finance, marketing, healthcare (you name it) and you don’t feel confident using the data you get yourself.\n- A Data Scientist and your pet peeve is data cleansing! Before everything is ready for your cutting-edge ML knockout blow, you need that solid communication with your data warehouse.\n- A Data or BI Analyst, and your fluency in SQL is key in providing reliable meaningful results.\n- A SQL Developer, Data Engineer, or Data Architect and you need to interact with your databases more easily so that you can focus on other core parts of your role in development and design.\n\n\nI have created this course with your role in mind! I have put my experience with relational databases in these roles for over 10 years, so that you can get good at what constitutes over 80% of the practical SQL needed in the roles above.\nTeradata is the number one solution in Data Warehousing, and Data Warehousing is what enabled this booming era of data; be it in Data Science, Business Intelligence, or even in the growth and practicality of the internet.\n\n\nIn this journey, we will:\n\n\no Overview the main data warehousing products of Teradata\no Install a fully functional database and Teradata Studio to write SQL with\no Have a crash course on Teradata Studio to use it easily and benefit from its advance features\no Learn SQL statement categories of DCL, DDL, and DML\no Create different types of tables and database objects\no Learn data types, logical expressions, joins, aggregation, SET operators, string functions, and many more topics\no Learn by creating a chess database with data about players, chess tournaments and games, and more.\n\n\nFeel free to check out the free preview videos.\n\n\nIf you are ready for this journey together, I will see you inside in the course!",

Over the years author recognized certain patterns and practices that led to successful API initiatives. Intrigued by his findings author did thorough research of 100's other successful API providers (examples: Facebook, Expedia, Capital One ...) and that resulted in a collection of Best practices and Design patterns that are covered in this course.\nThis course covers all the important aspects related to design, development and management of API. The best practices, design patterns, challenges, suggestions & options discussed in this course are either:\nCreated by analyzing how the popular API providers such as Facebook, Twitter, Capital One etc are building and managing their API\nTaken from personal experiences of the author\n\n\nCourse is divided into 6 Parts:\n1. Setting the stage - Discusses a case study (ACME travels) used through the course + provides information on tools used\n2. Evolution of  REST API - Lectures in this section will cover the foundational concepts + Why REST/JSON has become a defacto standard\n3. Designing the REST API (Covered in multiple sections)\nThis is where students will learn the:\nBest Practices\nImplementation patterns\nTo demonstrate the implementation aspects, a set of NodeJS based API is also implemented for a fictitious enterprise ACME Travels.\n4. Securing the REST API\nWhen an API is exposed by an enterprise to the public internet, it poses a risk to the enterprise as hackers may use the vulnerabilities in the API to launch attacks against the enterprise. There are multiple types of such Functional attacks that the API provider must consider. You will learn about the common attacks and the best practices for protecting the API.\n5. Swagger 2.0 / Open API Initiative specifications\n\nThis section will begin with the description of Collaborative specifications development process & benefits of adopting contract first approach. At the end of this section student will be able to write Swagger/OAI specifications for their own API. As part of the lectures, a complete specification will be created for ACME Vacations.\n6. API Management\n\nAPI management  is the process of publishing, documenting and overseeing application programming interfaces (APIs) in a secure, scalable environment. Lectures in this section cover the details of the following activities that an API provider carry out within the scope of API management.\nAPIgee, IBM API Connect & Mulesoft platforms will be used for demonstrating the various API management aspects discussed in the lectures. Students are encouraged to try out these platforms on their own to get a good feel of what API management platforms bring to table. The three platforms offer a free trial version that can be used for testing.\n\n\nWHY REST API?\nToday Enterprises are using REST APIs for not just building mobile applications but also for:\nCreating new channels for partnership\nBuilding new revenue streams & business models\nPromoting their brands\nJust creating the API does not guarantee that the enterprise will be able to achieve the desired goals from API perspective. Adoption of API by developers depend on multiple aspects such as its utility, ease of use, performance, scalability, security. The API provider must apply best practices throughout the life cycle of an API.\n\n\nWho should take this course?\nThis course is suited for any technologist interested in learning REST API from end to end perspective not just from the coding perspective. Though this course uses NodeJS for demonstrating the design best practices, it does not require students to have any prior experience wth NodeJS.\nTo take this course the student is expected to know any one (or more) programming language; have understanding of web application architecture; to be familiar with the concept of services ; understands the data formats such as JSON or XML\nPlease note that this course will NOT teach how to code REST API in NodeJS.",

      "description": "Do you want to visualize your workflows and business processes to simplify the requirements discovery process? Or maybe you want a more efficient workflow, but you don’t know where to start? This course is for you!\nLearn how to:\nCreate Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and Context Diagrams from your current process workflows\nVisualize business needs, analyze business problems, discover timing anomalies, and optimize exception/error handling\nCreate a holistic picture of requirements, user stories, features, etc. that increases the buy-in of all stakeholders\n----------\nUse Data Flow Diagrams to Visualize Workflows\nGetting from someone's explanations of how they do their job to usable and accurate workflow descriptions can be a daunting proposition. Understanding current workflows, however, is critical to defining a future digital solution. Just as critical is understanding how data is created and consumed throughout the workflow.\nTo truly understand problems inherent in a business process or workflow, you need to help the domain experts, business analysts, and developers visualize what they do. Data Flow Diagrams are phenomenal tools for visualization.\nWorking with business experts, you can help them discover problems and inefficiencies they don’t even know they have. These are not people problems; they are process problems. Understanding when and how to create and use Data Flow Diagrams will help you discover and capture the requirements for improving the use of information technology.\nCombined with workflow analysis techniques, DFDs optimize your workflows and reveal Requirements, User Stories, Features, Scenarios, or whatever mode you use to describe desired business outcomes of software.\n----------\nWho Needs DFDs Today?\nData Flow Diagrams (also written Dataflow Diagrams) are a method for depicting the sources, transportation, transformation, storage, and consumption of data in a business process. These are not just tools for data analysts and software developers.\nIn our extensive experience, DFDs are tools of visual communication among domain experts (aka Subject Matter Experts or SMEs) and the Information Technology (IT) group. Having used them in hundreds of requirements discovery and user story workshops over the years, we have yet to find a better tool for encouraging productive discussions about workflows and how individual departments interact.\nIn addition, many organizations are undergoing digital transformation that relies on Big Data. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning depend also on reliable, accurate, and accessible data. Since bad data leads to bad outcomes, the ideal time to ensure the requisite level of quality is when the data is created. A Data Flow Diagram is an optimal tool for analyzing and improving data quality at the time of creation.\n----------\nWhy Should You Buy This Course?\nThis course includes the most complete, in-depth Data Flow Diagram tutorial that helps you remove workflow process problems and clarify complex requirements.\nFully updated with tons of new content.\nIncludes Student Handout in .pdf format for notetaking\n\"Intellimated\" video lectures use visual representations to simplify complex concepts and associations.\nQuizzes and assignments give you an opportunity to test your understanding of the presented material, reinforce learning, and increase retention.\nHelp from the authors to clarify open questions and provide additional information.\nLifetime access to the course including future updates.\n30-day Moneyback guarantee backed by Udemy if you are not completely satisfied with the learning experience.\nYou will gain confidence in your ability to leverage the power of User Stories to minimize miscommunication that plagues IT initiatives.\n----------\nAbout the Course\nYou will learn the benefits of process visualization for the business community, for the one wearing the Business Analysis or Product Owner hat, for those tasked with developing the solution, and ultimately for the entire organization.\nYou will also discover that DFDs are powerful tools for recognizing and solving some major problems that haunt IT projects, such as scope creep, project overruns, and missing or misunderstood requirements.\n“Business Analysis: Data Flow Diagrams to Visualize Workflows – Simply Put!” uses a concrete business scenario to present a simple, easy-to-learn approach using interviews with domain experts to create and analyze Data Flow Diagrams depicting workflow and data manipulation.\nYou will learn step-by-step how to create a Context-Level Data Flow Diagram and explode relevant process(es) to reveal the nitty-gritty detail (i.e., individual process and data specifications) that developers need to create IT solutions that the business community needs.\nThe course also covers how to do workflow analysis using a DFD that delivers Requirements, User Stories, Features, Scenarios, or whatever mode you use to describe desired business outcomes of software products.\nThe course answers the following questions:\nWhat is a Data Flow Diagram (DFD)?\nWhat is a Rigorous Physical Process Model?\nWhat is a Context-Level DFD?\nWhy should I use Data Flow Diagrams?\nWhat symbols can I use on each type of diagram?\nHow can I drill down into a process?\nHow can I show internal processes and flows that produce the results?\nWhat does balancing a Data Flow Diagram mean and what is the business value?\nWhat is the most efficient approach to balancing a DFD?\nWhat business value do process specifications offer?\nHow can I express detailed specifications for processes and data?\nWhat is “metadata\" and why do you need it?\nWhat does a fully balanced DFD look like?\nWhat value does a DFD fragment provide?\nHow can I visualize what’s wrong with my current workflows?\nHow does a DFD help me get requirements or user stories?\nRegardless of your job title or role, if you are tasked with identifying business process improvements or functional requirements, this course is for you.\n----------\nAbout the Instructor\nTeaches 18 Udemy courses for Agile Business Analysis with over 65,000 students enrolled.\nChampions lean and agile methods to meet communication challenges between business and IT communities.\nExtensive YouTube Channel with 121 videos for 18K subscribers and 1.7M views.\nAuthored 11 Business Analysis books covering tools and techniques for Agile and traditional software requirements.\nConsultant to a multitude of Fortune 500 companies and governmental agencies.\nFacilitated 100’s of User Story and Requirements Gathering Workshops for multi-million-dollar projects.\n25+ years’ experience with instructor-led training for tens of thousands of students around the world.\n· Coach and mentor for aspiring business analysts.\nIntrigued but not convinced?

I’m excited to offer these foundational insights that are hard to find elsewhere.\nHowever, there is more to be updated, especially on RAP and CAPM, but these are the building blocks. I provide in-depth explanations for every topic covered; my approach is like digging for gold—you’ll gain the knowledge needed to keep creating projects after the course. I never withhold information; even the smallest, critical details are shared.\n\n\nALL THE BEST\n***\n\n\nAnother Latest Update-\nCourse is being updated with CAPM - Cloud Application Programming Model also called SAP BTP CAPM Node.js stack\nAs of now only at Indtroduction stage, will be updating it gradually\n\n\nLatest Update-\nCourse is being updated with FIORI Elements and SAP ABAP RAP/ABAP Cloud.\n\n\nABAP Cloud concept is Spoon fed to any new comer- no need of any pre-requisites to learn ABAP cloud- all basics are very well explained, to include all the concepts of course it will take time, but this is the only course as of Jan 2024 to cover ABAP Cloud or ABAP RAP as a topic in Udemy(First course in entire Udemy to starting updating with ABAP RAP or ABAP Cloud as of Jan 2024).\n\n\nApp development using VSCode, BAS, WEBIDE.\n\n\nI can go up to an extent of saying that this course is for below enthusiasts:-\n1) if you complete this course and are thorough with the concepts presented, you can easily clear questions from the SAPUI5 technical interview.\n2)For anyone who is looking for an opportunity to get a job in SAPUI5\n3)For anyone who wants a complete custom SAPUI5 application development course, where they do not want to depend on any other resource/colleague for completing their objects, apart from SAPUI5 standard documentation\n4)For anyone who does not want to spend their hard-earned money for learning bits and pieces of SAPUI5 custom development here and there, this is the course for you- YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LEARN ANYWHERE ELSE. Everything is included here( if not included you can build applications referring to SAPUI5 standard documentation based on the knowledge you acquire in this course)\n5)Complete debugging of Chrome is covered concerning SAPUI5 ( also called UI5 / FIORI )\n\n\nThere is so much passion that went into this course creation.\nPassion to share the knowledge, not withholding any details for you to master the art of programming.\nI know many who give training who just teach you ABCD's of what is needed to understand what is SAPUI5, but this course is unlike anything you have seen before. I bet you can develop applications like a professional, provided, you completely digest the concepts presented.\nsuppose you are a dreamer, dreaming of getting a good job in a Top MNC, or a freelance programmer who is aiming for a good contract for building SAPUI5/ FIORI applications. In that case, this course promises you the technical foundation needed for you to build applications independently.\n\n\nAlmost 40+ Applications which are explained in this course with help of examples for a clear understanding of concepts are available for download.\nDownload Applications from resources, of course, ->Upload them into WEB IDE as  Projects-Watch Videos in Udemy, and observe the project Uploaded in WEB IDE for clear understanding. Simple!!\nFree System Set Up for learning from this course, no need to shell out an extra amount for remote access to the server\nA to Z of what is required to learn is set up in a particular sequence\nTopics that are covered in this course concerning SAPUI5 technology are covered in-depth, also with the help of debugging in internet developer tools to make you better understand what is happening inside the framework, under the hood. So that when you work in real-time, when you encounter any dumps or when you do not remember methods to be used in application programming, you can find these methods using chrome developer tools and use those methods in code- without the strain of memorizing them.\nAlso, another way of finding methods/functions is going to standard sapui5 SDK. we have given the references of standard SDK throughout the course so that you will be self-sufficient - the foundations of SAPUI5 are well laid, and you do not depend on anyone else to help you when you are stuck.\n\n\nBasics to Learn SAPUI5 Application development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are only covered to the extent students need to follow this course.\nif you need to master SAPUI5, you need to master JavaScript as well. Please refer to any JavaScript course for in-depth details of JavaScript. Contents of this course are only relevant to SAPUI5 but at the same time have given basic details of JavaScript wherever required.\n\n\nPlease turn on subtitles\nPlay videos with 1.25X speed, based on your convenience\n\n\nTo help better understand standard SAP Recommended coding practices for SAPUI5.\n\n\nAll the basics of SAPUI5, all theoretical concepts are very well covered and incorporated into our examples\nDebugging to minute level and finding methods/functions to be used in source code.\nGoogle Chrome developer toolkit is shown in almost every example - making sure that students understand how to work in real-time when he/she encounters errors and also to find out functions on their own without needing any external help\nStandard SAPUI5 SDK references are given wherever required so that you will be self-sufficient to not depend on anyone else to resolve your programming issues.\n\n\n*Disclaimer*\n\n\nSAP and other SAP products and services mentioned herein as well as their respective logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of SAP SE (or an SAP affiliate company) in Germany and other countries.

From User's perspective they do not need to login for each application. Login once and access all applications under that organization. That's why it is called as Single Sign On (SSO).\nIn this course you will learn Single Sign On (SSO) with Keycloak with Spring Boot & Spring Security. Also you will learn Role based Authorization with Keycloak.\nNow a days Spring framework is widely used among Java Developers and specifically Spring Boot is in high demand. So this course covers SSO with Spring Boot and Spring Security.\nFirst you we will get started with basics of Authentication & Authorization. After that will jump to Keycloak.\nTo work with Keycloak you need to have basic knowledge of Spring Security & Thymeleaf. If you do not have that then do not worry because I am covering basics of Spring Security & Thymeleaf in this course.\nKeycloak provides adapter that we can integrate with Spring Security in our Spring Boot application. That's what we are going to use in this course. We will be having two Spring Boot apps with which we will implement Single Sign On (SSO).\nKeycloak can be configured with several SQL databases and in this course we will use MySQL to be used with Keycloak.\n\n\nCourse Topics & Lectures :-\n• Basics of Authentication & Authorization\nWhat is Authentication & Authorization ?\nWhat is Single Sign On (SSO) ?\nIntroduction To Keycloak\nKeycloak Installation\n\n\n• Basics of Spring Security & Thymeleaf\nIntroduction to Spring Security & Thymeleaf\nSetting Up Spring Boot App\nSpring Data JPA with MySQL\nLogin Page with Spring Security\nSpring Security Configuration\nUsage of UserDetailsService\nPassword Encoder with Spring Security\nUser Home Page with Thymeleaf\nSpring Security In Action\nAuthorization with Spring Security\nAccess Denied Page with Spring Security\nLogout with Spring Security\n• Getting Started with Keycloak\nWhy Keycloak ?

As the same setup, we are going to shifting to the cloud for deploying AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services) with using ACR (Azure Container Registry).\nAlso we will cover additional topics that;\nDocker compose microservices\nKubernetes components (pods, deployments, services ..)\nZero-downtime deployments\nUsing Azure resources like ACR (Azure Container Registry), AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services)\nAutomate whole deployment process with writing custom pipelines with Azure DevOps and so on..\nIn the course, we will have 3 microservices which we are going to develop and deploy together.\nMicroservices 1 - Shopping MVC Client Application\nFirst of all, we are going to develop Shopping MVC Client Application For Consuming API Resource which will be the Shopping.Client Asp.Net MVC Web Project. But we will start with developing this project as a standalone Web application which includes own data inside it.\nAnd we will add container support with Dockerfile, push docker images to Docker Hub and see the deployment options like \"Azure Web App for Container\" resources for one web application.\nMicroservices 2 - Shopping API Application\nAfter that we are going to develop Shopping.API Microservice with MongoDB and Compose All Docker Containers. This API project will have Products data and performs CRUD operations with exposing API methods for consuming from Shopping Client project. We will containerize API application with creating Dockerfile and push images to Azure Container Registry (ACR).\nMicroservices 3 - Mongo Db Database\nOur API project will manage product records stored in a No-SQL MongoDB database as described in the picture. We will pull MongoDB docker image from docker hub and create connection with our API project.\nAt the end of the section, we will have 3 microservices which's are Shopping.Client - Shopping.API - MongoDb microservices.\nAs you can see that, we have;\nCreated docker images,\nCompose docker containers and tested them,\nDeploy these docker container images on local Kubernetes clusters,\nPush our image to Azure Container Registry (ACR),\nShifting deployment to the cloud Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS),\nUpdate microservices with zero-downtime deployments.\nAnd the last step, we are focusing on automation deployments with creating CI/CD pipelines on Azure DevOps tool. We will develop separate microservices deployment pipeline yamls with using Azure Pipelines.\nWhen we push code to GitHub,\nMicroservices Azure Pipeline triggers,\nBuild docker images and push the Azure Container Registry (ACR),\nDeploy to Azure Kubernetes services with zero-downtime deployments.\nIn the last section, we will give assignment for deploying multi-container microservices applications with automating CI/CD pipelines.\nBy the end of this course, you'll learn how to deploy your multi-container microservices applications with automating all deployment process separately.\nThis course will have good theoretical information but also will be 90% of hands-on development activities. All microservices and deployment steps will developed step by step and together.",

You'll leave with the confidence to lead any project, turning business vision into real-world success, and ensuring that your user stories and acceptance criteria drive meaningful, high-quality results.\n\n\nStill Not Convinced? Need more course details?\nYou will learn how to determine the best structure for your User Stories based on the needs of all audiences while ensuring delivery of business value to the author of each User Story.\nYou will understand the core components of a well-structured User Story and defend the purpose of each. In addition, I explain why defining business needs in User Story format is a significant factor in achieving effective communication between the business user community and developers.\nTo ensure that business community needs and wants are met, I will present techniques for capturing User Stories from the right mix of end users and other stakeholders. You can only get a reasonably complete set of User Stories by identifying Roles, Personas, and Stakeholders that your digital solution must support.\nUser Role Modeling, Stakeholder Identification, and Persona Development are three approaches that I have found most helpful in different situations. The role gives developers the power to clarify the intent behind the User Story which greatly increases the chances that the business community gets the solution it needs.\nHow to write a User Story is a simple, easy-to-learn skill. I will introduce and explain several ideas on how to make sure your User Stories are GREAT. Following the INVEST model will help make your User Stories Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable.\nThose six criteria help you avoid a lot of problems, but each criterion can be challenging to achieve. For that reason, I introduce 3 methods that you can use to implement the INVEST model and add significant value to your User Stories.\nAs powerful as User Stories are, they are still susceptible to misunderstanding. You will learn 6 specific methods for identifying and removing the twin causes of miscommunication, namely ambiguity and subjectivity. In line with the Lean principle of waste reduction, you should wait until the last responsible moment to ensure that your User Stories are clear, concise, relevant, and at the right level of detail for developers.\nThe most important tool to reduce misunderstandings and avoid any ambiguity are Acceptance Criteria, aka Conditions of Satisfaction. They provide details of functionality that help the developers understand the User Story the way the originator intended.\nYou will learn how to use simple checklists, Business Rules, conditional statements, Functional Features, and Given-When-Then Statements to express Acceptance Criteria. These form the basis for the essential step of Acceptance Testing which is covered later in the course.\nLean and Agile do not change the need for sound analysis and decision making. What they change is the timing of those activities. You will learn what to do and when to do it given that the User Stories live and evolve throughout the process of delivering software that wows its users. You defend the need for Product Backlogs, Feasibility Analysis, and User Story Prioritization to ensure the evolution of the product delivers business value at every step of the way.\nWhat the business community considers a simple request can be unbelievably complex for developers.

You probably have applications built with Qt running on your computer, smart phone, television, and other electronics.\nNo experience necessary, this is a beginners course that will teach you the foundations of both Qt 6 and C++. This course is meant as a direct replacement for an introduction to C++ class. This course starts off with simple topics such as \"what is a variable\" and ends with some basic Qt classes and how to work with them. The main focus of this course is to get the student a solid foundation to move forward from. At the end of this course you will be able to create basic applications using C++ and Qt 6. This course is a complete re-record of my award winning Qt 5 for beginners course, covering new material along with using CMAKE instead of QMAKE.\n\nWe will start with basic foundational concepts such as variables and each section moves into more complex topics such as templates, classes, error handling and how to use some of the Qt 6 classes includes in the core library. This course uses C++ and Qt Creator which is the best IDE for developing cross platform applications using Qt that can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, embedded devices such as a raspberry pi, iPhone and Android.\n\n\nThis is the starting point for all other Qt 6 courses on that are coming soon to Udemy as I re-record them with the newest technology.\nQt 6 Core Intermediate\nQt 6 Core Advanced\nQt 6 Widgets\nQt 6 QML\nQt 6 Design Patterns\n\n\n\nFeaturing closed caption in: English, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, Traditional Chinese",

This course has been taught with implementing a data engineering solution using Azure Databricks and Spark core for a real world project of analysing and reporting on Formula1 motor racing data.\nThis is like no other course in Udemy for Azure Databricks. Once you have completed the course including all the assignments, I strongly believe that you will be in a position to start a real world data engineering project on your own and also proficient on Azure Databricks. I have also included lessons on Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Data Factory as well as PowerBI. The primary focus of the course is Azure Databricks and Spark core, but it also covers the relevant concepts and connectivity to the other technologies mentioned. Please note that the course doesn't cover other aspects of Spark such as Spark streaming and Spark ML. Also the course has been taught using PySpark as well as Spark SQL; It doesn't cover Scala or Java.\nThe course follows a logical progression of a real world project implementation with technical concepts being explained and the Databricks notebooks being built at the same time. Even though this course is not specifically designed to teach you the skills required for passing the Azure Data Engineer Associate Certification Exam DP203, it can greatly help you get most of the necessary skills required for the exam. Similarly, the course teaches the skills required to pass the Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate Certification.\nI value your time as much as I do mine. So, I have designed this course to be fast-paced and to the point. Also, the course has been taught with simple English and no jargons.

The configuration to business process approach is maintained throughout the course.\nThe next goal is to provide comprehensive coverage to the PP workflow tools available. Further, there are significant “hidden” or lesser-used functionalities in PP that you can integrate even when (and long after) your SAP system implementation is complete. These tools are covered to bring greater optimization to your business processes.\nThe course offers real-life examples and other modeling hints and tips to help you decide which option best meets the business needs of the company. Screens using SAP S/4HANA are used extensively and are duly supported by in-depth coverage of concepts and terminologies. The menu paths or transaction codes are given to perform each step.\nThis course takes a deep-dive approach to deliver in-depth and comprehensive coverage of basics of S/4 HANA, user interface (fiori), master data, demand management, MRP, discrete manufacturing, process manufacturing in SAP. It begins by covering the enterprise structure that you need to set up in PP, which also reflects the interdependencies of the enterprise structures of other areas.",

By the end of this course, you'll feel confident applying for jobs and doing well in interviews. If you're already working in IT, this course will help you build a strong foundation to move ahead in your career. These basics will make the tasks you do every day much clearer and help you become the technician that everyone looks up to.\nWhy Choose This Course\nThere are lots of courses on sites like Udemy and others that focus on specific technologies and their certifications. While those courses are good and go into depth, they might not be what you need when you're just starting out. At the beginning, you just need to grasp the basics. You can dive into the details and certifications once you've gained some experience. Unfortunately, most courses and books don't follow this approach for teaching IT. This is one reason why people sometimes find IT difficult. All they see are courses and topics piled on top of each other, trying to explain everything in too much detail. In reality, learning and mastering IT can be easy – and I'll show you how.",

      "description": "PS:\nPlease do NOT join the course if you are not comfortable with coding\nThis course starts from the Basics so if you are an expert you may already know first few sections. Do take a preview before joining.\nThis course will NOT teach you Javascript or any Javascript framework.\nPlease read the Pre-Requisites before signing up\nFocus of the course is Ethereum hence it was decided to use HTML DOM JS API instead of Angular/JQuery & other JS libraries.\n\n\nWhat students should know (Pre-requisites) ?\nTo build Ethereum Decentralized applications you will need to learn a couple of skills. This course can help you learn all of those skills but there are some prerequisites for the course:\nExperience with either Javascript or Java. Course will NOT teach Javascript\nBasic understanding of the Javascript/HTML DOM model\nAccess to a PC or MAC with access to the Internet (Minimum 4GB needed 6 GB preferred)\nComfortable with new software installation & hands on coding\nCourse Approach?\nThis course takes the approach of “Learn by doing”. Students are encouraged to try out all aspects of the technologies on their own after each lecture. Almost all of the concepts discussed in the lectures are shown in action by way code samples etc. The demo code used in the lectures is available for download from GitHub so that students can change the code to try out new things.\nFront end of the Decentralized applications are typically created as single page or desktop applications using Javascript/HTML/CSS. Since there are multiple Javascript frameworks, it was decided to keep the lectures independent of any specific JS framework. Students are free to use any one or more JS frameworks of their choice.\nMultiple quizzes in each section will validate student’s knowledge. Coding exercises will help them understand the concepts better & gain confidence.\nStudents will download the source code for a fully built DAPP - this DAPP shows/teaches all of the web3 API that students need to learn. Code walk through is covered in the lectures.\nCourse is divided into 10 sections:\nSection#1\nIntroduces the Blockchain & Ethereum technology\n\nSection#2\nDrills deeper into the Ethereum Blockchain technology\nConcepts, Wallet\nHands-on:  Install Wallet, Mining for Ethers, Transactions\nSection#3\nEthereum Client\nHands-on: Install Geth, Try out the geth commands & options\nSection#4 Geth Javascript Management API\nHands-on: Try out the various API i console and by writing scripts\nSection#5\nWeb3 API\nHands-on: Develop Javascript/HTML front end for executing contracts on TestNet\nSection#6\nGetting ready for Smart Contract development\nLearn about the various tools & frameworks used for developing smart contract\nHands-on: Installation : Visual Studio, Truffle framework version 4.0, Ganache, Meta-Mask\nSection#7\nSolidity for smart contracts development\nLearn the concepts of Solidity language\nHands-on: Code simple contracts in Solidity + write test cases for testing\nSection#8\nSolidity &Infrastructure patterns\nHands-on: Code smart contracts\nEnd to end application walkthrough\nHands-on: DIY Project & Solution\nSection#9\nCovers the setting up of private networks\nTools for managing private networks\nSection#10\nAll about Initial Coin Offering & ERC20 Standard for creating and launching a coin\nStudents will learn how to create a coin and manage it in common tools\n\n\nBackground\nDemand for Blockchain technologists is going up as multiple enterprises (& startups) are looking to achieve efficiencies or/and create new business models enabled by the Blockchain technologies. Ethereum is the leading Blockchain platform and is accepted as the most mature platform for Blockchain applications. Ethereum technology is quite complex but the approach taken in this course \"Learn by doing\" will accelerate the learning process and make it easy for the students to understand the concepts. Please refer to \"Introduction to Ethereum\" below for a high level overview of Ethereum.\nWhy learn Blockchain/Ethereum?\nIf we are to believe the pundits, Blockchain will change the way software is built for business transactions. Almost all industries are looking to leverage this new technology to gain efficiencies and/or to create new business models & opportunities. Organizations are looking for talent in this new technology and facing difficulty in finding developers/architects who can design and develop Blockchain applications.\nTaking this course will prepare you to innovate using this cutting edge technology that promises to change the world around us. It will prepare you for the future.\nIntroduction to Ethereum\n\nThe digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin was the first Blockchain application. Success of Bitcoin led to the creation of the Ethereum platform. Whereas Bitcoin is a “Blockchain Application”, Ethereum is a “Blockchain Platform”. Ethereum not only supports a distributed ledger but it also supports Smart Contracts.\nSmart Contracts are computer programs that has the code that implements contractual agreements (rules) between two or more parties. The rules coded in the smart contract are triggered by events in the physical world and automatically carry out some predefined action(s). All of this happens without any intermediary, web servers or back end databases.\nLet me give you an example - Ebay is the intermediary between the buyer and seller. EBay makes $ every time a buyer buys an item from the seller. In a decentralized bidding application a smart contract can replace EBay the intermediary. The rule coded in the contract will be that when buyer will pay, the seller will ship the item to the buyer. The funds will be held in the smart contract till buyer confirms the receiving of the goods. Once the buyer confirms the receipt of goods the funds will be released to the seller. Smart Contracts are executed on the Ethereum network nodes as opposed to a centralized server infrastructure owned by an intermediary (e.g., Ebay). Nodes are Ethereum client processes running on the network participant’s computer.\nAnyone can write Ethereum decentralized application, so in other words you can create your own Bitcoin like Cryptocurrency or Ebay like application on a public Ethereum network. Please note that all applications are not a good candidate for Blockchain technology for example building a static website on Blockchain technology is not the right use of the technology.",

      "description": "*** UPDATED APRIL 2025 *** This Power Automate course has been significantly updated in 2025 to incorporate latest and greatest features and improvements to the platform. The older content is not available but can be provided if you message me. ***\n\n\n*** NEW *** This course also includes Power Automate's AI Hub, which integrates Gen AI into your workflows - check it out in the Intermediate section.\n\n\nGood news, everyone! Our Power Automate course has received a significant update in 2025 to incorporate the latest features and improvements of the platform, designed to aid and enhance the knowledge you gained in the previous course.\nWe will start with the fundamentals, including setting up flows, using expressions, and adding conditions. From there, we'll move on to advanced topics such as approvals, AI-powered automation with Copilot, and seamless integrations with Excel, SharePoint, and Power Apps. The updates are made to provide you with the most current tools and techniques to excel in your automation projects.\nMoreover, we’ve incorporated real-world exercises to equip you with practical skills. With these enhancements, we believe you will find our Power Automate course more valuable and enriching.\n-\nNote: Power Automate was previously called Microsoft Flow\n\n\nHave you ever wanted to automate a repetitive task? Are you an automation enthusiast? Do you want your business to be more efficient? If so, then welcome to Power Automate\n\n\nLearn from more than 22 hours of relevant instructional video content, with many resources and further reading at your disposal!\n\n\nAutomate any tasks! Build automated workflows with no code. Power Automate is a development environment created by Microsoft to quickly create flows, which can automate any repetitive task that you have (both personal and for work). Power Automate is built for people who want to automate their tasks so that they can be more efficient.\n\n\nAny task or business process can be automated. It can be something simple like \"Get the most recent document from this website and email it to all my users every morning\" or something more complex like \"Retweet all tweets that mention my brand in a positive way\".\n\n\nPower Automate is quickly growing in demand and is currently the highest adopted automation system in medium-to-large companies (along with PowerApps) and one of the most sought after Microsoft skills, both personally and for business. People have leveraged Power Automate to free up several hours in their work day, so that they can focus on more important things. In fact, Forrester has reported that Power Automate makes businesses on average 15% more efficient. In Microsoft's words, Power Automate empowers everyone, from end users to technology experts.\n\n\nPower Automate also contains both attended and unattended Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capabilities. You can start implementing RPA in your workflow with Power Automate. In fact, Power Automate was labelled as an RPA Visionary by Gartner in July 2020, and RPA continues to become more popular.\n\n\nThis is the only complete guide to Microsoft Power Automate, from basic to advanced. This course is not only comprehensive (it covers everything you need to know right from the start / beginner level) but is also instructional in nature, meaning that as we learn new concepts, we are also integrating them in the application with examples. Don't just learn concepts, learn how to actually apply them. That also means that whether you are a beginner or expert, there's something for you in this course.\n\n\nThis course is structured in a way that helps you learn all the concepts. For each concept, we first cover it in theory and then apply it using a real life example. We also progressively learn more and more advanced concepts, so that you never feel overwhelmed and can achieve your goals. I also respond to questions, and have an interactive portion in the course!\n\n\nAgain, this is the complete guide to Power Automate - you won't ever need another course. We will also update the course if there is a newer version or if newer features get released!\n\n\nWhat is Power Automate?\nPower Automate is a tool that allows you to build and execute flows, which can automate and streamline any repetitive tasks. It has the ability to connect to wide variety of applications (twitter, slack, outlook, drive, file system, third party via API) and can also contain complex logic like conditions or loops. It is also frequently used to develop Robotic Process Automation (RPA) within businesses. Almost any repetitive task can be replaced by Power Automate.\n\n\nWhat are the main features of Power Automate?\nMicrosoft ecosystem - Power Automate is similar to other familiar Microsoft applications, like Word or Excel. It has the same ribbon structure and similar design, which makes it easy to learn and transfer knowledge. Power Automate is Microsoft's way to build and execute flows, similar to how PowerPoint is Microsoft's way to build presentations.\nEasy to use - No coding necessary or even required. Similar to other Microsoft applications, it's a drag-and-drop system which makes thing easy, and has an amazing user-friendly interface to create flow diagrams.\nConnect to anything - Power Automate has hundreds of pre-built connectors, allowing your flows to interact with several applications at once (like Outlook, Slack, Text, Trello, Filesystem, Drive, SQL). It also allows you to connect to any third-party application via API, and allows to interact with both Desktop and Web user interface.\nCreate any logic - Power Automate can make both simple (trigger and action) and complex (trigger, condition, loop, approval, action, etc.). It also has an approval feature, allowing you to get approval from someone before your flow can continue. This is useful for automating business processes.\nCustomize to your heart's desire - Power Automate allows you to build your flow your way. This means that you can build the flow in your vision - your imagination is your only limitation!\nPowerful scaling - Flows have a powerful monitoring feature, allowing you to see how flows have performed for all your users. Flows can also be shared among colleagues with ease, and can scale up as your business or personal needs grow.\n\n\nWhy Learn Power Automate?\nBoost your productivity - Power Automate can automate any repetitive task, meaning that you can have more time in the day for what matters most.\nCreate impact fast in your business - Power Automate can replace many mundane business process tasks with the click of a few buttons, without any code. Do you have a process in your organization or with yourself that is currently that can be automated? Power Automate allows you to replace this with an automated flow.\nGet hired / increase your employability - Power Automate is one of the fastest growing tools in medium-to-large businesses, and is expected to be one of the top sought after Microsoft skill. Put this skill on your resume to boost your chances and pay rate. It is also a must-have for automation enthusiasts.\nImprove your toolkit - Add this to your list of Microsoft skills - this is very powerful in conjunction with other Microsoft products (PowerApps, Office, PowerBI, Azure, 365, etc.)\n\n\nWhy Choose This Course?\nComplete guide - this is the 100% start to finish, zero to hero, basic to advanced guide on Power Automate. There is no other course like it that teaches you everything from start to finish. It contains over 10 hours of instructional content!\nFully instructional - we not only go through important concepts, but also apply them as we are building our application so that we can solidify them. This is not only a walkthrough of the Power Automate features, but a course that actually builds flows with you\nStep by step - we go through every single concept in a sequential order (from beginner to advanced). This improves your probabilities of learning Power Automate rather than going haphazardly through each feature.\nLearn to learn - During the latter parts of the course, we go through situations where we encounter new features or errors, and work through how we would use the documentation to resolve them. In this way, you not only learn about Power Automate inside and out, but learn how to resolve your own issues as they come up\nTeacher response - I have a response time of <8 hours, so if there's anything else you would like to learn, or if there's something you cannot figure out, I'm here for you!\nGreat resources - Resources, and further reading can help you in your learning journey\n\n\nCourse and Module Overview\nIntroduction - learn about Power Automate, its features, how to learn through this course, and what a flow is\nEnvironment Setup - make a Power Automate account and set up your development environment\nBeginner: create your own flow from scratch and learn about triggers, actions, dynamic content, expressions, and more\nIntermediate: build more flows with complex controls, variables, loops, approvals and the AI Hub\nAdvanced: get expertise on data operations, HTTP requests, connectivity to Power Apps & Copilot Studio, advanced controls, and more\nConclusion: - earn your certificate\nIf you want to learn Microsoft Power Automate, this is the course for you. We're looking forward to having you in the course and hope you earn the certificate.",

Selenium is an industry standard for test automation, so Python's readability make the two a perfect match for writing valuable automated tests.\nBrowser automation is in high demand as software testing costs rise and the software industry explodes in size. Unfortunately, engineers interested in automation have little in the way of concrete guidance on how to be successful, or what properly written automation code even looks like.\nThe most widely circulated videos on these topics speak only to the technologies themselves, and do not offer viable implementation guidance or valuable industry practices. I have made these valuable practices the focus of this course.\nContent and Overview Suitable for those comfortable with basic Python and Object-Oriented Programming concepts, these lectures build a rock-solid foundation of skills required to automate at a professional level.\nBeginning with a step-by-step setup of the development environment using Virtual Environments (a must for aspiring Python developers) and Selenium setup, this course allows you to watch as I walk you through each step, explaining as we go.\nOnce the environment is ready we will discuss how web elements work, and how the best and fastest automation engineers (a rare breed!) identify them for automation. I will demonstrate each concept in real time as a conversation. That means you will spend almost NO time watching traditional lectures or slides, and almost all your time seeing the concepts in action or following along with me.\nStudents completing the course will have the knowledge to begin a career in entry-level browser automated testing, or to automate their browser for any number of useful purposes to include data-scraping and task automation.\nEquipped with code samples,code challenges, short quizzes, and info-rich videos, you’ll have no trouble following along with the concepts, and I am always available for questions.\nFinally, automating is a blast, and I wish more people did it. Let me rephrase that - I wish more people did it, and did it well! We need more people like you executing effective, high-value automation solutions, so let's get started on this journey together!",

I feel like I am completely competent in Gradle, andI have already converted 3 of my projects to use Gradle, and it is all working surprisingly well. Good job! -- Keith Swenson\n\nCourse is certainly very informative and the fundamentals are well explained with real world examples. Especially multi module gradle concepts and custom plugins adds, because they are very much useful for a IT developer. Lecturer voice is clear and intense. Thank you very much -- Sunil Kumar\nI was waiting for Bharath's course on Gradle and when it came out, I purchased it instantly.

This course is your gateway to writing clean, maintainable, and scalable software by mastering two of the most important pillars of software architecture: SOLID principles and design patterns.\nWe’ll start by diving deep into the SOLID principles — five core guidelines every professional developer should know. You’ll not only learn the theory behind each principle but also see how to implement them in Java through hands-on examples.\nNext, we’ll explore the world of design patterns, the time-tested solutions to common software design problems. You’ll learn how these patterns help you write flexible and reusable code — an essential skill as software systems become increasingly complex.\nSection 1 - SOLID Principles\nwhat are SOLID principles?\nsingle responsibility principle\nopen closed principle\nLiskov's substitution principle\ninterface segregation principle\ndependency inversion principle\nwhat is dependency injection?\nSection 3 - Creational Design Patterns\nwhat are creational design patterns?\nsingleton pattern\nfactory pattern\nabstract factory pattern\nbuilder pattern\nprototype pattern\nSection 2 - Behavioral Design Patterns\nwhat are behavioral design patterns?\nstrategy pattern\nobserver pattern\ncommand pattern\niterator pattern\ntemplate pattern and null object pattern\nvisitor pattern\nSection 3 - Structural Design Patterns\nwhat are structural design patterns?\ndecorator pattern\nflyweight pattern\nfacade pattern\nadapter pattern\ncomposite pattern\nbridge pattern\nSection 4 - API Design\nSOAP\nRPC\nREST\nSection 5 - Software Architectures\nmonolithic architecture\nlayered (n-tier) architecture\nservice oriented architecture (SOA)\nmicorservice architecture\nSection 6 - Data Storage Design\nrelational databases\nnon-relational databases\nscaling relational and non-relational databases\nreplication and sharding\nCAP theorem\nWhile the implementation will be in Java, the concepts are language-agnostic and valuable to any developer, regardless of your tech stack.\nThis is a practical course — I strongly encourage you to code along and re-implement the examples yourself. This is the best way to build a strong foundation and internalize the patterns and principles we’ll cover.\nWhether you're a junior developer looking to build solid habits or an experienced programmer aiming to sharpen your design skills, this course is for you.\nThanks for joining — now let’s dive in and level up your software design skills!",

One can use this to\nAutomate data calculation\nFetching data from 3rd party software like Trello, Salesforce etc (Not Covered in this Introduction Course)\nSending data to 3rd party\nConnecting various sheets , Documents and other tools\nSetting a trigger for an action, based on an event. For Example, send an Email, when form is filled\nThe best part of writing codes in Google Apps script is that you do not need to worry about hosting the code on a server and maintaining it. Google takes care of everything. You write the lines of codes and it is up and running. Above all, it is free.\nHere are some thoughts by students of this course:\n\"This has been of the best course I've taken in Udemy. One can begin to apply the new knowledge to real world almos instantly. I cant wait to take another Shahbaz course. Thanks!!!\"\n\"I really enjoyed this class -- I think for a beginner or even someone who has a little experience but needs to see more examples of how to use the Google Apps documentation, this is a great course. The pace of the course was also nice for beginners. You will not be an expert after you finish this course but you will have a good understanding of the fundamentals and you will be more comfortable using the Google documentation on your own. This course sets the learner up perfectly for a follow-up intermediate level course and it would be great to see this instructor add an intermediate level course to this one with more real world projects.

      "description": "This is the first in a series of courses for technical writers who want to learn how to write API documentation. This course teaches how to document structured data, focusing on the two most popular structured data formats: JSON and XML. If you are new to API documentation, this is a great place to start. No programming experience is required, but technical writers with programming experience who want to know more about structured data will still find it useful.\nWhat are APIs?\nAPIs (Application Program Interfaces) define how software systems talk to each other, and API documentation is a rapidly growing field. There is a strong need for writers who can understand APIs and explain them so that software developers can understand how to use them. API writers get to be in on the cutting edge of technology in high-paying positions.\nWhat is in This Course?\nBy the end of the course, you will understand what APIs are, why they are important, and how to read and document structured data. In this course you'll find:\nEight videos that:\nProvide background information on APIs and structured data\nBreak down sample JSON and XML files to show you how they work\nShow real-time, narrated writing of JSON and XML documentation\nFour hands-on exercises to lead you through building and documenting JSON and XML files\nTwo text-based lectures about useful software tools\nFive short quizzes to keep you on your toes\nPowerPoint presentations as a resource for every video lecture\nThe course takes approximately 2.5 hours to complete, depending on how fast you are with the exercises.",

This is the first course in a series of courses designed to help you attain the coveted Google Certified Data Engineer.\nAt this juncture the Google Certified Data Engineer is the only real world certification for data and machine learning engineers.\nThe Harvard Review dubbed the data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century.  It might be the greatest job in the world if you have a dedicated team of data engineers at your beckon call otherwise you’re first week of work is going to be a tough one.\nMost applied machine learning is supervised.  That simply means you use a data set to build your machine learning or deep learning models with.\nIn the real world data is messy, complicated and very difficult to work with. Another real world issues is working with data at scale. Very few companies have the compute or storage resources to work with large data sets. That's where the Google Cloud Platform comes in. The tools they've built for the cloud are the tools they are using internally.\nThis is the first course in a series of course dedicated to learning the Google Cloud Platform and attaining the Google Certified Data Engineer.\nThis course will lay the foundation for what you’ll need in order to become a data engineer and pass the exam. In the course we will cover all the basics of the platform and be prepared to move into the more advanced data engineering specific courses.\nPlease keep in mind this course alone will not give you the knowledge and skills to pass the exam. The course will lay the foundation for what you'll need to know before you begin a more intensive study of the services specific to data on the Google Cloud Platform.\n**Five Reasons to Take this Course**\n1) Google is the World Leader in Machine Learning\nGoogle knows data and they know big data. They work with some of the largest data sets in the world. They also have one of the largest data science teams on the planet. Companies that know data science know data engineering.  Google has been on the forefront of data exploration for years.\n2) Occam's Razor Approach to Teaching\nLess is almost always more.  If you're serious about data engineering as a career you don't need or want your hand held for long periods of time.  You want the core of any subject and then you want to get your hands dirty. My courses are relatively short and to the point. You don't have time for filler and I don't believe in adding it.\n3) Real World Instructor Experience\nI've been working with data for over two decades. I've authored books, created applications being used in the real world and have over 30 course on Udemy specific to data. I've worked with over 50 different companies as an employee or consultant. Data has been my life for two decades and all of that has been in the real world.\n4) The Only Data Engineering Certification on the Market\nI have to be honest with you. I'm not a huge fan of most mastorial programs for machine learning or data related degrees. There is still quite a gap between what colleges teach and what companies expect.  I believe certifications offer a better path into the real world of data and machine learning. A master's degree might get you the interview but hands on with the product and the certification will get you the job.\n5) Limited Data Engineering Courses\nAt the time I authored this course there are no other courses on the market that are dedicated to learning the skills you'll need for passing the Google certified data engineer exam.  My courses aren't specific to learning how to pass the exam. I want you to be able to pass the exam but more importantly I want you to be able to apply what you've learned in my courses in order to work with various real world data sets.",

Thousands of organizations, from all sizes and shapes, are moving to the cloud, and being able to work with it is one of the most important skills for every developer, architect, or IT admin.\nAnd this course does just that.\nIf you'll take this course, you'll become a real expert in Microsoft Azure.\nWe start from the very basics - what is the cloud and what it's good for - and go to the most advanced concepts such as Azure Policy, Cost management, and lots more.\nBy the end of this course you'll be familiar with the major services in Azure, and also some real hidden gems known only to the few (Azure IMDS, for instance), and you'll be able to work with Azure and design and build modern cloud apps, utilizing the most up-to-date cloud services.\nHere is a partial list of what we'll talk about in this course:\n- What is the cloud\n- Azure vs other clouds\n- The Azure portal\n- Azure Compute - Virtual Machines, App Services, AKS, Azure Functions and more\n- Azure Networking - VNets, Subnets, NSG, Application Gateway and more\n- Data in Azure - Azure SQL, CosmosDB, Azure MySQL, Storage Account and more\n- Messaging in Azure - Event Grid, Queues, Service Bus, Event Hubs\n- Azure Active Directory (also known as Azure AD)\n- Logging and Monitoring in Azure\n- Securing systems in Azure\n- Cost Management\n- Disaster Recovery (DR)\nAnd lots and lots more...\nNow, to make sure that this course is the best Azure course out there, I've decided to make it a little bit different.\nInstead of going through the various features of Azure, talking about each one and perhaps even doing a demo - this course takes a different approach.\nWe're going to build, together, a full blown modern cloud system on Azure.\nTogether, we're going to build the readit website, a fictional bookstore that's built in Azure.\nWe're going to begin with the very basics - take a code and put it on a virtual machine in the cloud.\nAnd then we're going to add more compute elements, add networking, databases, messaging, monitoring, security, and even DR! (Take a look at the video preview - you can see there the architecture diagram of the system at the beginning, and how it looks like when we're done with it. Worth watching...)\nAnd when we're done - you'll be able to say that you've built a complete system in Azure!\nThis is something you can show future employers and clients, and explain them how the system is designed, and what are the reasons it's built like this.\nNow, don't worry about the code. Everything it going to be provided to you.\nThe system is built using .NET Core and nodeJS, but you don't have to be familiar with these languages, you just better have some development knowledge.\nThere is no other course like this!\nThis is the only Azure course that takes you step-by-step towards a complete, full blown system in the cloud. At the end of it - you can definitely call yourself Azure Expert.\n\n\nBut that's not all...\nAt the end of this course, you'll be able to download the Azure Architecture Summary, a comprehensive, step-by-step guide that summarizes what we've learned in the course, and that will help you design great Azure apps.\nThis summary is an extremely handy doc to use when designing future Azure apps. I use it and it helps me a lot - and so should you...\n\n\nThis course takes you from the absolute basics of Azure to the most advanced topics, known only to few.

      "description": "Updated to OpenShift 4\n\n\nOpenShift is a very powerful platform that can help you run your applications securely and easily scale them up as demand rises. In this course you will learn to take advantage of all of this functionality and deploy any type of application to the OpenShift Container Platform. No prior experience in Docker, Kubernetes, or OpenShift is required. This course will take you from no knowledge of OpenShift to professional-level knowledge of OpenShift in just 6 hours.\n\n\nWhat this course has that other courses don't have\n\n\nThis is the only course that covers all of the essential OpenShift resource types that you, the developer, need to do your job. Most other courses provide only a light introduction of a few of the OpenShift resource types. Instead, they focus on the DevOps aspects of OpenShift. This course covers 15 different types of OpenShift resources that you will need to do your job effectively. Don't settle for anything less!\n\n\nReal-world experience\n\n\nYou have the opportunity in this course to get real-world experience with services like Quay and GitLab. These services are not required to complete the course, but you will get the most out of the course if you sign up for them and complete the related Labs. You can use both of these services for free for this course.\n\n\nReasons to Learn OpenShift\n\n\nThere are many great reasons for developers to learn OpenShift. Many top tech companies are adopting OpenShift as part of their cloud journey. Knowledge of OpenShift can help you get a job working on the OpenShift platform. The primary customers of OpenShift are large companies with lots of employees, so you have a good chance of finding a position to use your new OpenShift skills.\nDevelopers may also wish to learn about OpenShift to leverage the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) OpenShift solutions offered by many public cloud vendors. This can help you to host your own OpenShift-based application to support a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startup or other freelance work.\n\n\nContent and Overview\n\n\nThis course explains OpenShift's vocabulary in clear language, assuming no background in OpenShift. Lectures each have demos and walkthroughs to bring concepts from theory into practice.\n\n\nThroughout the course, you will work with Git source control and a container registry to deploy applications to OpenShift. This enables you to test your skills in a realistic setting. Labs are hands-on and will require modifying configuration or light code patches in order to achieve the goal.\n\n\nOpenShift Resource Types\n\n\nJust like Kubernetes, developing applications on OpenShift requires knowledge of OpenShift resource types. OpenShift has custom resources, such as the DeploymentConfig, ReplicationController, and Template, that are not part of Kubernetes. To effectively create applications for OpenShift, you need to know how to work with these new OpenShift-specific types. Of the 15 resource types covered in this course, 10 are OpenShift-specific and only 5 are the same as Kubernetes.\n\n\n\n\nLegal Notice\n\n\nOpenShift and the OpenShift logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Red Hat, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries. This course is not certified, accredited, affiliated with, nor endorsed by OpenShift or Red Hat, Inc.",

      "description": "Did you know…\nOver 750 million people have Excel on their computers, but most don't know how to use it!\nThis might be because Excel can come across as being a little awkward with first-time users.\nWell, within this course, 'Microsoft Excel - Excel from Beginner to Advanced 2025', I'd like to dispel any awkwardness you may encounter, while using Excel, and quickly get you to the point where using Excel is as natural as rolling out of bed in the morning.\n\n\nHow do I do this?\n\n\n- I explain concepts within Excel simply and clearly.\n- I break down Excel's various tools, features, and functionality into the finest of detail, so you can gain a much deeper understanding of the program.\n- I re-visit areas already taught every now and again, to reinforce what you would have already learned.\n- I created this course to suit any level of learner.\n\n\nI understand that learning Excel can feel like a huge undertaking, as it was for me when I first started using the program over 10 years ago. And so, you might ask yourself, “Do I have to learn everything in Excel before I can use it effectively?”.\nWell, the answer is, NO!\nYou don’t have to learn every aspect of Excel before you can consider yourself qualified. The truth is, there is a certain level of proficiency that once reached, will make you considerably more qualified than the average Excel user.\nTo help you achieve this level of proficiency, I've created a very useful Excel workbook called, \"main-workbook-section2\" to accompany you throughout the first part of the course (After the basic introduction videos/material). In this workbook, I cover most (if not all) of the most important features and functionality you must know to get up to speed with Excel. Then as you progress further into the course there are various other pre-prepared spreadsheets and workbooks you can download and use to follow along with my instructions.\nThere's also a really useful section within the course that covers AI in Excel. This is where you'll see how artificial intelligence can help speed things up, make your work more efficient, and even help you get more done in less time. As Excel continues to evolve, learning how to take advantage of Excel AI tools and techniques is a smart way to stay ahead of the curve and stand out from the crowd.\nWhat can you expect after enrolment?\nWe’ll start with a few introductory tutorials to get you set up for the course along with a basic introduction to Excel itself. Then, it’s onto section two, which I hope you’ll complete, and of course, ENJOY! Then, once this part of the course is completed, we'll start diving into other areas of Excel to really start sharpening the skills you would have already learned, along with learning some new things as well.\n\n\nStudent Success Stories:\n\n\n“It's an amazing Excel course! Well explained, and detailed. Great Job Warrick!” Student J - January 2023.\n“I like the course very much, clear/detailed explanations and good way tutor mix dense and easy topics.” Student A - January 2025.\n“I loved this course! It’s clear that the instructor cares about the students who take this course and makes sure the information is clear and easy to understand. I have learned a lot of new and useful tools in Excel. 100% would recommend.” Student K – December 2024.\n“He is stepping into the course in a very smooth way making it easier for the client to understand more” Student Q - June 2022.\n“I have never been able to get halfway through a course before. That is until now. Warrick is a brilliant tutor, everything is explained so well that I've learnt so much and feel more confident in what I'm doing with Excel now. Such a great feeling of self-achievement and that is genuinely because of Warrick. Thank you” Student J – February 2025.\n\n\nWhat do you get when you enroll:\n\n\n- A 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can enroll risk-free.\n- A lifetime access guarantee so you can re-visit the course whenever you want.\n- Access to the Q and A section so you can get help at any point during the course.\n- A certificate of completion to add to your resume/CV.\n\n\nSo, whatever your reason for wanting to learn Excel, enroll in 'Microsoft Excel - Excel from Beginner to Advanced 2025' today! And see where my course will take you :)\n\n\nI’ll see you in the first lesson.\n\n\nWarrick Klimaytys.",

      "description": "Course Overview\nThe testing of traditional systems is well-understood, but AI-based systems, which are becoming more prevalent and critical to our daily lives, introduce new challenges. This course will introduce the key concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI), how we decide acceptance criteria and how we test AI-based systems. These systems have unique characteristics, which makes them special – they can be complex (e.g. deep neural nets), self-learning, based on big data, and non-deterministic, which creates many new challenges and opportunities for testing them.\n\n\nThe course will introduce the range of types of AI-based systems in use today and explain how machine-learning (ML) is often a key part of these systems and show how easy it is to build ML systems. We will look at how the setting of acceptance criteria needs to change for AI-based systems, why we need to consider ethics, and show how the characteristics of AI-based systems make testing more difficult than for traditional systems.\n\n\nIntroduction to ISTQB AI Testing Course by AIT\nThree perspectives are used to show how quality can be achieved with these systems. First, we will consider the choices and checks that need to be made when building a machine-learning system to ensure the quality of data used for both training and prediction. Ideally, we want data that is free from bias and mis-labelling, but, most importantly, closely aligned with the problem. Next, we will consider the range of approaches suitable for the black-box testing of AI-based systems, such as back-to-back testing and A/B testing, introducing, in some detail, the metamorphic testing technique. Third, we will show how white-box testing can be applied to drive the testing and measure the test coverage of neural networks.\nThe need for virtual test environments will be demonstrated using the case of self-driving cars as an example.\nFinally, the use of AI as the basis of tools that support testing will be considered by looking at examples of the successful application of AI to common testing problems.\n\n\nThe course is highly practical and includes many hands-on exercises, providing attendees with experience of building and testing several different types of machine learning systems. No programming experience is required.",

      "description": "The main objective of this course is to help you to learn Data Engineering techniques of building Metadata-Driven frameworks with Azure Data Engineering tools such as Data Factory, Azure SQL, and others.\n\n\nBuilding Frameworks are now an industry norm and it has become an important skill to know how to visualize, design, plan and implement data frameworks.\n\n\nThe framework that we are going to build together is referred to as the Metadata-Driven Ingestion Framework.\n\n\nData ingestion into the data lake from the disparate source systems is a key requirement for a company that aspires to be data-driven, and finding a common way to ingest the data is a desirable and necessary requirement.\n\n\nMetadata-Driven Frameworks allow a company to develop the system just once and it can be adopted and reused by various business clusters without the need for additional development, thus saving the business time and costs. Think of it as a plug-and-play system.\n\n\nThe first objective of the course is to onboard you onto the Azure Data Factory platform to help you assemble your first Azure Data Factory Pipeline. Once you get a good grip of the Azure Data Factory development pattern, then it becomes easier to adopt the same pattern to onboard other sources and data sinks.\n\n\nOnce you are comfortable with building a basic azure data factory pipeline,  as a second objective we then move on to building a fully-fledged and working metadata-driven framework to make the ingestion more dynamic, and furthermore, we will build the framework in such a way that you can audit every batch orchestration and individual pipeline runs for business intelligence and operational monitoring.\n\n\nCreating your first Pipeline\n\n\nWhat will be covered  is as follows;\n1. Introduction to Azure Data Factory\n2. Unpack the requirements and technical architecture\n3. Create an Azure Data Factory Resource\n4. Create an Azure Blob Storage account\n5. Create an Azure Data Lake Gen 2 Storage account\n6. Learn how to use the Storage Explorer\n7. Create Your First Azure Pipeline.\n\n\nMetadata Driven Ingestion\n\n\n1. Unpack the theory on Metadata Driven Ingestion\n2. Describing the High-Level Plan for building the User\n3. Creation of a dedicated Active Directory User and assigning appropriate permissions\n4. Using Azure Data Studio\n5. Creation of the Metadata Driven Database (Tables and T-SQL Stored Procedure)\n6. Applying business naming conventions\n7. Creating an email notifications strategy\n8. Creation of Reusable utility pipelines\n9. Develop a mechanism to log data for every data ingestion pipeline run and also the batch itself\n10. Creation of a dynamic data ingestion pipeline\n11. Apply the orchestration pipeline\n12. Explanation of T-SQL Stored Procedures for the Ingestion Engine\n13. Creating an Azure DevOps Repository for the Data Factory Pipelines\n\n\nEvent-Driven Ingestion\n1. Enabling the Event Grid Provider\n2. Use the Getmetadata Activity\n3. Use the Filter Activity\n4. Create Event-Based Triggers\n5. Create and Merge new DevOps Branches\n\n\nBonus Course: Provision Infra with Azure BICEP\n\n\nThe goal of this course is to help students learn how to professionally write and develop Azure DevOps Infrastructure as Code with BICEP, YAML, Git, and PowerShell.\nAzure DevOps is a leading automation and DevOps platform and the students will be taken through the following;\nAn in-depth introduction to Infrastructure as Code with the Azure DevOps platform\nA definition of DevOps and how Azure as a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform facilitates the practice of the DevOps methodology\nAn Introduction to YAML pipelines on the Azure DevOps platform\nAn Introduction to BICEP and ARM templates for developing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on the Azure DevOps Platform\nAn overview of Industry leading DevOps tools\nGit is an industry-leading distributed version  control system and is a very critical component of Azure DevOps therefore students will be taken through a Git Crash Course that covers the following basic aspects;\nThe creation of a local Git Repository\nLearn how to stage and commit single and multiple files\nBranching management with Git including Merging\nGit with Bash and Visual Studio Code\nLearn how to time travel and undo changes\nStudents may find it necessary to learn about how to set up Azure DevOps Pipeline Agents as Self-Hosted Azure DevOps agents for running CI / CD  pipelines, perhaps the situation could be cost saving in a work environment or  a cost-effective personal environment, and therefore the students will learn the following;\nSet up Billing for Microsoft and Self Hosted pipeline agents\nInstallation and Set Up for a  Self Hosted pipeline agents\nSetting up of a Personal Access Token\nConfiguration of a Self-Hosted Agent\nYAML is a leading configuration management technology for developing CI / CD pipelines, perhaps the best way to learn how to write YAML pipelines is for the student to be taken through how to provision infrastructure with YAML, Powershell, and BICEP. The initial focus will be the provisioning of the resource group and there and therefore the students will learn the following;\nHow to Create an Azure Service Connection\nCloning an Azure DevOps Repository\nWriting PowerShell Script to Provision a Resource Group\nHow to Add Stages, Jobs, and Steps in a YAML pipeline template\nRunning the YAML pipeline on Azure DevOps\nHow to develop Azure Variables Group and pass them into YAML templates\nHow to override BICEP parameters using YAML\nOne aspect of professionalism in coding is how projects are structured for coding efficiency and ease of management, the other aspect in the naming convention of resources. The course will take through students on the following.\nCreating Project Structures for a DevOps and BICEP project using Bash and Git\nEstablish a standard naming convention for resources using BICEP and PowerShell\nThe heart of provisioning and deploying infrastructure in Azure is the adoption of BICEP, and students will learn the following in terms of developing BICEP in a professional manner;\nDevelopment of a BICEP template to provision Log Analytics and Data Factory\nHow to add Input Parameters to a BICEP template\nHow to create BICEP Modules for Log Analytics and Data Factory\nHow to add Tagging Information to BICEP modules\nHow to structure a naming convention with BICEP\nHow to use run time and compile time variables and parameters\nHow to write a PowerShell Script to Transpile BICEP to an ARM template\nHow to Manage Dependencies between Resources with BICEP\nHow to manage BICEP template errors",

Not only will you learn SQL, but you will learn a lot about data visualization and how to gather insights from the data. You will also have access to hundreds of huge real world data sets that come along with the Google Big Query Ecosystem. Even after finishing the course content, you can still continue to improve by doing all sorts of projects on the data made available.\nThis course requires a Google account (which is Free) and a free 12 month trial for Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This is how you access Google Big Query which is one of the services offered through GCP. When signing up for the 12 month free trial of GCP you get $300 USD to spend on any GCP services. This is more than enough to query the data sets in this course. I used less than 5% of the credits in preparing as well as completing all the materials. As part of the sign up process you will require a credit card or bank account details so GCP can verify your identity. You will not be charged or billed during your free 12 month trial. Instructions for signing up  will be available in introductory videos for the course.",

I highly recommend it to those wanting to take a solid intro to microservices.\"\n\n\n★★★★★\n\"The course is very good not only for a pace-setting self-learners, but also for instructors/tutors.\nBeing a coding tutor I continuously seek for basic courses that allow me to grab ideas for opinion making and directing. The students will have fast and effective progress whenever they are given a proper direction to knowledge formation.|\nThis course will definitely be included in my Favorite List.\nThe only notification, all the code must be fully visible, even if just for a while.\nI really enjoyed to observe how the tutor explains.\nWell done!\"\n\n\nKnowledge Notes!\nIn today's digital landscape, it's more important than ever for web applications to be scalable and resilient. As a result, many developers are turning to microservices as a way to build and manage complex systems. In this article, we will explore Spring Microservices, a framework that makes it easy to develop and deploy microservices-based applications, while also ensuring their maintainability and reliability.\nWhat are Spring Microservices?\nSpring Microservices is a framework for building microservices-based web applications using the Spring Boot framework. It provides a set of tools and libraries that simplify the development, deployment, and management of microservices-based applications. Spring Microservices is built on top of Spring Boot, which makes it a popular choice among developers who are already familiar with the Spring framework.\nWhy Choose Spring Microservices?\nThere are several reasons why developers are turning to Spring Microservices. Here are a few of the most compelling benefits:\nScalability: Microservices architecture allows developers to break an application down into smaller, independent components. This means that each microservice can be scaled independently, which can help improve the performance and scalability of the overall application.\nResilience: By breaking an application down into smaller, independent components, developers can build more resilient applications. If one microservice fails, it won't necessarily bring down the entire application.\nFlexibility: With microservices, developers can choose the best technology for each microservice. This allows for more flexibility in terms of development and deployment.\nMaintainability: With microservices, developers can more easily make changes to the application without affecting other parts of the system. This can help improve the maintainability and scalability of the application over time.",

Course moves quickly enough to be engaging without skipping over material.\" -- Sarah Hale\n\"This course works for me because it progresses with a level of detail that will be useful as I think through each step necessary to execute my own integration packages. There are several courses to choose from and I'm glad I chose this one.\" -- David McNickle\n\"Very good introductory course. Didn't really know what SSIS was until recently. Working through the course opened my eyes to past projects that would have benefited from an SSIS ETL package or two.\" -- Stephen Benton\nWelcome to this course about SQL Server Integration Services.\nIn this course you'll be downloading and installing the latest 2022 SQL Server Developer – a full version for free, so that you can use it on your machine. And previous versions of SQL Server Developer have previously retailed for around $100, and now it’s free.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\nSo what is SSIS? It’s a way to automate in the importing and exporting and data – or ETL: extract, transform and load. It’s a very visual part of SSIS, using tasks, components and flowcharts, so it’s easy to learn the basics of it.\nWe’ll start by extracting some data, and then loading it into another table. I’ll take nice as slow as we start to introduce transformations, such as aggregation, conditional split, merging and auditing. There’ll be plenty of practice activities too, so you can get to practice your new-found skills.\nBy the end of this course, you'll be confident in using the main Data Flow components and Control Flow tasks, and would be able to use it in your own work.",

Because it is so widely used, in everything from cars and trucks through to boats, factories and even building management systems, the chances of interacting with it on a daily basis are pretty high.\nCAN is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer. It is a message-based protocol, designed originally for multiplex electrical wiring within automobiles, but is also used in many other contexts.\nYou should get to know this protocol as it will allow you to expand your expertise and opportunities in design and building equipment in the following areas: Automotive, Medical, Military, Industrial Machines, Aviation, etc.\nThere is quite a bit of info on CAN Bus available on the Internet, but not much showing CAN Bus communications in a very practical way. And that's what I am going to do in the course.\nAt the end of my course, you are not only going to understand the CAN Bus theory but I am going to show you how to use CAN Bus hardware and software in my usual practical approach.",

The first course is called \"Learn API Technical Writing: JSON and XML for Writers\", and it is recommended that you first take that course, unless you are very familiar with JSON and XML, and how to document them.\nThis course teaches how to document REST APIs. No programming experience is required, but technical writers with programming experience who want to know more about REST APIs will still find it useful.\nWhat are APIs?\nAPIs (Application Program Interfaces) define how software systems talk to each other, and API documentation is a rapidly growing field. There is a strong need for writers who can understand APIs and explain them so that software developers can understand how to use them. API writers get to be in on the cutting edge of technology in high-paying positions.\nWhat is REST?\nREST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular style of web API, and it's used to communicate data between devices and servers. Different data is contained in different parts of the API requests and responses, and this course explains what those different parts are and how to document them.\nWhat is in This Course?\nBy the end of the course, you will understand what REST is and how to read and document REST requests and responses. In this course you'll find:\n12 videos that:\nProvide background information on REST APIs\nBreak down REST requests into their various pieces with examples\nShow real-time, narrated writing of REST documentation\nProvide overviews of authentication and authorization for REST\n7 hands-on exercises to lead you through making and documenting REST requests\n7 short quizzes to keep you on your toes\nPowerPoint presentations as a resource for every video lecture\nA Microsoft Word document you can use as a template for REST reference material\nThe course takes approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes to complete, depending on how fast you are with the exercises.",

I can use SAP CR much more consciously now. Especially enjoyed the Formulas section. Thank you, Phillip!\" - Julius\n\"Neatly articulated and presented with full of joy. Felt very good all the way till end with his friendly teaching method. Feel good learning experience. Thank You!\" - Parthasarathi\nHello, and welcome to Crystal Reports 2008 to 2020. This course has been completely re-recorded using SAP Crystal Reports 2020\nIn this course we'll be looking at SAP Crystal Reports, and how to use it.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by SAP.\nThis course starts right at the beginning, and so is good for absolute beginners, but would also be useful for you if you have previously used it, perhaps viewing reports or making basic reports, and would like to improve your skills.\nYou don't need to have Crystal Reports on your computer, as first of all we will install a trial version of Crystal Reports for free, so that you can use it on your computer free for 30 days. This way, you can practice with your new skills, experiment with your own data and create your own reports.\nThis course is separated into 7 levels, each getting progressively more deeper into Crystal Reports. They are:\n\nCreating your first report,\nAdding grouping, sorting and filtering, also known as Selecting.\nFormatting,\nAdding user interaction through parameters,\nGraphs and charts,\nSubreports, and\nFormulas.\nAll of this will be taken at a fairly leisurely pace, so you can really get familiar with the menus and icons.\n\nBy the end, you will be able to develop your own reports, and start to explore other people's.

      "description": "Thanks for checking out this course!\n\n\nMy name is Theodore Panagacos and I am a full-time management consultant and Chief Architect practitioner.\n\n\nIf you're like myself and have worked as an Enterprise Architect you'll realize how hard it can be to develop artefacts that are both meaningful and valuable for your organization.\nThere are heaps of courses out there which help you become and Enterprise Architect but not many will show you exactly what you need to be doing once you start working as one!\nAre you an Enterprise Architect, Business Analyst or Consultant who has been struggling with designing architecture models and diagrams and quickly want to take your skills to the next level?\n\n\nIn this course I show you exactly how to develop Enterprise Architecture models and diagrams that are used by the world’s most successful organizations.\n\n\nAs a career Management Consultant in the Enterprise Architecture industry, I’ve been fortunate to work alongside some of the world’s top performing organizations. By working with these companies, not only  did I learn first-hand how to design and model architecture diagrams during my own work, but I quickly found I started to teach others about the topic too. This course is the direct result of many years of experience in Enterprise Architecture. Not only is this course realistic and practical, but it will give you the exact details needed to improve your knowledge and understanding of this specialist topic.\n\n\nDeveloping architecture artefacts can be a difficult topic to learn but in this course I'm going to guide you through an entire suite of examples so that you will finish as a better architect.\n\n\nThis course will also provide you with practical architecture skills which includes;\nUnderstand the differences between various architecture artefacts and how they're used to make a difference within organizations.\nShow you exact real-life examples needed to create Business Architecture, Data Architecture, Infrastructure Architecture and Application Architecture diagrams.\nLearn the best-practice methods for setting up Microsoft Visio Professional.\nLearn how to model in Visio the same way the architecture professionals do.\nAnd we're going to learn this together, step-by-step.\n\n\nWhile this course will teach you the essentials of developing models and diagrams, it has also been designed to make you a more effective Enterprise Architect practitioner. This course covers critical skills that will help you add immediate value to your architecture career. Best of all, the course has been structured in an easy-to-follow format.\n\n\nThis course is suitable for beginners and students at all levels.

Your course is amazing.\" - David Pereira, Product Owner, limango GmbH\n\"Thank you so much for creating the robust Product Owner course. It is, for me, the exact approach I needed to wrap my head around the position and its responsibilities.\" - Hans Fernandez, Central Square\n“Michael's passion and enthusiasm for Agile practices is evident both in the way that he presents his material and the subject matter itself.” - Jamie Phillips, Consulting Software Engineer, Picis\n\"I tend to be a fairly cynical and critical person. I have gone to a lot of seminars and often find myself leaving them feeling like it was not a good use of my time.\nYet, I am only on slide 1 of Module 2, and the amount of time I'm spending nodding my head up and down in agreement with your points is already noteworthy. Even a simple point you made about user stories, and how there is no universal right or wrong way to do it, is something I have NEVER heard expressed so well, even at Business Analyst focused seminars. I'm enjoying how you break this down and explain these concepts.\" - Brian Cargas, Product Owner, Cargill\n\n\n\n\nAre you a Scrum Product Owner? Are you not sure how to run experiments to validate your backlog? Do you want to learn how to collaborate with your team and stakeholders? Do you want to make accurate prioritization decisions that maximize value? Then this course is for you!\nThis course is the fastest path you can take to 'level up' your Scrum Product Owner skills.\nThis course is for people who have taken a one to three day course on Scrum Product Ownership (or have equivalent experience) and want to ‘raise the bar’ on their skills. Introductory Product Owner courses tell you ‘what’ you need to do but not ‘how’ to do it. This course shows you, through detailed examples, exercises, and homework, ‘how’ to be a Scrum Product Owner.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nThe mindset of successful Scrum Product Owners. You will learn how your mindset influences your actions and how to construct an effective mindset.\nHow to interact with the Development Team and stakeholders. What practices can you put in place that will make you more successful?\nHypothesis-driven development: How to make sure that the items in your backlog are valuable.\nEXACTLY what you are responsible for during the planning, refinement, and review meetings. And how to execute on those responsibilities effectively.\nHow to visualize your work. You will learn what managers care about and how they think about product ownership.\nThe characteristics of a Product Owner and how to increase your ability to work with the team.\nYou will get spreadsheets and recipes that take the STRESS out of being a Scrum Product Owner.\nIn addition to the course material, you will receive two one-on-one 25 minute coaching sessions with me. I will share with you what I’ve learned training and consulting at eBay, Carbonite, edX, Paypal, Symantec, Philips, Verizon, and a dozen other companies.  In addition, you’ll be able to ask questions at any time using the questions area of the course. This is like having a PERSONAL TUTOR as you ‘level up’ your Scrum Product Owner skills.\nWho am I? I am a Scrum Alliance Certified Enterprise Coach (CEC). There are about 100 of us in the world. I know that sounds a bit arrogant but I'm one of about 300 Scrum coaches and trainers who can submit people for the Certified Product Owner (CSPO) and Certified Scrum Master (CSM) certifications so I know the material in ways that other instructors do not.  I'm the co-author of two books, Why Agile Works and Professional Scrum with Team Foundation Server. Before becoming an agile coach I was VP of Corporate Strategy at Softricity (acquired by Microsoft) and founder of Inquira (acquired by Oracle). I have a PhD in Computer Science from MIT.\nI am here to pump you up as you deepen your understanding of Scrum and improve your Scrum Product Owner skills!\nThe course is designed to be taken over nine weeks. If you follow this plan, you will spend approximately half an hour per day on the course. The first one or two days of every week will focus on videos and during the remainder of the week you will be doing assignments.\nWarning: This course is HARD. I like to say, “Practice in proportion to your aspirations.” If you are ready to sweat blood to become a better Scrum Product Owner, I invite you to look at the many videos you can watch for free to see if this course is a good fit for you.\nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. I want you to be successful: more influential, confident, and visible.",

Kubernetes has gained a lot of popularity lately and it is a well sought skill by companies.\nThis course is updated frequently to include the features of latest releases!\nWhen Google started running containers a decade ago, nobody could reach this kind of infrastructure agility and efficiency. Using this knowledge, Google released Kubernetes as an free and open source project. Nowadays Kubernetes is used by small companies and big enterprises who want to gain the efficiency and velocity Google has.\nYou can containerize applications using Docker. You can then run those containers on your servers, but there's no way you can manage those efficiently without extra management software. Kubernetes is an orchestrator for your containers that will create, schedule and manage your containers on a cluster of servers. Kubernetes can run on-premise or in the cloud, on a single machine or on thousands of machines.\nI will show you how to build apps in containers using docker and how to deploy those on a Kubernetes cluster. I will explain you how to setup your cluster on your desktop, or on the cloud using AWS. I use a real world example app (Wordpress with MySQL - blogging software) to show you the real power of Kubernetes: scheduling stateless and stateful applications.\nThe introduction lectures that show you the Kubernetes desktop installation are free to preview, so you can already have a go at it before buying the course!\nThis course also has Closed Captions (English subtitles)\nUpdates (11/2019):\n* Added Admission Controllers lectures\n* Continuous Development with Skaffold\n* etcd and the raft algorithm\nUpdates (01/2020):\n* AWS EKS (managed Kubernetes) lecture and demo\nUpdates (01/2021):\n* MutatingWebhook, ValidatingWebhook and demo\nUpdates (04/2024):\n* How to write a Kubernetes Operator Controller in Go",

Write queries efficiently using BigQuery hints and formatting helps.  Work with SELECT statements, including creating FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses to create queries that answer driving questions you have about your data.  If you are not familiar with working with multiple tables and using joins, that's no problem, you will learn that in this course.\nUse features of BigQuery designed to make you more productive, like Saved Queries, Exporting Data, and Execution Details that help you improve the performance of your queries.\nLearn how to create tables and data sets and load data into BigQuery directly and by using Cloud Storage, Google Cloud's large scale object storage system.\nWhile the graphical user interface, known as the BigQuery console, is an excellent tool for interactive work with BigQuery, sometimes we need to run the same queries or operations repeatedly to generate reports or download data. In this course you will learn about the bq command line utility that lets you query data and work with datasets from the command line.  If you prefer to work with Python or other programming languages, you can use the BigQuery client libraries for running queries and other jobs right from your programs and scripts. You don't even need to have Python installed on your device because we'll use CoLab, a free Google service for working with Python notebooks.\nQuizzes and assignments in this course allow you to check your understanding as you progress through the course by answering questions and writing queries.\nTo use BigQuery effectively though, you need to understand how BigQuery is designed. Building a data warehouse and designing data models in BigQuery is fundamentally different than building and modeling in relational databases like Oracle, SQL Server and PostgreSQL. In this course, you will learn about BigQuery's architecture and how it influences how we structure and query data.\nLearn insights from an instructor with decades of experience in working with data. Dan Sullivan is a Principal Data Architect and author of books and numerous articles on databases and Google Cloud. Dan is the author the Official Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer Study Guide as well as study guides for the Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect and Associate Cloud Engineer certifications.  He has developed courses for Google Cloud, data modeling, data science, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, DevOps, and more.

The entire curriculum that this class covers was what they covered in week 1, and from what I've heard, R has a very steep learning curve. The extra time taken to even walkthrough installation is clearer here. It is much appreciated. You get lots of opportunities to practice, follow along, and really build your knowledge step by step.\" 5 star review by a Udemy user\n\n\n\"A really really good course for beginners in R, highly recommended. Everything is well explained in detail and enough coding exercises to get you familiarize with concepts before moving to the next section.\nThanks for this Ivo, appreciated.\" 5 star review by a Udemy user\n\n\n\"Easy to understand, calm and clear explanation. Covered points which are ignored by other tutors. Great\" 5 star review by a Udemy user\n\n\nThis course was designed to be your first step into the R programming world! We will delve deeper into the concepts of R objects, understand the R user interface and play around with several datasets. This course contains lectures around the following groups:\nIntroductory slides lectures with the most well-known commands for each type of R object.\nCode along lectures where you will see how we can implement the stuff we will learn!\nTest your knowledge with questions and practical exercises with different levels of difficulty!\nAnalyze real datasets and understand the thought process from question to R code solution!\nThis course was designed to be focused on the practical side of coding in R - instead of teaching you every function and method out there, I'll show you how you can read questions and examples and get to the answer by yourself, compounding your knowledge on the different R objects.\nAt the end of the course you should be able to use R to analyze your own datasets. Along the way you will also learn what R vectors, arrays, matrixes and lists are and how you can combine the knowledge of those objects to power up your analysis.\n\n\nHere are some examples of things you will be able to do after finishing the course:\nLoad CSV and Excel files into R;\nDo interesting line plots that enable you to draw conclusions from data.\nPlot histograms of numerical data.\nCreate your own functions that will enable you to reutilize code.\nSlice and dice Data Frames, subsetting data for specific domains.\n\n\nJoin thousands of professionals and students in this R journey and discover the amazing power of this statistical open-source language.\nThis course will be constantly updated based on students feedback.",

We will delve into the various scenarios, such as new fields, new partitions, changes in data types, and missing data, and discuss the techniques on how to handle them effectively. We will also delve into Glue Catalog Management and the evolution of schemas, with a focus on minimizing disruption to downstream systems\nWe will also look into different data formats, such as CSV, Parquet, Avro, and ORC, and examine their respective strengths and weaknesses. Following that, we will delve into Glue ETL, a robust Apache Spark-based solution for data transformation.\nThis course is filled with hands-on exercises and projects.\nYou will analyze a University Rankings dataset, which is easy to understand, useful, and has a mix of data types with many data quality issues.\nYou will learn to utilize Athena for querying data, tackle data quality problems through SQL, and cleanse the data using Glue - Apache Spark ETL.\nAdditionally, the course covers techniques for simplifying queries using views and visualizing data using Amazon QuickSight.\nTo showcase the scalability of Athena, we will query the large Amazon Customer Reviews dataset containing over 130 million reviews. Finally, we will construct a serverless application using Kinesis Firehose, Lambda, Comprehend AI, Glue, Athena, and S3, which can process an unlimited number of customer reviews, perform sentiment analysis, and store the results in the data lake for querying.\nI am excited to meet you soon!\nThank you!\nChandra Lingam\nCompute With Cloud Inc",

      "description": "This course details the requirements of ISO/IEC 27701:2019, the latest standard published by ISO (The International Organization for Standardization) to define controls for an organization that processes a Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\nISO/IEC 27701 is an extension for privacy of ISO/IEC 27001 (the Information Security Management System standard) and can be used by any organization regardless of its location and size, regardless if it acts as PII (Personally Identifiable Information) controller, PII processor or both.\nProtecting privacy is a significant business concern. According to IBM the average cost of a data breach is USD 3.6 million, and legal obligations are increasingly stringent. As we get more connected, governments all over the world are introducing various privacy regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). ISO/IEC 27701 helps businesses meet such requirements, whatever jurisdiction they work in\nMajor companies and organizations have participated in the development of this standard. For example Microsoft was an active member of the committee that developed ISO/IEC 27701.\nThe course includes 5 sections:\n- the first one is the Introductory section where we discuss about general aspects, definitions, privacy principles, privacy actors, international standards for privacy or the relationship of ISO/IEC 27701:2019 with the GDPR;\n- the second section is about the general management system requirements including Context of the organization, Leadership, Planning, Support, Operation, Performance evaluation and Improvement.\n- the third section discusses the information security controls (114) from ISO/IEC 27001 with privacy additions, where they are present. The following sets of controls are included: Information security and privacy policies, Organization of information security and privacy, Human resources security, Asset management, Access control, Cryptography, Physical and environmental security, Operations security, Communications security, Systems acquisition, development and maintenance, Supplier relationships, Incident management, Information security and privacy aspects of business continuity and Compliance;\n- the fourth section includes requirements and guidelines for organizations that act as PII controllers and\n- section five is about requirements and guidelines for organizations that act as PII processors.\n\n\nFrom this course you will get all the knowledge you need to understand what a Privacy Information Management System is.\nYou can use this information to:\n- work as a privacy consultant;\n- participate in management system audits;\n- enhance an organization's information security management system to meet the additional requirements of ISO/IEC 27701;\n- implement a Privacy Information Management System in a company;\n... or you can just have a better understanding of what is ISO approach on processing personally identifiable information.\nYou will get from this course concise information that you can re-visit at any time since Udemy offers life-time access and as you complete the training you will obtain a certificate for completion, that can be useful to demonstrate your competence.",

      "description": "This course is for Quarkus developers who want to discover how Quarkus and MicroProfile handle microservices. It’s a mixture of slides and code so you can “Understand and Practice” at the same time. This way, you learn the theory, and then put it into practice by developing a microservice architecture step by step.\nIn this course you will develop two microservices that talk to each other. After introducing Microservices and MicroProfile, you will make sure your development environment is set up, and you will go from bootstrapping two Quarkus microservices, to running them as Docker containers. The different steps you’ll go through are:\nUnderstand Microservices,\nUnderstand MicroProfile,\nCheck your development environment,\nDevelop two microservice that expose a REST endpoint using JAX-RS and CDI,\nCustomize the JSON output with JSON-B,\nTest the two microservices in isolation with JUnit and RESTAssured,\nConfigure each microservice,\nDocument each microservice with MicroProfile OpenAPI,\nEstablish the communication between microservices with MicroProfile REST Client\nMock the microservice communication when testing,\nHandle communication failure with MicroProfile Fault Tolerance,\nBuild a Linux executable with GraalVM out of each microservice,\nContainerize each microservice with Docker and execute it,\nCreate and configure a Docker Compose file so both microservices can be executed in a single command.\nAt the end of the course you’ll get a good understanding on how implementing microservices with Quarkus. You will be able to bootstrap, develop, package and execute a microservice architecture, but most important, take Quarkus microservices to your next project.\nGood luck for the course, and please reach out if you need any help or if you have any request: I’m here to help!",

Maybe your company is transitioning to ServiceNow from another tool, or maybe you’re interested in starting your career as a ServiceNow developer? Whatever your case may be, this course will get you get up to speed on the ServiceNow platform.\nHello, my name is Mark Miller and I’ll be your instructor for this course. I have over 6 years of experience on the platform and have worked on 50+ ServiceNow projects.\nExplaining ServiceNow in a clear and concise manner has always been a goal of mine. Unsatisfied by ServiceNow’s own attempt to explain their platform, I set out to create this course, which will do just that.\nWhat can it do? What are the benefits of using the platform? Why might a CIO choose ServiceNow over their internal team of application developers? These are all questions we’ll explore in this course. We’ll also look at 6 use cases which leverage the ServiceNow platform, we’ll cover how to get your very own ServiceNow instance up and running for free, we’ll explore the ServiceNow docs and community, and introduce the user interface and navigating the platform. We’ll end the course by touring the Incident, Problem, Knowledge, and Service Catalog applications.\nThanks and I hope to see you in the Up & Running with ServiceNow course!",

      "description": "Ever wondered how you could capture and represent knowledge to share it with someone else, using the most efficient way possible? Are you interested in learning how knowledge can be pieced together for human interpretation and Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nChances are we've probably all at some point been faced with situations where we wished there was a quicker, more effective, way of capturing and representing knowledge so that it makes sense to human beings and computers. Knowledge modelling (or technically speaking, ontology modelling) is about the tools and techniques for capturing and representing knowledge. A knowledge model (a.k.a. ontology) is, basically, a representation that provides a basis for sharing meaning about some subject matter.\nThere are a great many uses of knowledge modelling from semantic data fabric to augmented data products, natural language processing, high-fidelity controlled vocabularies & thesauri, reference models used in enterprise architecture, engineering and heaps more. Moreover with Generative AI and the need for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) for accurate question-answering capability, ontologies are now a focal point in Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nIn this course, you'll learn how to go about modelling knowledge from a practical perspective, which means that in addition to getting an appreciation of the context of knowledge modelling, you'll also be expected to get your hands dirty! So, we'll be looking at applying different methods for building knowledge models. These methods include graphical as well as formal computer-aided techniques.\nThis course is for people who care about knowledge sharing and making knowledge a true asset to support knowledge management, systems interoperability, intelligent information architecture, best practice knowledge capture, and many more.",

This course covers everything you need to know to get started with Spring Data Rest . Using this architecture simplifies the creation of a REST API - Renato Santos\nExcellent course. Interesting, practical, hands-on, relevant and engaging. The instructor makes Spring-Data-REST easy to learn and use - Glyn Davies\nI am fully satisfied with your lecture.Outstanding.You are simply Awesome - Prasad Palla\n---\nAll source code is available for download\nResponsive Instructor - All questions answered within 24 hours\nProfessional video and audio recordings (check the free previews)\n----\n\n\nDo you have a lot of data that you'd like to expose via RESTful web services? Are you a java spring developer interested in learning the Springs powerful and easy to use REST framework.Are you an experienced Java web developer who wants to create Microservices RESTful APIs in minutes.Then this course is for you.It is a complete hand's on course with quizzes and assignments.\nSpring is the most widely used framework in the industry today.REST web services have become the number one means for application integration on the web.REST is also the defacto technology for Microservices to communicate. REST defines that a system consists of resources that clients interact with. These resources are implemented in a hypermedia driven way. Spring MVC allows building these kinds of services. But implementing even the simplest of REST web services for a domain model can be quite tedious and result in a lot of boilerplate code every time.\nSpring Data REST builds on top of Spring Data repositories and automatically exports those as REST resources. It leverages hypermedia to allow clients to find functionality exposed by the repositories and integrates these resources into related hypermedia based functionality automatically.\nThe goal of this course is to help you master the concepts of micro services, rest and build an end to end application while exploring the various features of spring data rest.By the time you finish this course, you will have gained the understanding of Microservices, REST, HATEOAS and Spring Data Rest.We'll look at how you can use Spring Data REST to easily take your data from your data access layer to consumable JSON by a front-end framework.\nWhat Will I Learn?\nMaster the concepts of Microservices , REST and Spring Data REST\nCreate a simple RESTful API using Spring Data REST\nBuild an end to end RestFul API application from scratch\nTest your REST APIs using Postman REST Client\nImplement Paging and Sorting support for your REST API\nCustomize the JSON Responses\nImplement Custom search APIs using Spring Data\nImplement business logic into your REST Services using custom controllers\nProvide different views of the data in your application using projections and excerpts\nEnable HAL browser support for your Applicatoin\nSecure your REST API using Authentication as well as authorization\nAll in simple and easy steps",
