Non si tratta di quanto un ambiente sia grande o piccolo, ma di saperlo sfruttare adeguatamente con soluzioni intelligenti e piccoli accorgimenti che pagano immediatamente l’occhio, dando una piacevole sensazione a chi lo vive.",

      "description": "Why should we grow our own garden?\nYou can go to the supermarket and buy your own produce, but growing your own vegetables is very important, and incredibly satisfying.\nModern Agriculture uses oil. The burning of the oil creates global warming. In order to reduce the amount of global warming, we can grow our own food.\nSecondly, A non-organic system means polluting the water system when we use pesticides. These pesticides, go directly into the water system.\nThirdly, Non-organic agriculture encourages chopping down trees, which is not good for the ecosystem in general.\nFourthly, In order to grow food, modern agriculture denudes the land, creating an inhospitable environment for different species of animals and plants.\nToday, in our modern world, we do all these things in order to grow food, but we're actually eliminating the fertile ground we are sitting on, which will eventually lead to an ultimate lack of farmable land. Growing our own garden improves the state of the planet we live in in a number of ways:.\n\n\nThe Advantages of Organic Agriculture:\nFirstly, Organic agriculture does not use pesticides, so it does not pollute the water system.\nSecondly, Organic agriculture does not need to chop down trees. In fact, it tries to grow food complemented by trees, or to grow food on the trees themselves.\nThirdly, Organic agriculture strives to live in harmony with animals and other plants, recognizing and taking advantage of the fact that certain plants and animals depend on one another to survive and thrive.\nThe goal of organic agriculture is to create a permanent culture, a culture that will stay here forever.\n\n\nAdditional Advantages of Growing an Organic Garden: Improvement of the Individual\nFirstly, the garden can be created, worked on, and harvested by the whole family. The garden thus provides teamwork and becomes an educational opportunity for the kids.\nSecondly, A garden provides an opportunity to engage in physical work. This relatively easy physical work is very good for prolonging life, and for improving quality of life.\nThirdly, Gardening 10 to 20 minutes daily has been proven to be of great benefit for people of more advanced ages- mentally, emotionally, and physically.\nFourthly, Gardening is related to the concept of Earthing. Earthing means standing barefoot on the ground. This simple action has many psychological benefits. It allows us to become more grounded, more centred, more at peace with our world, and with our place within that world. Earthing has physiological benefits as well, such as allowing us to sleep better, and reducing chronic pain. Additionally, in our modern world we tend to sit a lot, in front of the computer, television, in the car, causing our bodies to accumulate energy, instead of using this energy. Gardening allows us to productively use the energy our body produces.\nFifthly, A home grown garden provides us with the entire 100% vitamin and mineral of its produce. All the nutrition and energy which the plant absorbed is available for us to eat! Produce purchased in the supermarket loses between 50-70% of its vitamins and minerals within 5-7 days of being harvested (by the time it arrives in the supermarket from the farm). There is also very little waste with a home garden. You can leave the produce in the garden until you are ready to prepare your meal! Oh, and the ultimate satisfaction of eating and sharing the foods that you yourself have produced is indescribable!\nSo now that our eyes are open, let's start making a beautiful garden. Come with me.\n\n\nIn this course, each of these six steps of creating and maintaining a vegetable garden are divided into 2 short lessons:\n1. Practical lesson in the garden: In these lessons we will observe the practical application of each stage, including important tips\n2. Theoretical lesson: In these lessons we will talk about the importance of the stage and go into further depth on the subject.",

Such as, for example, making stone paths, coating of wall surfaces with stone, restoration of old wells, making stone fences, as well as smaller, portable fountains. My name is Milan, I live and work in all areas of the former Yugoslavia, as well as the European Union. A friend recommended this place to me as the best for tutorials. In my demo video, as in the others, you can see seriousness and professionalism, both from me and from the person who edited the video material. The tutorial fully explains the making of the fountain. From choosing the site and materials for construction, marking, digging, installing insulation, masonry, installing pumps and lighting, as well as finishing works, such as painting. I hope that the students will be very satisfied with the course, because everything is very simplified. I wish you much success.",

They just have an entrance at each end or further entrances can be worked into the sides at different points, especially if it is a particularly long tunnel.\nDomes - (igloo like structures, which can have a single entrance or could have double entrances. facing each other.\nArbours- These are open fronted, curved areas of living willow that arch over the sitters head; generally these are constructed round benches or logs to provide shade.\nFedges - they are a combination between a fence and a hedge. They are living willow structures that can divide areas up and can be set at different heights. Like tunnels they can be set out in straight lines or curves. They are quite popular for making mazes.\nI will teach you how to lay out the set up and the tools and materials you will need, including how to use a template where that increases efficiency of installation.\nAs you progress through the course,  you will learn how to construct the frame that establishes the overall shape of the structure and then you will learn how to add the secondary layer or skin called the lattice. This gives the structure its profile shape and it is where the majority of growth occurs as the willow flourishes.\nYou will learn about the sizes of sticks needed for the frame and the lattice and the amount of material you need.\nYou will learn about the differences between cultivated and foraged willow, with some insights on coppicing  your own.\nYou will also learn about the maintenance that is needed to maintain and develop the integrity and beauty of your living willow structures.",

We have worked in industry, and as lecturers, and we are passionate about plants and horticulture, and sharing that knowledge.\nThis course is about identifying and using 10 easy to grow, commonly planted, robust evergreen shrubs. We will show you how you can use them either in a garden setting, or in the wider landscape, and sometimes where they should not be used too!\nIn the course, we discuss individual shrubs, their growing habits, important characteristics, and how you can use them to design or improve your garden.  We talk about the most suitable places to plant them as well as the different pruning and training methods that can be used for each plant. Each plant may have two or three different pruning or training methods depending on whether it is being used for hedging, as a stand-alone specimen or even a wall shrub.\nWe aim to give you confidence in identifying plants, and the knowledge you need to keep them looking healthy and vibrant in your garden, but most importantly we want to share with you how fascinating and diverse the world of plants can be. Kindling your enthusiasm for horticulture and building your knowledge is our goal!\nIt is an excellent starting point for anyone considering planting a new garden or is interested in learning more about garden design or horticulture as a new career.",

      "description": "Cameras and alarms are not enough to deter many criminals.\nHow can you know about other options, where to start, and what to do?\nThis one-hour online course will give you ideas on what to do.\nLearn to create a layered approach to home security, working from the inside out.\nSome home security companies use fear or anxiety to market to you or to try to sell you their product or service. For example, they'll try to convince you that the only thing you need to do is install an alarm in the house and a camera on the front porch, and then you'll be...somehow...protected.\nWell, that's not really true. Those things are valuable in their own way, but they have to be part of a much larger plan and philosophy you create to protect yourself.\nUnfortunately, crime is real, and it is rational to fear it. But we take a different approach. We want your knowledge and your wisdom to be the starting point. Not fear or anxiety. And that's why this course goes way beyond cameras and alarms.\nWe'll save you some time and research. We're going to cover a long list of things you could do to improve your security. And we'll break those things down into a series of complementary layers that are both flexible and overlapping.\nWe found over time this is the best way for most people to digest this information.\n- So, we'll start with what's inside your head, and we'll look at how you perceive security.\n- We'll talk about your daily habits and simple changes you could make...many of them at no cost.\n- Then we'll break the rest of your home down into layers, with options inside each layer.\nOur goal is to put you in a position to build your own plan—something that works for you—something that will address your concerns within your timeline and within your budget. We want you to know you don't have to live in fear. You have plenty of options when it comes to your home security. And in the end, no one takes better care of you than you.\nSo, when we looked at crime trends, we knew that we had something valuable to share with you. And we knew a lot of people would never have access to this kind of training or information. But we also quickly realized we couldn't meet face-to-face with everyone who needed our help. That's when we decided to create this course, put it online, and make it accessible to anyone who needs it at a significantly reduced cost.\nWe really hope you enroll in the course. We think you'll enjoy it. We think you'll find it useful.\nEmpower yourself with courage, competence, and confidence.\nHere's our guarantee:\nIf you get to the end of the course and feel like you didn't get any value from it, please email us and let us know.

For example, they'll try to convince you the only thing you need to do it install an alarm in the house and a camera on the front porch, and then you'll be \"protected.\"  Well, that's not really true. Those things are valuable in their own way, but they have to be part of a much larger plan and philosophy you create to protect yourself.",

Farming to produce food in a way is a very important activity to sustain humanity on  this earth because without food production all of us will not leave to this day. Basically a farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and crops, it is the basic facility in food production. Example of farm includes arable farm, vegetable farm fruit farm and poultry farm etc. The population of this world is growing so much that there is a very big responsibility on farmers especially commercial farmers to increase their output and help meet the increasing demand of the market so they can contribute to the current hunger that some of the countries are facing now. Subsistence farmers like me are also encourage to improve and expand their farms to help meet the demands of their locality.\nFarming have assumed a different dimension to the extend that its now very capital intensive, l edge leaders of the world to agree in principle and as a corrective measure to ensure that resources in terms of finance and machines are available to support the farmers so they can produce more and help stop the hunger in the world. Farmers need to be given free education across the world so that a lot of small farmers can become big farmer with little push which will help the world, agricultural professionals should be sent to farmers so they can help them go through their farming process effectively and efficiently. One of the challenges that many farmers face is the application of the fertilizer, some over do it and it affect the crops and even becomes a very big treat to human consumption.\nFarming is now a very serious business so farm owner must see it like that and ensure that their employees are well train so they can contribute to the success of the enterprise, because in a lot of situations some farmers employee cheap workers who are not skillful on the farming work, but at the end of the day it cost the farmers a lot in terms of productivity.",

      "description": "Permaculture is an approach to land management and settlement design that adopts arrangements observe in flourishing natural ecosystems. It includes a set of design principles derived using whole systems thinking. It applies these principles in fields such as regenerative agriculture, town planning, rewilding, and community resilience. Permaculture originally came from permanent agriculture, but was later adjusted to mean permanent culture, incorporating social aspects. The greater notion behind permaculture is that we all should use our natural resources including land in a more effective and productive way without destroying the land which will have greater implications for our generations yet unborn. The ethics of permaculture care for humanity and preaching the concept that we should all understand that  our environment is there to save us all because the environment has a very big role to play in our own well being. When we all understand and adopt permaculture practices and stop degrading the land and our environment it will help all of our generations to grow and eat a healthy food.\nThe world need food to avoid the hunger situations we are experiencing now, but you and l have a very big role to play to ensure that we all contribute. How we can design our front yard  to ensure that we use it for permaculture garden or farming is very important. First we all need money in other to plan a permaculture garden by getting the right nursery of seed which will give us a head start, we also need time and effort to ensure that we can maintain our front yard garden. Front yard garden cannot take the whole pathways we need to ensure that there is good walk way so that we can walk through easily, in designing this let make sure that we do not forget the permaculture principles. Planting permaculture herbs must be done in a professional way and also by selecting the best herbs for planting that will give us much benefits such as dandelion, yarrow and lemon balm etc.\nAll permaculture practitioners must ensure that they always use natural things in the preparation of their farm before planting such as the usage of green manures which are chemical free and can give good yields with no  side effects. The practice of permaculture should be apply in every aspects of our life to ensure a safe environment and a save society.  When the environment is well protected life is saved because poor environment has created a lot of challenges for mankind. A living wall is an arrangement of plants situated on a vertical facade. The outer garden of a tea garden serves as a pathwa to the inner garden.",

Made specifically to be understood with ease by practically anyone with basic English language. It was designed so that it is not intimidating and more motivational as much as its educational. It's designed with a focus on social systems at the forefront. Many famous guest teachers like Starhawk and Rosemary Morrow play a key role in helping make this a spectacular experience. I, Deva Presence, am most certain you will enjoy and learn a bunch!!! Give it a try and enjoy!\nThis course does not go into practicals for planting, building structures, water system, alternative energy or specific climatic factors or world regions. For this, I highly recommend doing a search for local permaculture experts in your area and volunteer your time. I spent 4 years volunteering my time, taking local wild plant walks, helping people build their homes and gardens, when I first started learning about permaculture. This is how I got the most valuable lessons and apply them in my life today.\nAs one of the founders Bill Mollison puts it, if you want to know about organic gardening or rain catchment or natural building, pick up one of the hundred books out there. I want to know where you are banking and how you invest your time and money. This is how we create the most impact in our world today.",

      "description": "Have you ever dreamed of turning your room into a living, fragrant \"greenhouse\" where every plant literally glows with health? Believe me, I know that you, with your subtle sense of beauty, have long wanted to create your own little paradise of ficus, orchids or juicy tomatoes on the windowsill. And here I, an expert in the field of plant growing, rush to help!\nWhat do people usually face in the field of plant growing?\nLack of confidence in your abilities. It may seem that without the intervention of magic power, all plants are doomed. But no! I am sure that the spark of a real gardener is already burning inside you, and you only need a little knowledge and inspiration to turn this spark into a real green fireworks!\nFear of not having enough time. Work, household chores and even trying to catch your breath at the end of the day - when is there time to take care of plants? However, it is your lifestyle that helps you choose the ideal model for caring for them.\nLimited knowledge. It’s hard to figure out which varieties to choose, how to provide the right light and watering. But you absorb information much faster if it’s given in a convenient format by a real expert.\nAll of this is solved by our course “Growing Plants at Home”, created especially for you under the guidance of a highly qualified specialist.\nWhat do I offer in the course?\nA deep understanding of the plant “soul”: I won’t just tell you how to water and fertilize — I’ll show you why the plant “wants to drink” right now, and what its roots “say” when you transplant them into a new pot.\nA scientific approach that’s understandable to everyone: yes, I study the science of plant life, but I explain everything in simple terms, without abstruse terms. You will instantly “feel” the logic of plant physiology — and this (I promise!) will be even more exciting than you thought.\nPersonalized life hacks: do you have a “southern” window and dry air? Or is it a baby cactus and you want it to bloom? Or do you grow basil in the kitchen, but it started to get depressed? I love finding solutions for specific conditions so that each of you can grow everything like in the tropics.\nClear step-by-step instructions for choosing and planting plants - forget about endless googling!\nConfidence in success: the program has been tested by me and my team (with over 10 years of experience) and it gives results after the first two weeks of classes.\nAnd I see that you are that very meticulous and attentive person for whom it is important to understand the processes \"from the inside\". After all, this is the only way to achieve truly stunning results!\nWhy should you start right now?\nMore greenery - more happiness: plants purify the air, calm the nerves and make any interior lively. It's great to wake up in the morning, look at your blooming \"family\" and recharge your mood for the whole day.\nSave time and nerves: with scientific understanding, you will no longer rush between “to water or not to water”, “to use this soil or to buy another one?”. Once you have mastered the principles, you act confidently.\nThe “wow” effect: friends, family and your clients will admire, as if you magically tamed the exotic jungle - and all because I will help you understand every nuance.\nSocial proof: 96% of our students note that a month after the start of the course, their plants look healthier and more active than ever.\nAfter all, you want to surprise not only with beauty, but also with deep knowledge of why your ficus grows twice as fast as your neighbor's. And I know that you definitely love such pleasant compliments!\nHow does it work?\nAnalysis of your situation: what is your lighting, humidity, what plants you already have or what you dream of getting.\nTraining and support: you will learn what, how and why.

Forget about panicking at the sight of a spot on a leaf: I will tell you how to tame aphids, overcome mold and help the plant survive the seasonal \"oh, I'm cold - hide it away\" or \"oh, I'm hot - water it\".

      "description": "La lombricultura es la práctica de criar lombrices para convertir residuos orgánicos en humus, un abono natural de alta calidad. Este proceso involucra la descomposición de materiales orgánicos por medio de lombrices, Estas lombrices ingieren materia orgánica y la transforman en vermicompost a través de su digestión, produciendo un producto rico en nutrientes beneficioso para el suelo y las plantas.\nAsí mismo, la importancia de la lombricultura para el medio ambiente radica en su capacidad para gestionar residuos orgánicos de manera eficiente y sostenible. Al reciclar restos de cocina, desechos de jardín y otros residuos biodegradables, la lombricultura ayuda a reducir la cantidad de basura que termina en los vertederos. Lo cual disminuye las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, como el metano, que contribuyen al cambio climático. Además, la producción de humus de lombriz mejora la estructura del suelo, aumenta su capacidad de retención de agua y promueve la biodiversidad microbiana, lo que resulta en suelos más saludables y productivos.\nPor otro lado, su función principal en la lombricultura es convertir residuos orgánicos en un abono altamente nutritivo que puede utilizarse en la agricultura y la jardinería. El humus de lombriz es conocido por contener nutrientes esenciales como nitrógeno, fósforo y potasio, así como microorganismos beneficiosos que mejoran la fertilidad del suelo y promueven el crecimiento saludable de las plantas. Además, este abono es libre de químicos, lo que lo convierte en una opción ecológica y segura para el medio ambiente.\nFinalmente, lo que se destaca de la lombricultura es su simplicidad y efectividad. No requiere tecnologías complejas ni grandes inversiones, lo que la hace accesible para individuos, comunidades y agricultores. Además, su capacidad para mejorar la calidad del suelo y aumentar la producción agrícola de manera sostenible la convierte en una práctica crucial en la lucha por un planeta más verde y saludable. Al promover el reciclaje de nutrientes y la reducción de residuos, la lombricultura representa una solución integral para enfrentar los desafíos ambientales actuales.",

To produce quality crops and maximum output, farmers use fertilizers, and pesticides to a great extent. With the help of an intensive production system farmers enhance the soil and crop quality. It is a method where a large number of crops are grown with intensive use of agrochemicals and other input strategies to a higher output. This farming technique that help increase the higher production from a specific land. Pasture intensification is a term for pasture soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems. This process is characterized by loss of forage because of overgrazing, poor nutrient management and lack of soil conservation. These adverse effects lead to the degradation of pasture soils which can decrease the water availability, and fertility and may increase the acidification. Deteriorate pastures may significantly lower productivity.\nPractices of intensive farming in some countries are sustainable, which is develop to stop degrading agricultural land and then regenerate soil health and ecosystem services also. These upgrades include the intensive and organic farming category, a combination of organic and traditional farming. It includes bio intensive farming, agroforestry, intercropping and vertical farming.",

Pour la germination, tu devras acheter des graines (environ 7 USD – 10 USD pour 100g) et un couvercle de germination (6 USD pour 4 couvercles) ou une étamine à fromage (environ 3 USD par rouleau). Pour la culture des pousses, tu devras acheter des graines (environ 7 USD – 10 USD pour 100g) et du terreau (environ 8 USD pour 7-8kg).

      "description": "Vineyards have become more and more popular in recent years, but growing grapes takes time and lots of practice if you are to manage your vines properly.  There are many steps involved to turn grapes into wine, and it all starts with the irrigation system.  Your new grapes are most sensitive to diseases and failure during their first months and having irrigation that works properly and reliably will make operating your vineyard much more manageable.  This Course is on how to design an efficient irrigation system, one that pays attention to detail and looks at all of the factors necessary when designing and laying out your system.\nQuestions such as \"What is your Soil Texture?\"  Different soils hold different amounts of water.  Moisture content will change, not just with texture but with depth.  What is your water source?  How many gallons (liters) per minute do you have available? and at what operating pressure?  The irrigation is a critical part of growing grapes and making wine.  In many climates, without proper irrigation your grapes will die or be more susceptible to diseases that can ruin your vineyard.\nBeyond irrigation, knowing how to manage your vines is another critical part of having a successful vineyard and crop.  Our homeowner, who is also the vineyard manager, will be explaining her methods  in tending the vines throughout the season and up until harvest.\nThis Course will cover all of these topics and more, in a straight-forward, easy to understand manner accessible to anyone who wants to better manage their new or existing grapevines.\nThanks for joining Marc and I as we as we guide you through the steps to successfully manage and care for your small vineyard!\nRob Littlepage\nMarc Denzin",

Trae ispirazione dalla natura per progettare sistemi produttivi che hanno la diversità, la stabilità e la resilienza degli ecosistemi naturali. A qualsiasi scala e in ogni ambito: un balcone, un orto, un’azienda agricola, una comunità di persone…\nSi basa sul collegamento di varie discipline, strategie e tecniche, sulle connessioni funzionali fra tutte le cose: è l’arte di tessere relazioni utili.\nCon questo corso ti introdurrò in un mondo affascinante. Te ne spiegherò in modo semplice e sintetico la cornice concettuale, le basi teoriche e gli ambiti d’applicazione. Scoprirai che la permacultura non è un metodo per coltivare l’orto, come molti immaginano, ma piuttosto una filosofia di vita. Perciò non ti mostrerò una serie di tecniche, bensì l’approccio progettuale per arrivare ad applicare una tecnica adatta al contesto.\nLa permacultura insegna a diventare ogni giorno agenti del cambiamento, iniziando dalla porta di casa. E probabilmente anche tu, quando l’avrai capito, non vorrai più tornare indietro. Vorrai approfondire, prenderti la tua responsabilità e trovare il tuo posto nel mondo per costruire una società più sostenibile, superando il senso di separazione da Madre Terra e dagli altri esseri umani che ci ha portato alla crisi globale.

      "description": "Feng Shui Certification Course\nThis Feng Shui Certification Course is your complete guide to understanding and applying Feng Shui in everyday life. Designed for beginners and holistic enthusiasts alike, the course introduces you to the ancient Chinese practice of Feng Shui, the art of arranging your environment to harmonize with natural energy flow. Whether you're seeking peace, better relationships, financial success, or health, Feng Shui gives you the tools to shift your space and energy with intention.\nThe course begins with the fundamentals of Feng Shui, explaining what Chi that is life-force energy is and how it interacts with your home or workspace. You will learn how energy flows through spaces and how blocked or stagnant energy can affect your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. This understanding lays the foundation for deeper work with Feng Shui principles throughout the course.\nYou will be introduced to one of the most important concepts in Feng Shui: the Five Elements Theory that are Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. Each element has its own energy, color, shape, and emotional quality. You will learn how these elements affect different areas of life and how to balance them in your home to enhance harmony and vitality. The course explains how to identify which element may be missing or excessive in a space and how to correct it using simple techniques. Another powerful tool covered in this Feng Shui course is the Bagua Map—a symbolic layout that divides any space into nine life areas: career, relationships, wealth, health, family, creativity, helpful people, knowledge, and fame. You’ll learn how to overlay the Bagua Map onto your home and how to activate and balance each of these areas to attract positive outcomes in your life.\nThe course takes a room-by-room approach to applying Feng Shui in practical ways. You'll explore how to create balance in your bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom, and home entrance. You'll also learn how to set up your workspace using Feng Shui to enhance focus, creativity, and success. These practical lessons include color suggestions, object placement, and what to avoid in each space. You will also learn about Feng Shui remedies which are powerful tools like mirrors, crystals, wind chimes, water features, plants, and lighting. Each of these items can be used to correct energy imbalances or enhance certain aspects of your life. The course teaches you how and where to place these remedies for maximum energetic benefit, making Feng Shui easy to apply even in small spaces.\nOne of the most important parts of this Feng Shui course is understanding the emotional and spiritual connection between your space and your inner self. You'll discover how clutter holds back energy, how past emotions can get stuck in furniture or objects, and how intention-setting is a key part of using Feng Shui effectively. You will also explore how Feng Shui can support your healing journey and spiritual growth.\nThis Feng Shui course is ideal not only for personal transformation but also for professional use. If you’re a Reiki healer, life coach, energy worker, or interior designer, this Feng Shui certification adds a valuable dimension to your offerings. You'll gain the skills to perform Feng Shui evaluations for clients and recommend personalized adjustments to shift energy in their homes and lives.\nWith easy-to-follow video lessons, downloadable resources, printable Bagua maps, and real-life examples, this course ensures you gain both knowledge and confidence. You’ll complete simple exercises to assess your own space and make changes right away. Plus, lifetime access allows you to revisit the material anytime you want to refresh your understanding or help someone else.\nAfter completing the course, you’ll receive your Feng Shui Course Completion Certification, recognizing you as a Feng Shui Practitioner. More than just a certificate, this symbolizes your understanding of one of the most powerful and time-tested energy practices in the world. Whether you use it for personal growth or to support others, Feng Shui will give you a new lens through which to view space, energy, and life itself.",

The significance of all this technology is to enhance farming so that, there will be more productivity, which will intend led to more profitability.Precision agriculture has also been enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles that are relatively inexpensive and can be operated by novice pilots. These agriculture drones can be equipped with multispectral or RGB cameras to capture many images of a field that can be stitched together using photogrammetric methods to create orthophotos. Geolocating a field enables the farmer to overlay information gathered from analysis of soils and residual nitrogen, and information on previous crops and soil resistivity.\nRemote sensing technologies provide a diagnostic tool that has at least two important functions as well as many other uses in site-specific management of crops. Remote sensing can be used to measure reflectance of light energy from crop canopy, which may be useful in detecting plant stress while there is still time to correct the problem. Yield monitors are an essential component of many site specific management strategies. Yield maps, the visual and numerical product of yield monitors, encourage creative investigation and can provide reliable answers to carefully performed  on-farm experiments.",

He is a world-class survival instructor, published writer, TV host, and legend on “Discovery Channels “Naked and Afraid”.\nWe are living in uncertain times. We are struck with emergencies and massive natural disasters and thrown into survival mode at an alarming rate these days. We have had Pandemics, Wildfires, Economic Turmoil, Food Shortage Threats, Energy Strains, and even War. You and your loved ones have been put in a serious life survival situation that you have no control over…. But actually, YOU DO!!!\nSo, what is the average Joe or Joan supposed to do, you ask? You always hear that YOU MUST “BUGOUT” when SHTF, BUT in Reality….90% of humans on the planet aren’t Bugging anywhere…as the COVID Pandemic showed us…THEY ARE “BUGGING IN”! And the 10% that are left, 5% are “Bugging Out” are only going somewhere else to “Bug-in,” and the other 5% are the ones with the skills, knowledge, and determination to stay out in the Wild and Truly “Bug Out.”\nSo again, what should the average Joe or Joan do with their loved ones? Easy, I have put together this film, the “Ultimate Bug-In and Home Defense”, to answer those questions, provide you with the information and tools needed, and show you how to properly prepare for “Bugging In” and the Defense of YOUR Domicile.\nIn this film, we will talk about everything you need to prepare and plan for when the SHTF properly!!!

We will discuss everything from what to do to get from, say, your office, school, store, park, or wherever you are when SHTF to get from their back to your vehicle safely so that you can then head towards your home if you need the vehicle to cover a long distance then if you can or have to get there on foot what to do to make it there safely.\nWhat items can you have on you and plan for that will make your move easier and safer, what supplies you will need, and all things covering your basic survival and protection. How to plan routes and cache stops along the way to refit, resupply, and rest, as well as what security needs you need to be concerned with.\nNow once you get home, how do you DEFEND YOUR HOME! Mostly done prior to the SHTF Scenario even happens, now you just need to put your well-planned plan and practice into play and execute! If done RIGHT, you will feel a lot more confident, reassured, safe, and ready for whatever comes your way!\nOnce in your home, you don’t assume trouble won’t come looking for you and let your Guard down…that is when you go full on and BE READY!!! You make the potential Bad Actors understand that YOU ARE NOT EASY PREY!!! And 90% of the time, they “GO AWAY”! Then if you must go, what is it you need in terms of your “BUGOUT VEHICLE” and possible trailers and/or RVs, etc., to be able to move everyone with you safely and with all you need!\nThe “Ultimate Bug-In and Home Defense” Film is just the ANSWER YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR to Prepare for that Bad Day ahead!!!

Io trovo sempre utile avere nuove prese in casa, perché avere tante prese servono sempre in qualsiasi stanza. Un modo originale sostituire una scatola del telefono abbandonata o che non funziona più.\nGuida dettagliata passo passo. Per principianti.\nMolti progetti di ristrutturazione di una casa richiedono la scelta opportuna dei tubi elettrici. Io ti insegno le differenze fra i tubi elettrici, partendo dal diametro (caratteristica fondamentale). Poi ti mostro i nuovi tubi elettrici che contengono il tirafilo incorporato (davvero utile per risparmiare tempo e tirare i fili elettrici senza usare una \"guida passacavi\" da elettricisti).\nDevo scavare la traccia elettrica nel muro per unire due scatole elettriche distanti fra loro (di circa 1,5 metri). Una operazione facile, ma diventa molto difficile quando devi rompere un pilastro in cemento armato! Passare un tubo corrugato da 16mm mi sembra la soluzione migliore per non creare danni strutturali al pilastro (che comunque bisogna romperlo per far passare il tubo elettrico). Non consiglio di usare tubi elettrici di diametro molto grande quando c'è un pilatro che ti ostacola. Per scavare rapidamente nel pilastro, io uso un martello elettrico scalpellatore.\nUn consiglio: Usa una punta a CUCCHIAIO per scavare delle traccie perfettamente rotonde!\nQuando ristrutturri una casa devi rifare l'impianto elettrico e hai bisogno di aggiungere o sostituire vecchie scatole elettriche. Vedi le differenze principali tra le varie scatole elettriche di oggi rispetto al modello vecchio. Una mini guida utile sia per elettricisti che per muratori.\nISCRIVITI al corso adesso e imparerai passo passo cosa fare!",

Part of the fun of developing 'green fingers' is simply having a go, with the added satisfaction of tasting fruit from plants you have nurtured.\nAs the great chef Gino D'Acampo passionately believes, the goal should be \"Minimum effort, maximum satisfaction!\"\nTo that end, this course covers the following 8 different types of Soft Fruits:\n1). Blueberries\n2). Blackberries, Loganberries and Tayberries\n3). Strawberries\n4). Gooseberries\n5). Raspberries\n6). Blackcurrants\n7). Redcurrants and Whitecurrants\n8). Figs\nWhere possible, my approach is to promote organic growing methods. Once you've tasted the flavour and nutritional health benefits of your own organic soft fruits, you'll never want to buy them in the shops again!\nSome background about the author:\nBrian Matthews has been a professional gardener with over 20 years gardening experience, for both public and private clients.

The improvement in agriculture is very great, currently the world is facing challenges that part of the solution may come from effective and efficient agricultural. The rapid growth of the world population is a very great sign that everybody need to be involved in the agricultural business so that we all can feed the increase people and save more food for future food shortages. Now technology is a key answer to the world food challenges, technological development and advancement has increase but you will agree with me in principle that, this development is more in developed countries whilst developing countries are struggling to achieve technological development in agriculture.\nResearch has shown that technological irrigation can greatly improve productivity and also help increase yield which will help a lot of farmers gain profitability, but the great question we all as farmers must ask is how many farmers can afford this technology?, obviously few of them, this make a lot of farmers suffer because of poor financial assistance. l will suggest to some farmers that they should form groups or associations so that they can buy some of this new technological tools and rotate them for better farming. When you look currently on the improvement in information communication technology its a great way to enhance farming but how many farmers have assess to even a mere mobile phone. l think the world must listen to farmers voice so that organization like United Nations will come in to assist farmers who are in dire need of this technological farming tools to aid their farming, there are some places even ordinary tractors can boost productivity in their farming.\nThe use of digital agriculture, precision agriculture and blockchain technology is some of the great panacea to improve the total agricultural sector but we need to look at it carefully are this development available every where  to assist every farmer in each continent.",

      "description": "Up to Date as at:  January 2020.\nShipping Container Homes in 2020, why or why not?\nDo's and Don'ts When Building a Shipping Container Home.\nLearn the things to avoid and the things you must do when building your own shipping container home. You will save a lot of sleepless nights, time and money by just planning your building process better.\nYou can save more than $500 on your building project by applying the information covered in this course.\nWhy should you look into this course?\nOver the last 10 years, an idea evolved to use stockpiled shipping containers as modular units for building office space as well as domestic homes. Because these empty hefty steel boxes are piling up in ports around the world and posing a storage problem. Since 2005 several architects and builders are taking advantage of this surplus to recycle the containers.\nLooking at a container has 2 metric tons of steel which will take 8000 kwh of energy to melt down and make new beams. The process of modifying that entire 2 metric tons of steel into a higher and better use domestic home only takes 400 kwh of electrical energy (or 5%). This takes a bit more muscle and planning but we feel is that next step up for better Re-cycling.\nEach long container measures 2.4 m wide by 12 m long by 2.5 m tall. Depending on the quality of a used shipping container, it could set you back anything from $2,000 - $10,000 per container.\nAccording to structural engineers, these units are stronger than conventional house framing because of their resistance to \"lateral loads\" -- those seen in hurricanes and earthquakes -- and because steel is basically welded to steel. The roof is strong enough to support the extra weight of a green roof - which has vegetation growing on it - if the owner should want it.\nAs for their energy efficiency, they claim that when the appropriate coatings are installed, the envelope reflects about 95 percent of outside radiation, resists the loss of interior heat, provides an excellent air infiltration barrier and does not allow water to migrate in.\nWhen applying a standard exterior siding to a house, the finished house is virtually indistinguishable from conventional housing.",

Bu nedenle, hangi cinsiyetten, yaştan veya coğrafyadan olursanız olun, bu kurstaki bilgileri yılların bilgi birikimi ile öğrenmek artık esastır.\nBotanik bahçesi veya botanik bahçesi[nb 1], botanik isimleriyle etiketlenmiş çok çeşitli bitkilerin toplanması, yetiştirilmesi, korunması ve sergilenmesine adanmış bir bahçedir. Kaktüsler ve diğer sulu bitkiler, bitki bahçeleri, dünyanın belirli bölgelerinden gelen bitkiler gibi özel bitki koleksiyonlarını içerebilir; yine tropik bitkiler, alpin bitkiler veya diğer egzotik bitkiler gibi özel koleksiyonlara sahip seralar, gölgelikler olabilir.\nBotanik bahçesindeki ziyaretçi hizmetleri, turları, eğitim gösterilerini, sanat sergilerini, kitap odalarını, açık hava tiyatro ve müzik performanslarını ve diğer eğlenceleri içerebilir. Botanik bahçeleri genellikle üniversiteler veya diğer bilimsel araştırma kuruluşları tarafından yürütülür ve genellikle bitki taksonomisi veya botanik biliminin başka bir yönü ile ilgili bitki ve araştırma programlarına sahiptir. Prensipte, görevleri, mevcut kaynaklara ve her bir bahçede izlenen özel ilgi alanlarına bağlı olmasına rağmen, bilimsel araştırma, koruma, sergileme ve eğitim amacıyla belgelenmiş canlı bitki koleksiyonlarını sürdürmektir. Modern botanik bahçelerinin kökeni genellikle 16. yüzyıl Rönesans İtalya'sında üniversitelerin tıp fakültelerine botanik profesörlerinin atanmasıyla izlenir ve bu da bir tıbbi bahçenin küratörlüğünü de gerektirir. Bununla birlikte, günümüz botanik bahçelerinin amaçları, içeriği ve izleyicileri, antik çağın görkemli bahçelerine ve antik Atina Lisesi'ndeki Theophrastus'un eğitici bahçesine daha çok benzemektedir.\nTıbbi bitkilerle ilgili ilk ilgi, 17. yüzyılda botanik yavaş yavaş tıptan bağımsızlığını kazandığı için Avrupa dışındaki keşiflerden yeni bitki ithalatına olan ilgiye dönüştü. 18. yüzyılda, isimlendirme ve sınıflandırma sistemleri, bahçelerle ilişkili herbaria ve üniversitelerde çalışan botanikçiler tarafından tasarlandı, bu sistemler genellikle bahçelerde eğitici \"düzen yatakları\" olarak sergilendi. 18. yüzyılın sonlarında Avrupa kolonilerinin dünya çapında hızla genişlemesiyle, tropik bölgelerde botanik bahçeleri kuruldu ve Londra yakınlarındaki Kew Kraliyet Botanik Bahçeleri'ndeki merkez ile ekonomik botanik odak noktası haline geldi.\nBu kursta, çok değerli ve size bitki bilimini çok sevdirecek bilgiler bulacaksınız.\nBu kursta sunulan bilgiler sürekli güncellenmektedir. Alacağınız Udemy sertifikasının size hayatınızda ve kariyerinizde, kendinizi geliştirmesinin yanında çok fırsatlar sunacağını biliyoruz. Bu kurstaki bilgilerin öğretmenleriniz, akademisyenlerimiz ve uzman teknik ekibimizce sürekli olarak eklenerek derslerin arttırılması, sık aralıklarla kursunuzu kontrol etmenizi gerektirir.

      "description": "Parenting 101 is an alphabetically indexed collection of topics on the subject of raising children. The author covers a range of subjects of interest to parents of children of all ages. In a conversational tone infused with illustrative personal anecdotes, she discusses problem areas, metes out some helpful advice, and shares some of her personal thoughts on various parenting practices and trends.\nSome of the subjects she covers are how to put an end to whining, teaching kids about money and finances, best discipline practices, and even advice on transitioning into parenting adult children. Although there are some words of warning, primarily the course is positive and upbeat as it steers the reader through and around common pitfalls in childrearing and gives encouragement along the way. The reader will not only enjoy, but will also relate to the humorous and sometimes slightly self-effacing stories the author shares.\nMuch of the material will seem like common sense that bears repeating, and some of it maybe some new food for thought for the parent who is searching for answers. The course is designed to help parents maneuver through the parenting process without losing their minds, but the primary goal is to help them raise happy, well-adjusted children to become successful, responsible, and mature adults. Happy reading!\n\n\nAbout the Expert\nMelanie Miller is a high school English teacher and the mother of 3 adult children. She has long said that she has had enough experiences with children and enough stories to fill a course, so that is exactly what she has done! She has learned a lot about kids over the years and has some great stories and helpful advice to share.\nHer greatest achievement, Melanie claims, is that she has managed to raise 3 human beings to successful and self-supporting adulthood without losing her mind in the process or causing any permanent damage to her kids. If you would like to hear how she did that, then this course is for you.\nMelanie’s other interests are reading, freelance writing, trying out new restaurants, and lounging around with her three dogs and cat with which she has filled her nest so it doesn’t feel quite so empty.",

Digital farming enables the consistent application of  methods of precision farming and smart farming, internal and external networking of the farm and used of web based data platforms together with big data analyses. Digital farming gives farmers access to timely valuable insights so that they can adopt best practices and manage farms more efficiently thus reducing losses and maximizing profits. Digital farming relies on having reliable high-speed internet connections, satellite imagery and mobile devices. This is because while digital agriculture is as nature as traditional farming, it fundamental relies on collecting, storing and analyzing data.\nPrecision farming has only really developed at speed thanks to these broader technological developments that have allowed farming equipment to become more accurate and optimized for specific agriculture uses. As communication technology has progressed, farmers have increase production, maximized yields, reduce waste, cared for the environment, cut manual labor  and eliminated unnecessary risk without acquiring new land of diversifying. Farmers no longer make as many decisions as they previously used to, now data and software make decisions, the farmers simply carry them out. Connectivity is key in massive internet of things, lower power network and cheaper sensors will set the stage for the internet of things to scale up, enabling such use cases as precision irrigation of field crops, monitoring of large herds of livestock, and trucking of the use and performance of remote buildings and large fleets of machinery.

No matter how much space, time or money you have, you can easily put a few seeds in some soil, sprinkle them with water and away you go. In this course, I’m going to go through five vegetables (well, technically some vegetables and one fruit), and show you how simple it is to grow your own lettuces, radishes, peas, tomatoes, carrots potatoes and beetroot.\nI’ll also include some hints and tips to help you on your way.\nHerbs are a great way to add vibrant flavours and texture to any meal, and growing them is really simple. There’s nothing quite as nice as harvesting your own herbs and using them fresh from the garden.\nIn this course, I’m going to go through five herbs that you can grow at home hassle free. I’ll be explaining how to grow the herbs from seeds, how to care for the adult plants and most importantly how to harvest them.\n\n\nWith this bonus course, you will learn to build your very own stackable vegetable planter.\nThis project is perfect for you if you would like to grow your own vegetables and herbs.\nThe basic design is a single-layered square planter with no base, and you can build as may of these as you like to so that you create taller planter for vegetables that have a deeper root system. You can also place them side by side for an allotment-style arrangement.",

Starting with conventional farm-sourced materials plus the addition of biodynamic preps and minerals it usually requires turning once. It is then covered and left to ‘do its own thing’ while heat and the fermentation process along with the worms ‘ clean’ up the materials producing a compost rich in a broad spectrum of microbes and plant available minerals.\nThis course will show how to build compost in static piles, in cowpat pits, and then how to prepare the sprays and to broadcast them by hand. Watch and listen as Hamish starts from scratch and invites participants to build the compost pile with him.\nHamish McKay, a biodynamics educator, gave a brief insight into the wonders of biodynamics and its practical contribution to farming. He pointed out that for little output biodynamic preparations could be made or purchased and these were used by both farmers and gardeners with outstanding results.\nBiodynamics has much in common with other organic approaches – it emphasizes the use of manures and composts and excludes the use of synthetic (artificial) fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides on soil and plants. Methods unique to the biodynamic approach include its treatment of animals, crops, and soil as a single system, an emphasis from its beginnings on local production and distribution systems, its use of traditional and development of new local breeds and varieties.",

That’s why we created this course, in conjunction with Woodworkers Guild of America. We’ll demystify finishes that are common in the marketplace, help you understand which finish is best for your projects, and provide great preparation and application tips that will help you achieve a better finish.\nTHE FINISHING PRODUCTS\nIn this course Woodworkers Guild of America Instructor George Vondriska intentionally chose to use finishing products that are readily available at home centers. No exotic finishes or obscure techniques, you’ll find that the approach taken in this course is very mainstream. That makes it accessible, and makes it easier for you to realize success with your finishing processes. With the wide array of products and application tips shown in this course, you’re sure to find a few that work with your projects, your shop, and your approach to woodworking.\nTECHNIQUES\nThis course concentrates on techniques that will be easy for you to use. Cotton rags, cheese cloth, home center off-the-shelf brushes, aerosol finish… It’s how you use these items that is most important, and we’re here to teach you. With our application techniques in hand you’ll be more confident about choosing stains and top coats, and finding the best application method for each.\nOUR CHEAT SHEET\nIn addition to the information provided through video in the course, we’re providing a printable Class Guide that includes information about the major advantages and disadvantages of a variety of stains and top coats. You’ll find this very helpful as you decide which finishes to use, and create your finish shopping list.\nIn addition to the hands-on video instruction you’ll receive, this class provides you with some downloadable resources and helpful information to print and keep, including the detailed Class Guide mentioned above as a recap of the key points of the class instruction and a resources document that will give you information on the products you’ll see in the course.",

Horticulturist are agriculturist who grow flowers, fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs as well as ornamental trees and lawns. When you look at the temperature regions, temperate zones for horticulture cannot be defined exactly by lines of latitude or longitude bust are usually regarded as including those areas where frost in winter occurs, even though rarely.Thus most parts of Europe, North America, and northern Asia are included, though some parts of the United States, such as southern Florida, are considered subtropical. Propagation, the controlled perpetuation of plants, is the most basic of horticultural practices. Its two objective are to achieve an increase in numbers and to preserve  the essential characteristics of plant. Propagation can be achieved sexually by seed or asexually by utilizing specialized vegetative structure or by employing such techniques as cutting, layering, grafting and tissue culture. The most common method of propagation for self-pollinated plants is by seed. In self-pollinated plants, the sperm nuclei in pollen produce by a flower fertilize egg cells of a flower on the same plant.\nPlant breeding, the systematic improvement of plants through the application of genetic principles, has placed improvement of horticulture plants on a scientific basis.",

This floor plan is a map that will guide you to the area of the home that we will be discussing. We invite you to sit in this area of your home during our class so you may make notes of how you might want to adjust the space right away with the Feng Shui cures you will learn. If you do not have a floor plan, draw one on a full piece of paper. It does not have to be to scale but should be relatively proportionate.\nWith an accurate understanding of the Feng Shui Bagua, and specific information about this area in your home and office, you may bring in more business, create a better team, move into a better job, find loyal supporters for your art, find that agent who will publish your book, create support for moms in the home and so much more.\nYou may compare Feng Shui for your environment, to acupuncture for your body. When life energy is blocked in the body, it may cause illness. When that energy is released and blood once again flows freely, there is health and vitality.\nWhen there is blocked energy in your environment, you may feel stuck in your career, depleted in your health, or angry about your life circumstance. When the \"chi\" in your home and office is open and flowing, you create a space where you may gracefully share your purpose with the world, from a state of health and vitality.\nWhile you have access to this class forever, we highly encourage note taking and invite you to start a discussion and/or ask us questions; we are both available to answer emails and contribute more information.",

      "description": "Aujourd'hui, en raison de la croissance rapide de la population, de l'augmentation des besoins alimentaires, de l'urbanisation et du changement climatique, la superficie des terres agricoles diminue rapidement et nos lacs et océans sont surexploités. Pour répondre à la demande alimentaire future, il est nécessaire de mettre au point des techniques de production alimentaire innovantes, écologiques et peu encombrantes. L'aquaponie est une polyculture qui intègre l'aquaculture et l’hydroponie ; son objectif principal est de réutiliser les nutriments contenus dans les aliments et les excréments des poissons pour faire pousser des légumes, et de recycler l'eau. Ce cours propose une approche aquaponique low-tech particulièrement adaptée aux pays en voie de développement. Après avoir suivi cette formation, les participants sauront comment construire, gérer et exploiter différents types de systèmes aquaponiques.

      "description": "Subsistence farming occurs when farmers grow crops to meet the needs of themselves and their families on smallholdings. Subsistence agriculturalists target farm output for survival and for mostly local requirements. Planting decisions occur principally with an eye toward what the family will need during the coming year, and only secondarily toward market prices. Despite the self-sufficiency in subsistence farming, most subsistence farmers also participate in trade to some degree. Although their amount of trade as measured in cash is less than that of consumers in countries with modern complex markets, they use these markets mainly to obtain goods, not to generate income for food: these goods are typically not necessary for survival and may include sugar, iron roofing-sheets, bicycles, used clothing, and so forth.\nAll cultures need ways to produce goods and distribute them for consumption. This is the essence of an economic system. The forms these takes vary across the globe and make involve with family or non-family. It may involve work from the home or it may be corporation. Some economic systems support the independence of families while others result in a greater, albeit oft unacknowledged, interdependence. Most people like to grow plants that look good as well as some that taste good. But when you're doing survival garden, your goal is literally to survive. Every plant in your garden should have a sue that reflects that goal.",

      "description": "The Satyanarayana Pooja is one of the most revered and auspicious Hindu rituals, performed to seek the blessings of Lord Satyanarayana – a form of Lord Vishnu, the preserver and protector of the universe. This sacred pooja is believed to bring peace, prosperity, and happiness to one’s life while removing obstacles and fulfilling wishes. Traditionally performed on full moon days, special occasions, or before embarking on important life events, this ritual is simple yet spiritually powerful.\nIn this course, you will learn the complete process of performing the Satyanarayana Pooja – from preparation to conclusion – in a clear, step-by-step manner. Whether you are a beginner with no prior knowledge of Hindu rituals or someone familiar with pooja traditions looking to deepen your understanding, this course will guide you with devotion and precision.\nWe will begin by exploring the significance and history of the pooja, understanding why it is performed, and the spiritual benefits it brings. You will then learn about the required materials, how to arrange them, and how to prepare your space for the ceremony.\nThe course will walk you through the ritual sequence – including Ganapati Pooja, Kalasha Sthapana, offering prayers to the Navagrahas (nine planetary deities), chanting of mantras, recitation of the sacred Satyanarayana Katha, offering naivedyam (food), and performing aarti. You will also learn the meaning and correct pronunciation of the important mantras so you can perform them with faith and confidence.\nSpecial attention will be given to understanding the Satyanarayana Katha – the five chapters of stories that convey the moral values and blessings associated with the pooja. By learning these, you will not only perform the ritual correctly but also connect with the deep spiritual wisdom it carries.\nBy the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and confidence to:\nPerform the Satyanarayana Pooja independently at home.\nLead or assist in community pooja ceremonies.\nTeach others the correct method and meaning of the ritual.\nIncorporate devotion, purity, and discipline into your spiritual practice.\nThis course is beginner-friendly and does not require prior experience. All you need is a willingness to learn and a respectful, devotional mindset.

To start with, plants are not the cheapest things in the world, and if you don’t know what you’re doing with them, buying plants can become a large expense – especially if you end up killing them! Secondly, when you buy a plant it looks one way, but after a few weeks or months of growing, it can either grow completely out of control or, worse, it can die.\nOver the years, after a lot of trial and error, I have learnt a lot about which plants to buy at which times of year, and how to care for them so that you end up with a beautiful floral display throughout the year.\nThis is a course to give you some ideas about simple, easy to care for plants and grass care that will make your garden into the envy of your neighbourhood and won’t require hours and hours of hard work.\n\n\n5 succulents for beginners and how to take care of them\nThere is one collection of houseplants that are very easy to look after called succulents.

You’ll notice that their leaves are much thicker than other plants, and they are native to deserts and very dry areas.\nSucculents are so varied that there is something for everybody no matter what your taste. Plus, studies have been done showing that not only are houseplants, including succulents, visually beautiful, but they’re also good for your health!

But life can get busy, and I often don't have enough time to do much in the garden. I can quickly feel overwhelmed and behind, dreading the long hours of maintenance, resulting in ignoring the landscape entirely. The garden suffers from it. I see many others who struggle to know what to do when they are short on time to maintain the landscape. If you feel the same way, this course is for you.\nThis is a quick guide offering an efficient approach to landscape maintenance. It’s perfect for those with busy lives who are short on time and might have fallen behind with normal yard work. You will learn how to prioritize maintenance tasks to gradually get a handle on things and not feel daunted working in the garden.\nThis course will help you to:\n\n\nLearn how to maintain your landscape when you feel overwhelmed\nPrioritize garden tasks to make the greatest impact in the time you have\nLearn what projects will make the most impact on decreasing maintenance load\nMaintain your garden in a less stressful way\nIf you have a landscape or garden to maintain, this is for you. It's great for beginners to gardening, those not interested in gardening but still have a landscape to maintain, and anyone who simply feels like they need a starting point for landscape maintenance.\nThe course is outlined with seven steps, arranged by priority level. As you complete the seven steps in your garden, you will be able to transform any overgrown yard into a beautiful landscape. Learn how to enjoy yardwork, and turn it into gardening.",

We will start with the important components on the exterior. The attic and crawlspace will be addressed. We will also teach you what to look for on the interior. Last but not least, we will talk about one of the most important concerns in a home, IAQ (Indoor Air Quality).\nWe will give you a clear explanation as to the important areas you should pay special attention to. Performing a thorough inspection starts with the proper process. Once the course has been completed, you should be able to walk through a potential home purchase and recognize defects that may affect your decision to put an offer in on a home that is defective.\nBy no means is this course a replacement for a professional home inspection. Every home inspector does things differently, I give you the perspective from a very successful inspector that pays attention to the important details during a home inspection. Home inspectors are expensive and you may not have the time to hire one before you place an offer on a home.\nWhy pay a professional $400 to find out you want to back out of the contract?

      "description": "Aeroponics is the process of cultivating plants in an air or mist environment, eliminating the need for soil or an aggregate medium. It is very important to note that, the fundamental principle of aeroponic growing entails suspending plants in a closed or semi-closed environment while spraying their dangling roots and lower stems with a nutrient- rich water solution in an atomized or sprayed form. Due to sensitivity of root systems, aeroponics is often combined with conventional hydroponics. This serves as a backup nutrition and water supply in case of any failure in the aeroponic system, acting as an emergency crop saver. Air cultures maximize air exposure to facilitate optimal plant growth.\nThe materials and device used to hold and support aeroponically grown plants must be completely free from disease or pathogens. Adequate oxygen availability in the root zone is essential for promoting healthy plant growth. In aeroponics, where plants are grow in an environment of air and micro-droplet of water, almost any plant can thrive and reach maturity with an abundant supply of oxygen, water, and nutrient. The high pressure aeroponics techniques, which employ mist generation through high-pressure pumps are commonly employed in the cultivation of high-value crops and plant specimens. The commercial aeroponic systems comprise high-pressure device hardware along with biological systems.",

      "description": "Aquaponics is a sustainable method of raising both fish and vegetables. It is popular with individuals, entrepreneurs, educators, missions and governments. With this type of indoor farming, you grow substantially more food with less water, land and labor than traditional agriculture.\nAquaponics is a farming system that uses water, fish, and plants to maximize growing space, water, and fertilization.\nIn this course you will learn all about aquaponics and how to set up and maintain a flourishing aquaponics operation firsthand.\nWe will first start out with the basics of aquaponics and how it works. We'll get into how to manage the fish and the plants. After that, we'll get into more in-depth topics such as managing your aquaponics systems. Along the way we'll go over many important tips.\nAquaponics is putting fish to work. It just so happens that the work those fish do (eating and producing waste), is the perfect fertilizer for growing plants.\nOne of the more interesting things about Aquaponics is that it mimics a natural ecosystem. Aquaponics represents the relationship between water, aquatic life, bacteria, nutrient dynamics, and plants which grow together in waterways all over the world. Taking cues from nature, aquaponics harnesses the power of bio-integrating these individual components: Exchanging the waste by-product from the fish as a food for the bacteria, to be converted into a perfect fertilizer for the plants, to return the water in a clean and safe form to the fish. Just like mother nature does in every aquatic ecosystem.\nIf you are serious about growing food through your own aquaponics system and want the opportunity to learn in-depth professional training, this course is for you. By the completion of this course, you will be able to design, build, and operate an aquaponics system for personal, education, or commercial use.",

      "description": "This course is designed for people that believe they may have a mold concern. You may be sick all the time and you don't know what's causing it. You could spend thousands of dollars for testing and inspections, just to find out that there isn't a mold concern inside your property. There are many steps a homeowner can take to find out if there is a major mold problem or if it's something they can take care of on their own. I will walk you through the proper steps to get to the bottom of a mold concern.\nWe will start with the exterior of the home and then make our way through the entire inspection. We will talk about the crawlspace, attic, basements, mechanical room, living areas, bathrooms and bedrooms. We will explain the different types of mold testing and when you should utilize certain steps. Toxic mold isn't the only environmental and IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) concern you need to address inside your property. We will talk about Radon, Termites and VOC's (Volatile Organic Compounds).\nMost mitigation companies will tell you there's a major concern so that they can charge you thousands of dollars to mitigate. You will learn how to do your own mold testing, which can be done for less than $100. If you've ever paid a mold specialist like myself, you know that it can get expensive quickly. This course could save you thousands of dollars on a problem that isn't a major concern. This course may be something that addresses the fact that you've been sick for a long time and your doctor can't get to the bottom of it.\nI have been in the mold and construction industry since 1994. I will give you the perspective of a mold specialist and general contractor. By no means is this course a replacement for a professional inspector or IAQ specialist. We DO NOT recommend mold mitigation to be performed without the proper equipment and certifications. Any mold removal shall be done by a certified mold mitigation contractor. Take the time to address your health and the health of your home, lets do this!",

However, you will most likely only have to deal with two to three main diseases in your area. some diseases are soil-borne, some can be spread by seed, and others through the air or water. Disease-resistance has been bred into many newer tomato varieties- some open- pollinated and some hybrids. Many heirlooms are very susceptible to common disease, though a few offer resistance to a particular disease. Keeping your tomato plants healthy and free from tomato disease that can plague the plant leaves is a top priority for all gardeners. As your plants grow, watch for tomato plant disease such as tomato wilt that can manifest themselves as fungi, bacteria, or viruses. When autumn comes if you have had any tomato plant disease problem at all extract the entire plant.\nThe most important step to take to prevent tomato disease are to maintain good soil conditions, choose and care for hardy cultivars, manage their water well, and deal with disease when its first shows itself. Get a soil test. Good gardens begin with healthy soil. A soil test will let you know your soil's PH level and essential nutrients levels.",

First, I ask myself: should this be a traditional hinged door type, or a more modern sliding door system? sliding doors are the choice so, there’s another decision to make—should the doors be top-hung roller style or bottom-roller? Each type has its own set of advantages in terms of installation, durability, and ease of use. Alternatively, depending on the space available, I might even consider creating a walk-in wardrobe, which offers a more luxurious and spacious layout.\nA built-in wardrobe, regardless of the door mechanism, tends to offer significantly more storage capacity per cubic foot compared to most freestanding, store-bought wardrobes. The biggest advantage? Complete customization. Unlike mass-produced units, a built-in can be tailored precisely to fit the dimensions of your room and your specific storage needs. For example, in the design I’m building here, I’ve included a hanging rail positioned halfway up the interior to accommodate shirts and jackets, while reserving the entire upper section for storage—ideal for storing boxes, seasonal clothing, bedding, or other less frequently used items. The result is both efficient and tailored to the user’s lifestyle.",

Most of these photos are from the albums of the lecturer complied over the years.\nAt the end of this series a student will be able to set up an apiary, trap swarms to populate their apiary and carry out simple inspections to determine the health of the colony. The student will also have an understanding of the history of the honeybee and its origins, classification and traits.\nThe last two Lessons are each split into two parts due to the length of the subjects.

Values are determined by local officials, and may be disputed by property owners.\nPlease Remember If you will do proper planing to save tax; then your Gross income will remove certain income from it under the head of investment, education or even medical bills & therefore you will cut your Tax bill.\nTax credits and deductions come and go as the Internal Revenue Service alters its rules every 5-10 years or every year. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to trim your taxes that are likely to remain applicable for a while.\nPeople with higher incomes pay more in income tax. There are expenses you can deduct to reduce your income tax. When you claim a deduction, your taxable income is less.\nCut Taxes Legally Thru Home & Increase Income - US Focused",

There are a variety of ways to make doors, and this Make Quality Doors video course, produced in conjunction with Woodworkers Guild of America, will help you choose an approach that lends itself to your woodworking skills and your tools. Regardless of which of our techniques you choose, you’ll create doors that will stand the test of time.\nThe router table provides a great way to make frame and panel doors. You might choose to use reversible rail and stile bits, two-piece sets, vertical or horizontal panel raisers. Woodworkers Guild of America instructor George Vondriska will cover them all in this course, providing you with tips to simplify set up, use the bits safely, and make sure the cope and stile joints are a perfect fit.\nSMALL SCALE DOORS\nCabinet doors are one thing. Scaled down doors for smaller projects are something else. This instructional course provides you with buying advice so you can match your router bits to the stock you’re working with, and provides approaches for safely machining smaller door parts on the router table.\nUNIQUE STYLES\nFrame and panel doors may not always be the best choice for your project. Bead board, a form of home siding, provides an attractive door alternative, when used correctly. Some projects may call for paint grade doors, and mdf is a great choice for these doors. Painting mdf and getting a seamless finish can be tricky, so we’ll take you through the process.\nCATHEDRAL DOORS\nMany woodworkers aspire to make cathedral, or arched top, doors, but are concerned about the “freehand” cutting required to shape the panel and upper rail. With the tips and tricks we provide for cathedral doors, and a little practice, you’ll be comfortable making these doors in no time.\nIn addition to the detailed video instruction you’ll receive, this online course provides you with some downloadable resources and helpful information to print and keep, including: A detailed Course Guide you can follow and use as a reminder for the key steps of the course instruction; and source references for the tools and material used in the course.",

      "description": "The care for the environment is gaining momentum and people are more conscious about the well being of their life. Individuals attention is more centered and are more interested in living a self-sufficient lifestyle than ever before, the dream of individuals growing their own food is gradually growing. Homesteading is a broad term that can mean different to different people, but not all homesteaders share the same values or beliefs, The notion of most homesteaders are self-sufficiency. Some of the examples of homesteading includes raising your own livestock, saving seed to grow your own heirloom vegetables year after year, creating and repairing your own clothing and textiles. Urban homesteaders will start by planting a large vegetable garden to grow most of their food and perhaps look into producing alternative energy with things like solar panels. When thinking of homesteading land is a very important consideration, but we must think deep that as far as permaculture homesteading is concern one do not necessarily need a very big land but it can be started on a very small scale even in the city before you can expand it by buying acres of land. In any permaculture homesteading practices water is something that need to be taken into consideration because water can make or break any agricultural undertaking and is very significant in permaculture homesteading when the idea is placed on self-reliance.\nHomesteading can also be a source of getting money for one own expenses when the right strategy is being adopted, for instance the growing of mushroom can be a very good source of income based on the choice of the mushroom to grow, you can harvest it in no time which will aid and support your financial position as a homesteader, many crops like microgreens  can also be grow, which is very lucrative. Good homesteaders adopt a lifestyle that they manage their personal finance very well and do not spend like others do, even some can repair their own farming or garden inputs when it breaks down.",

I felt like I had found my tribe as she told anecdotes about people who practiced the “aesthetics of joy.” Here were people who played with their environment with zeal and creativity, who sometimes took their passions to absurd extremes.\nFrom my experiences in feng shui and design, I understood what they were trying to do and why these shifts in their environment could bring about such delight. The book got me thinking about how ordinary people could take these lessons and design joy into their homes. Fetell Lee starts to go there, but that is not her focus. I pick up where she leaves off to show you how you too can practice the “aesthetics of joy” and create a home that makes possible more joy in your life.\nI show you how to\n-bring more energy;\n-create harmony;\n-cultivate feelings of freedom;\n-induce play;\n-transcend the ordinary;\n-create occasions for renewal and celebration\nin your home and life.\nThis mini-course is free now and forever.

      "description": "\" Organic\" gardening or farming means different things in many countries. To many consumers it means food grown without unnecessary chemicals or pesticide. Managing bioponics needs much more attention than traditional hydroponic growing methods. Not in terms of time spent, but in terms of visual attention and examination. Bioponics is managed by eye as much as with PH and EC parameters, although these do still remain important. Bioponics works through a symbiotic relationship between you microorganisms and your plants. In free water, without the buffering capacity of soil. life is hard to impossible for beneficials and even when established on roots and substrate their activity and health can be affected by rapid changes in environment.\nBioponics is the next revolution of soilless agriculture in which crops can be produced from nutrient-rich streams, without the use of chemical fertilizers. Bioponics both recovers nutrients for vegetables and other crop from nutrient rich products. Microorganisms in bioponics play significant roles in nutrients recovery such as organic waste degradation to maintain good water quality as  nutrient mineralization and transformation for plant uptake. The liquid fertilizer employed in bioponics systems is generally produced from either worm humus or bird manure after having been infused at a low temperature inside tanks for organic fertigation connected to systems for filtering solid and organic waste.",

      "description": "How to Grow Organic Mushrooms\nMushrooms are a culinary treat, and many contain beneficial vitamins and nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin B, selenium, antioxidants, and iron. Purchasing mushrooms can weigh on your budget, though, and harvesting wild mushrooms often proves to be a hazardous venture. To save yourself money and peace of mind, you can grow organic mushrooms that offer you all the benefits of mushrooms with few of the risks.\n\nHow to Grow Edible Mushrooms\nMushrooms are delicious, but the gourmet varieties can be expensive and difficult to find fresh. If you're a big fan of cooking with mushrooms, you can keep your kitchen stocked and your kitchen diverse by growing your own unique varieties, ensuring that you've always got a fresh fungus to cook with. This article will explain how to select varieties, methods of fruiting, and cooking techniques for your mushrooms.\nHow to Grow Hydroponic Mushrooms\nMushrooms can be cultivated hydroponically as fungi. Essentially, growing your own mushrooms hydroponically means that you are using water or other growing mediums instead of soil to cultivate your crop. Hydroponic mushrooms grow quickly and are quite tasty. This article describes two methods of growing hydroponic mushrooms.\n\nHow to Grow Mushrooms Indoors\nGrowing mushrooms at home is a task that any gardener interested in growing their own food should attempt. Mushrooms are a healthy addition to any diet, as they are low in calories and fat, high in fiber, and contain high amounts of potassium and selenium. Mushrooms are best grown indoors where the temperature and light conditions can be more readily managed. Learning how to grow mushrooms indoors is a matter of managing their growing conditions carefully.",

I'll be cloning and spore-printing supermarket mushrooms to show you how to create clean living cultures on petri dishes, in liquid culture solutions, and in 'master slants' for long-term storage.  I'll show you the step-by-step procedure from mushroom through to grain spawn so you'll never need to buy cultures or grain spawn again!\nThis is NOT a mushroom growing course - our focus here is on creating and expanding mushroom cultures to make grain spawn.  If you want to learn how to grow mushrooms please check out my other course \"Growing Mushrooms for Business and Pleasure\" and come back when you've caught the bug!",

      "description": "Tomatoes are one of the most popular edible plants to grow at home, and for good reason. many varieties grow well in a container, and taste much better freshly harvested than the tomatoes that end up in grocery stores. Tomatoes are sun-love and picky about watering schedules, but besides that they don't need much attention. Plant them now and before long you'll be enjoying a fresh tomato salad with a lush green friend next to you company. Pots are great for fitting miniature garden onto a balcony or patio, but only the bush varieties of tomatoes will be comfortable in small containers. Most of theses can grow in pots as small as five gallons. Each variety also has a maximum height, so you'll know in advance that they won't hit a roof overhang.\nTo start growing tomatoes from seed, you can buy seed or choose seeds from a tomato. You can buy seeds online at seed exchange sites from your local nursery or from other gardeners. You can also buy seeds from the garden section of a department store. If you want to collect seeds from a plant, then you will need at least one tomato from the plant. make sure the tomato is from a plant that was grown from an heirloom or open pollinated seed. If you choose tomatoes from a hybrid, or a plant with chemically-treated seeds, the results may not be as impressive.",

This course has been created to teach you how to achieve same.\nI have been able to generate 50% of the energy for cooking, 100% of the electricity needed to power essential devices for modern life, that includes the electricity I'm using to power my laptop right now. The house is also able to harness around 80% of the water I use from nature.\nThis urban homestead is essentially zero-waste as I recycle, compost, or reuse everything. Other than the obvious reduction in cost of living, this urban homestead contributes to improving biodiversity, food production, saving soil and in general a better environment. It has also done a ton of good to my health and well-being. All within a 13m x 13m space\nThis required applying both ancient knowledge and current technologies with a bit of creativity.\nI am Ololade Olatunji, a researcher with over 10 years prior experience as a University lecturer and industry researcher. My current research focus is in the area of food and energy self sufficiency. My past research work has extended from energy recovery from waste plastics to food processing technologies. I have studied self sufficiency within various concepts and the different approaches people have taken to achieve self sufficiency in different parts of the world and in different periods of human existence.\nIn the course of my research I have built a model micro urban homestead as a demonstration site for what can be achieved within limited space in an urban setting in terms of food and energy self sufficiency, water and waste management.\nIn this course, I will be taking you through the different aspects of achieving food and energy self sufficiency as well as managing water and waste within a micro urban homestead. You will in the process learn how to convert a standard urban building into a homestead using minimal structural modification by skillfully living in synergy with nature and implementing readily available technologies to sustainably harness resources from nature.\nWhy you should take this course\nThe methods presented are based on scientific findings and first-hand experience\nIt presents a realistic approach to homesteading that is achievable by a larger proportion of the society living in urban and peri-urban areas\nThe course has been designed to be visually appealing and easy to follow\nIt is valuable knowledge you can almost immediately implement\nThe knowledge gained is an asset that helps prepare you before going into homesteading whether out of necessity or desire\nWho should take this course\nPolicymakers, NGOs and governments officials in areas such as urban development and sustainable development\nDevelopment workers\nProperty developers and real estate agents\nResearchers\nStudents in e.g. sustainable buildings, urban development\nArchitects, builders, and civil engineers\nIndividuals looking to build or convert their existing residences into homesteads",

There are many keys to successful and safe router use, and we’re proud to bring you a broad selection of router know-how in this course that was produced in conjunction with Woodworkers Guild of America.\nStart With The Basics\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of plunge and fixed base routers? When installing a router bit, just how much of the shank should be in the collet? Is it better to use 1/4″ or 1/2″ shank router bits? How do you know what the correct (and safe) feed direction is? Woodworkers Guild of America Instructor George Vondriska starts by answering these questions, and so much more. This will significantly increase your confidence level when using a hand-held router. We’ll also provide you with buying advice that will help you make good choices on future router purchases.\nMake The Cut\nThere are definitely right and wrong approaches when using a router. We’ll talk about what not to do, and provide you with the correct techniques that will help you achieve the best results with your router. In addition to general router skills, you’ll learn some great tricks that will simplify setting your router bits to a precise depth, every time.\nSpecific Skills\nOnce you’re comfortable with setting up and using your router for basic cuts, we’ll increase your router vocabulary by teaching you some more advanced skills. These can be used to simplify the work you do on your woodworking projects, make your projects look better and more professional, and add interesting decorative elements.\nThere are over 90 minutes of hands-on video instruction in this course. In addition to the detailed video help you’ll receive, this course provides you with some downloadable resources and helpful information to print and keep, including: A detailed Guide you can follow and use as a reminder for the key points of the course instruction; a Speed Chart to help you determine the best speed to run your bits; and a resources document that will give you information on the products you’ll see in the course.",

      "description": "A router table adds a LOT to the shop. With the amazingly diverse availability of router bit profiles, there are many different things you can do on a router table; from edge profiling to joinery. Thanks to the high rpm of a router motor, the cut quality is great, typically requiring very little sanding. Woodworkers Guild of America Instructor, George Vondriska teaches this video Course and will give you many important tips and fundamentals – helping you to get the most out of your router table.\nSafety\nThe same attribute that provides great cut quality can make routers intimidating to operate. Typically running at over 20,000 revolutions per minute, things can go wrong quickly if you’re not using a router correctly. This Course covers a variety of must-have safety tips including how to properly secure the bit in the collet, determining feed direction, setting up for multiple passes, and how to use feather boards and push pads.\nBuying Advice\nThere are lots of routers available in the marketplace. This Course will educate you regarding the best type of router to use in a table, and we’ll look at the advantages router lifts bring to router tables.\nMaintenance\nWhile the router table itself requires little more than good housekeeping, router bits are another story. A dull or dirty bit will be unsafe to use, and will cut poorly. We’ll show you how to determine if a bit needs to be sharpened, how to do the sharpening in your own shop, and how to clean a pitch-covered router bit.\nTechniques\nDadoes, rabbets, slot cutting…these are just some of the woodworking techniques you’ll learn in this Course. We’ll show you short cuts that will make set up easier and more repeatable, so you can reduce set up time and increase accuracy.\nThere are over 100 minutes of hands-on video instruction in this Course produced with Woodworkers Guild of America. In addition to the detailed video help you’ll receive, this Course provides you with downloadable resources and helpful information to print and keep, including: A detailed Guide you can follow and use as a reminder for the key points of the course instruction; a Speed Chart to help you determine the best speed to run your bits; and a resources document that will give you information on the products you’ll see in the Course.",

The world of beekeeping has changed since the days of our grandparents. Pests and diseases have made it important that you, the beekeeper, must take action.\nBeekeeping is a participation hobby. To ensure a healthy hive and gather a bit of the sweet stuff a beekeeper needs to examine the comb. It can tell you all you need to know about your hive.\nDon't let fear or analysis paralysis get the better of you and your hive. Let me help you understand what it is your are looking for in your hive.\nWe will cover:\nWhy you need to inspect your hives.\nWhat to expect from healthy comb.\nWhat some diseases look like.\nPossible pest problems\nQueens\nAnd More...\nI like not wearing my bee suit, forgetting myself and getting as close to the bees lives as they will let me, remembering in the process that there is more to life than the merely human and accepting the humbling truth that bees know better than I do.\nThis course will be sprinkled with bits of zen wisdom that you can help you on your journey of mindful beekeeping. Since I am an organic beekeeper I lean towards treatment free, holistic and natural management.\nIncluded as downloads are\nHive Inspection Sheet\nBeekeeper Calendar\nGuide to Inspections\nGear Checklist\nPDFs on pests\n\n\nThis is for the beginner to intermediate level beekeeper. Here you will find no judgement, just encouragement.\nAs  beekeepers we can never stop learning!\n\n\nJoin the swarm!",

With minimal time and effort - much less than creating entire beds and planting flowers in the ground - you can create dazzling flower displays in containers and make your property look professionally crafted. And well, it will be. You're going to be the professional!\nImagine with me. It's springtime. Everyone is looking forward to the warm weather. The birds chirping melodiously. The grass turning back to the vibrant green of summer. The trees and flowers showing off their beautiful blooms. And then there's your neighbors. Yes, you know the ones. Their yards seem perfectly manicured from Day 1 of Spring and you feel inadequate at making the outside of your home look just as stunning.\nSure, it's nice looking at your neighbor's yard. But you want to create that beauty around the exterior of your own home. You want to WOW your friends and family as they approach your dwelling.

      "description": "Are You Searching for a Smart, Sustainable Way to Grow Food and Fish Together?\nThe demand for eco-friendly growing methods is skyrocketing as the world shifts toward more sustainable food systems. Yet many passionate individuals still feel unsure how to start their journey into aquaponics, lack the technical know-how, or feel overwhelmed by the science behind integrated systems. With food security challenges, water scarcity, and soil degradation affecting traditional farming, the need for clean, space-efficient, and profitable methods like aquaponics has never been greater.\nThis is where our CPD-Accredited Diploma in Aquaponics for Cultivating Fish and Vegetables becomes your gateway. Whether you’re an aspiring farmer, urban gardener, educator, sustainability advocate, or entrepreneur, this course provides everything you need to master aquaponics and turn your knowledge into a purposeful, income-generating venture.\n\n\nAt the very beginning, you’ll step into the world of aquaponics, understanding what aquaponics is, how it works, and why it's quickly becoming the gold standard in sustainable agriculture. You’ll explore how aquaponics merges two powerful systems—hydroponics and aquaculture—to grow fish and vegetables in a single, closed-loop environment. By comparing traditional farming with modern aquaponic and fish farming practices, you’ll see why aquaponics is revolutionizing how we grow food.\nYou’ll dive into the types of aquaponics systems, from deep water culture and media beds to nutrient film techniques and vertical towers. These insights help you choose the best design based on your space, climate, and goals—whether for home use, schools, or commercial production.\n\n\nNext, you’ll learn how to plan your aquaponics system with confidence. From selecting fish species and compatible plants to identifying the right tools and materials, this section arms you with practical, step-by-step guidance. You'll discover how to balance your aquaponic and fish farming goals, choose the right grow bed type, and calculate the size of tanks and pumps for optimal efficiency.\nBy understanding system layout, plumbing design, and energy requirements, you'll build a strong foundation to begin setting up your very own aquaponics system—small-scale or commercial.\n\n\nWith planning complete, you’ll get hands-on with a complete guide to building your aquaponics system. This section walks you through every step—from assembling components and plumbing to installing grow beds, filters, and water pumps. You’ll learn the process of cycling your aquaponics system, a vital stage where beneficial bacteria establish the nitrogen cycle that keeps fish and plants thriving together.\nOnce your system is ready, you’ll add your fish and seedlings, beginning your journey in aquaponics with a fully functioning ecosystem. These real-world instructions are designed to give you confidence as you transition from learner to doer.\n\n\nWater is the engine that powers aquaponics. In this critical section, you’ll learn how water quality directly affects fish health and plant growth. From understanding pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to monitoring nitrates and nitrites, you’ll gain the skills to keep your ecosystem balanced and productive.\nYou’ll explore water testing methods, filtration options, and how to troubleshoot imbalances—vital for managing both small systems and commercial aquaponic and fish farming operations. Because without healthy water, nothing else in aquaponics works.\n\n\nSuccessful aquaponics relies on ongoing care and attention. You’ll explore daily and weekly maintenance routines, from feeding fish and checking pumps to monitoring plant health and adjusting nutrient levels. Learn how to make seasonal adjustments for temperature swings and climate shifts, keeping your system productive all year round.\nThis section also covers how to troubleshoot common issues, from algae blooms to fish stress, and from pest problems to pump failures. With this knowledge, your system stays healthy, your crops stay lush, and your fish thrive.\n\n\nOnce you've mastered the essentials, it's time to scale. This section dives into advanced aquaponics techniques, including how to scale your aquaponics system for commercial or community use. You’ll explore organic aquaponics, sustainability practices, and how to integrate renewable energy sources into your setup.\nLearn how to design innovative systems—stacked, vertical, and modular models that combine aquaponic and fish farming efficiency with smart use of space. These cutting-edge approaches make your system more productive, sustainable, and profitable.\nYou’ll also understand how hydroponics contributes to the development of more nutrient-efficient aquaponics, and how hybrid systems are creating new standards in sustainable agriculture.\n\n\nAs your system matures, you’ll learn how to harvest both fish and vegetables efficiently. Understand optimal harvesting times, methods, and post-harvest handling techniques to maximize freshness, nutrition, and profitability.\nLearn how to sell your produce at markets, to restaurants, or via CSA programs. This section also explores legal and food safety considerations, helping you meet local and international standards—whether you’re running a backyard system or a full-scale aquaponics farm.\n\n\nThis diploma doesn’t just teach—you’ll also learn how to start your own aquaponics business. From business model planning and funding sources to branding and pricing strategies, this section equips you with real-world entrepreneurial tools. Whether your passion lies in eco-farming, education, or supplying fresh food to urban communities, we help you build a business that reflects your values.\nExplore commercial aquaponics systems with high-yield outputs, understand grants and funding opportunities, and get guidance on certifications and legal compliance. Whether you're launching a boutique aquaponics setup or a full-scale vertical farm, you’ll know exactly what to do.\n\n\nWhy This Aquaponics Diploma Is Different\nAt Training Excellence, we combine comprehensive instruction with hands-on learning to make aquaponics accessible, practical, and impactful. This CPD-accredited diploma is designed to empower you with the confidence to grow your own food, contribute to sustainable agriculture, and even launch your own aquaponic and fish farming business.\nComprehensive Curriculum – Covers everything from biology, design, and setup to system maintenance, advanced techniques, and business strategy.\nPractical Application – Real-world labs, setup walkthroughs, and field case studies to reinforce your learning.\nFlexible Online Study – Learn at your own pace from anywhere in the world with lifetime access to resources.\nGlobally Recognized Certification – Add a CPD-accredited certificate to your credentials, increasing your credibility in the green tech, agri-tech, and sustainable farming sectors.\nWho Should Take This Course?\nWhether you’re a complete beginner or an experienced grower looking to transition into aquaponics, this diploma is for you.

By the process of directly working in harmony with Nature we do the one thing most essential to change the world. We change ourselves.'' In this course, you're going to learn how to grow your own herbs indoors and outdoors and how to use them in magical recipes. I will guide you from the seed to the plant and to the table. We will take a peek into my herbal garden, the forest nearby, visit the local garden center and finally, use herbs in magical recipes. The information in this course will also involve the basics of using essential oils as these are a wonderful way how to further promote health. The course is divided into sections. Each section is divided into lectures and includes many resources. The course is mainly taught via videos, so please make sure your internet connection is stable and reliable. I'm looking forward to teaching you this course. If you are passionate about lunar gardening and astrology, please sign up also for the course The Power of the Moon here on Udemy.

      "description": "As a beekeeper, you will maintain and manage your bee colonies. You will spend your time caring for bees, feeding them, and collecting their honey once they produce an excessive amount. On most days, you will just check in on the bees to ensure they are healthy and productive. while it may sound like a lot of work, beekeeping requires very little daily effort once your hive is established, since bee colonies are largely self- sufficient. Start beekeeping projects in the autumn. Bees's behavior is entirely dependent on climate. Use the fall and winter to consult books on beekeeping, gather your supplies to build the hive, and find a source for your bees. Introduce your bees to the hive only in the spring as the early flowers appear. Beginning your project during the autumn months ensure your bees can collect nectar and pollen to build a strong hive in the spring and summer.\nTreat bee stings. It's inevitable that you will get stung at some point while working with bees. Most experience beekeepers have been stung many times, but eventually learn to avoid most situations that may result in getting stung. If you are stung, treating a bee sting is fairly easy. Naturally, organic honey can usually be stored for many months at room temperature as long as your container is sealed well.",

      "description": "El arte popular chino de distribuir los objetos para fomentar la armonía y la buena suerte se llama feng shui. Este antiguo conocimiento nos proporciona un marco de referencia nuevo a través de nuestra relación con los objetos que nos rodean, situándolos de modo que la gente (el hombre), el entorno (la Tierra) y el espíritu (el cielo) formen una alianza para el progreso. Feng Shui significa “viento y agua”, es cada día más conocido en todo el mundo. Cada vez más personas perciben que su entorno puede ser una fuente de recursos donde pueden cuidar y mejorar sus vidas. El Feng Shui nació de la mano con la filosofía del Tao, que se basó en el estudio de la naturaleza y sus ciclos. De ahí viene la simpleza de su nombre: Feng Shui “viento” y “Agua”, dos elementos fundamentales para la existencia de la vida. Se dice que el QI fluye con el viento y el agua acumula el QI. Por lo tanto, El Feng Shui es el arte del flujo y la contención del QI. El Feng Shui se puede aplicar en la arquitectura, en la decoración, en el diseño de interiores, en la construcción de jardines, etc. Muchas de las características del Feng Shui están basadas en los principios lógicos y estéticos donde el sentido común y la búsqueda de la belleza son muy importantes.",

      "description": "Why should you study the Permaculture Design Course?\nEveryone can benefit from learning about Permaculture and how to apply Permaculture design principles to your life. You can apply these design principles to your garden, community spaces or to the larger environment. This course will allow you to broaden your understanding of Permaculture theory, building your knowledge of all the necessary aspects (like growing food, enriching soils and using waste as a resource) to become fully conversant with Permaculture design. By the end of the course, you will be able to confidently create your first Permaculture design plan.\nThis course not only provides you with the theory and practical knowledge to create design plans, it allows you to take a step into the world of Bill Mollison, one of the co-founders of Permaculture. Bill's global experience in sharing the principles of Permaculture design, along with his entertaining story telling, will captivate you and challenge you to think critically about how we can all apply the principles of sustainable land use design to our lives and communities.\nAll students enrolled in the course are invited to join our private Student Group on Facebook. Check your Welcome message to gain access.\nPlease note: This course does not include an assessment component and therefore there is no formally recognised Permaculture Design Certificate.\nWhat exactly is Permaculture and why is it applicable to everyone?\nThe concept of Permaculture was first presented by Bill Mollison and his student, David Holmgren, in the mid 1970's. Permaculture is sustainable land use design, based on ecological and biological principles, often using patterns that occur in nature to maximise effect and minimise work. Permaculture aims to create stable, productive systems that provide for human needs, harmoniously integrating the land with its’ inhabitants. The ecological processes of plants, animals, their nutrient cycles, climatic factors and weather cycles are all part of the picture. Inhabitants’ needs are provided for using proven technologies for food, energy, shelter and infrastructure. Elements in a system are viewed in relationship to other elements, where the outputs of one element become the inputs of another. Within a Permaculture system, work is minimised, “wastes” become resources, productivity and yields increase, and environments are restored. Permaculture principles can be applied to any environment, at any scale from dense urban settlements to individual homes, from farms to entire regions.\nWho is the Permaculture Design Course delivered by?\nThis Permaculture Design Course was first convened in 2005 through collaboration with Tony Walkins and Lisa Mollison, Tagari Publications. Tagari Publications' primary function is to support the work of The Permaculture Institute by publishing educational materials on sustainability, with Lisa Mollison fulfilling the role of Managing Director since 1997. All lectures available in this course are a recording of the live delivery of the course in 2005 and feature presentations by Bill Mollison and Geoff Lawton.\nThroughout your participation in the digital course, you will be supported by Lisa Mollison, who has been teaching Permaculture design principles to students, volunteers and 'Wwoofers' at Tagari Garden Farm (the home of The Permaculture Institute) since 1996. Lisa Mollison is furthering Bill Mollison's vision to spread Permaculture design principles and ethics across the globe by offering the Permaculture Design Course to a wider audience.\nLisa Mollison, Tagari Publications and The Permaculture Institute, is the copyright owner of all course content and resources. Please note, although unintentional, there is a possibility that some content presented in this course may contain references to deceased people, sacred or secret material and terminology or language which some people may find inappropriate or offensive.\nAbout Bill Mollison\nBill Mollison was the Founding Director of the Permaculture Institute, the first and longest running Permaculture institute in existence, and  taught and developed projects from the Arctic through Sub-tropic and Equatorial regions of the planet. There are few countries left in the world where he did not personally plant the seeds of Permaculture. The Peoples of the Pacific, South East Asia, South Africa and seven Amazonian language groups have been inspired by and acted on his teachings, embracing Permaculture as a dynamic tool. He also gave courses in the drylands and developed projects with Native Americans, Indigenous Australians, tribal women of the Deccan, Kalahari, San groups and Pima people of the Sonora. In the USA, Europe and Scandinavia, Bill lectured and helped to develop ecological designs for urban and rural properties, including many city farms and CSA’s (Community Supported Agriculture).\nBill Mollison was vitally concerned with the environment for over forty years. His many roles included: scientist, naturalist and university professor. Later, he became a vigorous campaigner against environmental exploitation which led him to develop Permaculture as a positive solution.  Bill devoted his energies towards designing sustainable systems, writing text books and articles on Permaculture, and most importantly, teaching. Permaculture now laps the globe, resulting in thousands of independent associations involved in the areas of sustainable agriculture, reforestation, education and village economics. True to his vision, throughout the world, Permaculture is becoming an everyday part of life.",

Perhaps you're interested to grow healthy food for your family, or maybe you're dreaming of starting your own mushroom farm.  Whatever your motivation, your journey starts here!",

In \"Building Soil from Scratch for Beginners\" we will start from what exactly is soil and all the different factors that contribute to whether it is suitable for growing or not. Once we have an understanding of the components that make up soil, we will dive into what we can add to achieve a healthy, balanced foundation for your plants to grow in. From amendments, to organic materials to beneficial bugs we will cover all the bases. And we’ll even take a field trip to the community garden where it all started for me and show you some samples of the kind of amendments you can expect to use and where you can find them. We hope this will be a fun and comprehensive start to your gardening experience that will set you up for success!",

This has made growing your own fresh veggies and herbs a necessity, but it is limited by the space one has. However when you grow food using containers, you can easily overcome space limitation and grow fresh food almost anywhere. This course gives you the relevant knowledge and sets you in the right direction to start your own food garden and make it sustainable to productive for years to come.\nIt starts with an introduction to organic agriculture and container gardening followed by various considerations one needs to make before starting one's garden. These garden design principles are often ignored by beginners leading to monumental failures later on. Then one learns everything about gardening from preparing containers, mixing potting soil and making organic fertilizers to composting, pest management and even how to water correctly. This course is not just about demonstrations and how to do things. It is also about why you do them and this knowledge will guide you throughout your gardening journey long after the course is over.\nThe course is presented in a structured and clear manner and is for everyone from beginners to experts who want to make their container food gardens productive, efficient, balanced and sustainable.\nAnd by the way, you get a free e-book 'Organic Urban Farming The Indian Way', which covers everything taught in this video course and more in written form.

The course will be useful for experienced and novice gardeners. It contains not only the theoretical foundations of landscape design and gardening, but also my practical experience of more than 10 years of design and practical gardening. The course will be useful to everyone - it is structured and allows you to create beautiful, harmonious and a low-maintenance garden compositions.\nThe course was created myself and it contains my knowledge and experience for 10 years. In my garden, I planted almost all possible plants and applied all the techniques that I came across in different sources. Now I have come to a low-maintenance garden, I prefer to choose of the plants that will require a minimum of care, but at the same time look beautiful.\nI hope my experience and knowledge will be useful to you.\nOnce I myself was looking for something similar when I grew my garden.\nIn my opinion, the design should be functional first. I am always using this principle when I creating my own landscape projects.\nAlthough we know that gardening is not for the lazy, the gardener's time is often limited. Therefore, it is worth planning landscape compositions so that their care is minimized.\nCreating a beautiful and easy-care flower garden or mixborder depends a lot on how well thought out its layout is.

      "description": "This course provides students with the knowledge of various recommended techniques for successfully cultivating profitable Gerbera crop under controlled conditions. Gerbera flowers have become popular for cultivation in India due to their color variations, symbolic meanings, flower size, long-lasting nature, and adaptability to different cultivation methods. The demand for Gerbera is high in both domestic and export markets throughout the year, making it one of the top ten cut flowers in the global flower trade. India, being geographically closer to major flower-consuming countries, has significant potential in the flower trade, especially during severe winters in other flower-producing countries.\nTo meet international quality standards, it is necessary to cultivate high-yielding and long-lasting hybrid cultivars in polyhouses or greenhouses. Growing Gerbera under cover has several advantages, including the exploitation of genetic potential in exotic hybrids or varieties, year-round cultivation, protection against adverse weather conditions, and prevention of pest and disease incidence. This approach allows farmers to achieve higher returns.\nBy taking this course, students will gain the confidence and knowledge to adopt Gerbera cultivation as a business model. They will analyze both the opportunities and threats associated with this practice and develop strategies to overcome challenges. This course aims to empower students to pursue Gerbera cultivation as a profitable venture.",

Comment isoler ma maison pour qu’elle soit  confortable? Comment organiser mon alimentation en eau potable et  comment gérer mes eaux usées? Où installer ma micromaison? Comment  puis-je être autonome face à l’énergie et l’eau?\n\n\nDepuis la fondation de ma compagnie Habitations MicroÉvolution en 2014, j'ai reçu une quantité incroyable de questions par courriel, téléphone et lors des visites de ma micromaison sur roues (que j'ai auto-construite). Le phénomène des micromaisons emballe beaucoup de monde, et ce, avec raison! Cependant, vous le réalisez probablement, la construction d’une tiny house est relativement complexe et demande un certain investissement (temps, argent, etc.), tant pour la planification  que la construction. Pour vous faciliter la tâche et vous mettre sur la bonne voie, j'offre depuis plusieurs années cet un atelier complet où les participants passent la journée avec moi à apprendre directement de ma micromaison!\n\n\nCependant, je suis conscient que ce n'est pas tout le monde qui peut prendre une journée au complet pour suivre une formation. De même, il se peut que vous habitiez trop loin de chez moi pour pouvoir en profiter... C'est pourquoi j'ai finalement transformé le contenu de la formation en vidéos, que vous pourrez suivre à votre propre rythme, et ce sans vous déplacer!\n\n\nMon but est qu'après avoir suivi la formation, vous ayez tous les outils en main pour réussir votre petite maison de rêve!",

      "description": "This is an introductory course to wildlife gardening in the UK, covering the basic framework and essential concepts that go towards making a garden, wildlife friendly.\nThis course explains:\n- Key principles of wildlife gardening. These are the most important aspects that every wildlife friendly garden should aim to incorporate. Because these are so important, this course explains each one in turn, with images to help convey ways to achieve them in your own garden.\n- Garden food chains. These are a fascinating and important aspect of wildlife gardening. This course explains what they are, and why it's good for a wildlife gardener to know them. Understanding that, what you plant and the animals your garden attracts, your garden will send out invitations to other wildlife.\n- Life-cycles of some common garden wildlife. Peppered throughout this course, I will take a deeper look at certain species that are common in the UK, to get an understanding of their life-cycles, what their needs are and most importantly, what gardeners can do to help them thrive in their garden.\n- Explanation of what wildlife gardening is, with a working example from my own garden. Wildlife gardening is a term that's often used, but what exactly is it? Isn't every garden that has plants, wildlife friendly? This course will clarify what is meant by wildlife gardening.\n- Why we should consider gardening with wildlife in mind. Many gardeners are at odds with wildlife, especially insects and plant eating animals. This course outlines the benefits and good reasons to not just tolerate wildlife in gardens, but see the joy in supporting our incredible garden wildlife.\n- This course does NOT cover standard gardening advice, only concepts and the framework behind wildlife gardening. Only topics that are specifically related to wildlife gardening are covered in this course. There is no mention of how to prune, or how to plant something. This course is about the concepts and principles that go behind a wildlife friendly garden, so it doesn't require you to have any prior knowledge of gardening either.",

It brings whānau and communities together and is one of the most important ways we share and celebrate our culture and family traditions. Common Unity is dedicated to food. Growing it, cooking it, and sharing it by feeding as many people in our community as we can, celebrating the goodness of our soil, from the actions of our hands and the heartfulness of wanting to bring home local food solutions into our neighbourhoods. Since Covid, we've focused on our Community Food Hub, providing over 96,000 meals to the community and expanding our farm network which has included Rimutaka Prison, Agrihood backyard farms and Epuni care and protection, and Epuni School; making it 12 farms in total we have developed over 10 years. Some of these farms are now on pause as we embed learnings and relationships.\nAnd we want to share our learnings with you.\nFirst we’re going to cover your operating model. Next we’ll go onto funding your urban kai farm and then a video about the land you are planning on using. We will cover staff and volunteers, some important discussion on governance and administration We then get onto planning your planting, how to rethink waste, and finally, the importance of food safety. At the end of the course you will have a good understanding of what an urban kai farmer ‘looks like’, what an urban farmer is able to accomplish, and what is required to set up an urban kai farm.\nWe encourage you to print out the checklists and use these to create a business plan for your project.\nPlease compile feedback throughout the course and feel free to share this with us upon completion at growkit@cupa.org.nz\nIf you would like to learn more, we invite you to check out our documentary, launched in February 2022 by Happen Films: \"Together We Grow\"\nThanks for learning with us.",

The project successfully made its mark in India as first-of-its-farm in North India, featured in short documentary on aquaponics by Down to Earth,available of YouTube titled “Aquaponics can be a profitable agriculture technique for Indian Farmers”. The project also featured on various international and national news platforms such as The Times of India, The Hindu, Punjab Kesari,Dainik Jagran, Better India, Hortidaily etc.\nThe lectures in this tutorial are in the form of Audio/Presentation mashup. What that means is that you will see a video of power point slides with my voice over. You don’t have to do anything – the slides will appear at the right time with right concepts.\nThe course will provide you with basic understanding in following topics and encourage you to innovate and build your own system:\n- Introduction to aquaponics\n- Water Chemistry\n- Aquaponic components\n- Design of fish tank, mechanical filter, biofilter, sump and hydroponic systems\n- Management of farm and troubleshoot of problems and solutions.\nThe lectures will end with some handy literature and useful resources as you embark on an aquaponic journey.",

      "description": "Learn how to start seeds inside so you can enjoy the wonderful taste of heirloom vegetables that aren't available for purchase at the supermarket. From seed to plant ready for transplant outside, I will walk you through the process step by step showing you not only what I do, but why I do it so that you can not only successfully follow my method, but adapt it for your individual needs. This course can help you with your indoor seed starting regardless of whether you're planning an urban vegetable garden, a container garden, want to use the square foot method in raised beds, or want to go all organic with your gardening approach.\nEasily Start Seeds Inside Successfully Using the Methods Described in this Comprehensive Course.\nDiscover how to take the work out of seed starting\nLearn how to make watering easy.\nGrow strong seedlings that succeed in your garden.\nTake the guesswork out of lighting.\nAvoid costly mistakes with fertilizer.\nSeed Starting Inside is the Cornerstone of a Successful Garden - and the Only Option If You Want Access to a Wide Variety of Delicious Heirloom Vegetables.\nI grow hundreds of varieties (yes - varieties) of heirloom vegetables each year, many of which must be started from seed inside if I wish to grow them - I can't go to a local store and purchase plants. Starting from seed not only allows me to save money on plants, but it also enables me to make sure I have strong healthy seedlings ready to plant out on my schedule. In a given year I'll start 45-60 different varieties of tomatoes, and 15-30 different varieties of sweet peppers inside - along with several other types of vegetables. Rest assured though that my methods will work for you whether you have a small container garden or a large three acre plot.\nIn my search to find solutions and improved methods to the various challenges gardening provides, I've taken a holistic approach to gardening. When searching for a solution or improvement to a current process, I heavily consider both related fields of study as well as related environmental factors. This has led me to researching things such as hydroponics, aquaponics, grafting, and vermicomposting to discover what principles have been learned there that I can leverage to improve my gardening methods. I've also become involved in fields that compliment my gardening needs such as beekeeping and raising chickens. All of this is experience you get to benefit from as you learn the methods I've developed.\nOverview\nI've used my skills as an engineer to design a method for seed starting that minimizes much of the work involved, reduces costs without cutting corners I'll regret later, and helps to ensure my success. You can benefit from my experience by taking this course which enables you to replicate my successes without the need to experience the failures I've discovered along the way.\nWhat successes have I had? Taste is my biggest success, but I don't have any way of showing that to you short of you trying it for yourself. A great harvest is my second biggest success. Keep in mind I'm not a \"professional farmer\" - I have a day job, yet I easily manage a densely planted 1/4 acre garden producing more food than my family of seven could ever hope to eat. Everything in that garden I start from seed, and many of those seeds must be started inside each year to provide a long enough growing season for the plant. See my promo video for the course for pictures of some of what comes out of my garden every year.\nIf size is what impresses you, with no special attention (I'm not intentionally trying to grow \"contest vegetables\") I've had 3-4 lb tomatoes, sweet peppers easily 8 inches in length, pumpkins over 100 lbs, and muskmelons (cantaloupe) in excess of 35 lbs. Many of my tomato plants easily reach 7ft - some even having stems that look like miniature trees.\nStarting your seeds inside correctly is the foundation for growing good healthy plants in your garden and having a successful harvest. How you start your seeds inside will help you avoid common gardening problems such as aphids and blossom end rot.\nIn this course I walk you step by step through the details you need to successfully start seeds inside. I utilize spreadsheets, video lectures, hands on demonstrations, white board sessions, PDF summary points, and pictures showing the principles we're discussing to provide you the details you need to be successful. In addition, I'm available to provide clarification and answer any questions you may have about seed starting inside to help you be successful.\nSeed starting inside does not need to be a lot of work, and it doesn't need to be complicated or intimidating. Let me make it easy for you.\nUdemy offers a money back guarantee on my course through their website allowing you to try it risk-free.\nSign up now for my course so I can start working with you to enable you to be successful starting seeds inside.",

A filosofia 5s já é consolidada em empresas do mundo inteiro e depois de aplicar esse programa em diversas empresas, decidi criar esse curso e mostrar como podemos aplicá-la no nosso lar. Dentro do curso vamos discutir sobre a utilização e utilidade dos utensílios e dos espaços, vamos ver o que não serve mais e o que possivelmente seria mais funcional se estivesse em outro lugar. Vamos abordar também a reorganização de espaços inteiros e de gavetas e armários, discutindo a melhor forma de organizar por ordem de uso, o que é mais usado será colocado de uma forma prontamente disponível seguindo os conceitos da filosofia que foram apresentados. Também falaremos de higiene e respeito as pessoas, um pilar importante para que qualquer mudança seja validada como uma melhoria por todos os membros da casa. Durante o processo de organização, discutiremos sobre temas como lixo e reciclagem, ergonomia e conforto, segurança, aromas, manutenções e uso correto de equipamentos. Após conversarmos sobre todos os temas que envolvem o programa 5s e a arrumação da casa, vamos descobrir como padronizar e validar as mudanças feitas, além de mantê-las e aperfeiçoá-las ao longo do tempo.

      "description": "The modern farming techniques depend on farming methods that ensure the efficient and effective use of power or energy in the production of crops and plants, but in all angles farmers want cheap but effective source of energy for their farm business and operations. The impact of electric power on modern agriculture has been at least as significant as that of either steam or gasoline, because electricity in its nature is far more versatile than the earlier power sources. The use of electricity for farming is one of the best sources of energy that enhance growth quickly and also impact on productivity. Specifically modern application of electricity in farming range from the comparatively simple to some as complex as those in the manufacturing industries. They include conditioning and storage of grain, preparation and rationing of animal feed; and provision of controlled environment in stock-rearing houses for intensive pig and poultry rearing and in greenhouses for horticultural farming. The usage of electricity in the farming business is currently not uniform across the globe because there are some continents that have challenges in their electrification supply especially Africa continent and this is affecting the productivity of their farm as compared to highly develop nations. The issue of farming is very important for everybody, so it will be very good if governments globally will support farmers to assist them get better electricity supply to enhance their productivity. This will be  the right step to boost global food supply and increase storage.\nfarmers all over the world want to drastically reduce operational cost, the current inventions of electric vehicle is another way of ensuring that there is less reliance on diesel and gasoline for their machines that comes at high cost and depends more on the usage of electric vehicles that even have positive implications on the environment. Currently  there are many electric tractors that is helping the farm work.",

One farming tactics that has aid in the production of food and vegetables is called hydroponics, this is a very great type of horticulture and a subset of hydroculture which clearly involves the growing of plants and vegetables without soil. There is something we all must understand that by clearly using nutrients solutions in an aqueous solvents, plants may grow their roots which is expose to nutrients liquid, which its root might physically be supported by some inert medium such as gravel, coconut coir and other essential substrates to ensure that the crop grow well to yield better for the farmer or gardener. The great news here is that there are so many plants and vegetables that can be grow with this type and method of farming.\nHydroponic farming is far better in this current times than never before because current farming on land is very difficult because there are shortage of lands and to get land now even is very expensive with so many farming land litigation a cross the globe. There are cheap farming methods under this and there are also expensive farming methods under this when one is doing it commercially or for individual usage or consumption. Te good news is that so any plants and vegetables or crops can be grown under this horticulture farming tactics such as tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and lettuce etc. Farmers must be aware that some nutrients used in hydroponics systems can come from, chemical fertilizers, fish excretions and duck manure. Hydroponics farming requires you to be more conscious and seek information from a experts if you lack information or you are a new starter.hydroponics farming need time and careful attention towards the produce  of the farms and make sure that always the water content is good and meet the required standard for the farm and plants or crops.",

      "description": "In the realm of innovative gardening systems, Vermiponics stands out as a unique fusion of vermiculture and hydroponics. This method involves using worms to break down organic matter and create nutrient-rich worm castings, which act as a natural fertilizer for plant growth. Unlike traditional aquaponics systems that rely on fish waste for nutrients. Vermiponics allows plants to thrive in a soil- less environment without the need for fish. By harnessing the power of worms, Vermiponics provides a sustainable and efficient way to grow plants indoors or limited spaces.\nWorms plays a crucial role in Vermiponics by converting organic waste into valuable nutrients that plants can readily absorb. These hardworking creatures help a balanced ecosystem where plants receive essential nourishment for the growth. With Vermiponics, you can enjoy the benefits of both vermiculture and hydroponics, leading to healthier and more vibrant plants in your indoor garden or small - scale farming setup. To set up a vermiponics system effectively, you will need essential components such as worm beds, plant beds, and a well-designed water circulation system between them. Here are some key instructions for setting up your vermiponics system: prepare worm beds, create a suitable environment for worms to thrive and produce nutrient-rich castings. Set up plant beds use gravel or a hydroponic medium in plant beds to support optimal plant growth. Establish water circulation: design a system that allows water to flow between the worm beds and plant beds efficiently.",

Der Kurs richtet sich an alle, die sich für ökologische Gestaltung, regenerative Landwirtschaft und ein harmonisches Zusammenleben mit der Natur interessieren.\nZu Beginn beschäftigen wir uns mit der grundlegenden Frage: Was ist Permakultur? Wir beleuchten die Ursprünge dieses Konzepts und zeigen auf, wie es weltweit angewendet wird, um natürliche Systeme zu erhalten und produktive Ökosysteme zu gestalten.\nIm zweiten Abschnitt tauchen wir in die Grundlagen der Ökologie ein. Wir untersuchen, wie natürliche Kreisläufe funktionieren, welche Wechselwirkungen zwischen Pflanzen, Tieren und Mikroorganismen bestehen und wie wir diese Erkenntnisse nutzen können, um nachhaltige Systeme zu entwerfen.\nEin zentraler Bestandteil der Permakultur sind ihre ethischen Grundsätze und Designprinzipien. Wir erläutern, wie Werte wie Erde pflegen, Menschen versorgen und Überschüsse teilen als Leitlinien für nachhaltiges Handeln dienen. Die Permakulturprinzipien helfen uns, durch Beobachtung, kreative Problemlösung und ressourcenschonendes Handeln effektive Lösungen für unterschiedliche Lebensräume zu finden.\nSchließlich beschäftigen wir uns mit dem Design natürlicher Systeme und den wichtigsten Werkzeugen, die uns helfen, resiliente und produktive Ökosysteme zu gestalten. Wir lernen, wie wir durch bewährte Methoden, wie Zonierung, Mustererkennung und Wassermanagement, nachhaltige Lösungen für Gartenbau, Landwirtschaft und Siedlungsplanung entwickeln können.\nDieser Kurs vermittelt nicht nur theoretisches Wissen, sondern inspiriert dazu, die Prinzipien der Permakultur praktisch anzuwenden und einen positiven Einfluss auf unsere Umwelt zu nehmen.",

      "description": "Horticulture is the branch of agriculture that involves the cultivation and management of plants, including fruits, vegetables, ornamental plants, flowers, and trees. It encompasses a wide range of practices, including plant propagation, plant breeding, crop production, soil management, pest control, and landscape design. Horticulturists work in a variety of settings, including commercial nurseries and greenhouses, fruit and vegetable farms, landscape design firms, and public gardens. They may be involved in growing plants for food, medicine, or ornamental purposes, or in creating and maintaining attractive and functional outdoor spaces. Horticulture is an important field that plays a vital role in feeding the world's growing population, preserving natural habitats and biodiversity, and enhancing the aesthetic and functional value of outdoor spaces. It combines the art and science of plant cultivation, and involves a deep understanding of plant biology, soil chemistry, and environmental factors that affect plant growth and development.\nHorticulture has been defined as the culture of plants, mainly for food, materials, comfort and beauty. According to an American horticulture scholar, \"Horticulture is the growing of flowers, fruits and vegetables, and of plants for ornament and fancy.\" A more precise definition can be given as \"The cultivation, processing, and sale of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and ornamental plants as well as many additional services”. It also includes plant conservation, landscape restoration, soil management, landscape and garden design, construction and maintenance, and arboriculture. In contrast to agriculture, horticulture does not include large-scale crop production or animal husbandry.\nHorticulture is the art of cultivating plants in gardens to produce food and medicinal ingredients, or for comfort and ornamental purposes. Horticulturists are agriculturists who grow flowers, fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs, as well as ornamental trees and lawns.\nThe study and practice of horticulture have been traced back thousands of years. Horticulture contributed to the transition from nomadic human communities to sedentary, or semi-sedentary, horticultural communities. Horticulture is divided into several categories which focus on the cultivation and processing of different types of plants and food items for specific purposes. In order to conserve the science of horticulture, multiple organizations worldwide educate, encourage, and promote the advancement of horticulture. Some notable horticulturists include Luca Ghini and Luther Burbank.\nHorticulture involves plant propagation and cultivation to improve plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, diseases, and environmental stresses. It also includes plant conservation, landscape restoration, soil management, landscape and garden design, construction and maintenance, and arboriculture. The word horticulture is modeled after agriculture; it derives from the Latin words hortus and cultura, which mean “garden” and “cultivation”, respectively. In contrast to agriculture, horticulture does not include intensive crop farming and large-scale crop production or animal husbandry. Additionally, horticulture focuses on the use of small plots with a wide variety of mixed crops while agriculture focuses on one large primary crop at a time.\nTypes of horticulture\nThere are several major areas of focus within the science of horticulture.[1] They include:\nOlericulture: the production of vegetables.\nPomology, also called fruticulture: the production of fruits and nuts.\nViticulture: the production of grapes (largely intended for winemaking).\nFloriculture: the production of flowering and ornamental plants.\nTurf management: the production and maintenance of turf grass for sports, leisure and amenity use.\nArboriculture: the cultivation and care of individual trees, shrubs, vines, and other perennial woody plants, primarily for landscape and amenity purposes.\nLandscape horticulture: the selection, production and care of plants used in landscape architecture.\nPostharvest physiology: the management of harvested horticultural crops to retard spoilage while stored or transported.",

With the year round temperatures and fertile soil, as Becky put it, “you could just throw seeds on the ground and they would grow!” Eventually Becky and her husband would move to Colorado and buy some land in Johnstown with the goal of fulfilling her lifelong dream of becoming a flower farmer. Becky soon discovered that growing her beloved roses in Colorado’s clay soil wouldn’t be quite as easy as just “throwing them on the ground”!\n\n\nThose early days did not provide the results she was looking for but through much determination and effort, Becky slowly cracked the code to growing roses in Colorado’s climate and clay soil. She eventually found that it really wasn’t that difficult at all but just required a few basic steps to get up and going.\n\n\nIn “Growing Roses in a Cold Climate”, Becky will walk you through step by step what she has learned over the course of all her seasons growing in Colorado. Learn when is the best time to plant your roses and why “hardening” them off before putting them in the ground is so critical. You’ll see a demonstration of how to plant a bare root rose bush along with pruning and winterizing.\n\n\nAfter taking this course, you’ll know everything you need to grow beautiful and fragrant roses in Zone 5 climates!",

The application of agricultural technology such as artificial intelligence will aid in enhance efficient and effective farming,  for farmers to gain more yields and reduce waste drastically. Artificial intelligence has being used in the applications to alleviate certain problems throughout industry and academia. Artificial intelligence like electricity and computers, is a general purpose technology that has a multitude of applications. It has being used in the fields of language translation, image recognition, credit scoring, e-commerce and other domains. Bringing the benefits of artificial intelligence and digital agriculture to all farmers requires accessibility to networks and affordable broadband internet access, not only in residence, but also in the fields. Farmers or small and medium-size enterprises must also make several complimentary investments, such as installing specialized infrastructure for collecting and transferring data.\nGreenhouse production processes are already highly automated and controlled but, similar to what is occurring in many sectors, artificial intelligence systems are now taking control to unprecedented levels. Because of their potential ability to process large amount of data and make tiny continuous adjustments, Artificial intelligence systems are beginning to provide operators with myriads of production-related benefits. Crop health management involves detection and actuation. Detecting might be further enriched by prediction but the extreme complexity of weeds, disease and pest dynamics has not resulted in many wide spread commercial solutions yet.",

      "description": "Out of all the components that go into gardening and farming, soil is by far the most important and yet is often the most overlooked.  Soil is the critical foundation on which everything you wish to grow is built. Without the right balance of nutrients and minerals, your plants will face a variety of issues from a lack of healthy leaves that are spotted or discolored to stems that are always short to plants that won’t even grow at all!\nEarly on in my gardening and flower farming days, I never gave much thought to soil and I was continually frustrated with my results at the end of the growing season. I thought if I just composted, that would be enough.  It wasn’t until I discovered Soil Testing that my gardens and fields really took off!\nBut the whole process of getting your soil tested can be intimidating in itself. The first time I got my soil test back I didn’t know how to interpret the results but I slowly but surely learned to read those charts just like reading a recipe and that’s what I want to share with you. That when you learn to balance your soil, much like measuring out the ingredients to baking a cake, there’s no limit to the kind of garden you can grow!",

In this course, which consists of three modules, you'll learn about the things you'll want to do to prepare to move into your new home, what to do in the first weeks and months and what yearly maintenance to do. There is also a module on some more ad-hoc DIY you may come across as well as an extra lesson on energy saving.\n\n\nThe objectives of this course are to give you the knowledge and confidence to tackle common household problems on your own from day one. What you can expect to achieve by the end is to have a maintenance schedule for your home and an idea of how to tackle both ah-hoc and regular maintenance jobs that come up, before they become a problem.\n\n\nModule One: Moving-in Essentials\nMoving can be stressful especially if you are moving into your first home. In this chapter you will be guided through the ways to prepare best for your move, what to do when you first arrive and what DIYs to prioritise in the first weeks and months to keep your house safe and secure.\n\n\nModule Two: Regular Home Maintenance\nThis chapter will guide you through the process of creating a maintenance schedule for your home. Regular maintenance is crucial for keeping your home in good condition. It will discuss tasks such as cleaning gutters, checking your boiler, installing your whitegoods and managing household pests. By establishing a maintenance schedule of what to do year round, you can stay on top of necessary tasks and prevent potential issues from arising.\n\n\nModule Three: Ad-Hoc Home Maintenance\nUnderstanding common household issues and knowing how to troubleshoot them can save you time and money. In this chapter, it will cover common problems like leaky taps, changing toilet seats, adjusting your doors and windows, and more. This will teach you how to identify the underlying causes of these issues and provide step-by-step instructions for troubleshooting and resolving them. By the end of this module, you will have the knowledge and confidence to tackle common ad-hoc household maintenance problems on your own",

Your output depends on many factors you often cannot control, including the animals you raise, the weather conditions in your area, and the price of equipment, supplies, and the farm you operate upon. Much like other businesses, cash flow is crucial to your success, and you can expect to encounter problems when managing your revenue at some point over the lifetime of your operation. Some entrepreneurs in the industry choose to cut costs in other areas of their business to free up cash or afford a growth opportunity, but you can preserve the integrity of your farm and make your operation stronger by securing financing to support you as you grow.\nWhether you need to purchase new equipment, stock up on inventory for an upcoming busy season, or hire additional staff, getting poultry farm loans could be what you need to take your business to the next level. To be able to draw up a budget, you will have to find out what materials, chickens and feed will cost in your area. It is not possible to provide these cost, as they may differ from one region to the next.",

      "description": "From tight curves to large sweeping curves, thin stock to thick timbers, bandsaws can handle it all. Equipped with the right blade, and correctly set up, the versatility of a bandsaw is amazing. This course, brought to you in conjunction with Woodworkers Guild of America, will provide you with the information you need to get the most out of your bandsaw, use it safely, and make it a go-to tool in your shop.\nWhat A Bandsaw Offers\nWhat makes bandsaws so great? Lots of things. They have a significant thickness capacity, with most saws able to cut 6” or more. The kerf of a bandsaw blade is quite small, so there’s very little waste going up the dust chute. Combined with the ability to cut curves or dead straight lines, a bandsaw can be one amazing machine.\nSet Up\nMany woodworkers consider their bandsaw only a coarse, rough cutting tool because they never learned to set it up correctly. It’s critical that the blade tracks correctly on the tires, the tires are clean, the guide blocks and thrust bearing are correctly set. Each of these aspects has a cumulative effect on how well (or how poorly) and bandsaw performs. Woodworkers Guild of America instructor George Vondriska takes you step-by-step through set up to make sure you get it right.\nUsing The Saw\nIn addition to being able to correctly set up the saw, we want to make sure you’re using it properly and safely. Our tips on controlling and steering the material will help make your cuts more accurate. And we’ll simplify the set up required for resawing.\nIn total, you’ll get over 115 minutes of hands-on video instruction in this course. In addition to the detailed video help you’ll receive, we have included downloadable resources and helpful information to print and keep, including: a detailed Guide you can follow and use as a reminder for the key points of the course instruction; and a resources document that will give you information on the products you’ll see in the course, including a handy Blade Radius Chart.",

      "description": "¿Te gustaría que tu ropa no se arrugara y que SIEMPRE estuviera ordenada?\nTe diría que no es magia, pero es que sí que lo es: el doblado mágico de baransu va mucho más allá del doblado vertical que has visto en cientos de vídeos por internet. Es una técnica depurada y adaptada a todas las prendas, tengan la forma, el tejido o el tamaño que tengan.\nNo importa lo que sea: ropa interior, camisetas, pantalones, faldas, vestidos... o incluso sábanas, toallas, trapos de cocina, bolsas... Ninguna prenda se resiste al doblado mágico.\nSi crees que el doblado vertical normal no te sirve... ¡estás en lo cierto! La ropa se cae, o no cabe en el cajón, o se desmonta... Por eso probé y probé hasta que encontré la técnica perfecta: el doblado mágico.\nEn este curso te voy a enseñar, en vídeos muy cortitos, cómo doblar cada una de las prendas que puedas imaginar. Aprenderás la técnica general y luego la podrás aplicar a cada prenda, por extraña que sea. Ah, y si necesitas consultar cómo se dobla una prenda en concreto, la encontrarás en seguida, porque en cada vídeo solo enseño un tipo de prenda (aunque a veces hay diferentes estilos de la misma prenda).\n¡Seguro que vas a encontrar una solución para todas y cada una de las prendas de ropa que hay en tu armario! E incluso para otros objetos textiles, como manteles, sábanas o trapos de cocina.\nPruébalo en un cajón y sorpréndete cuando, después de 3 meses, esté exactamente igual de ordenado que el primer día.\nVas a preguntarte cómo has podido vivir doblando en horizontal toda tu vida. Vas a bendecir el día que te apuntaste a este curso.\nVas a tener adicción a doblar en vertical, te lo aseguro.",
