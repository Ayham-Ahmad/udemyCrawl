An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\n\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network. An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals.\n\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\n\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\n\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system. An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement. An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer. They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them. With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles.\n\n\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\n\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk. For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\n\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks. When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing :\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched. Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\n\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack.\n\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results.\n\n\nWhy do you want to take this Course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhether you work in machine learning or finance, Whether you're pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python and data science are among the essential skills you can learn.\nPython's simple syntax is particularly suitable for desktop, web, and business applications.\nThe Python instructors at OAK Academy are experts in everything from software development to data analysis and are known for their practical, intimate instruction for students of all levels.\nOur trainers offer training quality as described above in every field, such as the Python programming language.\nLondon-based OAK Academy is an online training company.

Kubernetes helps you automate, deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. It gives you the freedom to take advantage of on-premise cloud infrastructures. It also helps you write better cloud-native applications. Kubernetes is a core tool in DevOps; it gives you the ability to schedule and manage containers (Docker or otherwise) at scale. If you’re looking to use Kubernetes in production and have a better understanding of how to manage your containers using Kubernetes. then this Course is perfect for you!\nThis comprehensive 2-in-1 course is a fast-paced guide offering hands-on and practical guidance with step-by-step instructions to design, implement and deploy Kubernetes Cluster for production grid environment. You’ll initially get up and running with fundamentals of Kubernetes and container orchestration. You'll build your own container cluster and manage it as well as secure the cluster and handle service discovery. Moving further, you'll streamline the way you deploy and manage your applications with large-scale container orchestration. Also, monitor and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters and run highly available Kubernetes. Finally, you’ll be able to use Kubernetes in production and will have a better understanding of how to manage your containers using Kubernetes.\nBy the end of this course, you'll containerize your applications to build a production-class container infrastructure in the ‘Kubernetes way’.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 2 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Kubernetes in 7 Days, covers managing applications in a productionised Kubernetes. This course will help you to unravel the potential of Kubernetes in the shortest amount of time. You will begin by creating your first Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. Then move on to exploring Kubernetes in some more detail and build a complex cluster. By the 4th Day, you will learn to enhance your cluster with a Grafana based monitoring dashboard in your application. Once you’ve acquired knowledge on dashboards, explore how a Kubernetes cluster provisions storage to its applications and learn how to secure them. Finally, learn to create a CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy your applications.\nThe second course, Kubernetes Recipes, covers how to orchestrate and automate deployment with Kubernetes services. You will first learn how Kubernetes works with containers and will work through an overview of the main Kubernetes features such as pods, replication controllers, and more. Next, you will learn how to create Kubernetes clusters and how to run programs on Kubernetes. Then you will be introduced to features such as high availability, setting up Kubernetes masters, using Kubernetes with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes using AWS. Later, you will explore how to use Kubernetes-UI and how to set up and manage Kubernetes clusters on the cloud and bare-metal. You will also work through recipes on microservice management with Kubernetes. Upon completion of this course, you will be able to use Kubernetes in production and will have a better understanding of how to manage your containers using Kubernetes.\nBy the end of this course, you'll containerize your applications to build a production-class container infrastructure in the ‘Kubernetes way’.\nAbout the Authors\n● Des Drury is a passionate technologist with many years' experience in all aspects of data center infrastructure, automation, programming languages, and developer workflows.

When these deux topic are mastered, you can set up a secure roaming agreement within a few minutes !!! This lecture is Network Server agnostic and we will make demonstration with Actility, The Things Industries and ChirpStack Network Server. Finally, we are going to explain the two available options to set a a Roaming agreement : peer to peer agreement or global roaming hub. There are two global roaming infrastructures available on the market : Actility Roaming Hub and Packet Broker (The Things Industries).\nAt Savoy Mont Blanc university, we have our own private network with hundreds of devices connected. So we will take our network as a real example of a LoRaWAN infrastructure and connect several Join Servers with several Roaming agreements.",

Kali Linux is an operating system and there are many tools to perform such attacks.\nWeak passwords are still a huge problem in the security world. Users must set strong passwords to restrict access to data by anonymous users. Even a 6-digit PIN is not secure enough and can be brute-forced within an hour. A rule of thumb for passwords is that it should be longer (more than 9 words) and contain different or multiple letters+numbers+special characters.\nHydra is a pre-installed tool in Kali Linux to enforce usernames and passwords for various services such as FTP, ssh, Telnet, MS SQL, etc. Brute force can be used to identify different usernames and passwords against a target with the correct credentials. It is a command line tool that you will learn to use in this course.\nIn this course you will learn how to crack passwords using Kali Linux.  Kali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. It does this by providing common tools, configurations, and automation's.\nThis is a beginners course, you don't need advanced knowledge but you should have already Kali Linux at hands.",

      "description": "With the huge growth in the number of web applications in the recent times, there has also been an upsurge in the need to make these applications secure. Web penetration testing is the use of tools and code to attack a website or web app in order to assess its vulnerabilities to external threats. While there are an increasing number of sophisticated ready-made tools to scan systems for vulnerabilities, the use of Python allows testers to write system-specific scripts, or alter and extend existing testing tools to find, exploit, and record as many security weaknesses as possible.\nThis course will walk you through the web application penetration testing methodology, showing you how to write your own tools with Python for every main activity in the process. It will show you how to test for security vulnerabilities in web applications just like security professionals and hackers do.\nThe course starts off by providing an overview of the web application penetration testing process and the tools used by professionals to perform these tests. Then we provide an introduction to HTTP and how to interact with web applications using Python and the Requests library. Then will follow the web application penetration testing methodology and cover each section with a supporting Python example. To finish off, we test these tools against a vulnerable web application created specifically for this course.\nStop just running automated tools—write your own and modify existing ones to cover your needs! This course will give you a flying start as a security professional by giving you the necessary skills to write custom tools for different scenarios and modify existing Python tools to suit your application’s needs.\nAbout The Author\nChristian Martorella has been working in the field of Information Security for the last 16 years, and is currently working as Principal Program Manager in the Skype Product Security team at Microsoft.

      "description": "Welcome this comprehensive course on Ethical Hacking! This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in hacking and by the end of it you'll be able to hack systems like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts!\nThis course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory, so we'll start with ethical hacking basics and the different fields in penetration testing, installing the needed software (works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and then we'll dive and start hacking systems straight away. From here onwards you'll learn everything by example, by analysing and exploiting computer systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc, so we'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.\nThe course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to practically exploit theses weaknesses and hack into it, not only that but you'll also learn how to secure this system from the discussed attacks. This course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level by the time you finish, you will have knowledge about most penetration testing fields.\n\n\nThe course is divided into four main sections:\n1. Network Hacking - This section will teach you how to test the security of networks, both wired and wireless. First, you will learn some basic network terminology, how networks work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:\nPre-connection attacks: in this subsection you'll learn what can you do before even connecting to a network, and even before having internet access; you'll start by learning how to gather information about the networks around you, discover the devices connected to them, and how to control connections around you (ie: deny/allow devices from connecting to networks) even without knowing the password of the target network.\nGaining Access: Now that you gathered information about the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to crack the key and get the password to your target network weather it uses WEP, WPA or even WPA2.\nPost Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of powerful techniques that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, see anything they do on the internet (such as login information, passwords, visited urls, images, videos ....etc), redirect requests, inject evil code in loaded pages and much more! All the attacks here work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to create a fake WiFi network, attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.\n\n\n2. Gaining Access - In this section you will learn two main approaches to gain full control or hack computer systems:\nServer Side Attacks: In this subsection you will learn how to gain full access to computer systems without the need for user interaction. You will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as its operating system, open ports, installed services, then you'll learn how to use this information to discover weaknesses and vulnerabilitiesand exploit them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will learn how to generate different types of reports for your discoveries.\nClient Side Attacks - If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to gain access to it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by hijacking updatesor backdoornig downloadeds on the fly. Not only that but you'll also learn how to create trojans by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use social engineering to deliver this trojan to the target, to do this you'll learn how to spoof emails so they appear as if they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with.\n\n\n3. Post Exploitation - In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’ll learn how to access the file system (read/write/upload/execute), maintain your access, spy on the target and even use the target computer as a pivot to hack other computer systems.\n\n4. Website / Web Application Hacking - In this section you will learn how websites work, how to gather information about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc) and how to discover and exploit the following dangerous vulnerabilities to hack into websites:\nFile Upload.\nCode Execution.\nLocal File Inclusion.\nRemote File Inclusion.\nSQL Injection.\nCross Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n\nAt the end of each section you will learn how to detect, prevent and secure your system and yourself from the discussed attacks.\n\n\nAll the techniques in this course are practical and work against real systems, you'll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you'll learn how to use it to hack into the target system, so by the end of the course you'll be able to modify the these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to different situations and different scenarios.\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n\n\nNOTE: This course is created for educational purposes only and all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against devices that I have permission to test.\nWho this course is for:\nAnybody who is interested in learning ethical hacking / penetration testing\nAnybody who wants to learn how hackers hack computer systems\nAnybody who wants to learn how to secure their systems from hackers",

      "description": "How many times do you actually come across this term ‘cloud computing’ or the word ‘cloud’? How much do you know about it? How can it benefit you? Most importantly, have you already started using it? Do not get overwhelmed with these questions as they point to the core of a revolution that our generation is experiencing. Let’s sum everything up in one line: Cloud computing has made our work easier, increased efficiency, and reduced costs.  The concept of cloud computing can be summarized as – “Let someone else host machines and servers for you.”\nWhile this may be an oversimplification of this vast concept; but it does touch upon the root idea. With the concept of cloud computing, the world is also introduced to the concept of cloud storage. Cloud computing has made possible to store your data in the cloud without you having to maintain dedicated physical hardware. Cloud storage also solves the scalability problems associated with on-site data storage efficiently.  In case of a cloud file storage server, you have the freedom to choose the amount of space you need, and the icing on the cake is that someone else is handling all the pain of maintaining data storage servers for you.\nMicrosoft Azure Storage Services provides top-end cloud-based storage services to its users.\nOpportunity is Knocking\nLet us look at these statistics:\nAs estimated by McKinsey Global Institute, in the coming days there could be a scarcity of about 140,000 to 190,000 workers in the U.S. The workers with analytical skills are required to work with big data and associated enterprises.\nFor these workers, the average salary is roughly around $120,000+.\nAs per the report by Ryerson-led Canada’s Big Data Consortium in 2015, there is a shortage of about 19,000 professionals that possess data and analytical skills. While there has been a significant shortage of professionals possessing deep analytical literacy and the number goes up to 150,000.\nThere has been a significant rise in demand for cloud experts and data scientists as more and more companies are switching to cloud-based storage setup. As per the latest Q1 FY 2018 results, it is reported that Microsoft's Azure has single-handedly generated revenue growth of 90% as compared to the previous year's report. When it comes to gaining ground in application workload, Azure holds 29.4%.\nWhy Azure?\nAzure offers cloud-based digital data storage solutions that comprise of an extensive range of data services. You get access to blobs, files storage, queue and table storages in a timely and reliable manner.  One remarkable feature of Azure is that it replicates your stored data across its various datacenters to tackle the problem of data destruction due to unexpected threats or hazards.\nAzure takes the hassle out of the task of managing data on the cloud-based platform as most of the critical data management issues are handled by Azure itself. The best thing about it is that you have all the right to your data anytime and anywhere in the world without the need of installing or maintaining any type of dedicated hardware or software. The data is available over HTTP, HTTPs, and Azure provides development kits over a wide range of programming languages. It also supports PowerShell CLI.\nWhat will you learn?\nThis course would focus on providing you with hands-on knowledge of managing and employing data storage strategies on Azure.\nWork with different disk types and storage accounts available to you as an Azure user\nCreate managed and unmanaged disk types as well as the conversion process of managed to unmanaged disks and vice-versa\nThe concepts and applications of storage pools\nHandy tips and tools for a smooth workflow on Azure\nAnd much more\nWhat sets us apart?\nDesigning, deploying and managing scalable containerized applications in the cloud is a real technical challenge for DevOps and IT teams. At TetraNoodle we focus on in-demand skills and real-world education. Gaining this practical knowledge and experience with these cloud and containerisation frameworks will be very valuable for your career. And it will be a right step towards improving your work or project or career prospects. Numerous Fortune 500 and Fortune 100 companies such as Hewlett-Packard, McAfee, and Adobe, just to name few are constantly in search for cloud experts to manage their infrastructure and related resources.\nThis course, “Azure MasterClass: Manage your Storage and Disks in the Cloud with Azure Storage” will provide you with all the information you need to get started with Azure Storage.\nSo if you are ready to master the techniques and learn the tools for Managing your Storage and Disks in the Cloud with Azure Storage, then make sure you click the “Add to Cart” button.\nGrab your copy today!

It serves as the cornerstone for understanding more advanced chemical concepts and applications. At its core, general chemistry deals with the structure, properties, composition, and changes of matter. Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass, and it exists in three primary states: solid, liquid, and gas.\nThermochemistry explores the energy changes involved in chemical processes. It examines how heat is absorbed or released during reactions and introduces concepts like enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Additionally, general chemistry covers solutions and their properties, including concentration, solubility, and colligative properties. Chemical reactions involve the transformation of substances into new products through the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. These reactions are represented by chemical equations that must be balanced to obey the law of conservation of mass. Reaction types include synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, double replacement, and combustion.\ngeneral chemistry provides the essential knowledge needed to understand the composition, structure, and changes of matter. It integrates quantitative and qualitative analysis to explain both simple and complex chemical phenomena, laying the groundwork for fields like biochemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry.",

However, the key difference between vPC and VSS is that VSS creates a single logical switch. This results in a single control plane for both management and configuration purposes. Whereas with vPC each switch is managed and configured independently.\nIt is important to remember that with vPC both switches are managed independently.

      "description": "This course provides a comprehensive overview of Automotive Ethernet, its role in modern vehicle architecture, and why it's increasingly vital in the automotive industry. We will start by explaining what Automotive Ethernet is and why it is becoming the backbone of vehicle networking, especially as vehicles evolve towards higher levels of automation. With the increasing demand for higher data rates, seamless connectivity, and real-time communication in vehicles, traditional protocols like CAN, CAN FD, LIN, FlexRay, and MOST are often insufficient in handling the requirements of advanced applications.\nThrough detailed comparisons, you'll explore the pros and cons of Automotive Ethernet versus these protocols in terms of bandwidth, latency, reliability, cost, and scalability. While protocols like CAN and LIN have been industry standards for decades, they struggle to meet the demands of autonomous driving and the increasing complexity of modern vehicle systems. In contrast, Automotive Ethernet delivers the speed, flexibility, and efficiency needed to enable these cutting-edge applications.\nIn addition to discussing the technical advantages, we will delve into different levels of automated driving, from driver assistance systems to fully autonomous vehicles, and how Automotive Ethernet plays a pivotal role in facilitating these developments. The course will also explain the crucial role of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) in modern vehicles and provide real-life applications that highlight its significance, such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, and emergency braking.\nMoreover, we will cover important terms like V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything), V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle), V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure), and V2P (Vehicle-to-Pedestrian) and explore how these technologies are shaping the future of connected vehicles. These systems are crucial for improving traffic safety, efficiency, and autonomy.\nFinally, we'll address the cybersecurity implications of integrating Automotive Ethernet. As vehicle connectivity increases, so does the potential attack surface. You will learn about the challenges and strategies for securing in-vehicle networks in the context of modern cybersecurity threats.\nThis course is designed to provide you with a deep understanding of Automotive Ethernet and its impact on vehicle architecture, communication, automation, and security, preparing you for the future of automotive technology.",

This course is a heavily hands-on introduction to both RESTful as well as GraphQL API vulnerabilities. These APIs are very common in modern web and mobile applications.\nYour instructor is Martin Voelk. He is a Cyber Security veteran with 25 years of experience. Martin holds some of the highest certification incl. CISSP, OSCP, OSWP, Portswigger BSCP, CCIE, PCI ISA and PCIP. He works as a consultant for a big tech company and engages in Bug Bounty programs where he found thousands of critical and high vulnerabilities.\nThis course features theoretical introductions into API vulnerabilities followed by practical exploitations of common RESTful API and GraphQL API vulnerabilities. Some labs are being performed utilizing the Portswigger Web Academy Labs. Other labs are performed on standalone VMs such as crAPI and DVGA. As people use different platforms, The training will not show the set up of crAPI or DVGA. But you can install these easily on a free virtualization software like virtual box on Windows or MacOSX. Martin will be solving a lot of labs and explains each step on finding the vulnerability and why it can be exploited in a certain way. The videos are easy to follow along and replicate. This training is highly recommended for anyone who wants to start out in API Penetration Testing or API Bug Bounty Hunting.\nThe course features the following topics.\nREST API Introduction\nREST API Discovery and Recon\nREST API Enumeration\nREST API Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)\nREST API Broken Authentication\nREST API Broken Object Property Level Authorization\nREST API Excessive Data Exposure\nREST API Mass Assignment\nREST API Unrestricted Resource Consumption\nREST API Broken Function Level Authorization (BLFA)\nREST API Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows\nREST API Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\nREST API Security Misconfiguration\nREST API Improper Inventory Management\nREST API Unsafe Consumption of APIs\nREST API Server-side parameter pollution\nGraphQL Introduction\nGraphQL What is it?\nGraphQL Key terminologies\nGraphQL Burp extensions\nGraphQL Wordlists\nGraphQL Payloads\nGraphQL Tools\nGraphQL API Attack Surface, Recon, Enumeration\nGraphQL Attack Surface Analysis\nGraphQL GET requests and the issues\nGraphQL POST requests\nGraphQL Information Disclosure\nGraphQL Introspection\nGraphQL GET vs. POST Introspection\nGraphQL Introspection filter bypass example\nGraphQL Non-prod GraphQL endpoints\nGraphQL Field Suggestion\nGraphQL Automating Field Suggestion\nGraphQL Field Stuffing\nGraphQL Abusing Error Messages\nGraphQL IDE\nGraphQL DoS\nGraphQL Deep Recursion Query Attack\nGraphQL Circular Fragment Vulnerabilities\nGraphQL Batch Query Attacks / Resource Intensive Query Attacks\nGraphQL Field Duplication Attacks\nGraphQL Alias based attacks (DoS scenario)\nGraphQL Directive Overloading\nGraphQL Object Limit Overriding\nGraphQL Array-Based Query Batching\nGraphQL Authentication and Authorization attacks\nGraphQL Login functions\nGraphQL Bypassing protections\nGraphQL Alias based attacks / query batching\nGraphQL JWT token forgery\nGraphQL Cookie forgery\nGraphQL Access control issues and IDORs\nGraphQL Injection attacks\nGraphQL OS Command Injection\nGraphQL SQL Injection\nGraphQL HTML Injection\nGraphQL XSS (Cross-site scripting)\nGraphQL Request Forgery and Hijacking\nGraphQL Server-side request forgery (SSRF)\nGraphQL Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)\nGraphQL GET based CSRF\nGraphQL POST based CSRF\nGraphQL Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH)\nOnline RESTful and GraphQL Penetration Testing Playgrounds without local install\nNotes & Disclaimer\nPortswigger labs are a public and a free service from Portswigger for anyone to use to sharpen their skills.

Course has been designed in a way so that any novice, (from Zero level) to the advanced level of people in cyber security field can easily understand and can be well-benefited. As it is a step-by-step process, from zero to high level, we encourage you to try to understand exclusively the part one; then after, jump into the next parts to get what you need to know about cryptology, network establishment, firewall, hacking, eavesdrop, empower the security, etc...(as if you were sitting in a Master & PhD cryptology classroom).\nTherefore, after completing our courses (parts 1 - 4), you will meet with the most used encryption techniques, methods used to mitigate the probability of being hacked by Black-Hat hackers.\n-The most recent ways of hacking into a wireless network, no matter what protocols the Wifi was set with by its administrator. Furthermore, no matter how strong the Wifi password is, so that we dupe someone's network. We explain the reasons behind the scene of such attacks. Exploitation of the existed holes that the most used Operating Systems contain, such as (Linux based, Windows, Mac OS, Android)\nWe deeply explain why RSA is that so strong and why it is highly used in real-life cybersecurity, as well as AES encryption.\nMost Well-known Encrypting Algorithms, such as ElGamal, RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and so on forth (Encryption and Decryption steps) are well described. It is crucial for cybersecurity engineers in Master and in PhD classes.\nNote:\nIn this course, we supply to you not only videos for the practice, but also we provide a light text file for each part of the tutorial which is exclusively self-explanatory (a step-by-step process) so that we make it easier to learn according to the obligations that you might face while you want to continue with your practice.\nExample of a situation: you might need to continue with your tutorial where you are at a specific place, and don't want to disturb anybody while you forgot your earphone/headphone.",

      "description": "What Is Hash Cracking?\nUnlike encryption, hashing isn’t reversible. The only way to “recover” the password from the hash is to make a guess as to what the password is, run it through the hashing algorithm, and see if the result matches the hash you have. As you’d expect with such a prolific and time-consuming challenge, the tooling available to attackers is very mature; John the Ripper and Hashcat collectively support a huge number of hash types with all sorts of fancy features and exceptional performance optimizations. At the end of the day though, the biggest challenge isn’t the software – it’s the hardware.\nHash Cracking Rigs\nIf you’ve ever spent more than five minutes researching password cracking, you’ve probably come across forum posts of folks bragging about their “cracking rigs”: several-thousand-dollar custom builds with the singular focus of cranking out hashes as fast as possible. The cool kids all seem to show up with eight GPUs and talk about the killer hash rates they’re capable of. After all, the more quickly you can test your guesses, the faster you’ll land on the right one!\nThe cost of running these rigs dissuades almost everyone from participating in the practice. We maintain a couple of dedicated cracking rigs here at Coalfire; sure, they were expensive to buy, but running that hardware isn’t cheap on electricity either. All told, the hardware, electricity, and maintenance run in the tens of thousands of dollars per year; definitely not a price within range of even the most passionate enthusiast.\nPassword recovery is a battle against math,\ntime, cost, and human behavior; and much like any battle, the tactics are\nconstantly evolving.",

      "description": "The Controller Area Network (CAN) is an automotive standard network that utilizes a 2 wire bus to transmit and receive data.  It is more common in modern cars that we can find CAN bus system for information exchange. CAN bus system uses frames to transmit the Application data. Each node on the network has the capability to transmit 0 to 8 bytes of data in a message frame.  A message frame consists of a message header, followed by 0 to 8 data bytes, and then a checksum. The message header contains a unique identifier that determines the message priority also message ids are unique in the bus system. Any node on the network can transmit data if the bus is free. If multiple nodes attempt to transmit at the same time, an arbitration scheme is used to determine which node will control the bus. Arbitration uses wired AND operation to determine the winner. The message with the highest priority, as defined in its header, will win the arbitration and its message will be transmitted. The losing message will retry to send its message as soon as it detects a bus free state. Course aims to cover complete CAN bus system standard, how to program can network using python programming with real time examples",

Leveraging the extensive knowledge and experience of the OWASP's open community contributors, the report is based on a consensus among security experts from around the world.\n\n\nWhat is File upload vulnerabilities?\nFile upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size.\n\n\n\n\nFile upload vulnerabilities are a serious issue that can allow attackers to upload malicious code or files to a web application, potentially giving them access to sensitive information or allowing them to take control of the system. A comprehensive course on file upload vulnerabilities would cover the following topics:\nIntroduction to file upload vulnerabilities: Explanation of what file upload vulnerabilities are, how they can be exploited, and the potential impact of an attack.\nTypes of file upload vulnerabilities: Overview of the different types of file upload vulnerabilities, including direct object reference, insufficient file type validation, unrestricted file upload, and others.\nPrevention and mitigation techniques: Discussion of the best practices for preventing and mitigating file upload vulnerabilities, including file type validation, file size restrictions, file name restrictions, and other security measures.\nExploitation of file upload vulnerabilities: Explanation of how attackers can exploit file upload vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data, install malware, or take control of the system.\nDetection and testing: Overview of the methods used to detect and test for file upload vulnerabilities, including manual testing, automated tools, and other techniques.\nCase studies and real-world examples: Discussion of real-world examples of file upload vulnerabilities, including lessons learned and best practices.\nSecure coding practices: Overview of the secure coding practices that can help prevent file upload vulnerabilities, including input validation, output encoding, and other security measures.\nCompliance and audits: Explanation of the various regulations, standards, and best practices related to file upload vulnerabilities and how they are audited and enforced.\nPatching and remediation: Explanation of how file upload vulnerabilities can be patched and remediated, including methods for fixing the underlying code or applying security updates.\nHands-on experience: Practical exercises that allow students to gain hands-on experience in identifying, testing, and remediating file upload vulnerabilities.\nThis course would be suitable for developers, security professionals, and anyone interested in improving their understanding of file upload vulnerabilities and how to prevent them. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to identify, test for, and remediate file upload vulnerabilities in web applications, helping to protect against malicious attacks and safeguard sensitive data.",

These techniques range from physical observation to the electronic monitoring of conversations.\nSo how this relates to ethical hacking well in ethical hacking our primary goal is to check the security of data, correct!\nNow it’s not necessary that data should be in hard drive or on cloud or on any system, data is everywhere like in a meeting room if you discussing your company’s future plans or any financial possibilities for current projects or future projects, sure you don’t want to disclose this information to your competitors so that's also a form of data which you have to keep secure!\nNow the question raises how my meeting room conversion can be leaked to my competitors even if all the employees are reliable and faithful to the company. Over there Surveillance takes place. So by applying surveillance tools and techniques your meeting room or your office cabin conversion can be leaked and by applying the same tools and techniques your home, office or your strictly personal data can be leaked out and used against you.\nIn these course, we will see different tools and techniques of surveillance. We will see specifications of these tools and check out their potential in the practical field.\nSo this course is going to be less technical and more on focusing on surveillance tools and how to use these surveillance tools in different fields.\nThis course is not just for technical persons, we have designed this course keeping in mind the corporate sector and business executives so anyone can take this course and understand the sensitivity of how important it is to keep our conversions secure. At the same time technical persons can take this course and explore the new dimension of capturing data and how to use that data in ethical hacking. So this course is for everyone with or without any technical knowledge.",

The first thing you will learn is some basic information about ethical hacking and the different fields in penetration testing.\nThis course covers all the important techniques related with WIRELESS NETWORK (or WiFi) HACKING and SYSTEM HACKING used by hackers, system administrators and pentesters.\n\nThis course is focused on the practical side of penetration testing without neglecting the theory behind each attack. Before jumping into penetration testing, you will first learn how to set up a lab and install needed software to practice penetration testing on your own machine. All the attacks explained in this course are launched against real devices in my lab.\nThis course takes an in-depth look to get your started with setting up base to work with Linux, Networking, Wireless systems, Windows. Using readily available tools and custom developed practice scenarios, you will navigate your way through the techniques attacker use to hack and also ways to protect it.\n\nThe course is structured in a way that will take you through the basics of linux, computer systems, networks and how devices communicate with each other. We will start by talking about how we can exploit these systems to carry out a number of powerful attacks. This course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level -- by the time you finish, you will have knowledge about most penetration testing fields.\nIt is an Offensive World to be Defenced.!!!",

      "description": "Getting into the field of cyber security for most people is quite complicated because resources that map out a very clear path into the feld are very scarce. With that said, there is no shortage of information about this subject but if care is not taken in leveraging a lot of the available resources, one is very likely to get more confused than enlightened. This is the challenge that this course aims to solve through the DRAPE methodology, which is a blueprint for getting into cyber security. DRAPE is an acronym for Discover, Relate, Acquire, Plan and Execute.\nWhile developing this course, the author figured that having a blueprint like this should make things easier for individuals who are trying to break into the field of cyber security. This thought was fueled by his experience as a cyber talent developer who has been privileged to help many individuals break into the field.\nIn cracking the cyber security career code, the first thing you want to do is DISCOVER the field. In this course, you did that by understanding fundamental cyber security attributes and the motivations of enterprise defenders and cyber adversaries in relation to cyber defense and cyber attack, respectively. You also learned about what it takes to break into cyber security, as well as overview of cyber threats, common types of threat actors, and overview of vulnerabilities.\nThen you need to RELATE your discoveries about the field of cyber security to how they might apply in enterprise environments. In this section of the course, you learned about what keeps cyber security professionals up at night, the cyber kill chain framework, taking a lifecycle approach to vulnerability management, common avenues of cyber attacks, threat hunting, and the relationship between cyber security and IT. Knowledge gained in the “relate” phase of the course sheds light on the intersection of theory and practice. Consider the discover phase as theory of cyber security and the relate phase as its practice.\nThe ACQUIRE phase is relatively straightforward; what you want to do here is ensure that you’ve acquired the fundamental knowledge and skills required to break into cyber security, as well as the attributes needed to thrive as a professional. The previous two phases (Discover and Relate) are about what you need to know as you try to break into the field while this phase is about the skills and attributes that you need to acquire to give yourself a decent chance.\nOnce you’ve mastered every aspect of the previous three phases, you need to develop a PLAN of attack and pick your battle as the situation demands. In this section of the course, you learned about how to stay abreast of evolution in the cyber threat and technology landscape, your professional certification choices, and the cyber security career decision tree. All you now need to do is plan your next move based on what you now know.\nEXECUTION comes after the plan phase. As Morris Chang said, without strategy, execution is aimless. Without execution, strategy is useless. Your ultimate goal is to break into cyber security and be successful there, and everything you learned up to this point in this course can be considered the strategic aspect of plan towards actualizing that goal. Now, it’s time to execute by taking steps that move you closer to your goal. In this section of the course, you learned that attending conferences and meet ups can be quite beneficial. You also learned about how to search for jobs in the true sense of the word “search”, how to create an impressive resume, a good cover letter, and how to approach your job interview whether it’s a telephone interview or a face-to-face interview.",

      "description": "Welcome to The Mastering Nuclei with Automation for Pentesting and Bug Bounty course. This course opens the doors to those wanting to be ahead in a penetration testing or bug bounty career. This course will prepare learners to take their information security career journey to the next level with exclusive first content to be on top and avoid duplicates. This course covers web application attacks and how to earn bug bounties. There is no prerequisite of prior hacking knowledge, and you will be able to perform web attacks, hunt bugs on live websites, and secure them.\nThis course is not like other hacking or penetration testing courses with outdated manual techniques. It enables learners to automate Bug Bounties and increases efficiency by teaching automation and industry-oriented techniques.\nThis course is designed to ensure that the latest content reaches you on time. It will be full of ready-to-use private YAML templates and custom automation scripts to help students achieve bounties.\nYou will learn about the Nuclei tool, how to write custom templates, and gain access to templates that are not publicly available.\nThis course is divided into multiple sections, each covering how to hunt, exploit, and mitigate a vulnerability in an ethical manner.\nDetailed Breakdown of Course Content\nEach section begins with the fundamental principles of how the attack works, exploitation, and how to write a professional report.\nIntroduction – This section introduces the course, roadmap, and how to get the most out of it.\nAll About Nuclei – This chapter provides a guide to Nuclei, starting from a beginner's perspective. It explains the limitations of grep and regex tools, the motivation behind using Nuclei, and its foundational workings. Students will learn how to write simple and effective templates for identifying vulnerabilities.\nNuclei Template Writing: Simple GET-based Matcher – This section covers the basics of Nuclei template writing using a GET request. Students will learn how to create a GET-based YAML template to match the output using Nuclei Vulnerability Scanner. It also explains how to match responses in the body and headers of HTTP requests.\nNuclei Template Writing: Simple POST-based Matcher – Similar to the previous section, this covers POST requests. Students will learn how to write POST-based YAML templates to identify vulnerabilities and understand how to match output in HTTP request bodies and headers.\nNuclei New YAML Templates – This section contains exclusive Nuclei templates that are not available in the community repository. Each template will be broken down to explain how vulnerabilities are exploited, internal workings, endpoints, and other parameters. This helps students avoid duplicates and improve the chances of reporting valid vulnerabilities.\nAfter identifying a vulnerability, students will learn how to exploit it for maximum severity and report it professionally.\nThis course also covers how to start a bug hunting journey on well-known platforms like Bugcrowd, HackerOne, and Open Bug Bounty.\nAdditionally, students will learn how to hunt and report vulnerabilities to NCIIPC (Government of India), private companies, and responsible disclosure programs.\nWith this course, you get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions, you can post them in the Q&A section, and we will respond as soon as possible.\nNotes\nThis course is created for educational purposes only. All attacks demonstrated have been ethically reported and fixed.\nTesting any website that does not have a Responsible Disclosure Policy is unethical and against the law.

Regardless of what job you end up choosing, having at least a foundational understanding of how data travels all around us is very beneficial.\nSo in this course, we're going to learn just that starting with how data travels using physical connections. But physical connections alone aren't enough to make the internet work. We also need to answers questions like: how does data know exactly where to go? Say I'm sending an email to someone - how does that email know to go to that other person's inbox, and no one else's?\nOr even reading this right now. How did you receive this text and the images on this page that are stored in a different part of the world than where you're located? How does all of it transfer in seconds or even milliseconds?\nThese are fascinating questions that can be answered once we understand how the physical and virtual backbone of the Internet works. Once we understand how human-readable information gets transformed into a format that machines can process, and then back into a human-readable format again. Once we understand how models and standards were created to dictate a set of rules for how devices should communicate.\nOnce we look at all of that, and more, then we start to see how everything is interconnected and how the Internet is able to function the way it does.\nJoin us as we unpack the mysteries of networking and learn Networking Fundamentals that you'll be able to carry with you throughout your entire IT career!",

AND you want to learn how Kubernetes is actually used in the real world?\n\n\nIf so, keep reading.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Get\nA Kubernetes and containerization course with the content you need to use Kubernetes in the real world. This content was created from real-world scenarios and real production experiences from implementing Kubernetes.\n\n\nThis Course Takes Feedback!\nAs we all know as engineers, creating a course like this can go in a million different directions. There are literally hundreds or thousands of different ways to do production Kubernetes deployments. Because of that, I want to take your feedback into consideration. If you feel that I've missed something, please tell me and I'll work on adding it. The goal of this course is for it to be a \"Forever Edition\".\nThe other part of this feedback process is my own (Michael Levans) feedback. For example, I may think in a month \"Oh, I should really add a video about this into the course\". I'll then record it and add it to the course at no additional charge to you. You'll get the extra video for free. This is the joy of creating on a platform like Udemy. I can update the course whenever I want.\n\n\nWhat This Course Is Not\nAs an engineer, there are often times that you have to deploy something to production without going incredibly in-depth into the technology. Why? Because chances are you have a million other deployments you have to do and overall tech management. You simply may not have the time to dive deep into each technology.\nThis course is very-much following the same protocol. You're going to learn how to think about and deploy production workloads on Kubernetes, but you aren't going to dive as deep as possible into each stack like Service Mesh and GitOps. Why? Because if we did that, this course would be over 500 hours long and that length wouldn't be very beneficial for most.\nThis course will go in-depth on how to deploy to production, but it will not go in-depth for every single third-party tool, addon, and stack available. There's simply not enough time to cover it all in one course.\n\n\nCourse Outline\nThe Kubernetes Real-World course is broken down into three sections:\nDay Zero Ops\nDay One Ops\nDay Two Ops\nThe goal here is to take you from the planning phase all the way to the implementation and environment management phase. You will learn everything from how to pick what tools you want to use to architecting the environment to managing it 6+ months later with upgrades and patches.\n\n1. Day Zero Ops\nWorking with teams\nPoint of contact and communication\nSecurity fundamentals and planning out protocols\nRBAC\nPlanning\nKubernetes Architecture\nCreating Best Practices For Your Team\nUnderstanding Which Tools And Platforms To Use\nRefactoring\n2. Day One Ops\nSingletenancy vs multitenancy\nNetwork deployment\nCluster Deployments\nApplication Deployments\nSecrets Management\nGitOps\nHelm & Kustomize\nCost & Resource Optimization\n3. Day Two Ops\nSecurity\nFailover and Backup/DR Strategies\nScaling and upgrading clusters\nScaling and upgrading apps\nMonitoring & Observability\nService Mesh\nTesting\nOrchestration Management\nSee What People Are Saying About Michael Levan's Training\n\n\nThe Instructor, Michael Levan, Explained The Key Concepts Without Overwhelming Us. Good Pace And Well Done!\n\n\n\"I really found value in your content as compared to others. It is really helpful for people and your followers. Very much appropriate. Thank you for all of your efforts.\"\n\n\n\"Really like your content. Some of the best and most digestible Kubernetes content on LinkedIn\"\n\n\n\"I really enjoyed reading your stuff and it helps to clarify some confusing topics. Thanks!\"",

We begin by exploring common signs that your computer may be infected, such as unexpected changes to browser settings, sluggish system performance, or sudden crashes. You’ll learn about the destructive capabilities of viruses—including how they can corrupt or delete files, and even hijack your email or social media accounts to send unauthorized messages or posts.\nNext, the course provides an in-depth look at different categories of computer viruses. We’ll challenge the misconception that virus detection and removal are straightforward tasks by examining specific virus types like direct action viruses and their targeted files. You’ll gain a clear understanding of boot sector viruses and why they can be particularly difficult to eliminate. We’ll also cover macro viruses, explaining how they operate differently by targeting documents rather than the core system, and explore the complexities of polymorphic viruses that continually change to avoid detection.\nFurther topics include multipartite viruses, file infector viruses, resident viruses, overwrite viruses, and spacefiller viruses—each explained with respect to how they infect, spread, and damage your system.\nA critical part of the course distinguishes viruses from other malware forms, clarifying common confusions: Is ransomware a virus? Is a Trojan a virus? How do their spreading speeds compare? What exactly does a Trojan horse do? We’ll also discuss worms—how they differ from viruses and why they can spread more rapidly.\nYou’ll learn about spyware and adware, their purposes, and why identifying the exact type of malware on your system can be challenging.\nThe course concludes by summarizing the range of damages computer viruses can cause, offering a comprehensive understanding of cyber threats and their potential impact on modern digital environments.",

The deployment of a security operation center (SOC) is a cost-effective strategy against these cyber threats. The SOC team deals with security incidents within the organization. The SOC analyst plays a vital role in the SOC team by monitoring the log data, identifying suspicious activities, and reporting to the higher authorities. It could be an excellent platform to start your career in cybersecurity. A candidate must have a basic knowledge of networking, malware analysis, and incidence response.\n\nThe cyber security field is one of the most booming fields in this decade. To get a job in this field, it depends on the kind of profile you are looking in the cyber security domain as this field has many different kinds of job roles.\n\nSOC Analyst\nSOC analysts are the first to respond to cyber security incidents. They report on cyberthreats and implement any changes needed to protect the organization. Job duties of SOC analysts include: Threat and vulnerability analysis. ... Analysis and response to previously unknown hardware and software vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThat said, it's not unusual for a Tier 1 SOC Analyst gig to be your first stop in the journey of your cybersecurity career. While every employer will attach a slightly different set of duties to any given job title, in general there are three tiers of SOC analyst jobs. The EC-Council's blog has a detailed breakdown of the differences among those tiers, but to sum up:\n\n\nL1 SOC analysts are triage specialists who monitor, manage, and configure security tools, review incidents to assess their urgency, and escalate incidents if necessary.\nL2 SOC analysts are incident responders, remediating serious attacks escalated from Tier 1, assessing the scope of the attack and affected systems, and collecting data for further analysis.\nL3 SOC analysts are threat hunters, working proactively to seek out weaknesses and stealthy attackers, conducting penetration tests, and reviewing vulnerability assessments. Some Tier 3 analysts focus more on doing deep dives into datasets to understand what's happening during and after attacks.",

This is the ultimate practice exam course designed to help you confidently prepare for and pass the latest CompTIA CySA+ certification exam. Whether you're a beginner in cybersecurity or an IT professional looking to validate your skills, this course will help you get an understanding on what to expect when tackling the multiple choice questions on your exam.\n\n\nThese questions are designed to challenge you. Some questions are worded to trip you up, and even \"waste\" exam time. This helps with your time management during the real exam. Every question is part of the CS0-003 exam objectives and are full of acronyms, just like what you WILL see on your exam. You will have loads of acronyms.\nEach question will have an explanation to further help you understand the question, as I personally believe that is the best way to learn when taking practice exams.\n\n\nThe practice exams consists of the 4 domains:\n\n\nSecurity Operations - 33% of the questions\nVulnerability Management - 30% of the questions\nIncident Response and Management - 20% of the questions\nReporting and Communication - 17% of the questions\nThere are a total of 3x practice exams with 90 questions each, and a separate \"Logs only\" exam that has 20 log related questions.\nRemember, these questions are to mimic the type of questions you will see on the actual exam, in both format and difficulty. These aren't questions taken from other areas on the internet like other courses on here, these are questions that have not been seen before. And that's important. A lot of courses on here are just repeat questions from other resources/courses. I also want to mention that there are no performance based questions on here, and that is intentional. There is no way to appropriately add a simulation similar to what you will see on the actual exam using Udemy, so I don't want to provide material that doesn't adequately prepare someone.\n\n\nTo get the best out of this course, please take the questions seriously. Plan ahead like you would with the real exam, don't take breaks during the practice exam, and flag/skip if you're unsure until the end. I provide a lot of content for free, and most of my content will always be free. My courses will always be the lowest price that Udemy will allow, as I truly want people to succeed.\nGood luck!\n- Cyber James",

PCI SSC is an open global forum for the ongoing development, enhancement, storage, dissemination and implementation of security standards for account data protection.\n\n\nThe purpose of these Payment Card Industry (PCI) Qualification Requirements for Payment Card Industry Professionals (PCIP) (the “PCIP Qualification Requirements”) is to provide the information required to apply for PCIP status by summarizing key aspects of the program and steps to earning and maintaining the PCIP credential.\n\n\nWelcome to the PCIP preparation questions course. My name is Dennis Steenbergen and I have worked over five years in the Payment Card Industry as a Qualified Security Assessor evaluating and testing payment service providers, banks and online merchants for compliance to the PCI DSS standard. I addition, I have worked over 25 years in the Internet security industry.\n\n\nIts important to prepare yourself for this certification because its very expensive and you don’t need to be wasting time or money taking this exam multiple times. If you work for a company like my previous companies, they only reimburse exam and training costs for passing the exam but not for failing it. The Security Council is offering this training at a cost for non-participating organizations at a whopping $2,750. And to become a Participating Organization, that will cost your company another $4.100. Even if you are a Participating Organization, the Security Council still charges $1,7000 per student. Then if you just want to take the exam and not the training, its still $1,700 the first time. So, you need to make sure you're going to pass.\n\n\nThat’s why I believe you’re here. We are going to solve this certification together. I am personally going to answer any questions you may have regarding this course.

We will start this course with the overview of the first course so all things revised and clear.\nThen we will implement a car simulator with higher difficulty levels and look for advanced tools on automobile security starting with CaringCaribou. We will see how we can find all the unique IDS in CAN Network. We will work on Unified Diagnostics Services (UDS) and also see Fuzzer Brute Force Attack.\nThen we will look at another advanced tool on automobile security CANAnalyzer which is a graphical tool. We will do Sniff and Send CAN Packets Attack and Fuzzer Test.\nAfter that we will cover On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD2). We will see OBD2 Protocols and create OBD2 Universal connectors as well to communicate with real vehicles.\nAfter that we will create a version 2.0 device with MCP2515 module to communicate with real vehicles and get real time data from cars.\nThen will do a practical demo on a real car with version 2.0 device and OBD2 connector.\nAfter that we will move to the very interesting part of this course in which we will create an Electronic Control Unit model ECU. This ECU unit will help us test all tools which we study in this course. We will also connect our version 2.0 device with this ECU unit and try to Reverse Engineer CAN Frames.\nIn the last one important thing this course is NOT for everyone But for anyone who is passionate about cybersecurity and has the ability to think out of the BOX!",

A firewall can stop a hacker completely or deter them to choose an easier target.\n\nUnified Threat Management makes security simple Sophos UTM provides the ultimate network security package with everything you need in a single modular appliance. It simplifies your IT security without the complexity of multiple point solutions.\nSophos UTM is unmatched in its deployment flexibility: choose from hardware, software, virtual or cloud with simple options for high-availability, clustering, branch office connectivity, wireless, and centralized management and reporting.\nUnlike antivirus tools, a UTM system does not just protect personal computers (PCs) and servers. It protects an entire network and individual users by scanning all network traffic, filtering potentially dangerous content and blocking intrusions.\nIf you're interested in fortifying networked systems against threats, you might be happier in network security. If you want to detect and defend against real-time cyberattacks, cybersecurity might be the better choice. Ultimately, the differences between these disciplines may be a nonissue in your career.The average salary for a firewall engineer is $106,704 per year in the United States.\nLearning cybersecurity can be challenging, but it doesn't have to be difficult, especially if you're passionate about technology.

Topics covered are 100% Windows related and dive into the full pentesting lifecycle of Windows and Active Directory.\nThe course guides the student through red team and ethical hacking TTP's while showcasing real-world scenarios on a Windows cyber-range which mimics a corporate network. The cyber-range, Kinetic is hosted by SlayerLabs and contains 25 Windows VM's with 5 Domains and 6 subnets all engineered to exploit!\nThe mission of this course and cyber-range is to provide the user with a technical high-level overview of Windows and Active Directory security, along with realistic scenarios and learning opportunities to become proficient in Windows AD Pentesting. The goal is to provide real-world scenarios so the student can get hands-on keyboard and start running through the entire process from Reconnaissance to Post-Exploitation.\nThe course has been designed to trim the fat and only covers Windows related topics. With that, the student is expected to know basic TTP's in relation to offensive security, ethical hacking and pentesting. For example - covering how to setup a VM in VirtualBox, explaining the basics of networking or installing additional tools on Kali will not be covered.\nEach topic dives into the technical side, providing command-line examples and explanations along the way. Topics covered (but are not limited to):\nDomain Enumeration with BloodHound, PowerView, ldapsearch and Dsquery.\nInitial Exploitation of AS-REP Roasting, Kerberoasting, Follina, Sharpoint Exploits, and Password Spraying.\nPrivEsc with WinPEAS, Saved 3rd party creds, and AlwaysInstallElevated.\nPost-Exploitation using Golden Ticket attacks, Pass-the-Ticket, Overpass-the-Hash, Pass-the-Hash, Dumping & Cracking NTLM & MsCache hashes and DPAPI.\nCourse content uses Kali the majority of the time, but also uses Slayer Labs Kinetic range Windows targets as jump boxes, utilizing built-in services such as WinRM and SMB. Students should be comfortable using Kali Linux along with Linux and Windows command-line. Majority of the commands used throughout this course are provided as a downloadable resource once purchased. Common tools used on Kali are Impacket Suite, CrackMapExec, Evil-Winrm and Metasploit.",

We will create our own GSM and LTE based network using LimeSDR. But you can continue this course without LimeSDR as well and understand the concepts of GSM & LTE network and create virtual GSM network without LimeSDR.\nWe will start this course by understanding LimeSDR and its frequency range then we will setup LimeSDR and update its library and firmware.\nAfter getting the grip on our SDR tools we will dive into GSM network and try to grasp the core concepts of GSM network we will discuss the main components of GSM network like BTS, BSC, MGW, MSC, HLR. After getting an idea of GSM core components we will create virtual GSM network and once we are comfortable then we will start the actual GSM network with our LimeSDR device. We will also learn and program our own SIM cards and then we will make connection with our own GSM network using these SIM cards.\nAfter Creating our own network and connecting phones with this network we will call from one phone to another and do SMS from one phone to another. We will also capture and analyze GSM network packets using Wireshark.\nAfter GSM network we will move to LTE based network and create our own LTE network using same LimeSDR device. Then we will also understand the core concept of LTE networks and start our own LTE network.\nWe will program LTE SIM cards as well and connect these LTE SIM cards with our LTE network using our LTE based phone. At last, we will also capture and analyze LTE network packets using Wireshark.\nSo, in this course you will get a very good idea of GSM and LTE network and at the end of the course YOU WILL BE ABLE\n1. To create your own GSM or LTE network\n2. To program your own SIM cards for your own networks\n3. To Connect your phone with your own network and do call and SMS\n4. To get your own 4G LTE network",

      "description": "The SOC Cybersecurity Threat Hunting with Splunk training course has been developed and edited by Mohammad Mirasadollahi in an online format, consisting of 68 instructional videos on Splunk, along with practical course files. The course covers Threat hunting with Splunk from beginner to advanced levels, based on the latest Cybersecurity standard educational topics in the world. It has been published as a practical course on Udemy under the title \"SOC Cybersecurity Threat Hunting with Splunk.\"\nWith SOC Cybersecurity Threat Hunting with Splunk course, you will be able to easily identify cyber-attacks using Splunk in any SOC. Learning Threat Hunting with Splunk in SOC is one of the most important skills required by organizations in the field of information security.\n\n\nThe complexity of Cybersecurity attacks in recent years has rendered traditional methods ineffective in detecting advanced Cybersecurity attacks and APT groups. As a result, relying solely on traditional approaches such as firewalls, antivirus software, and EDR is no longer sufficient, and we need cybersecurity experts in the field of threat detection and identification.\nCurrently, cybersecurity analysts in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) can detect various attacks by analyzing and dissecting events received from different infrastructure and software, relying on their knowledge and various tools.\nCybersecurity experts and analysts require technology for continuous log analysis, which involves aggregating logs in a central system called SIEM (Security Information and Event Management). With the capabilities provided by SIEM, they can detect cyber threats.\nSIEMs are referred to as the beating heart of every SOC. Currently, one of the most powerful SIEMs available worldwide, with many followers, is Splunk software.\nSplunk is a software used for data storage, search, investigation, and analysis. Cybersecurity experts can use Splunk Enterprise to examine and analyze data, identify patterns, and establish logical connections between data to detect complex Cybersecurity attacks.\nTherefore, many organizations are striving to migrate from traditional methods to modern ones for better Cybersecurity attack detection. Due to the importance of cybersecurity experts in data analysis, log and event analysis, and the popularity of Splunk SIEM software, the SOC Cybersecurity Threat Hunting with Splunk training course will cover the techniques of threat hunting, investigation, analysis, and detection of Cybersecurity attacks using Splunk.",

      "description": "Java provides numerous classes that have developed over the years to meet evolving networking needs. These range from a low-level socket and IP-based approaches to those encapsulated in software services. Web services drive networking on the web and have been at the center of modern application architecture. Regardless of language or platform, understanding how web services work is a serious skill. This course explores web services: the concepts, commands, and tools that allow you to communicate and share data between applications.\nThis comprehensive 2-in-1 course step-by-step practical approach to master the advanced concepts and get hands-on with Networking Web Services in Java Programming to secure network applications through encryption! To begin with, you’ll learn applications of networking programming in Java and explore protocols that underlie the Internet, such as TCP/IP and UDP/IP. You’ll then implement WebSocket functionality end-to-end in a client and server application. Moving further, you’ll work with protocols such as SOAP and REST and send JSON data to the client. Finally, you’ll create server applications with symmetric and asymmetric encryptions and learn network interoperability and interface with other languages.\nTowards the end of this course, you'll get hands-on with Networking Web Services in Java Programming to secure network applications through encryption!\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 2 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Java Network Programming Recipes, covers building efficient networked programs effectively. This practical tutorial provides a complete introduction to developing network programs with Java. We start with the basics of networking and then explore how Java supports the development of clients/servers. You’ll explore how to use Java’s network class library to rapidly and effortlessly accomplish common networking tasks such as writing multithreaded servers, network scalability, implementing application protocols, and filtering clients and client names. Java NIO packages are examined as well as multitasking, building hands-on NIO buffers, scatter and gather, and transferring data to channels and selectors. By the end of this video tutorial, you will have mastered networking fundamentals (and advanced concepts) in Java to ensure you understand (and are capable of building) networked programs.\nThe second course, Building Web Services with Java Network Programming, covers developing hands-on networking web services with Java. This course explores web services: the concepts, commands, and tools that allow you to communicate and share data between applications. You will learn how to use HTTP services in synchronous and asynchronous modes by configuring an HTTP client. You will also explore protocols such as SOAP, and REST and shares simple programming tips for writing web services that are as efficient as possible. Plus, you'll learn how to secure your communications across the web with security standards and create key-store and server applications that use symmetric and asymmetric encryption for client and server. By the end of this video tutorial, you will be equipped to handle WebSocket functionality supported by servlets in Java and will have mastered advanced concepts well enough to build web services, ensuring the audience is able to understand and secure network applications through encryption and by interfacing with other languages.\nTowards the end of this course, you'll get hands-on with Networking Web Services in Java Programming to secure network applications through encryption!\nAbout the Authors\nPeter Verhas is a senior developer and software system architect with more than 30 years' software development experience.

      "description": "What is Cisco ACI?\nCisco ACI is the solution that emerged from Cisco, following its acquisition of Insieme, which is\na company they funded for more than two years.\nACI is seen by many as Cisco’s software-defined networking (SDN) offering for data center and\ncloud networks.\n\n\nHow Cisco ACI Works?\nCisco ACI is a tightly coupled policy-driven solution that integrates software and hardware.\nThe hardware for Cisco ACI is based on the Cisco Nexus 9000 family of switches.\nThe software and integration points for ACI include a few components, including Additional\nData Center Pod, Data Center Policy Engine, and Non-Directly Attached Virtual and Physical Leaf\nSwitches. While there isn’t an explicit reliance on any specific virtual switch, at this point,\npolicies can only be pushed down to the virtual switches if Cisco’s Application Virtual Switch (AVS)\nis used, though there has been talk about extending this to Open vSwitch in the near future.\n\n\nTo a large extent, the network for Cisco ACI is no different than what has been deployed over\nthe past several years in enterprise data centers. What is different, however, is the management\nand policy framework, along with the protocols used in the underlying fabric.\n\n\nIn a leaf-spine ACI fabric, Cisco is provisioning a native Layer 3 IP fabric that supports\nequal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing between any two endpoints in the network, but uses\noverlay protocols, such as virtual extensible local area network (VXLAN) under the covers\nto allow any workload to exist anywhere in the network. Supporting overlay protocols is\nwhat will give the fabric the ability to have machines, either physical or virtual, in\nthe same logical network (Layer 2 domain), even while running Layer 3 routing down to the\ntop of each rack. Cisco ACI supports VLAN, VXLAN, and network virtualization using generic\nrouting encapsulation (NV-GRE), which can be combined and bridged together to create a logical\nnetwork/domain as needed.\n\n\n++++++ ADDED ACI & Nexus Automation via Ansible\n\n\nThis Course provides a step-by-step guide to learning how to automate Cisco NXOS and Cisco ACI infrastructure using the\nOpen Source Ansible automation technology . It uses virtualised instances of Linux, NXOS, and ACI in order to provide an environment for\nlab task execution and experimentation.\n\n\nAnsible enables the simple automation of tasks across different parts of the infrastructure including compute, storage, and\nnetworking. When operating on Cisco NXOS devices Ansible uses the NXAPI, in contrast to its general server operations where it\nwill execute Python code locally on the device under management. This centralized model of operation appeals to large-scale\nnetwork operators and is one reason for Ansible’s popularity in the Service Provider industry.\n\n\nThrough the NXOS lab exercises, we will configure and manipulate numerous private and public VLANs, IP interfaces, IP route\ntables, and VRFs. In ACI, we will configure tenants, bridge domains, VRFs, Contracts, Endpoint Groups and Application Profiles.",

This tool will allow hackers to crack hashed secrets such as passwords, secret keys, etc, using Linux (e.g. Kali Linux) or Windows operating systems. On top of that, Hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced password cracking utility. As a result, it is widely used in multiple hacking scenarios (e.g., Penetration Testing, CTF, cybersecurity exams such as the OSCP, and much more ).\nThe student will learn all the functionalities of this tool to use it in their professional career. However, using this tool can sometimes be confusing, and this course's goal is to cover all the options inside Hashcat with practical scenarios. Also, students will learn the basics of hashing algorithms to understand how to manipulate them during the cracking process. During this course, students will understand the different attack types used in Hashcat (e.g., straight attack, combinator attack, hybrid attack, brute-force attack, and mask attack). Also, students will learn how to overpower Hashcat using professional cracking rigs. All these learning phases will use practical scenarios so students can follow along on their end.\nBy the end of this course, students will start using Hashcat with ease to start cracking hashes.",

This feature was not enabled before RouterOS v6.47\nFor this reason, I am designing this course to show you how you can benefit from this feature specially against the DNS spoofing attacks that may happen against your PC.\nTo be able to show you the importance of this feature, I am going to show you how the DNS spoof happens, which means that we will do the same techniques that a hacker use to run his DNS spoofing attacks. In other word, we are going to attack on PC from a Kali Linux machine and I am going to show you all steps that a hacker use to accomplish this mission. Once done, I will show you how to configure DoH on MikroTik router to overcome the DNS spoofing attack.\nThis course will be a mix of some hacking techniques to run the DNS spoofing using Kali linux machine and the solution that MikroTik providing us to use the DoH to overcome this problem, that means you will learn and be able to run a DNS spoofing attack against your PC and to use the MikroTik DoH feature to solve this problem.\nFor this course you require to have 1 PC and 1 MikroTik router. Also you require to have internet connectivity and 1 UTP cable.\nIf you want to learn the technique that hackers use to run a DNS spoofing attack and how to overcome this attack by using the DoH feature provided by MikroTik since version 6.47, then I advise you to register in this course and I will explain for you all details about those topics.",

      "description": "* Updated for the 2024 CISSP curriculum *\nWelcome, I am Thor Pedersen, and I am here to help you pass your CISSP certification.\nWith over 700,000 enrollments from 201 countries, my CISSP, CISM, and Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) courses are both the “Best Selling” and “Highest Rated” here on Udemy.\nIn this course I will cover how to approach practice tests, how to deconstruct practice questions, time management, how to make your own CISSP study plan, and finally you get 125 COMPLEX CISSP questions in a full CISSP practice test.\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam questions do.\n\n\nHow are Complex questions different than Hard questions?\nComplex Questions: Involve multiple competing requirements; require evaluating, prioritizing, and balancing different factors to pick the right answer.\nHard Questions: Require deep knowledge and attention to subtle answer differences to pick the right answer.\n\n\nGetting your CISSP certification now is a very smart career move.\n1. The CISSP certification is the gold standard for IT Security certifications.\n2. There are more than 82,000 job openings for CISSPs in the US.\n3. The average CISSP salary in the US is over USD147,000 a year.\n\n\nWhat our other students are saying about my CISSP courses:\nI passed the CISSP with the ISC Book and Thor's lectures and practice questions. Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of the test, you will get an explanation for each question and explaining to why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does.\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions\nAsset Security – 13 questions\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions\n\nI recommend students to do 1,500-3,000 easy/mid CISSP practice questions and 1,000-1,500 HARD/COMPLEX CISSP practice questions before the exam.\nI think learning how to balance competing requirements is critical for passing your CISSP exam, I designed these questions to teach you exactly that.\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it. This is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right and answering from an IT Security manager's point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.\nOn hard questions you will score lower. It is normal to score 80%+ on easy/mid questions and 50-60% on hard/complex questions.\nThe point of all questions is to find the gaps in your knowledge, learn how to deconstruct questions, argue WHY the answer you chose is the RIGHT answer in this scenario, making you ready for exam day.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nYou'll Also Get:\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days no questions asked, money back guarantee.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

Then, we dived into how to construct a solution with Meraki's platform.\n\n\nGet Started - Building a Meraki platform:\nIn this part of the training, I started to get into the details of configuring the different parts of every network needs. Basically, I am covering the foundations here.\n\n\nSDWAN and Dynamic routing (BGP):\nModern networks based on SDWAN, and in this section, I covered how to configure SDWAN using Meraki's platform. Using dynamic routing is critical when you gradually move from one platform to another or integrate third-party networks; I will walk you through configuring BGP and exchanging routes from Meraki to Non-Meraki networks.\n\n\nNetwork as a Sensor:\nNowadays, businesses expect the network to deliver a lot of insights that help improve the operations and offer business intelligence to make critical decisions. I will walk you through some examples of how to use the Meraki platform to deliver those outcomes.\n\n\nPlatform Efficiency:\nIntent-based networking is the future, and in this section, I will walk you through that concept and how it can be implemented with the Meraki platform.",

An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network. An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals.\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system. An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement. An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer. They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them. With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles.\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk. For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks. When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing :\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched. Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack.\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results.\n\n\nWhy do you want to take this Course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you sign up, you will feel the Instructor's expertise.

I'm Ahmed Elhefny, and I am the author and lead product creator at Cyvitrix learning, You'll notice that the course narration uses advanced voice cloning technology. I want to be clear: this isn't a fully automated process. It incorporates a \"human-in-the-loop\" (HITL) methodology, which means:\n\n\nSupervised Quality Control: Every segment of cloned voice narration is carefully reviewed and approved by a human expert (myself, or a qualified team member) to ensure accuracy, appropriate tone, and alignment with the learning objectives.\nAuthenticity Maintained: While my voice is synthetically generated, the content, pedagogical insights, and overall message are authentically mine and reflect my direct guidance. The human oversight guarantees that the voice expresses the nuances and emphasis I intend for effective learning.\nFocus on Content, Not Production: This technology lets us spend more time refining and updating the educational content rather than on time-consuming re-recording. This means you get a more frequently updated and richer learning experience.\nFutureproofing: Embracing this technology allows us to scale our efforts and potentially offer more courses and resources efficiently, without compromising on quality or my unique instructional style.\nWe believe this transparent approach, combining technological innovation with rigorous human oversight, delivers a superior and consistent learning environment. Your understanding and engagement are paramount, and we're committed to providing clear, high-quality instruction.\nNow, let's dive into through this learning journey.",

Describe their current cybersecurity posture;\n2. Describe their target state for cybersecurity;\n3. Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process;\n4. Assess progress toward the target state;\n5. Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk.\nThe Framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach to managing cybersecurity risk for critical infrastructure. Organizations will continue to have unique risks – different threats, different vulnerabilities, different risk tolerances. They also will vary in how they customize practices described in the Framework. Organizations can determine activities that are important to critical service delivery and can prioritize investments to maximize the impact of each dollar spent. Ultimately, the Framework is aimed at reducing and better managing cybersecurity risks.\nThis course will focus on the 5 Areas, Categories and Sub Categories of each area, we then work our way through the whole framework to then discuss the Pros and Cons of the CSF and how to implement it in a project at your company or for your company / team / department.",

      "description": "Hi there,\nWelcome to my \" Fortinet Fortigate Firewall Essentials Course with Exercises \" course.\nFortigate Firewall | Master Fortinet Firewall Administration and miniate cybersecurity risks for better network security\n\n\n\n\nA firewall is a network security device designed to monitor, filter, and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The primary purpose of a firewall is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks.\nFirewalls come in both hardware and software forms, and they work by inspecting data packets and determining whether to allow or block them based on a set of rules. Organizations can configure these rules to permit or deny traffic based on various criteria, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol type.\n\n\nFortiGate is the most deployed network firewall with over 50% of global market share. As the cornerstone of the Fortinet Security Fabric Platform, FortiGate is fully integrated with Fortinet’s broad portfolio of security and networking products that help organizations optimize security coverage and operational efficiency.\n\n\nA firewall is positioned between a network or a computer and a different network, like the internet. It controls the network traffic coming in and going out of the computer or network. If you do not have a firewall, virtually any data can exit your computer or network, and virtually any individual or program can come in.\n\n\nBasically, a firewall is a cybersecurity solution that protects your computer or network from unwanted traffic coming in or going out. It inspects and authenticates all data packets in network traffic before they are allowed to move to a more secure environment.\nWhether a hardware appliance or a software program that is protecting a corporate network or a personal computer, a firewall is essential to network security. For example, depending on where a firewall is installed, it may guard against insider threats in a network segment or act as a barrier against external threats at the network perimeter.\nAs your organization’s first line of defense, a firewall monitors and filters all network traffic including outgoing traffic, application-layer traffic, online transactions, communications, and connectivity. It blocks incoming threats based on a set of pre-programmed rules that also may dictate which users can access specific network areas.\nIt protects your network from unauthorized access to mitigate the risk from cyber attacks.\n\n\nIf you really want to learn Firewall Administration and have fun while learning without getting bored, you are at the right place.\nWith this course, you will learn many things about Firewalls and Firewall Administration and itself. This course offers information from the simplest level to almost advanced. When you finish this course, there will be almost nothing you haven't heard or learned about firewalls.\n\n\nDuring the course you will learn the following topics:\n\n\nWhat is Firewall?\nHow Does Firewall Work?\nFirewall Working Principle\nWhat is Blacklist / White List / Gray List?\nWhat Firewall Does Not Block?\nNetwork Segmentation Concept\nFirewall Types\nFirewall Types According to Their Structures\nHardware Firewall\nSoftware Firewall\nFirewall Types According to Their Functions\nPacket Filtering Firewall\nNAT Firewall\nProxy Firewall\nWAF Web Application Firewall\nUTM (Unified Threat Management)\nFirewall Selection\nFirewall User Guide and Documents\nNetwork Topology Creation\nInstallation Files and Setup\nBasic Firewall Settings\nFirewall Interface\nDashboard\nSecurity Fabric\nFortiview\nNetwork\nSystem\nPolicy & Objects\nSecurity Profiles\nVPN\nFirewall Sample Applications\nTraffic Shaping\nPort Forwarding\nWeb Filter\nApplication Control\nIntrusion Prevention System (IPS)\n\n\n\n\nWith my up-to-date course, you will also have the chance to keep yourself updated and have fun while learning the firewall. I am also happy to say that I will always be available to support your learning and answer your questions.\n\n\n\nWhat Is a Fortinet?\nFortinet, Inc. is a cybersecurity company with headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. The company develops and sells security solutions like firewalls, endpoint security and intrusion detection systems.\n\n\nWhat Is a Fortigate?\nFortiGate is a family of firewall products developed and sold by Fortinet. FortiGate devices monitor, manage, and protect network traffic against security threats. These devices come in various sizes and capacities and can be used in environments ranging from small businesses to large enterprise networks. FortiGate devices typically have the following features:\nThreat Protection: Protects against malware, attacks, and other threats.\nVPN Support: Creates secure connections for remote users.\nWeb Filtering: Blocks access to unwanted websites.\nApplication Control: Monitors and manages applications on the network.\nAdvanced Security Services: Includes intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus, antispam, and more.\n\n\nWhat Is a Firewall?\nA firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network. It allows or blocks traffic based on a defined set of security rules.\n\n\nWhat does a firewall do?\nBasically, a firewall is a cybersecurity solution that protects your computer or network from unwanted traffic coming in or going out. It inspects and authenticates all data packets in network traffic before they are allowed to move to a more secure environment.\n\n\nWhy Do You Need a Firewall?\nThere are many reasons why you need a firewall but in general, without firewalls, computers and devices in your network are easy targets for cyber attacks.\nFirewalls protect your network from unauthorized access by hackers who use a variety of tools to gain entry such as viruses, backdoors, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, macros, remote logins, phishing emails, social engineering, and spam. You not only need a firewall to block unauthorized access to your network, but also to block your users from visiting inappropriate websites and downloading malware.\nYou also need a firewall to identify the signatures of dangerous users, known bad actors, and risky applications especially when securing a vulnerable, private network. A firewall can block outflowing data when it notices a social engineering attack to mitigate the damage. When you need to block specific content in application-layer attacks, such as malware, use your firewall. You need a firewall to help you detect and deter rogue activity throughout your network.\nFirewalls can also manage network resources so you can control how much network bandwidth is available for specific data types. In addition, you might need a firewall to provide virtual private network (VPN) services that use data encryption to secure communications across the public internet.\nBy securing the border between your network and the internet, or between segments of your network and the rest of your environment, firewalls provide essential protection from internal and external threats.\n\n\nWhat are the Uses of a Firewall in Networking?\nThe primary use of a firewall in networking is to secure the network from cyberattacks. For example, a firewall prevents malicious and unwanted content from entering your environment. As well, a firewall protects vulnerable systems and private data in the network from unauthorized access–such as hackers or insiders. Protecting your business transitions, operational, and confidential data from ransomware attacks and leaks is a critical use of a firewall.\nIn educational institutions, for example, network firewalls can be used to limit access to specific websites and content deemed inappropriate or unsafe for a particular organization’s users–such as K - 12 and higher. And in business, a firewall can keep users from being distracted by online advertising, gaming, fraudulent websites that host malware, or certain social media platforms when using the company’s network.\nProtecting the seamless operations of a distributed enterprise is a critical use of firewalls in networking. With a remote and often global workforce accessing corporate networks, applications, and data–in multiple data centers around the world–firewalls are imperative to ensure security across all systems.\nFirewalls also safeguard supply chain networks to ensure confidentiality and coordination of goods, services, pricing, and production to secure the value for manufacturer, distributor, seller, and consumer. Whether a firewall takes the form of hardware, software, or web application in the cloud–the use of a firewall is essential to secure networking.\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of a firewall in a computer network?\nBy securing the border between your network and the internet, or between segments of your network and the rest of your environment, firewalls provide essential protection from internal and external threats. Firewalls do this by filtering data in network traffic to protect the network from a wide variety of malicious attacks and malware. Without firewalls to block cyber threats and prevent unauthorized access, computers and devices in your network are susceptible to attack.\n\n\nHow does a firewall protect a network?\nFirewalls block incoming threats based on a set of pre-programmed rules that also can dictate which users can access specific network areas. As part of your first line of defense against cyberattacks, firewalls offer essential monitoring and filtering of all network traffic to ensure only safe content passes to your secure environment. This includes outgoing traffic, application-layer traffic, online transactions, communications and connectivity, and dynamic workflows.\n\n\nWhy should you enroll in this course?\nOne reason: Muharrem Aydın.

At least this much you should know if you wish to have a solid base in routing. Following are covered in great details.\nA brief history of routing and “Why” behind routing.\nLet’s divide the routing problem in to sub-problems.\nIP Addressing and Subnetting\nWhere routing fits in TCP/IP layering.\nWhy behind Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)\nConcept of Next-Hop in Routing\nWhat is Routing Table (RIP or Routing Information Base)\nControl Plane vs Data Plane in Detail\nLayer-2 Multicast (Why routing protocol use multicast addresses)\nWhat and Why behind Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF’s)\nStatic routing with next hop and Static routing with exit interface.\nStatic routing with next hop and exit interface\nConcept of Proxy ARP\nConcept of Administrative Distance (AD)\nTroubleshooting Static Routing\nLonger Prefixes vs Administrative Distance\nLoad Balancing and concept of Floating Routes\nDistance Vector Routing Vs Link State Routing\nWhy Split Horizon (Loop Avoidance using Split-Horizon)\nBrief introduction about OSPF\nSteps necessary for OSPF\nAs understanding of routing fundamentals is mandatory, let’s start it with the brief history and why it is required. The concept of routing has been around since the early days of computer networking. In the 1960s, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed the first computer networks, which were used to connect computers and share resources such as storage and processing power. As networks grew in size and complexity, the need for more efficient and reliable routing became apparent. In the 1970s, researchers at Xerox Corporation developed the Xerox Network System (XNS), which used a routing protocol called the Internet Protocol (IP) to route data packets between networks. In the 1980s, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was formed to standardize internet protocols and technologies, including routing. The IETF developed the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is still used today to exchange routing information between networks on the internet. In the 1990s, the rise of the World Wide Web and the proliferation of personal computers and other devices connected to the internet led to a tremendous growth in internet traffic. This led to the development of new routing protocols and technologies to handle the increased demand. Today, routing is a critical part of modern computer networks and the internet, and it continues to evolve as new technologies and protocols are developed.",

I currently work as a Cybersecurity consultant with the Scotcoin Project CIC since my University days in 2016. I have worked in the IT industry since 1997 when I worked as a first-line support analyst at BT Internet helpdesk in Thurso, Caithness in the far north of Scotland. My main aim is to pass on my knowledge to students who wish to learn about cybersecurity and go on to get a well-paid job in the IT industry. I believe that organisations must embrace a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that considers the ever-changing nature of the threat landscape. New threats to security crop up all the time, and artificial intelligence is changing how we think about it. The advent of quantum cryptography has also changed things. The processing power of computers is miles faster than it used to be and can crack passwords much quicker. The issue of cybersecurity is of paramount importance in the digital age. With near-continuous revelations about incidents and breaches in the media, businesses and individuals are faced with the challenge of finding the right balance between risk, innovation and cost.",

I’m not confident about my (python/cybersecurity/ML) skills.\nWe make it really easy to follow along (line-by-line, concept-by-concept) and believe you will learn a ton by enrolling in the course.\n\n\nHere’s what one of our past students had to say:\n\n\n\"I found Emmanuel to be a likable easy to follow along with instructor...\"\n\"I recently took Cybersecurity Data Science by Emmanuel Tsukerman. This was the first course I have ever seen to combine 2 of my passions (cyber security and data science). This was also my first exposure to Emmanuel. For whatever reason there is a clear scarcity of content on this topic. This is strange because cybersecurity produces so much data.\nI really enjoyed the content, it was enough to give you a good overview of the topics he covers. I especially appreciate him teaching how to create a lab. Although I already had an idea how to do this it was great to see how an actual pro does it.\nOverall it is a classic Udemy course: short and touching on a little bit of a lot topics just to give you a taste. I found Emmanuel to be a likable easy to follow along with instructor who has some good choice in music. I would definitely purchase another course that he teaches and I hope he will put out more CyberSecurity data content. The world is lacking in it and he is an expert. Thanks for reading!\"\n-Leon R., cybersecurity data scientist, BNY Mellon\n\n\nIf you find the course too challenging, we offer a 100% get-all-your-money-back guarantee within 30 days.\n\n\n2.

He was formerly a senior operations engineer at global telco Verizon, designing resilient, high-performance infrastructures for major corporations such as Ford, McDonald's, and Bank of America. He is now an independent consultant, working closely with selected clients to deliver web-scale performance and enterprise-grade resilience on a startup budget. He likes writing books, especially about Puppet (Puppet 2.7 Cookbook and Puppet 3 Cookbook are available from Packt). He also provides training and coaching on Puppet and DevOps, which, it turns out, is far harder than simply doing the work himself. Off the clock, he is a medal-winning, competitive rifle and pistol shooter and a decidedly uncompetitive piano player. He lives in a small cottage in Cornwall, England and believes, like Cicero, that, if you have a garden and a library, then you have everything you need.",

If you're curious about penetration testing, cybersecurity, but now little to nothing about it, you're in the right place.\nI will take you through a practical use case approach. Rather than inundating you with theoretical jargon, I will immerse you in a practical use case where you'll have a peek behind the curtain. You will discover different tools, vulnerabilities, and how to use them to hack a web application.\nStarting from the very first kickoff meeting and progressing through the various stages that define a pentest mission, this course will offer you valuable insights into the fundamental building blocks of a pentest job. We will take you on a journey through the mission, immersing you in the real-world experiences of a white hat hacker's job.\nUpon completing this course, you will possess the knowledge and experience necessary to make an informed decision about whether a career in penetration testing aligns with your aspirations. This course will help you evaluate whether a job in this field resonates with your interests and goals.\nThe sole purpose of this course is to introduce penetration testing, it is NOT intended for those who want to build their technical skills.",

      "description": "What is Cisco ACI?\nCisco ACI is the solution that emerged from Cisco, following its acquisition of Insieme, which is\na company they funded for more than two years.\nACI is seen by many as Cisco’s software-defined networking (SDN) offering for data center and\ncloud networks.\n\n\nHow Cisco ACI Works?\nCisco ACI is a tightly coupled policy-driven solution that integrates software and hardware.\nThe hardware for Cisco ACI is based on the Cisco Nexus 9000 family of switches.\nThe software and integration points for ACI include a few components, including Additional\nData Center Pod, Data Center Policy Engine, and Non-Directly Attached Virtual and Physical Leaf\nSwitches. While there isn’t an explicit reliance on any specific virtual switch, at this point,\npolicies can only be pushed down to the virtual switches if Cisco’s Application Virtual Switch (AVS)\nis used, though there has been talk about extending this to Open vSwitch in the near future.\n\n\nTo a large extent, the network for Cisco ACI is no different than what has been deployed over\nthe past several years in enterprise data centers. What is different, however, is the management\nand policy framework, along with the protocols used in the underlying fabric.\n\n\nIn a leaf-spine ACI fabric, Cisco is provisioning a native Layer 3 IP fabric that supports\nequal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing between any two endpoints in the network, but uses\noverlay protocols, such as virtual extensible local area network (VXLAN) under the covers\nto allow any workload to exist anywhere in the network. Supporting overlay protocols is\nwhat will give the fabric the ability to have machines, either physical or virtual, in\nthe same logical network (Layer 2 domain), even while running Layer 3 routing down to the\ntop of each rack. Cisco ACI supports VLAN, VXLAN, and network virtualization using generic\nrouting encapsulation (NV-GRE), which can be combined and bridged together to create a logical\nnetwork/domain as needed.",

      "description": "Red Team Adversary Emulation, focuses on approaching an organization's security from the view of a real-world adversary. In this course, we perform a live Adversary Emulation exercise and try to steal customer data of a FinTech startup. We are hired by a FinTech startup to conduct an adversary emulation exercise and steal their customer data (before an actual adversary). This exercise assumes zero knowledge about the target network.\n\nDuring an adversary emulation exercise we mimic a real world cyber attack with a specific objective, such as stealing customer data, launching a ransomware attack etc. This course follows the Red Team Operations Attack Lifecycle to conduct this exercise. We go through each phase in a step-by-step manner and build our attack path as we move ahead. We employee a variety of techniques, such as\n\nActive and passive information gathering\nGaining foothold into the network\nHost Discovery\nBrute-forcing\nPhishing\nPrivilege Escalation (Linux and Windows)\nAutomated Active Directory domain enumeration\nPersistence via command and control center\nActive Directory attacks\n\nto achieve our objective. Upon completion of the exercise, we will prepare and submit a report to the organization's management.\nThis course also covers installation and usage of tools such as, PoshC2, Mentalist, BloodHound, Mimikatz, Metasploit, PowerUp, icacls, PowerShell etc.\nThis is a beginner friendly course. If you have just started your career in offensive cybersecurity or are preparing for penetration testing exams then this course is for you. If you are already a penetration tester or a red teamer, with a few years of experience under your belt, then you would already know most of the above mentioned techniques.

Detailed walk through of solution. Examples include different kinds of data in table delimited format, json and xml.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you would be confident to create your own regular expressions!\n\n\nHappy Learning and All the Best!\n-----\nTopic Background: What is DLP?\nData loss prevention (DLP), is defined as technologies which perform both content inspection and contextual analysis of data sent via messaging applications such as email and instant messaging, in motion over the network, in use on a managed endpoint device, and at rest in on-premises file servers or in cloud applications and cloud storage. These solutions execute responses based on policy and rules defined to address the risk of inadvertent or accidental leaks or exposure of sensitive data outside authorized channels.\nDLP technologies are broadly divided into two categories – Enterprise DLP and Integrated DLP. While Enterprise DLP solutions are comprehensive and packaged in agent software for desktops and servers, physical and virtual appliances for monitoring networks and email traffic, or soft appliances for data discovery, Integrated DLP is limited to secure web gateways, secure email gateways, email encryption products, enterprise content management platforms, data classification tools, data discovery tools, and cloud access security brokers.\n\n\nWhat are Regular Expressions?\nRegular Expression, or regex or regexp in short, is extremely and amazingly powerful in searching and manipulating text strings, particularly in processing text files. One line of regex can easily replace several dozen lines of programming codes.\nRegex is supported in all the scripting languages (such as Perl, Python, PHP, and JavaScript); as well as general purpose programming languages such as Java; and even word processors such as Word for searching texts. Getting started with regex may not be easy due to its geeky syntax, but it is certainly worth the investment of your time.\nRegular expression synax varies slightly between languages but for the most part the details are the same. Some regex implementations support slightly different variations on how they process as well as what certain special character sequences mean.",

      "description": "secure shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. The best-known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users. SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow the remote computer to authenticate the user, if necessary.\nThe best-known implementation of SSH is OpenSSH, which is available in many GNU/Linux distributions, as well as other operating systems such as BSD and Apple's Mac OS X. OpenSSH is often used by programmers to remotely affect and monitor computers.\nIn this course you will learn about secure shell. SSH is the secure shell command line tool and protocol used to securely log into and execute commands on a remote machine.  To make your machine remotely controllable, you need to install SSH server software like OpenSSH server, which you will also learn in this course. You will learn to remotely control a computer using secure shell.\nThis is a beginners course. If you are a Web developer, Ethical Hacker, Software Developer, Linux user or wish to control computers remotely with SSH, this course is for you. You don't need any prior knowledge about Secure Shell to do this course and you can use whatever system you want (Windows, Linux, Mac) as your client.",

Finally, did you know you can create websites with S3 like Amazon's sales website?\nMy name is Alston Godbolt, and I’ll be your instructor. This course is important to me because it provides me an opportunity to share my knowledge and teaching approach with you, the student. I have over five years of teaching adult students, and mentoring instructors. In addition, I am both an AWS Certified Solutions Architect and a Certified Developer. Finally, I am a Full Stack Developer working with the S3 Service daily. This combination of knowledge and experience makes me well suited to lead you through the wonderful world of S3.\nMy journey with AWS started off rough. I was looking for a place to host a personal web site. AWS was suggested to me as one option. As I attempted to navigate the site I was quickly overwhelmed by the number of services. I quickly left that page and found a service less intimidating. The purpose of this course is to ensure that my students never feel intimidated by AWS. I will break down S3 so that you know the power S3 contains, and by extension, give you the power to create on S3.\nThis course is designed for both beginners to AWS and experienced developers. First, after a brief course introduction, we will dive into what AWS provides to its customers. Next, we will take a very through “deep dive” look at S3. We will discuss what S3 is, use cases, and key terms to ensure you know the fundamentals.\nAfter mastering the fundamentals, we will get our hands dirty by navigating to the AWS and S3 console. We will create buckets, store objects, create static web pages, and delete buckets.\nOnce we have successfully completed the console, we will take things a step further by creating, listing, and managing buckets the command line.\nFinally, using Node.js and Software Development Kits (SDKs), we will create a series of short programs to further cement our acquired skills. Remember no prior experience is necessary for taking this course. We will install the necessary software and create an AWS free account during the course introduction.\nThank you, and Ill see you in the course!",

      "description": "This a detailed course on Cryptography, which is a way to secure important information and communication through codes. These codes are only available to the rightful owner and hence it can be used to combat attacks, and protect your data from hackers. Every organization, regardless of size, industry or infrastructure, requires a degree of network security solutions in place to protect it from the ever-growing landscape of cyber threats in the wild today. Network security is a comprehensive aspect that shelters a multitude of technologies, devices and processes involved in computer networks. With the advent of Internet and world wide web our interconnected computers are prone to threats and attacks through the system vulnerabilities and this in turn can hamper the activities of an organization or even an individual. In its simplest term, network security comprises a set of rules and configurations designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer networks and data using both software and hardware technologies.\nThere are several reasons to learn network security and cryptography.\nIn our everyday lives, cryptography is used extensively and is ubiquitous. Say for example, we may use it to securely shoot passwords over massive networks for online shopping. It is used in financial transaction in banks where Bank servers and e-mail clients save your passwords using cryptography. Cryptography is used to secure all transmitted information in our IoT-connected world, to authenticate people and devices, and devices to other devices.\nIn this course I will take you through a tour of various cryptographic techniques.\nThere are basically 2 types of cryptographic systems. Symmetric key cryptosystem and asymmetric key cryptosystem. In symmetric key cryptosystem there is a single key used for encryption as well as decryption. In asymmetric key cryptosystem, there is a pair of keys- one used for encryption and the other for decryption. Encryption is the process of converting the plaintext or original message to ciphertext or coded message whereas decryption converts the ciphertext back to plaintext. So, encryption is used at the sender side whereas decryption is used at the receiver side. Towards the end of the course some complex research related cryptographic topics have been discussed that will be beneficial to the researchers and advanced learners.",

      "description": "Welcome to “Wireshark | Wireshark Packet Analysis for Network Security” course.\nWireshark- Learn TCP/IP, Network Protocols' Packet Capture & Network Analysis to troubleshoot network for cyber security\n\n\nWireshark is a popular open source protocol analyzer that allows users to capture and read info from applications such as Sniffer, Snoop and Microsoft network monitor. What makes this software stand out is the fact that you can download it and and install it free of charge. It can be successfully used for network error troubleshooting, communications and software protocol development, but also for network analysis. Initially the tool was released in May 2006 as Ethereal, but due to trademark issues it was renamed to Wireshark soon after.\nWireshark 's main function is to help analyze the traffic on any network of your choice regardless of size.\nWireshark can run on a wide range of operating systems, such as Windows, OS X, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Free BSD, HP-UH, Solaris, UNIX and Linux.\nWireshark is a reference network protocol analyzer tool for open source network analysis. With its amazingly powerful functionality and user friendly interface, Wireshark makes it easy to see at any given time what's happening on a specific network and immediately take action if any type of suspicious activity is detected.\n\n\nThroughout this course, we are going to look at examples of how to practically use Wireshark to solve network problems and isolate cybersecurity incidents. This skill will help all IT engineers to improve in their analysis and troubleshooting skills.\nA network support specialist analyzes and troubleshoots problems with computer networks and keeps them secure, and many of these jobs will require the certification.\nWhile learning the Wireshark interface, configure custom columns, filters, and coloring rules, learning how to customize the layout so we can spot problems fast. This course will give you the Wireshark interface and the experience you need to understand core protocols.\n\n\nIdentifying the advantages and disadvantages of existing network configurations. Implementing network security, standards, and protocols. Troubleshooting network issues, analyzing, developing software and communication protocol.\nIn this course you will learn;\n\n\nNetwork Fundamentals\nPacket Captures in Wireshark\nAnalyse Protocols in Wireshark\nPacket Operations in Wireshark\nICMP Analysis\nARP Analysis\nTCP Analysis\nUDP Analysis\nDHCP Analysis\nDNS Analysis\nHTTP Analysis\nHTTPS Analysis\n\n\nWe will make sample applications for some of the topics covered in our course.\nIf you wish, you can improve yourself by using the topics covered in the lessons.\n\n\nFAQs about Wireshark\n\n\nWhat is the meaning of packet capture?\nIt is the process of intercepting a data packet that is moving through a network. The data packet helps in network analysis that is by analysis the data one can know the security status of the net.\n\n\nExplain packet sniffers or network analyzers work?\nPacket sniffers work by intercepting into a network that they can \"see.\" What a packet sniffer can capture depends on the structure of the net. Ones a packet sniffer or network analyzer captures a packet they analyze it and present it in human readable form so that the user of packet sniffer can make use of the data.\nIt is wise to note a packet sniffer gets set into two ways. Some can be configured to capture all the data in this way we say they are unfiltered. There are those that are set to capture specific packets. We describe them as filtered.\n\n\nWhat is the standard software tool that is used for packet sniffing or network analysis?\nThe most known network analysis or packet sniffing tool is called WireShark. It was known as Ethereal in the past and gathered datagram in real time have them in a form that you can read. It has color coding, filters, and other great features. It helps you analyze individual data packets and helps you go deeper in network matters.\n\n\nCan hackers use packet sniffers?\nYes, they use packet sniffers to access your network. By packet sniffing, they can gather sensitive information and even spy on your communications with other persons in your network.\n\n\nHow can you increase the security of my network?\nYou may consider transmitting encrypted data which only the recipient can decrypt. That way a hacker cannot access your info using a packet sniffer.\n\n\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company OAK Academy gives education in the field of IT, Software, Design, development in Turkish, English, Portuguese, Spanish, and a lot of different language on Udemy platform where it has over 1000 hours of video education lessons OAK Academy both increase its education series number by publishing new courses, and it makes students aware of all the innovations of already published courses by upgrading.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise\n\n\nFresh Content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate New tools are released every day, Google updates Android and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge With this course, you will always have a chance to follow latest trends\n\n\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our content is created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you the best learning experience\n\n\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\n\n\nWe offer full support, answering any questions\n\n\nDive in now into the \"Wireshark Packet Analysis & Capturing Network Packet Traffic\nWireshark- Learn TCP/IP, Network Protocols' Packet Capture & Network Analysis to troubleshoot network for cyber security\n\n\nSee you in the course!",

      "description": "Welcome to Learn Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing!\n\nThis course will teach you the techniques used by professional penetration testers and ethical hackers world wide. By the end of it, you will have the skills to hack systems and networks in the same ways that a “black-hat” would, as well as the knowledge to secure those same systems against such intrusion.\n\nWhether you are an IT professional or just starting out, this class is for you. No prior knowledge of hacking or coding is required. Everything is laid out and explained step-by-step through practical demonstration. You will not only master the tools of ethical hacking, you will also learn the theory behind their use. The skills you acquire here will give you the foundational knowledge needed to keep up in this ever growing field.\n\nThis class is arranged into nine modules, and moves from beginner to advanced subjects. Each lecture is designed to lead into the next, so that students with no prior knowledge will find the flow easy to follow. At the same time, with only a few noted exceptions, each lecture can be treated as being stand-alone by advanced students who already have the prior grounding.\n\nWhat you'll learn:\n\n\nModule One: Setting Up The Lab\n\n\n* How to install VirtualBox on a Windows operating system.\n* How to setup dual booting for Windows and Linux\n* How to install Kali Linux on a portable USB device with persistence\n* How to install Kali Linux (or the pentesting distro of your choice) on Virtualbox\n* A deeper explanation of VirtualBox configurations.\n* How to install Metasploitable on VirtualBox to serve as a training target for the development of your skills.\n\n\nBy the end of the first module, you will acquire the knowledge to setup your own hacking lab. Even if you only have a single computer to work with, you will be able to create virtualized systems within your primary operating system. This will give you many options for how to follow along with the lectures in this class, and remove the need to install a second operating system on your main computer if you prefer not to. It will also give you targets that you personally own and control to conduct penetration tests against, allowing you to try out what you learn on your own network without concern!\n\n\nModule Two: Information Gathering\n\n\nAny successful penetration test begins with the information gathering phase. Whether your objective is direct network penetration, social engineering, or simply research, knowing a target before you proceed is crucial to victory.\n\n\n* Learn how to conduct deep research against a target or entity using open source intelligence tools.\n* Use OSINT techniques to become your own private investigator!\n* Gently transition from fun graphical tools to Linux command-line tools seamlessly.\n* Acquire the skills to build detailed profiles of any subject, and establish attack vectors for later exploitation!\n* Become familiar with and ultimately master network scanning with tools such as Nmap and Zenmap.\n* Learn to identify weaknesses in any system, be it a network or even a corporate structure.\n* Get your feet wet with the basics of exploiting a few of these weaknesses in a user friendly GUI environment.\nWith the skills you learn in this module, you can pretty much become your own Private Eye. Open source intelligence is the way of the future, and the amount of information that is generally available online about any subject is truly staggering. Beginners will find these tools easy to use, and the transition from graphical utilities to the command-line should be both fun and gentle.\n\n\nModule Three: Vulnerability Analysis\n\n\n* Go deeper than you have thus far. Use what you have learned already to find vulnerabilities in web-based applications and services!\n* Learn the tools and techniques to begin exploiting these vulnerabilities.\n* Develop the skills to audit services. Use what you learn here to harden the security of online services that you create and defend.\n* Master the very techniques that “black hats” will use against such services.\n\n\nWith a focus on web services, module three continues the transition into command-line based utilities in fun and easy to master steps.\n\n\nModule Four: Web Vulnerability, Recon, SQL Injection & Database Exploitation\n\n\nTake the basics you learned in the prior module to the next level!\n\n\n* Master the art of finding “hard to spot” vulnerabilities in web services and network systems.\n* Learn to use the legendary “Burpsuite” in several easy lessons.\n* Become skilled with SQL Injection and SQLMAP, and learn how no website or database is truly safe!\n* Basic introduction to proxies. Learn the basic concepts that will be expanded upon later for staying safe and anonymous while conducting operations.\n* Spider the internet for secrets like a pro, with just a few simple key strokes!\n\n\nNow that you have learned to spot vulnerabilities, the basics of gaining web access, and how to obtain secure databases, it is time to take your training to a higher stage with what you'll learn in the following module.\n\nModule Five: Password Cracking\n\n\n* Take the techniques of “brute forcing” passwords and logins to the next level.\n* Create custom wordlists that are intelligently suited for a particular target. Greatly increase the speed and success rate of cracking any given password even on less powerful computer systems.\n* Learn all about Hashes and how to crack them. Decode the coded information from any database.\n* Gain familiarity with cross-platform tools, allowing you to conduct your cracking operations from any operating system.\n* Obtain the knowledge to make use of Rainbow Tables, which will open the door to attacking even the tightest credential security.\n* Pick up and use legendary tools like HashCat and John The Ripper with ease.\n\n\nProgress from the cracking of passwords, logins and database security directly into the sixth module. Here you'll learn all about hacking WIFI networks, and what you can do once you've penetrated the network.\n\n\nModule six: WIFI Hacking\n\n\n* Easy-to-learn introduction covers all the basic commands you'll need to get started.\n* All major methods covered, from old to new.\n* Identify vulnerable access points (that you have legal permission to test) and watch them fall!\n* Learn how to grab the encrypted “handshake” from any router device and crack it.\n* Know what to do with network access once you achieve it.\n* Learn about Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and how to guard against them!\n\n\nAs both a system administrator and ethical hacker, knowing the weaknesses in any Wifi network is essential. Whether you are trying to secure your grandmothers internet connection against the kid next door, or the internal network of a Fortune 500 company, these skills are crucial.\n\n\nBy this point, you'll have learned all the basics. You'll know how to scope your targets, gather information, identify vulnerabilities, crack passwords, and achieve access to secure networks. Now the fun begins...\n\n\nModule Seven: Metasploit\n\n\nThe bread and butter of ethical hacking, this module focuses entirely on the Metasploit framework. While other lectures can treated as “stand-alone”, the videos in this section must be viewed in order from start to finish. You will take everything you have learned so far and translate it into real action.\n\n\n* Master Metasploit and it's graphical cousin, Aritmage.\n* Take what you have learned so far and use it to penetrate any system.\n* Conduct your experiments using your own virtual machines as targets.\n* Feel the satisfaction of exploiting all those weaknesses you've found against systems you personally own, and the fearful realization that no system is truly secure.\n* Use what you learn to harden the security of the systems you protect. Know what to look for to avoid being hacked yourself!\n* Learn how to “hook” browsers and take control of the information going through them, without the end-user even being aware that anything is happening!\n* Generate your own malware for testing purposes within the Metasploit framework. No prior coding knowledge required!\n* Employ “crypters” on your own malware, so that it will evade even the most advanced detection scans.\n* Learn how to identify such “disguised” malware when it is employed against you!\n* It isn't enough to simply gain access. Learn how to escalate your privileges once you are inside a penetrated system.\n* It isn't enough to simply become admin. Learn how to establish a long-term presence on a system or network in the form of “persistent access”. Don't work hard over and over. Work hard once, then reap the benefits of what you now own!\n\n\nModule 8: Encryption and Anonymity\n\n\n* Learn how to create encrypted containers to secure important files for both storage and transit.\n* Learn how to fully encrypt any Windows operating system, from XP all the way to Windows 10.\n* Learn how to create an encrypted Decoy, as well as an encrypted Hidden, Windows operating system. Done correctly, no one will be able to identify and prove the existence of the hidden system!\n* Learn how to create an encrypted Decoy, Hidden AND Linux operating system, then boot into whichever one you want. This one isn't for the faint of heart though!\n* Learn how to erase a drive or even an entire system in a secure manner, so that no trace of your activities can be found by even the most determined cyber forensics!\n* Master the art of PGP (Pretty Good Encryption). Send and receive communications with military level security. Learn how people remain anonymous while still proving who they are using PGP Public and Private keys.\n* Understand how to easily verify any file or communication, making tampering impossible.\n* Learn all about the TOR anonymity network, and the Deepweb (aka DarkNet). Ensure secure lines of communication with other penetration testers and ethical hackers across the world.\n* Become familiar with the TAILS operating system and how to use it quickly and easily on any computer system through a live boot. Leave no trace of your activities behind on the system once you are done!\n* Learn about and implement Virtual Private Network (VPN) security to conceal all that you do online from other hackers and watchful internet service providers. Spoof your IP and Geo Location information with ease. Get around regional blocks and establish secure VPN tunnels through network firewalls.\n* Use ProxyChains in Linux to further secure your penetration testing activities.\n* Understand the nature of “cryptocurrency” and so-called “Blockchain” technology.\n\n\nAnd because no level of security and anonymity is ever truly enough, learn all about virtual private servers in the next module.\n\n\nModule Nine: Virtual Private Servers\n\n\n* Learn what a VPS is and how to select one that is suitable to your needs.\n* Use what you have learned so far to connect “securely” to a VPS that you have chosen, then conduct your activities from the VPS itself, which may also be made to employ the same connection security methods.\n* Learn how Virtual Private Servers can be used as “Command and Control” stations for BotNets, and what to look for as a system administrator who is facing constant attacks.\n* Learn about so-called free “community” BotNets so that you can defend against them.\n\n\nAnd so much more!\n\n\nWho this class is for:\n\n\n*Anyone interested in penetration testing and ethical hacking. This class is designed to assume no prior knowledge or experience in the field. Advanced students need only skip ahead to the material they wish to study.\n* Those wishing to advance their career in the field of IT and achieve a better rate of pay.\n* Students who plan to freelance online, through resources such as Linked-In.

      "description": "Do you want to learn how to hack websites and web application in the most fun way?\nIf yes, then this course is for you.\nIn this course, you will start as a beginner with no previous experience and knowledge about website or web app hacking. You will learn different hacking methodologies, tools and techniques. This course gives you ideas on website hacking through theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. This course is focused on the practical side of penetration testing without neglecting the theory behind each attack. Rather than using virtual machines and Kali Linux tools, We will be using the \"hackthissite\" website to hone our website hacking skills.\nThere are several websites on the internet which allow learners to hack through cool and realistic challenges. These websites are free of cost to use and help us understand how web hacking works at the core level. By completing all these challenges and missions, you will be able to start your career as web pen-tester. You can then use some tools and techniques using Kali Linux to uplift your knowledge. But, if you are a complete beginner then, this course will be perfect to start with.\nMost of the courses you will find at Udemy will teach you hacking through installing Linux on your machines using virtual machines. This way of learning web hacking can be troublesome for some of us because our machine may not be high end enough to support these tools smoothly.\nIn order to make anyone start with ethical hacking and web hacking, I have brought this course to you which can be compatible with any machine (Linux, Windows, MacOS x) because we will be learning to hack through completing missions and challenges given by “hackthissite” website.\nIn this course, we will cover basic to advanced concepts of web and application hacking in a fun and exciting way which will feel like you are playing some sort of the games where you complete the missions and you get rewarded. The “Hack This Site” website we will be using throughout this course is a popular platform among hackers to learn and play hacking games similar to Capture The Flag (CTF).\nYou will learn following topics throughout this course:\nPHP code vulnerability\nHTML code tampering\nEncryption and Decryption\nServer Side Include commands\nCookies tampering\nDirectory listing vulnerability\nSQL injection attacks\nReverse Engineering\nCryptography\nApache server related vulnerability\nCross site scripting attacks (XSS)\nTampering forms and cookies\nApplication hacking using x64dbg and tools\nWire-shark\nYou do not need any virtual machines, Kali Linux or high end machines to learn websites and application hacking in this course. I will be using Windows 10 to complete the missions and learn at the same time. You can use any operating system to learn from this course. I will be using Chrome as a web browser throughout this course.\nLastly, This course does not teach you only these aforementioned attacks/missions, we will be updating new content like Javascript missions, programming missions and other remaining missions. Completing these missions, I am sure you will have enough knowledge to attack any type of website you want. Hope to see you at the class!\nCaution: Please take permissions of the owner before defacing any websites.",

      "description": "A penetration tester who only knows how to use tools written by others is limited to old techniques. Learning to develop your own exploits will make you much more powerful. Python is the favorite choice for penetration testers because it combines simplicity and ease of use with advanced features.\nThis video course starts with high-level code injection, the simplest sort of exploit. It then explains binary exploits that allow you to skip past unwanted code, such as the password or product key tests, and add Trojan code. You will perform the exploit development process: finding a vulnerability, analyzing a crash in a debugger, creating a crafted attack, and achieving remote code execution on Windows and Linux. You will use the gdb debugger to analyze Linux executables and Python code to exploit them. On Windows, you'll use the Immunity debugger and Python.\nAbout the Author\nSam Bowne has been teaching computer networking and security classes at City College San Francisco since 2000.

      "description": "Chaos Engineering Bootcamp: A Hands-On Guide to Building Resilient Systems with Chaos Experiments\n\n\nChaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. Advances in large-scale, distributed software systems are changing the game for software engineering. As an industry, we are quick to adopt practices that increase flexibility of development and velocity of deployment. But with this increased complexity comes a new set of challenges: how much confidence can we have in the complex systems that we put into production?\nEven when all of the individual services in a distributed system are functioning properly, the interactions between those services can cause unpredictable outcomes. Unpredictable outcomes, compounded by rare but disruptive real-world events that affect production environments, make these distributed systems inherently chaotic.\nGetting started with Chaos Engineering is easier than you think! In this 2-hour interactive workshop, we'll teach you the fundamentals of Chaos Engineering and provide hands-on experience with Chaos experiments. We'll provide all of the necessary tools, including the infrastructure, demo application, monitoring, and Gremlin!\nIn this comprehensive course, you'll learn how to design and run effective chaos experiments that improve the reliability of your Kubernetes cluster. Over the course, you'll gain an in-depth understanding of the principles and best practices of Chaos Engineering. We'll cover a range of topics, including:\n\n\nThe basics of Chaos Engineering and its importance for Kubernetes\nHow to design effective chaos experiments that test different failure scenarios\nBest practices for implementing Chaos Engineering in Kubernetes\nHow to use Chaos Mesh, a powerful open-source tool, to run and monitor chaos experiments in Kubernetes\nTroubleshooting tips for common issues that arise during chaos experiments\nBy the end of the course, you should have a clear understanding of the principles of Chaos Engineering; how to proactively increase the resilience of infrastructure, applications, and processes; hands-on application through popular tools, especially   Litmus or Chaos Mesh.\nWhether you're a DevOps engineer, Kubernetes administrator, or anyone else responsible for the reliability of a Kubernetes cluster, this course will equip you with the knowledge and hands-on experience you need to confidently implement Chaos Engineering with Chaos Mesh.

You will be provided with example contracts of a rental property, film, sports team and a resource company that you can edit insert into our working smart contract template and deploy on the Ropsten Ethereum test network which you can then use the exact same steps to deploy your new security or asset token on the main Ethereum blockchain network.\nI am an award winning educator, tech founder and CEO and have already successfully launched my own ICO. Over 115 different tokens have officially launched using this very same process already.\nHow it Works\nImagine that you have a four bedroom property . The property is valued at $1,000,000 you want to raise $400,000 to improve the property or purchase other properties. How can you do this quickly without much friction?\nA Security or Asset Token is a method that converts rights to an asset into a digital token.\nTokenization can transform this property into 1,000,000 tokens.\nThus, each token represents a 0.0001% share of the underlying asset.\nFinally, we issue the token on the Ethereum blockchain network, so that the tokens can be freely bought and sold directly from seller to buyer wallets, from a website or on different exchanges.\nYou will have a front row seat as I will take you through every step of the way creating your own Security of Asset Token as we launch \"YourAssetToken\" in real time together on the Ropsten Network from start to completion, using a single smart contract and My Ether Wallet .\nI have found that this is the simplest way to set up a Security or Asset Token contract that is flexible for numerous uses and once you learn to do it once you can replicate it as many times as you want.\nThis will be UDEMY's first course on this subject.\nIn addition to showing you how to create your ethereum wallet, edit your smart contract and launch your very own security or asset token on the Ethereum blockchain, I will:\nProvide a real world examples of \"Off Chain Contracts \" for real-estate, a film, a sports team and a resource company and show you how to edit it and insert it into your smart contract already coded and ready to be edited with your name, symbol, token price and other details.\nShow you how to tokenize securities or assets, and value your tokens in relation to them.\nShow you what proof of title is and all the legal considerations involved in simple terms without legal jargon.\nWith great power comes great responsibility, so please be cautious with your new blockchain superpowers. My hope is that you use this new knowledge for good as you will be empowered by the potential that this technology puts in your hands.\n\nSo join me as we create your Security or Asset Token smart contract then launch it on Ethereum Blockchain network.",

This course begins by introducing students to the format string concepts on Linux x86_64 platform (though the concepts remain the same on other architectures too). We will slowly gear towards understanding how format string vulnerabilities can be leveraged to exploit other vulnerabilities such as Buffer Overflows. This is clearly taught in the course by showing various practical examples such as bypassing stack canaries and bypassing ASLR. This is an entry level to intermediate level course and we encourage you to take this course if you are interested to learn exploit development concepts surrounding format string vulnerabilities and memory leaks specifically for 64 bit intel processors. However, remember that the course involves a lot of assembly language and debugging using a debugger. So, you need patience and passion to learn the concepts taught in the course. This course makes use of a variety of techniques on exploit development and brace yourself if you are willing to learn by sitting in front of a computer. After successfully completing this course, you will be ready to attempt several industry leading practical cyber security certification exams.",

      "description": "In this mini-course, we will learn about subnetting. We will start small, by getting acquainted with the IPv4 address and getting to know the terms. When things are a bit clearer we start dealing with classful addressing. Classful addressing is about dividing the whole IPv4 range into 5 classes and we will be dealing with 3 of them and which was the only solution we used to use in the early days before subnetting. We will see also the private and public IP addresses. The problem is, it wasn't optimized. Then subnetting or classless addressing shows up and we start learning about its way of doing things and walk you thru the necessary steps like, how to borrow bits, how many valid IP addresses and networks will be generated.  Then we will see the difference between FLSM and VLSM which is a necessity for more optimization where different subnets have a different number of hosts.  Along the way, we will solve subnetting examples and quizzes to help you engage more and try out what you have learned. In the last section we will see some miscellaneous topics like, how would we know to which network this device belongs and the importance of the gateway. I hope you will enjoy this mini-course and get a thing or two from it.",

      "description": "SQL injection is a type of vulnerability that can allow attackers to inject malicious SQL code into a web application's backend database, potentially giving them access to sensitive data or even taking control of the entire system.\n\n\nWhat is SQL injection with example?\nSQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.\n\n\nWhy need to do that course?\nThe course would be structured in a way that is accessible to students with a range of backgrounds and levels of experience. It would start with the basics of SQL injection, including an introduction to SQL and database queries, before moving on to more advanced topics. The course would be designed to be practical and hands-on, with plenty of opportunities for students to gain experience in identifying, testing, and remediating SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\n\nOn that course would cover the following topics:\nIntroduction to SQL injection: Explanation of what SQL injection is, how it works, and the potential impact of an attack.\nTypes of SQL injection: Overview of the different types of SQL injection, including union-based, error-based, blind, and others.\nPrevention and mitigation techniques: Discussion of the best practices for preventing and mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities, including parameterized queries, input validation, escaping, and other security measures.\nExploitation of SQL injection: Explanation of how attackers can exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data, install malware, or take control of the system.\nDetection and testing: Overview of the methods used to detect and test for SQL injection vulnerabilities, including manual testing, automated tools, and other techniques.\nCase studies and real-world examples: Discussion of real-world examples of SQL injection vulnerabilities, including lessons learned and best practices.\nSecure coding practices: Overview of the secure coding practices that can help prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, including input validation, output encoding, and other security measures.\nCompliance and audits: Explanation of the various regulations, standards, and best practices related to SQL injection and how they are audited and enforced.\nPatching and remediation: Explanation of how SQL injection vulnerabilities can be patched and remediated, including methods for fixing the underlying code or applying security updates.\nHands-on experience: Practical exercises that allow students to gain hands-on experience in identifying, testing, and remediating SQL injection vulnerabilities.\nAdvanced topics: Discussion of more advanced topics related to SQL injection, including bypassing filters, exploiting blind SQL injection, and other advanced techniques.\nFuture trends: Overview of emerging trends and technologies in the field of SQL injection, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.\nThis course would be suitable for developers, security professionals, and anyone interested in improving their understanding of SQL injection vulnerabilities and how to prevent them. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to identify, test for, and remediate SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications, helping to protect against malicious attacks and safeguard sensitive data.",

      "description": "BEATING FRAUD\nFraud, including payment fraud and insurance fraud, is one of the biggest problems for organizations.\nAnd new advances in terms of generative AI have only made this worse.\nIn the world of today, organizations and individuals must be able to not only resist fraud attempts, but resist when they leverage generative AI - which, in many cases, means faster, larger-scale and more sophisticated attacks.\nThis course will teach you how to protect against fraud that leverages generative AI.\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING.\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn the basics of generative AI and what it can do, including common models and families of models, the characteristics of generative content, and how it can be misused due to negligence or active malevolence (including biases, misinformation, impersonation and more);\nYou'll learn the basics of fraud and its main types (identity theft, payment fraud, investment fraud, insurance fraud, account takeover), and the main factors enabling it (technological gaps, human error, process weaknesses, data breaches);\nYou'll learn how fraud is accelerated by generative AI (mass automation, increased authenticity, pattern evasion, synthetic identity creation, etc) and its effect on the major approaches (document forgery, transaction manipulation, synthetic identity fraud, claims fraud, etc);\nYou'll learn about an overview of the major generative content types used in fraud attacks (text, image, audio and video), including the specific approaches that each leverage, the model training requirements and data required for attackers to train such models, and how each type can be detected;\nYou'll learn about generative text in fraud, including the models that allow it such as LLMs, the distribution channels such as email, SMS, chats, the data required to train such models, and detection mechanisms such as behavioral analysis, authentication and text validations;\nYou'll learn about generative image in fraud, including the models that allow it such as GANs or diffusion models, the distribution channels such as deceptive documents and images in email attachments or submission portals, the data required to train such models, and detection mechanisms such as watermarks, behavioral detection or MFA;\nYou'll learn about generative audio in fraud, including the models that allow it such as GANs or TTS, the distribution channels such as voice messaging software or for calls, the data required to train such models, and detection mechanisms such as MFA factors, callbacks, or training employees;\nYou'll learn about generative video in fraud, including the models that allow it such as GANs for video or deep learning models, the distribution channels such as communication tools or submission portals, the data required to train such models, and detection mechanisms such as verifying communications, anti-deepfake software, MFA;",

      "description": "Research conducted on malicious campaigns found the successful establishment of a persistence mechanism(s) necessary for the attacker to achieve their goals. Installing persistence is a choke point in the attack method and provides an opportunity for detection through the analysis of affected system artifacts.\nThe identification of a compromised system is a high priority. Discovering the compromise early during an investigation improves scoping, containment, mitigation, and remediation efforts. If persistence is not detected, it may reduce the perceived risk of the system. Either finding is valuable for making resource assignment decisions.\nThis class teaches you how to utilize readily available artifacts to uncover persistence mechanisms quickly. Each module breaks down the artifact from a DFIR point of view, identifying key elements and analysis strategy guidelines along the way. Just about any forensic platform or security appliance may be used once you understand how to approach the artifact. Splunk is used to provide SIEM logic examples. Open-source tools, with a little python scripting, is used for the practical exercises. The completed python scripts are provided as well.\nThe main artifact categories covers evidence that appears in investigations repeatedly:\nWindows event logs for services\nWindows event logs for scheduled tasks\nWindows registry autoruns and registry modification events.",

There are two common trends that emerge from those conversations:\nMost enterprises are using Istio or plan to implement Istio in production soon.\nThere is a lack of enough experts capable of configuring Istio for enterprises.\nIstio is a complex piece of software. It demands a steep learning curve. But DevOps and SREs who understand the basic concepts of Istio and its underlying technology, Envoy, can cross the learning curve with relative ease.\nAnd that is the goal of this course: to make you thorough with the fundamentals of Istio service mesh and help you move up your career ladder.\nThe modules in this course are thus structured and recorded in a way that they are easy to understand. There are demo videos to make your hands dirty and also make you get started with testing Istio by yourself.\nHere’s a glimpse what all topics we’ll cover in the course:\nIntroduction to service mesh and Istio\nIstio components and Envoy proxy\nIstio implementation - demo\nZero trust network (ZTN) and mTLS with Istio - demo\nIstio Gateway\nLoad balancing and canary rollouts with Istio - demo\nThe architecture of Istio and API gateway\nNetwork resiliency features of Istio\nCircuit breaking, timeouts and retries, fault injection, traffic mirroring - demo\nIstio observability architecture\nHow to get application logs, Envoy logs, and traces\nJaeger, Prometheus, and Kiali - demo\nIstio integrations\nThe latest Istio ambient mesh\nThere will be widespread adoption of Istio since it became CNCF-graduated recently. And DevOps and SREs who understand and can implement Istio will be in high demand.\nBest of luck!",

By the end of the course, developers, AI enthusiasts, risk managers, and security professionals will be well-prepared to lead the charge in the evolving landscape of AI-assisted software development.\nParticipants will delve into the architecture of AI language models, understanding their inner workings and how they can be effectively utilized in software development. The course starts with an introduction to AI in code generation, covering the history and evolution of AI in coding, and presenting current AI tools and technologies like GitHub Copilot and GPT-4. Learners will get hands-on experience through practical exercises and case studies, contrasting secure and insecure code generated by AI.\nThe curriculum then addresses the benefits and risks of AI code generation, highlighting how AI can increase development speed and efficiency while also presenting potential risks such as biases and deprecated practices in training data. Participants will learn how to mitigate these risks through thorough evaluation and ethical considerations.\nA dedicated lecture on the top 10 risks for 2025 when it comes to AI code generation guides learners on what controls they need to implement to avoid these risks. This lecture explores the potential pitfalls associated with AI-generated code, such as biases, legal violations, deprecated practices, and security oversights. AI can accelerate development, but it also introduces challenges like algorithmic bias and unintentional inclusion of GPL-licensed code, potentially forcing projects into open-source. Examples, such as recruiting tools discriminating against women and commercial products using GPL-licensed code without proper compliance, highlight the importance of vigilance. The lecture also covers security issues, privacy leaks, logic errors in algorithms, and risks from deprecated APIs, mentioning common breaches. These real-world examples reinforce the need for proper controls and oversight when integrating AI into development workflows .\nThe next two lectures demonstrate the process of transforming human language into secure AI-generated code. Participants learn key secure coding principles and how to craft effective prompts to guide AI models in producing secure code. The demonstration emphasizes prompt engineering, showing the difference between a simple prompt (\"Generate a React login form\") and a secure one (\"Generate a React login form with input validation, CSRF protection, and secure handling against XSS\"). Additionally, the lecture discusses secure coding practices in React, such as protecting against XSS attacks and ensuring client-side authentication workflows are robust\nIn lecture 6, participants will learn how to assess the reliability, security, and quality of AI-generated code using specific evaluation metrics. Key code reliability indicators such as Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), and cyclomatic complexity are discussed. The importance of identifying security gaps, maintaining consistent performance, and fostering trust in AI tools are emphasized.\nFinally, the last lecture focuses on integrating the evaluation metrics from previous lectures into real-world scenarios. Demos are presented to showcase how these metrics can be applied to ensure that AI-generated code is not only functional but secure and maintainable. The lecture reinforces the idea that developers must \"trust but verify\" when it comes to AI-generated code, using both automated and manual techniques to confirm that the code meets security and performance expectations\nThrough in-depth real-world case studies and expert insights, learners will gain practical knowledge to confidently leverage AI in their coding projects, ensuring the highest standards of security and reliability. This comprehensive course empowers learners to stay ahead of the curve, adapt to new AI advancements, and implement robust security measures in their projects, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to excel in the field.

After that, you have to download the Chromedriver, the final step is to set up the This course is based on the Python programming language. To use Python, you first need to download PyCharm, which is an integrated development environment (IDE). Next, you’ll need to download the ChromeDriver, and the final step is setting up the ChromeDriver. These steps are demonstrated for free in a previous course.\nThis course consists of three videos. In these videos, I explain how to use automated software to create automated emails. The modules used in this course include Pandas, CSV, Selenium, String, Random, and Time. I believe I provide insight into how to use these modules efficiently. While the videos do not explain every function in depth (for example, the Pandas module requires many videos to cover fully), I showcase some key operations of these specific modules.\nGenerally, the course focuses on the core module, Selenium. The first thing I show in the videos is how to open the ChromeDriver. After that, I navigate to the platform where the emails are created, and using the Selenium module, I click on the appropriate buttons. Then, I generate random emails using the other modules. With Selenium, I fill in the email field and proceed in the same way with the password field, where I generate complex passwords and send them to the correct fields. For each email creation, I also show a script that saves the email names and passwords in a CSV file, so they can be used later for logging into the email accounts.\nThis is the entirety of the course, and I would like to conclude by encouraging you to use this course to improve your Python programming skills, but not for malicious purposes. Creating excessive emails could harm the email platform, and you may get banned, so it's important to use these tools responsibly.\nAs I mentioned, for a more detailed explanation, feel free to contact me via email, as I have been teaching online Python lessons for the past few months.",
