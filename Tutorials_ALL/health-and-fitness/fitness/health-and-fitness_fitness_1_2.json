Tai chi is practiced for both its defense training, its health benefits and meditation.\nQigong, qi gong, chi kung, or chi gung (simplified Chinese: 气功 qìgōng literally: \"Life Energy Cultivation\") is a holistic system of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used in belief it promotes health, spirituality, and martial arts training.

      "description": "Burn fat, eat right and get in shape with 20 minutes daily routine at home.\nYour fitness edge comes from consistent exercise becoming a part of your life.\nMaking your workouts convenient is part of removing the hurdles that keep you from developing the life-changing habit of a consistent fitness routine.\nAnd it doesn’t get more convenient than the at-home workout. Keep reading to learn all the benefits of working out at home and fast track your health.\n\n\n1. Cost-Effective\nSweating it out at home saves serious cash. Gym memberships cost a pretty penny these days, not to mention the cost of gas traveling to the gym.\nSave that cash and use it to give yourself a reward after completing an at-home exercise streak or challenge.\n2. Time-Saving\nWorking out at-home saves commute time. Cutting the amount of time it takes to workout cuts excuses.\nEliminating the excuse of not enough time is one of many benefits of working out at home that keeps you on track all year long.\nAt home, it only takes 5 min. to be ready for a run, clicked into an exercise video, or playing your favorite music while pumping dumbbells.\n3. Flexible\nYou will get sick, you’ll overbook your days, and you won’t always be able to get to the gym. The habit of the at-home workout saves the day when things don’t go as planned and you need more flexibility.\nFlexibility is important when establishing and staying on track with a workout routine.\n4. No Nasty Germs\nThanks to Covid 19, avoiding germs has gone to a whole new level. The fact is most of us don’t have the choice to go to the gym right now. Hopefully, that will change but avoiding dangerous germs is always important.\nExercising at home keeps germs at bay. There’s no need to wipe down machines, worry about who sat on the machines before you, or worry what else you might pick up when your phone drops on the floor.\nYou might love the gym, but you probably can’t wait to wash your hands, phone, and clothes after your workouts.\n5. Clean Up and Get Ready At Home\nSpeaking of clean, cleansing your body of all the toxins you’ve sweated out and using your own personal beauty products is a huge benefit to an at-home workout.\nWho knows what’s lurking on the floors of your local gym’s showers. Even worse is not showering and stewing in salty, sweaty toxins until you finally get a chance to rinse off at home.\n6. Privacy Working Out At Home\nIn the privacy of your own home, you don’t have to worry about who’s judging your form, fashion, or fitness level.\nNo need to be polite, you can just be. Sometimes you need some time to yourself away from the crowd. Your home is your safe haven where you can really get into your workout and not worry about the other people around you.\n7. No Creepers\nUnfortunately, they’re out there. Most of the time they just watch but every once in a while, they’re bold enough to approach.\nYes, ignoring them or giving them the stink eye is a good idea but it’s freeing to workout at home without being observed by the lookie-loo two machines away.\n8. Eliminate Distractions\nWhile you may need to eliminate some distractions while working out at home, gym distractions are not easily changed.\nBad music, news on tv screens, friends you haven’t seen in a while, or strangers chatting next to the machine you’re working on can slow you down and take the focus away from your workout.\n9. Freedom – No Rules\nYour house, your rules. The gym on the other hand must have rules, lots of rules.\nWipe down the machines, no dropping the weights, opening and closing times, use the machines this way, not that way, no loud music, leave your cell phone in your locker, be on time for your class, no chit chat.\nDon’t get me wrong, I like rules at the gym! But it’s nice not to have any when you workout at home.\n10. Always Open\nAt home workouts are always available. Unless you’re a member at 24 hr fitness, your gym’s schedule is going to limit you.\nThis benefit is also important when establishing an exercise habit. The more times a week you workout, the faster you will see results. Momentum builds and then not exercising feels strange.\nDon’t let hours of operations stop you from being your best self.\n11. Doesn’t Matter What You Wear\nNo shoes, no shirts, no problem!\nBust your move in jammies, wear those comfy shorts that expose cellulite, or don your favorite holey tee. No one cares what you wear when you’re at home.\nLet’s face it, some of the things you’d be willing to work out in at home could get you some strange looks at the gym.\n12. Messy Hair, Don’t Care\nNo makeup, messy hair? At home, who cares!\nYour workout goal at home is to get started. The goal for the gym is to at least tame the Lion King hair you woke up with and maybe swipe on some gloss and mascara.\nOnce again, working out at home saves you time and puts fitness first.\n13. Limits Excuses\nStarting an exercise routine and sticking with it is always going to be rife with excuses and roadblocks to overcome. Excuses don’t get results.\nThe at-home workout eliminates lots of potential excuses.\nWhen you have a workout routine that you can do wherever you are, you become master and commander of your fitness.\nNothing can stop you and that’s what you need.\n14. No Rush\nAt home, no one’s waiting for you to finish your reps so they can use your machine.\nClass doesn’t have a start and stop time. You go at your own pace. If you need to hit pause to get a drink, you don’t miss out on any moves.\nNo rushing home to get dinner started. Pop dinner in the oven to cook while you slay your cross fit video.\n15. No Lines\nSometimes, you’re the one waiting in line at the gym.\nIt’s frustrating to watch the lifter on the crunch machine scrolling and texting on their phone between reps. Do you become that toe tapping impatient person or kindly confront them?\nIt’s nice to run through your routine without worrying about someone else’s schedule.\n16. More Joy- Less Ego\nComparison is the thief of joy. It’s hard not to compare a little when you’re at the gym.\nWhen you workout at home you more easily make the only comparison that really matters. How well you did today compared to yesterday. You’re in competition with yourself, not the younger, fitter member at the gym.\n17. Workout With Family And Friends\nGoing for a walk with your girlfriend takes exercise to the next level. Chatty healthy fun.\nLively outdoor activities with your kids builds strong bodies and relationships.\nTrying to motivate your family to workout with you at the gym and then getting everyone there is like pulling teeth.\nPart of being healthy is developing community. When you combine important relationships with exercise it’s a win-win.\n18. Quick and Easy\nWhere do you have 15 min today? You almost always have 15 min somewhere in your day. The beauty of at-home exercise is that you can fit it in even on your busiest days.\nQuick 15 min body-weight training or HIIT routines can be done once a day or numerous times throughout the day for hassle free fitness.\nWhen you’re at home, it’s easy to stop what you’re doing and stretch for a few minutes, or drop and do 25 sit ups. You don’t have to prep anything to run up and down your stairs 10 times between activities.\nGoing to the gym isn’t quick and easy. After all the prep and travel, the last thing you want to do is a quick 15 min. workout.\n19. Workout For Your Brain\nRegularly working out at home more easily leads to creatively finding new ways to incorporate movement into your day.\nSquats in the kitchen while you wait for the water to boil. Racing your dog up the stairs, push ups between commercials. Fitness becomes a part of your home life and isn’t just reserved for the gym.\nA no brainer gym routine can be helpful for staying on track with fitness, but your muscles and brain crave variety.\n20. More Variety\nLike your brain, it’s good for your muscles to be challenged with new movements. Once muscles adapt to a workout, you lose the effectiveness of those exercises.There is no better way to add variety to your workouts than when you’re at home.\nOutdoor sports, exercises videos and apps, body weight routines, core building, walking, running, dancing, the variety of options is almost limitless.\n21. More Comfortable\nAt home workouts cannot be beat for comfort. Physical, mental, and emotional. Want to get comfortable with fitness? Start working out from home. You’ll build confidence and strength in yourself and your body.\nWalking into a new environment full of strangers is so much easier when you already have some mastery over flexibility, strength, and mobility.\n22. No Judgement\nWhen you exercise at home no one judges your body, what exercises you’re doing, or if you’re working out to their standards.\nLifting 10 lb free weights between two power lifting women is kinda awkward. Which leads to an important point. Don’t judge yourself either. Whether at the gym or at home. Do your best and forget the rest.\n23. Eliminates Fear Of Failure\nIt’s a lot easier to fail privately than in a room full of people.\nCan’t keep your balance while lunging? Couldn’t lift your weights more than twice? Leggings aren’t squat proof? No one cares when you’re at home.\nAt home, you can focus on failing forward without the pressure of others witnessing your mistakes and struggles.\nIt gives you room to develop an attitude of strength and confidence before working out in front of others.\n24. No Embarrassment\nNo need to worry about awkward sweat showing through your leggings or t-shirt.\nCrazy bridge thrusting? No need to blush.\nEvery awkward, suggestive, unattractive move can be done without cringing.\nHow many exercises do you pass up at the gym because there is no way you’re doing that move in public?\n25. No Weird Smells\nBetween stranger’s body odor, dirty floors, old sweat, and the constant spraying of disinfectants, the gym can be toxic to your nose.\nYour house smells like home and if you’re outdoors…ah, sweet fresh air.\n26. Fido And Kitty Cheer You On\nWhat could be better than having your little tiger come over and give you a nudge of encouragement during a workout?\nIt’s sweet when you get down on the ground for stretching and your favorite critter comes over for some love.\nBesides, your pup might get that walk he’s been craving, instead of waiting for you to get home from the gym.\n27. Vitamin D\nAt home, exercising outside is a breeze.\nNot only will you enjoy the benefits of exercise, but you’ll increase your Vitamin D levels too.\nVitamin D helps fight disease, reduces depression, and boosts weight loss.\n28. Leads To More Well Rounded Workouts\nYou’re more likely to mix it up a bit when you workout at home. A mix of cardio, core, weights, mobility, and fun are all important in a fitness routine.\nBeautiful day? Time to go for a walk.\nRainy and cold? Pop in a weight lifting DVD.\nFeel like dancing? Crank up the tunes.\nNeed a quick workout? 7 minutes of HIIT and you’re good to go.\nKids bored? Challenge them to a game of basketball.\n29. More Fun\nAt the gym, it isn’t always easy to really let your guard down and have a blast.\nYes, working out at the gym leads to good feelings, but it isn’t fun like taking Fido for a walk or dancing like no one’s watching during your favorite at home hip hop routine.\n30. No Headphones\nNo more messing with headphone wires or wireless headphone’s low batteries.\nPlay your tunes loud and proud.\nAll those cheesy and obnoxious songs you love to sweat to can be played at full volume in the privacy of your own home.\n31. Clean Eating Advantage\nBeing at home while exercising gives you more control over what you eat before and after working out. The gym is usually short on healthy choices and being out and about for workouts often leads to temptations.\nBefore a workout away from home, it’s all too common to skip a meal or lean on processed convenience foods.\nAnd after the gym, it’s more likely you’ll grab something on the go to curb that intense hunger you just whipped up. Those to-go choices are often unhealthy.\nBad food choices can quickly sabotage your healthy workout.",

Whether you’re brand new to Pilates or returning to movement after a break, this program will guide you step by step, ensuring you gain confidence and understanding in every session.\nWe start with the essentials—breathing and posture—so you can connect with your body and get the most out of each movement. From there, you’ll move through five targeted sequences, each focusing on different muscle groups to create a well-rounded practice. Expect to strengthen your core, enhance flexibility, and build stability in a way that supports everyday movement.\nEach session is available in two formats: a guided version with detailed instruction to help you refine your technique, and a flow version with less cueing so you can move with ease, one breath at a time. This flexibility allows you to revisit sessions at your own pace, customize your experience, and link flows together to design your own workout.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll feel stronger, more mobile, and better connected to your body—ready to continue your Pilates journey with skill and confidence. Whether your goal is to move with more ease, improve your strength, or simply enjoy the benefits of mindful movement, this course is designed to support you every step of the way.

Even today, if you were to walk into a random gym and take a brief survey of what type of plan people were following, a good majority would likely say, “I’m doing a bro split, bro .” And there’s a good reason why.\nBro-split training allows you to get adequate recovery between substantial volume with a muscle group so you can fully recover between training sessions. Sometimes it can take up to a week for DOMS to completely recover, especially from an intense leg day.\n\n\nStick to this program for at least 8 weeks and you will see great results.\nWish you all the best have a nice day.",

      "description": "Learn to dance, lose weight, tone core muscles, strengthen key muscles and build your core all at the same time! The course is heavily based on Belly Dance movements. One of the oldest forms of dance; Belly Dance is a great way to stay in shape, gain confidence and stay healthy no matter what your dance experience.\nBelly Dancing promotes femininity, creativity, balance, posture, strength, digestion, coordination and confidence as well as being a fun and highly expressive art form.\n\n\nBelly dancing significantly aids muscle toning with its refined movements of internal muscle anatomy. Movements were historically created to work those core feminine muscles such as, the Gluts (bottom), Oblique’s (stomach), Quads (thighs) and of course the Hips! It is a great workout without even feeling like you’re exercising, once you get lost in the music and art form! Your spine is strengthened and lengthened as your joints are lubricated. The best part of Belly Dancing is that it is a low-impact exercise that anyone of any age can take part in. Therefore you will be gaining strength without straining or stressing your body and muscles.\n\n\nDue to the improvement in body image and muscular tone, pushing past comfort zones and doing something new – confidence levels are naturally increased within weeks. I have literally seen students transform when they live through their bodies and gain a sense of empowerment. The fact that you are “exercising” is not even noticed as you enjoy the music and dancing. Belly dancing (as with most other dance exercises) also allows your body to secrete endorphins and dopamine, which are both the ‘feel good’ hormones in your body. You are therefore always guaranteed to leave a class feeling great about your productivity and yourself!",

      "description": "The last fitness program you'll ever need.\n\n\nI’ve been there. Confused, overwhelmed, scattered, and feeling close to hopeless and desperate to find what is actually the “best” workout routine for me and which I should commit to. The problem is there are hundreds, if not MILLIONS of so called fitness \"experts\" or newbies who swear by this or that exercise challenge, whether it be the newest “beachbody 2.0” or “bootcamp intensive for skinny wimps” but which is actually the best for YOU and the results you want? And how can you trust anyone these days? That's why I decided to study exercise science and become a certified personal trainer so you wouldn't have to do the heavy lifting (no pun intended). I wanted to make a course that everyone could understand, apply, and get fitness results for.\n\n\nWhat if an expert in the fitness industry guided you to make your own workout for your specific goals, needs, and wants?

But realistically I and other personal trainers know we can only handle so many in-person and even online appointments.

There are also people who prefer to do their workouts alone and in their own time, but don't know where to start. Although there are enough workout programs offered online to circle the earth, they aren’t tailored to you or reliable. There are millions who need the benefits of working out and my mission is to guide the motivated and ready learn the basic building blocks of proper workout design, implementation, and goals without having to be a fitness professional. I teach the fundamentals using my own model called the \"4 P Pyramid Model\" that's user-friendly, made for beginners, and created so you can start making workouts right away.

      "description": "This course offers a fresh and innovative take on training with the Escriba stick, focusing not on combat or self-defense but rather on movement, coordination, and fitness. Traditionally used in Filipino martial arts for striking and defense, the Escriba stick is reimagined here as a tool for fluid motion, dexterity, and mindful exercise. Instead of practicing drills for combat application, students will learn how to manipulate the stick in a way that enhances flexibility, hand-eye coordination, and overall body awareness.\nUnlike conventional training methods that emphasize sparring or rigid techniques, this course introduces the Escriba stick as a flow-based practice, much like the way a juggling pen is handled. Movements are designed to be smooth, continuous, and adaptable, making them easy to practice in any indoor setting, such as a living room, without requiring a large space. Whether sitting, standing, or walking, the techniques can be performed casually while watching TV, listening to an audiobook, or simply relaxing.\nThe training follows a structured step-by-step approach that allows students to develop fundamental movements before progressing to more advanced sequences. Starting with basic wrist rolls, transitions, and directional changes, participants will gradually build up to more complex techniques that integrate rhythm and flow. The exercises are designed to enhance mobility in the wrists, forearms, and shoulders while also improving grip strength and overall dexterity. Rather than focusing on repetitive drills, the emphasis is on developing an intuitive sense of movement that feels natural and effortless.\nThis course is ideal for those who want to explore a new and engaging form of exercise that stimulates both the mind and body. It is particularly suited for individuals looking for a low-impact, enjoyable routine that can be incorporated into everyday activities. Whether you are a martial artist seeking a different perspective on stick training, someone interested in flow arts and hand coordination, or simply looking for a creative way to stay active indoors, this course provides a unique and accessible approach to movement. By the end of the program, students will have developed a personal practice that blends relaxation, control, and continuous motion, turning the Escriba stick into a tool for both fitness and expression.",

I can change this for you.\nMy mission is to show you how to build the exercise habit into your routine in a way that fits your busy lifestyle.\nExercise doesn’t have to be boring or miserable hard work and you don't need to go to an expensive gym to get fit. In this course, I will teach you how to make exercise a fun, challenging adventure that feels a lot like play.\nTo create the habit of exercise, I guide you through how to use \"quantified self\" apps on your iPhone or Android phone — self-tracking tools that allow you to set clear goals, track your progress and create accountability systems that keep you motivated. Next, I show you how to use game mechanics (the psychology behind why video games are so addictive) to \"gamify\" the whole experience with all kinds of exciting challenges and achievements.\nThere is a well-research process to forming new habits that stick. In the first part of this course, I guide through the process of building your own habit forming blueprint. Then, I teach you how to build the right exercise habit for your lifestyle: walking, running, biking, yoga, pilates and all kinds of workout routines you can do from the comfort of your home.\nSave a fortune on a gym membership and a personal trainer by doing guided high intensity workouts at home using your smartphone, tablet or even by beaming the instructional workouts to your Apple TV or Google Chromecast.\nHere's a quick summary of what you learn how to do in this course:\n1. Reverse of the negative effects of sitting all day. Sitting is the new smoking. Learn simple exercises you can use to increase your energy at the office, eliminate your afternoon slumps and minimize the effects of sitting all day. If you regularly sit more than 6 hours a day, these simple practices will add years to your life.\n2. Stay fit while traveling. When you are passing through airports, eating lots of restaurant food and staying at hotels, it is easy to fall into an unhealthy rut. I'll show you how to do high intensity workouts on the road and stay fit even when your normal routine is disrupted by travel.\n3. Exercise at home without any weights or equipment. Get fit at home using high intensity interval training and you won't need to buy any expensive equipment or waste your time commuting to a gym. Plus, I'll show you the new scientific research that is showing how a 10-15 minute high intensity workout at home or outside can be better for you than hours spent at the gym.\n4. Hack the process of building the exercise habit. I'll walk you through a holistic process of habit formation based on the latest psychology and cognitive science research into how we form new habits in our brains.\n5. Employ the power of exercise gamification. Apply the game mechanics that make people addicted to video games and make exercise a rewarding adventure full of small wins, challenges, achievement milestones and rapid feedback on how you are improving.\n6. And most importantly, you will learn how to make exercise fun! I will show you all kinds of different ways that will work for you to make walking, running, biking, working out and just being outside in general both great exercise and even greater fun!\nTake the next step by joining me in this course and start enjoying all the health and productivity benefits you will gain when you start building the exercise habit.",

      "description": "You've got stubborn body fat in all the wrong places and struggle to put on muscle mass.\nPerhaps you're addicted to porn, have erectile dysfunction, or just want your girlfriend to respect you.\nRegardless, you're in a rut.\nBut testosterone fixes all of the above, and you know that you could build some major momentum over the next four weeks if you simply had the right plan to follow.\n\n\nThe goal of the Testosterone Takeoff Course is to get you moving towards high testosterone within four weeks.\nRAPID momentum is the name of the game.\n\nInside this course, you'll be provided with 5 programs in 1\nIntermittent Fasting Plan\nAncestral Diet Plan\nGym Training Plan (T-boosting)\nNo-Gym Bodyweight Training Plan\nTestosterone Fundamentals Guide\n\n\nEVERYTHING you need to become your healthiest most masculine self with massively improved testosterone levels.\n\n\nWhy Is Testosterone So Critically Important?\nWell without high levels of testosterone, the result is how you’re feeling right now - little drive, direction, motivation, strength, and body fat is harder to burn.\nTestosterone solves all of this.\nWith high-normal testosterone (800-1200 total):\nMuscle comes easier\nMoney comes easier\nFat is torched easier\nSex drive is higher\nRelationships come easier\nIt’s essentially a catalyst for all things male self-improvement. Life just gets easier & easier.\nOne of the main reasons you feel sluggish and can’t stay disciplined right now, is hormonal in nature.\nChanging this changes everything.\nHere’s how the course works:\nYou get all the information/resources you need in order to make drastic changes to your testosterone levels within four weeks. We cover every single topic in this video course from diet, to training, to endocrine disruptors, to supplements.\nYou get to choose between the Ancestral Diet route or the Intermittent Fasting route, based on your own goals & personal preferences. Each route has a diet plan and training program attached to it that you can use for at least four weeks to kickstart your results. The Intermittent Fasting route is the one that’s geared for maximum fat loss, the Ancestral Diet is geared for maximum muscle gain & primal living. You can also alternate between the two whenever suits you. Perhaps one month Ancestral, one month IF. You gain access to BOTH.\nYou get the (printable) Testosterone Tracker - this allows you to stay on top of everything within your diet & training and make even faster progress as you see your numbers improving day in, and day out.\nBy utilizing all of the above, you’ll be on your way to becoming a very different man by the end of the four weeks.\n\nFAQ\n“How much of a testosterone boost can I expect in four weeks?”\nThe biggest changes are usually within the first few weeks, but it does depend on your starting point. If you’ve got a lot of room for improvement, you could be looking at a 50-100% increase within four weeks.\n“What about TRT, do you think it’s a good idea?”\nTestosterone Replacement Therapy only makes sense if two conditions have been met:\nYou’re at least age 50, probably more like 60.\nYou’ve tried literally all the natural routes, you never drink alcohol, never eat junk food etc. You really have everything nailed, and your total testosterone is still below 500.\nOther than that, you’ll cause more issues than you currently have via excess aromatization, putting strain on your heart, reducing the size of your balls etc. and it’s all unnecessary - the natural methods work. Big time.\n“But isn’t high testosterone unhealthy?”\nNo this is only when you get to the steroid level, which isn’t going to happen via your own natural methods (testes & pituitary gland). The steroid level is well over 1200, often up to 5000 total or more. Liver King style. We’re talking about 800-1200.\n“Who exactly IS this course for?”\nAny male who is currently stuck, and wants to propel himself towards a better life.\nA more masculine, stronger, more successful life.\nIdeally, he’s sick of floating around and wants to gain some rapid momentum towards high T.",

It's amazing how much stronger and more flexible I feel after just 15 days of consistent practice.\" Hammad Khan\n\"As a bigger guy who focuses on Olympic Lifting and crossfit, I have gotten tighter in areas then I would like, this course has helped my flexibility which has improved my sports, and no more aches and pains. Excellent course, I have already purchased the rest. Well worth the time.\" Gregory Sullivan\n\"I've tried other yoga courses before, but this one stands out because of the instructor's clear and concise instructions. I feel like I'm getting a personalized yoga class.\" Genesis Kalel\n\"I couldn't be happier with this course, it is very doable, the instructor is excellent at describing each pose every time in details so you get the best out of it without even needing to look at her. I feel great during and after the practice and i am much more fit and flexible only halfway through the course. I intend to do all her challenges and i highly recommend it for all my friends. thanks you for a great course.\" Namaste Maha Helal\n\"This is a great course and Abi is a fantastic teacher. The pace is just right and she always seems to give instruction at just the right time that I wouldn't expect from someone who's not in the room with me. For example, just when I don't realize that my jaw, shoulders, etc are tensing up in a pose, her voice will come over and say to relax them. Thanks, Abi!\" Christie Ciccolone\n\"Fantastic course. Just what I needed. Straight to the point east to understand yoga that keeps my body working for martial arts, weight lifting , life and playing with my kids. Couldn’t recommend highly enough.\" Paul Smith\n\"It is an amazing course. I saw results very quickly. I intend to repeat the exercises and make them my daily routine to get permanent benefits. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to achieve flexibility and relaxation.\" Özgür Yengeç\n\"I loved this course and it really helped me get stronger each day as I did it! I absolutely love these exercises! It is the highlight of my day for me!\" Sowmya Swaminathan\n\"The teacher is very well prepared and - a very rare quality - is not an \"exhibitionist\": she doesn't want us to see how limber she is but she wants us to learn the positions and wants to stimulate us to practice yoga every day. Brava!\" Simone Bedetti\n\"Wasn't sure what to expect from Yoga but it is simply amazing! I had lower back issues from long sitting because of work and within a week it went nearly completely away. The 15 minutes each day pass sooo quick and I'm always surprised when the session is over. Can absolutely recommend. Nice and clear instructions both visual and audio. Do yourself a favor and try this course! :)\" Alexander Asbeck\n\"This was the first time I practiced yoga, it was incredible.\" Adriano Lozano\n\"I LOVE this course! I love Abi's calm, instructive voice, and how she eases you into the poses. The video quality is excellent, as well as the sound. Simple and elegant. I feel like the material she covers is excellent, and am already feeling myself becoming more flexible. Excited that this is now a part of my daily routine! Perfect for my work breaks.\" Chantile Ferriera\n\"Abi's 15 minute routines are perfect for those who need a quick yoga workout at the beginning of a busy day or at the end of a long one. I've tried one hour programs that seem to take up too much time in the morning and resulted in more often than not, me skipping the workout all together. Fifteen minutes is just enough to get a good stretch in to get you ready for the rest of your day.\" Scott Chin\n\"I also engage in personal yoga practice, which has given me a good understanding of various poses. Incorporating these 15-minute sessions into my routine has a profound effect on re-energizing me and setting a positive tone for the rest of my day. It never ceases to amaze me how dedicating just a quarter of an hour to focus solely on my well-being can have such a transformative impact on my mind.\" Allysa Chet",

      "description": "No matter what age we are, exercising is very important, especially for those of us who may be over the age of 65. Whether we enjoy it or not, exercising on a regular basis continues to keep our body moving and functioning properly as we age. Without getting up and entertaining our muscles with movement, we reduce our chances to age healthfully.\nAs a senior, or your loved one might love or hate exercising, but we have all continually been told, “exercising is healthy for you!” What if, now, you or someone you love is experiencing a mobility block? In younger years, they might have been able to run 10 miles a day or compete in a triathlon, now it’s just getting harder to even stand.\nThe most interesting trait of the human body is that it is always changing, literally, it cannot stay the same. It is constantly adapting to what you put it through. If you exercise, muscles adapt by getting stronger.\nIf you or an older adult you know are having trouble with moving around and finding it difficult to get even a little bit of exercise in the day, then this course is just for you because there are still ways to exercise without even having to move from a chair!\nChair exercises are a great substitute for aging adults. There doesn’t need to be a weight set, a trainer, and seniors don’t even have to have a caregiver with them at all times. The only thing a senior needs is a chair; though, some of the exercises may require a resistance band or dumbbells and a medicine ball to perform accurately with results. But we can always make do with what we have in the beginning. The idea behind this course and others we are producing is to just get moving.\nPlease keep in mind, everyone has different levels of comfort when it comes to exercise. For safety, it’s important to start slow and develop a health program that is tailored to your abilities.\nExercising on a regular basis (preferably at least 30 minutes per day) will not only keep an aging adult’s heart healthy, but can also prevent strokes, heart attacks, falling, high blood pressure, and chronic diseases such as dementia.\nOlder adults should never overexert themselves doing any of these movements; this could lead to injury or worse. If their body is resisting any of the movements suggested, they shouldn’t push their body further. I remind my students throughout the lectures: Our bodies talk to us when we exercise, they tell us when something is a good idea or when it’s a terrible one. Our entire body is connected by a muscle chain and just like a regular chain, if we have a chink, the other links won’t perform the same.\nNot everyone over the age of 65 is able to move agilely or even out of their seat, but this shouldn’t mean that they can’t exercise. So many regular exercises can be done while using a chair as a mobility device.\nBenefits can still be reached when a senior uses even a regular chair. They don’t have to go out and get something brand new just so they can start moving around, a completely ordinary chair will do. This chair should be stable with four legs, no wheels or rollers, and for most exercises, without arms.\nWe’ve got a great list of exercises that seniors can do in the comfort of their own home with equipment that they can use by themselves. We’ll explain exactly how to do each exercise and provide examples for a step-by-step process.\nNo special equipment is required to get started, just a chair and two unopened cans of soup will do.",

        "This course, along with many others have been developed expressly for those age 55 yrs and older. However, the workout is for any beginner especially if you have never been active and are now ready to get fit. You won't be bombarded with in your face coaching yelling at you to do 5 more reps. We believe you are an adult, capable of doing you best without being harassed to do so."

To some, the fear of falling may seem trivial. Yet to the 65+ age group, this can be a stressful thing.\nStudies show that people who fall during their senior years are much more prone to injury and sometimes even death. Many older people wonder if it’s possible to improve their balance and also get stronger so that they’ll be more stable. Should they accidentally trip or slip, their bodies would be more resilient and they will be able to handle the impact.\nThis is a sensitive topic and definitely warrants much attention. The hard truth is that people do not become physically unstable or unbalanced as they age. Of course, there is no denying that a certain degree of strength and mobility is lost.\nBe an expert with Zayra Mo who will teach you the best moves and routines for Stability and Balance in a progressive way and the cues of posture which you can integrate in any class format and also you'll learn from these routines:\nBreathing Exercises\nChair Stretching or Chair Yoga\nStability\nBalance\nCoordination\nand much more!\nAlso this program come with the BONUS of Fall Prevention Workshop\nAnd at the end, you can request our Special Diploma - besides Udemy - which you can showcase in your portfolio, office or social media.\nThis is a great opportunity to learn from Zayra Mo who is been teaching Yoga, Chair Yoga, Meditation, Fitness and more to Active Adults in the last five years.\nThe video routines are in ENGLISH AND SPANISH!",

      "description": "Aging is a natural process that every human being goes through and it starts from the very onset of birth. However, the actual “aging” is only really visible when the individual is considered to be quite advanced in age. It should be noted though, that the aging process should not in any way hamper keeping an exercise regimen and in fact exercising should ideally continue but at a gentler pace and design. In this course you will get all the information you need to develop a fitness program that works for you, with the consultation of your healthcare provider. Truly, “you are never too old and it is never too late”.\nAs we age the food we eat becomes more critical as well. We tend to snack more and pay less attention to the quality of the food we eat in terms of nutritional value. It is important that you eat three balanced meals every day or take supplements to fill in where your food groups may be lacking. At the very least be certain to take a multivitamin every day and watch you protein intake. Once you start exercising your body is going to need your full daily requirement of protein and if you are not getting that from the food you eat then look into a protein supplement or high protein snacks. So, we cover this dilemma seniors are faced with and give you ideas on how to get the nutrition you need every day without taking a ton of supplements\nMotivation is always a good tool to use when there is a need to cultivate a consistent interest in something. This is very true when it comes to trying to motivate those in the more senior age group to engage in a comprehensive and beneficial exercise routine. Many of us have not exercised consistently for many years now and the thought of it brings dread into our hearts and minds. We talk about motivation also, what you could possibly use to motivate you. See, we are all different. We all respond differently to life, to experiences and to the day to day living we all do.\nFor instances, I do not respond well nor does it in anyway motivate when I have some 20-something yelling at me to do 10 more sets and 2 more reps. I was in the military in my younger years and learned how to tune a yelling voice out. All I want now is to be treated like the adult that I am, make certain I am doing the routine correctly, proper posture etc.) and then let me do it at my own pace. That is what this course is all about.\nAt some point in everyone’s life, there would be instances where health issues would have to be dealt with.\nLearning how to deal or cope with these health issues using exercise as a positive tool may help you or someone you know better manage or even eliminate such conditions altogether.\nBefore embarking on a fitness routine, an aged individual should first seek to have some sort of health and fitness assessment done. This will not only help when it comes to designing a suitable fitness program for the individual but will also help to highlight any possible health issues that might need special consideration when picking the types of exercise routine to incorporate in the exercise program.\nAnd, finally, we spend some time on MET and what that should mean to you as you embark on your new fitness routine.\nI would love to see you on the inside.",

You can be ready to work out your rings in seconds.\nGymnastic rings are not stable therefore they cause more muscle activation.\nSave your time, You can get maximum impact in a minimum time.\nThe gym can be boring for most people. Working with gymnastic rings is very enjoyable, there are always more challenging moves.\nThe cost of gymnastic rings is very cheap and you can use it for a lifetime.\nIf you are ready to build up an Olympic athlete body you need rings and your will.\nI am a professional personal trainer. I have thousands of students. I use gymnastic rings both in my training program and the work of my students.\nIn light of these experiences, I have prepared a special program for you from beginner to advanced level.\nYou can do it too.\nYou will not regret it.\nYou have to initiate this change for yourself.\n\n\nThere are some things you need to know to build muscle.\nThere is a lot of corrupted information about bodybuilding, which is very confusing.\nYou just need to know and practice the basics.\nNow I will explain them to you in the simplest way.\nBasically for muscle building,\nYou need to train smart\nEat healthy\nsleep well\nNow let's simply explain these issues.\nTRAINING\nFor muscle development, you should apply the exercises with the right technique.\nDon't worry about it.\nI have prepared a scientific, bodyweight program for you. I have been working with thousands of students as a personal trainer. I am sharing all my experiences with you.\n\n\nLet's talk about the details.\nHow to adjust Training frequency\nGenerally 3 to 5 times workout a week is good for muscle growth.\nThe frequency and intensity of training can change from person to person.\nIn general, training 3-5 times a week will be sufficient for improvement.\nEveryone is different like fingerprints.\nDifferent lifestyle, different eating habits, different sleeping times and quality…\nDifferent genetics…Different jobs, for example; a person who is a physical worker is not the same as an office worker…\nYou need to adjust the training frequency and intensity according to your own life.\nBy the way, recovery time is also directly related to your lifestyle.\nThis is one of the important factors affecting the frequency and intensity of training.\nMuscle development happens in main two stages.\nSTAGE 1 (damage YOUR muscles)\nWhile training, we push the limits of our muscles by using some scientific methods. It causes damage to muscles.\nSTAGE 2 (RECOVERY )\nDuring the recovery STAGE, our body repairs our muscles and builds up more muscles\nResting, nutrition, and sleeping are very important at this stage.\nEating the right food gives to body material for building muscles.\nSleeping and resting give time to the body for recovery.\nGenerally, body recovery itself is 24 hours to 48 hours depending on what I mentioned before.\n\n\nSECRET OF MUSCLE GROWTH: PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD\nIf you always train at the same intensity, the same exercise\nyour growth will be stopped.\nProgressive overload simply means increasing training intensity step by step.\n\n\nHOW TO INCREASE INTENSITY?\n1- increase your reps,\nfor example, if you can do 5 push-ups, try to do 10 or more…\nif you can do 15 reps in good form time to try the next level.\n\n\n2- You can try the harder version of the exercise.\nI MENTİONED ABOUT THİS FOR EACH EXERCİSE\n3- INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SET.\nIf you can do 15 reps, 3 sets, and push-ups in clean form, time to try to do one more set.\n4- Use the time under tension technique:\nDo the same exercise slowly.\nif you can do 15 push-ups in 15 seconds. Do 15 push-ups in 30 seconds.\n5- You can add weight to yourself\nput some weight in your backpack and do the exercise that way...\n6- Next step try to work gymnastic rings\nGymnastic rings are not stable and need much more muscle activation.\nsave your time, You can do more muscle work in less time.\nIf you are interested in a gymnastic rings workout you can check out my gymnastic rings program.\n\n\nNUTRITION, SLEEP, RECOVERY\nNutrition and sleep are very essential for the regeneration of our muscles.\nI recommend 8 hours of quality sleep for muscle development and recovery.\nNutrition is an important and very complex subject.\nIf you want to lose kg decrease your daily calories to -500 max. do it step by step.\nIf you want to gain kg increase your daily calories by +500 max. again step by step…\nI won't say specifically what you eat because I have around 5000 students worldwide and this number will increase.\nEvery person lives in a different condition, in a different country.\nAccess to some foods depends on the geography and culture you live in.\nSo I will speak generally...\nEat as much as raw food, processed food is not good for your body.\nEat 1.5 to 2 gr proteins per kg.\nProtein makes the body acidic. Eat enough vegetables and drink enough water to tolerate this.\nConsume healthy fats, such as olive oil, coconut oil, fish oil, omega 3...\nConsume enough fiber for the digestive system to work well.\nBe sure to take enough minerals and vitamins.\nFinally, ensure that your nutrition and training program is sustainable.\nEnjoy what you eat, what you do...\nIf you need extra fat burn you need to do some cardio workout.\nAn hour of walking on an empty stomach in the morning will give great results.\nFor more cardio, you can check out my kickboxing programs.",

It is a widely recognized and respected credential in the fitness industry.\nThe role of an ACSM CPT is to work with individuals or small groups to develop and implement safe and effective exercise programs. They possess the knowledge, skills, and abilities to assess, motivate, educate, and train clients of various fitness levels, ages, and backgrounds.\nHere are some key aspects of the ACSM CPT role:\nFitness Assessment: An ACSM CPT is trained to conduct comprehensive fitness assessments to evaluate a client's current fitness level, including body composition, cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength and endurance, and flexibility. These assessments help in designing personalized exercise programs.\nProgram Design: Based on the client's goals, health status, and assessment results, an ACSM CPT creates customized exercise programs. They consider factors like cardiovascular training, resistance training, flexibility exercises, and functional movements to help clients improve their fitness, lose weight, build strength, or achieve specific athletic goals.\nInstruction and Demonstration: ACSM CPTs guide clients on how to perform exercises correctly and safely. They demonstrate proper techniques, provide verbal cues, and offer modifications or progressions as needed to ensure clients perform exercises with proper form and technique to prevent injuries.\nMotivation and Support: ACSM CPTs serve as a source of motivation and support for their clients. They encourage and inspire clients to stay committed to their fitness goals, provide feedback on progress, and offer positive reinforcement to keep clients motivated throughout their fitness journey.\nEducation and Guidance: As knowledgeable fitness professionals, ACSM CPTs educate clients on various aspects of health and wellness, including nutrition, lifestyle modifications, stress management, and injury prevention. They provide guidance on making healthy choices and developing sustainable habits beyond the gym.\nSafety and Risk Management: ACSM CPTs prioritize safety during exercise sessions. They ensure that clients use appropriate equipment, follow safety guidelines, and are aware of their physical limitations. They also have knowledge of emergency procedures and can respond effectively to any potential risks or injuries.\nACSM CPTs may work in a variety of settings, including fitness centers, gyms, corporate wellness programs, rehabilitation clinics, and private studios. They collaborate with other healthcare professionals, such as physicians, physical therapists, and nutritionists, to provide comprehensive care to their clients.\nObtaining the ACSM CPT certification typically involves meeting eligibility criteria, which may include holding a high school diploma or equivalent, having CPR/AED certification, and completing a recognized CPR/AED course. Candidates are required to pass a comprehensive examination that assesses their knowledge and skills related to exercise science, exercise prescription, and client interactions.\nIt's important to note that certification requirements and details may change over time, so it's recommended to refer to the official ACSM website or contact the organization directly for the most up-to-date information.",

This practice exam includes the following question breakdowns: the Scientific Foundations section has 102 questions (47 exercise science, 35 nutrition, 20 psychology), of which 33 are recall level questions and 69 are application/analysis level questions; the Practical/Applied section has 119 questions (45 exercise technique, 39 program design, 20 testing and evaluation, 15 administration and organization), of which 27 are recall level questions and 92 are application/analysis level questions.

Training tips for learning and practicing short power and jin using the palm structures are also included. A short review is provided in the introduction video.\n\n\nSpecific movements identified by the instructor that will help refine a student's movements in order for them to move more efficiently with Bagua and develop power. With follow-along instruction and discussion of concepts, these exercises assist a student to refine their Bagua practice, further develop body structure, and whole body power.\n\n\nBaguazhang is a unique whole body art the teaches a person to be completely aware of their body from head to toe. The slow steady movements develop a profound level of awareness, both physically and mentally. Much like Taichi/Taijiquan, the gentle movements slow down the brain and allow a person to connect with themselves in a way unlike any other physical discipline.\n\n\nBaguazhang is classified as an advanced form of Qigong conditioning, using both structural alignment and breath work to amplify and deepen the cultivation of Qi. QI/Chi is the energy that fills and surrounds the body, that allows our bodies to move and function and is similar to the rays of light that we receive from the sun every day. Through the use of spiralling movements that open and close the joints and body cavities, much like modern day somatic therapy, a person can rewire their nervous system and change their body chemistry down to their cellular function.\nThis change in the body is supported by recent studies that have shown a person can change their DNA by the wayt they simply think. In much the same weay Qi is cultivated to both strengthen and heal the body by using the focus of our minds to step out of our Monkey Mind chatter and enter in a Zen like state of Flow unique to the art of Baguazhang.",

You will learn to evaluate yourself and evaluate others for Jumper's knee. You will learn about the pathology of Jumper's Knee. You will learn to evaluate for muscular tightness in the quadriceps and hamstrings that contribute to this condition. At Rebound Athletics our approach is always to look above and below the problem. So we teach you to also evaluate for muscular tightness of the hips, groin, and calf muscles that also contribute to Jumper's Knee. This is the new approach, to go beyond the obvious to see how the other joints and muscles in the kinetic chain are contributing to Jumper's Knee. We will show you a systematic program of stretches and then strengthening of the muscles from the hips down to the calf muscles. Finally, we will show you functional exercises for conditioning of the muscles of the kinetic chain. These exercises use multiple muscles in multiple planes to strengthen the movements required in your sport. This improves your strength and endurance and improves stride length which is critical for runners. This program will treat your Jumper's Knee and get you ready to return to sport pain free.",

      "description": "Your Saying, My doing!  The following news letter in my mailbox inspire the course, using Tai Chi postures for shoulder problems!\n\n\nThe shoulder is the body's most complicated joint. It's where the ends of the collarbone, upper arm bone, and shoulder blade meet. And it's prone to arthritis (a wearing away of the cartilage between the bones), as well as tears or tendinitis (inflammation) in the rotator cuff — the group of tendons that helps you raise and rotate your arm. Shoulder pain can keep you from being able to raise your arms to get dressed, or reach up to a cupboard or out to a door.\n\n\nBut an easy way to stave off shoulder problems is to regularly stretch the muscles that support the joints. \"The muscles need to be long and flexible to stay healthy. You're more vulnerable to injury when your shoulder muscles are tight and restricted,\" explains Clare Safran-Norton, clinical supervisor of rehabilitation services at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\nHow stretching helps\nMuscles are a little like cotton fabrics. They may shrink up slightly, but if you pull on the fibers, you can stretch out the fabric again.\n\n\nStretching your muscles fixes the shortening that occurs with disuse and extends muscles to their full length. The more you stretch the muscles, the longer and more flexible they'll become. That will help increase your range of motion, ward off pain, reduce the risk for injury, and improve your posture.\n\n\nHarvard Health Letter\n4 stretches to keep your shoulders in shape\nKeeping your shoulder muscles flexible will help prevent injury.\nPublished: August, 2019",

Or maybe you’ve started lifting but want some tips on technique. Then this course is for you.\nDuring this introduction to lifting course we will explore some the key weight training movements and lifts such as back squats, front squats, deadlifts and overhead presses. As performers we already have a good body awareness and may have spent a long time training in a particular discipline. This course will therefore highlight some key things to look out for that may come from prior training, such as differing weight placement through the feet, habitual movements relating to patterns in dance and circus skills that need to be altered when weight training safely.\nWe will also demystify the gym, specifically the free weights area and squat racks so you can feel confident transferring your new knowledge into the gym environment. Sometimes half the battle to getting started is knowing what equipment to use, how it works, how to attach safety clips to the barbell, or how to grip the bar. This will all be covered so you can feel safe and confident in the gym and begin your weight training journey.",

      "description": "No-Equipment (Only Bodyweight) Home Workout Program for Fat-Burning and Weight Loss\n\n\nI designed for you a daily 20-minute program that develops muscle, burns fat, and improves condition, mobility, and flexibility.\n\n\nIn this specially designed 4-week cycle, you will learn how to burn fat, lose weight, build muscle, improve your fitness, and increase your mobility and flexibility without using any tools or equipment in 20 minutes per day.\n\n\nThis 4-week cycle is designed in a way that the workouts will differ to keep your concentration high until you reach your goal. No boring, repetitive workouts every week.\n\n\nBody Weight Focused\nAll exercises in this program are performed with body weight. Since you don't need extra equipment, you can exercise easily anytime and anywhere. This struggle against your own body will constantly take you higher levels.\n\n\nPush-ups and Sit-ups? Again?\nThe usual split training approach, which focuses on individual muscle groups, was completely avoided in this program. Instead, We focus on dynamic movements that work, stretch and mobilize the whole body simultaneously. Please watch the preview videos, and you will notice the difference.\n\n\nCondition\nThe exercises in this program are interval oriented to increase your cardiovascular capacity. Right after the first 4-week cycle, you will notice that you get tired harder in your daily activities and do things that once you label them as \"arduous\" with breaking no sweats.\nImportant Note: There is no exercise that will injure your knees or waist in this program.\n\n\nMuscle Development\nDuring this program, the muscles in your whole body will be trained actively and alternately. You will observe the improvement in your muscles. The development mentioned here does not allow you to gain bodybuilding-type burly muscles. This program will sculpt your body into an athletic, beach body-type look.\n\n\nFat Burning\nInterval training ingredients will allow you to burn fat. In the last part of the course, We will discuss the things you should do to burn fat faster.\n\n\nMobility & Flexibility\nStrength exercises in this program are selected among the movements that will naturally increase your mobility and flexibility.\n\n\nA Better Posture\nAs in every program I prepare, I chose the necessary exercises for a better, aesthetic posture and placed them at the points where the effect will be maximized.\n\n\nA Few Comments About the Course\n\n\n\"This course is very useful and helpful in weight loss. Lots of exercises that can be done easily at home and work. I get what I want by taking very little time. I would recommend this course to everyone. Thank you coach.\" Paul Harford\n\n\n\"There again, a simple, applicable course with useful information. Thank you...\" Muhterem Çelik\n\n\n\"The course that I expected the most from Umut Varol came finally, thank you Instructor\" Mustafa Ak\n\n\nHope to see you in the course.\nBest regards\n\n\nUmut Varol\nSenior Bodybuilding & Fitness Trainer\nPersonal Trainer | Coach",

No prior knowledge or experience with training is required. However, if you're already training, you will find this course to be extremely useful to you.\n\n\nAlongside the theory, 12 workout instructional videos are provided which cover every exercise in detail. This is not a series of follow-along videos but rather a full set of instructions on how to do any exercise with perfect form\n\n\nThis Fat-Loss Training program is a carefully selected progression of fun exercises and workouts that are scientifically designed to build strength, muscle, and burn fat.\n\n\nThere is no fluff or BS in this program. Workouts take between 20-45 minutes. Your first workouts will take less time and as you get more advanced, you will be adding a few extra sets and reps to each exercise.\n\n\nThis program is about building strength in order to preserve muscle mass as you lose fat. There are no jumping jacks or cardio exercises designed to make you sweat for the sake of sweating.\n\n\nInstead, I provide a way for you to give the maximum stimulus to your muscles in order to optimize fat-loss, build strength, and tone your body.\n\n\nA common problem you've likely run into before is that workouts and exercises are too advanced for you. This program is designed with the beginner in mind and requires Absolutely No Prior Knowledge or Experience with training.\n\n\nYou will learn exactly how and why you're doing every exercise. I hold your hand through the entire process by providing the workouts you need to do, when you need to do them, and how to do them in order to get the best results possible.\nInjury prevention along with actually enjoying your workouts are the keys to consistency. Doing High-Intensity style training often leads to injuries and hard-to-measure results. When you go from not being able to do a single push-up to cranking out 20+ reps in a row, you will stay motivated because you can feel the results of your hard work.\nYou've most likely bought courses and books in the past only to be disappointed with overpriced and lack luster results. That's why I created this course and put all of my heart and kinesiology knowledge into it so you can get the best results possible.\nWhen I started training myself over 10 years ago, I was at home with almost no equipment.
