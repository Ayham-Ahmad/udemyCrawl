In this course, you will learn how to also integrate SharePoint with Power Automate to create customized sophisticated workflows, Power Apps to create customized forms, and more\n\n\nThis is the only complete guide to Microsoft SharePoint, from beginner to expert. This course is not only comprehensive (it covers everything you need to know right from the start / beginner level) but is also instructional in nature, meaning that as we learn new concepts, we are also integrating them in SharePoint. Don't just learn concepts, learn how to actually apply them. That also means that whether you are a beginner or expert, there's something for you in this course.\n\n\nThis course is structured in a way that helps you learn all the concepts. For each concept, we first cover it in theory and then apply it using a real life example. We also progressively learn more and more advanced concepts, so that you never feel overwhelmed and can achieve your goals. I also respond to questions, and have an interactive portion in the course!\n\n\nAgain, this is the complete guide to SharePoint - you won't ever need another course.\n\n\nWhat is SharePoint?\nSharePoint is a platform that organizations use to create internal websites (called team sites) that empower teamwork and improve collaboration. SharePoint allows organizations to seamlessly organize, share, manage, and access content and knowledge across their businesses. More than 200,000 companies use SharePoint and 190 million people use SharePoint. SharePoint is provided by Microsoft.\n\n\nWhat is SharePoint Online?\nThere are several different versions of SharePoint, which can be both on-prem or online. SharePoint online is the most popular, and is a cloud-based service which is hosted by Microsoft, and for businesses of all sizes. Note that all modules and features discussed in this course also apply to previous versions of SharePoint due to backwards compatibility. So, this course is also designed for users in SharePoint 2016 and SharePoint 2019 (SharePoint Server 2016 and SharePoint Server 2019)\n\n\nWhat are the main features of SharePoint?\nContent management - easily and securely share and manage content across your business, whether it's files, news, workflows, or data, with sophisticated metadata and organization\nSocial features - share ideas across your organization, collaborate, and make decisions with built-in social features like shared calendars and comments\nIntegration with Office 365 - integrate SharePoint with Office 365 apps to make the most of the cloud, with sophisticated linkages with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Power Automate, Power Apps, and Microsoft Project\nDatabase - hold unstructured and structured content with Microsoft's intuitive, accessible, and powerful database system called SharePoint Lists; create views, validation rules, forms, and dashboards\nTransform business processes - use SharePoint to automate common and routine business processes, with conditional and approval workflows to truly reach digital transformation across your organization\nPersonalization - make SharePoint yours; design your site to your liking with customized design features\nPermissions - Manage access to content through Microsoft's sophisticated permission management system, which includes security roles, approval workflow / gateways, and utilize Microsoft's single sign on\nReach and scale - More than 90% of businesses already use Office 365; leverage cloud resources to scale SharePoint from small start-ups to F500 organizations\n\n\nWhy learn SharePoint?\nIncrease collaboration by creating a one-stop shop - SharePoint improves efficiency in an organization by having a centralized location for all your content, knowledge, news, and workflows (called Team Sites) - leverage this technology to empower your team\nRevolutionize business processes - Processes in SharePoint can easily be accessed and managed by multiple people in your organizations, and sophisticated workflows and custom apps can be created to fully revolutionize business processes\nGet hired / increase your employability - SharePoint is used by more than 200,000 organizations for a reason; it increases efficiency - learning how to create SharePoint sites is an invaluable skill to boost your pay rate and deliver value\nImprove your toolkit - add this to your list of Microsoft skills - this is very powerful in conjunction with other Microsoft products (PowerApps, Power Automate, Office, Power BI, Azure, 365, etc.)\n\n\nWhy choose this course?\nComplete guide - this is the 100% start to finish, zero to hero, basic to advanced guide on SharePoint. There is no other course like it that teaches you everything from start to finish. It contains over 15 hours of instructional content!\nFully instructional - we not only go through important concepts, but also apply them as we are building our application so that we can solidify them. This is not only a walkthrough of the SharePoint features, but a course that actually builds applications with you\nStep by step - we go through every single concept in a sequential order (from beginner to expert). This improves your probabilities of learning SharePoint rather than going haphazardly through each feature.\nLearn to learn - during the latter parts of the course, we go through situations where we encounter new features or errors, and work through how we would use the documentation to resolve them. In this way, you not only learn about SharePoint inside and out, but learn how to resolve your own issues as they come up\nIntegrations - we go even beyond SharePoint in the expert section and integrate it with other Office 365 apps, such as Outlook, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Power Automate, and Power Apps\nTeacher response - if there's anything else you would like to learn, or if there's something you cannot figure out, I'm here for you!\nReference material - follow along!

      "description": "Important note: The complete course has been re-recorded, so that all audio problems have been removed, also in this second version of the course, new lessons have been added that will help you in your further learning.\nImportant note 2:  What you must know, before you buy this course, is that in my courses and lessons I use a lot of PowerPoint slides in which I explain in detail each service individually. The only reason is that after a detailed study of the theoretical part, it is easier for the student to follow the practical part. Many people do not like this type of teaching, but as an instructor, I want to do everything to teach and prepare the person who trusts me and buys my course as well as possible for an exam or some other business opportunity. If you don't have patience and only want the practical part, then don't buy my course, or if you only want to watch the practical part, then skip the theory. Basically, all my courses contain a large number of practical exercises.\nWelcome to the new course where we will learn about the Entra ID service. The course is intended for everyone who wants to learn something new, but it can also be useful for you to seriously prepare for taking the certification, in which Microsoft Entra ID occupies a significant part. During the course itself, you will learn how to create and work with users, groups and applications, and a significant part is dedicated to security. In addition, you will have the opportunity to learn how to register enterprise applications, create access reivews, find out what Identity Governance and Privileged Identity management are. The course contains many demos, from beginners to more complicated ones, and the course itself is recommended for everyone, and it is designed to start from basic concepts to slightly more advanced functions. At the end of the course, you will be ready to work in the Entra ID service and, most importantly, you will understand its very essence, and be trained to work in the Azure environment. Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service that employees or users can use to access external resources. Examples of resources include Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. Microsoft Entra ID also helps us access internal resources such as applications on our corporate intranet and any cloud applications developed for your own organization.",

Whether you're an IT security professional, risk manager, compliance officer, or cybersecurity enthusiast, this course will provide you with the practical knowledge and structured understanding required to succeed in governance, risk, and compliance roles across both public and private sector organizations.\nThe course begins by introducing the CGRC certification, its purpose, benefits, and who should consider earning it. You will learn about the exam format, eligibility criteria, and how this course aligns with the domains tested in the certification exam. A foundational overview of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is provided to establish context and highlight the increasing importance of integrated risk and compliance functions in today’s organizations.\nA major focus of the course is on the Risk Management Framework (RMF), as outlined by NIST SP 800-37, which forms the backbone of the CGRC certification. You’ll explore each of the six RMF steps in detail—Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, and Monitor—while understanding key concepts such as security impact levels, system boundaries, control selection using NIST SP 800-53, and continuous monitoring strategies. Real-world examples and scenarios help bring these steps to life.\nIn addition to RMF, you’ll gain insight into legal and regulatory frameworks that shape modern cybersecurity and compliance strategies, including key laws like GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, and FISMA, and industry standards such as ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and COBIT. You’ll learn how these frameworks integrate with RMF to form a holistic approach to risk and compliance management.\nThe course also covers essential risk management concepts such as threats, vulnerabilities, risk assessments, mitigation strategies, and the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) process. You’ll discover how to assess and treat risks, develop and maintain security policies, manage incidents, and ensure compliance through effective auditing and reporting practices.\nSecurity governance is another critical focus area, where you’ll understand how to develop, implement, and manage a security program that aligns with business goals. This includes incident response planning, third-party risk management, and best practices for ensuring vendor compliance. You’ll also explore common pitfalls in GRC practices and learn how to avoid them.\nThe final part of the course helps reinforce your learning through case studies, real-world examples, and exam preparation tips. You’ll examine security incidents, governance challenges, and risk management failures to understand how theory translates into practice—and how to succeed on the CGRC exam.\nBy the end of this course, you will have the confidence, clarity, and competence to not only pass the CGRC certification exam but also apply GRC principles effectively in your professional role.\nWhether you're looking to advance your career in cybersecurity, risk management, or compliance, this course will be your comprehensive guide to achieving CGRC success.\nThank you",

Distracters or wrong answers will be presented as response options. These are response options that examinees with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose, as they are generally plausible responses fitting into the content area defined by the test objective.\n● Discrete Option Multiple Choice (DOMC): DOMC items represent a relatively simple, but useful change in the delivery of multiple-choice questions. Instead of displaying all the answer options at one time, as is done with traditional multiple-choice items, options are randomly presented, one at a time. For each presented option, the examinee chooses YES or NO to indicate if the option is correct. When the question is answered correctly or incorrectly, no more options are displayed, and the next question is presented.\nPlease provide review as well.",

SAP Analytics cloud can retrieve data from spreadsheets, on-premise databases, and cloud databases, or a combination of all three. SAP Analytics Cloud transfers raw data from the transactional system into precise data by providing meaningful insights.\nSAP Analytics Cloud evolved out of the Cloud for Planning product, which was released in February 2015. In addition to business planning, the other key components are BI (for reporting, dashboarding, data discovery, and visualization), predictive analytics and governance, risk, and compliance. Analytics Cloud allows data analysts and business decision-makers to visualize, plan, and make predictions all from one secure, cloud-based environment.

      "description": "** This is the ONLY course you need to ace the MLA-C01 exam in the first attempt **\n\n\nMay 18th, 2025: 18 NEW questions added to the course.\nNov 16th, 2024: 17 NEW questions added to the course.\n\n\nWelcome to the AWS Certified Machine Learning Associate MLA-C01 - Practice Test Course!\nAre you preparing for the AWS MLA-C01 certification exam? This course is designed to help you succeed by providing high-quality practice tests that closely mirror the real exam.\n\n\nWhat You'll Get:\n\n\n130 Latest exam questions with detailed explanations to each answer\n\nRealistic Exam Simulation: My practice tests are designed to reflect the format, style, and difficulty of the official AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer exam. This ensures you get a realistic testing experience.\n\nComprehensive Coverage: The practice tests cover all the domains and objectives of the MLA-C01 exam:\nDomain 1: Data Preparation for Machine Learning (ML)\nDomain 2: ML Model Development\nDomain 3: Deployment and Orchestration of ML Workflows\nDomain 4: ML Solution Monitoring, Maintenance, and Security\n\nDetailed Explanations: Each question comes with a detailed explanation to help you understand the concepts and reasoning behind the correct answers.

Identify your strengths and areas for improvement to focus your study efforts effectively.\n\n\nSneak peak into what you will get inside the course:\n\nQ1:\nA company has deployed an XGBoost prediction model in production to predict if a customer is likely to cancel a subscription. The company uses Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor to detect deviations in the F1 score.\nDuring a baseline analysis of model quality, the company recorded a threshold for the F1 score. After several months of no change, the model’s F1 score decreases significantly.\nWhat could be the reason for the reduced F1 score?\nA. Concept drift occurred in the underlying customer data that was used for predictions.\nB. The model was not sufficiently complex to capture all the patterns in the original baseline data.\nC. The original baseline data had a data quality issue of missing values.\nD. Incorrect ground truth labels were provided to Model Monitor during the calculation of the baseline.\n\nOption A is CORRECT because a significant decrease in the F1 score over time is often attributed to concept drift. Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of the target variable change over time, leading to a model's predictions becoming less accurate. This means that the patterns or relationships the model learned during training no longer apply to the new data, resulting in a decline in performance metrics like the F1 score.\n\nExample:\n\nScenario:\nA company has deployed an XGBoost model in production to predict whether a customer is likely to cancel their subscription. The model was trained on historical customer data, which included features such as the number of support tickets a customer raised, their usage frequency, and the duration of their subscription. The company used Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor to keep an eye on the model’s F1 score, which was recorded as part of a baseline during the model’s initial deployment.\n\nInitial Model Performance:\nInitially, the model performed well, achieving a high F1 score. This score indicates a good balance between precision (correctly predicting customers who will cancel) and recall (identifying most customers who will cancel). The baseline F1 score served as a reference point for future performance monitoring.\n\nConcept Drift Example:\nAfter several months, the company notices a significant drop in the F1 score. What could have happened?\nChange in Customer Behavior: Suppose during the initial training phase, the main predictor for cancellation was \"low usage frequency.\" The model learned that customers who seldom used the service were likely to cancel. Over time, the company introduced new features, promotions, or services that significantly increased customer engagement across the board. As a result, even customers who previously had low usage frequency are now more engaged and less likely to cancel. This change in behavior is known as concept drift—the underlying patterns in the data that the model relies on have shifted, leading to inaccurate predictions and a drop in the F1 score.\nImpact on Model Performance: Due to concept drift, the model continues to weigh \"low usage frequency\" heavily, but this feature no longer correlates with cancellation as strongly as it did before. The model might now incorrectly predict that engaged customers will cancel, lowering its precision and recall, and thus, the F1 score.\n\n\nOption B is INCORRECT because if the model was not sufficiently complex to capture the patterns in the original data, it would have shown poor performance from the beginning, rather than experiencing a significant drop in the F1 score after several months.\n\nOption C is INCORRECT because data quality issues, such as missing values in the original baseline data, would likely have caused problems from the outset. These issues would not cause a sudden decline in the F1 score after a period of stability.\n\nOption D is INCORRECT because providing incorrect ground truth labels during the baseline calculation would have resulted in an inaccurate baseline metric from the start, rather than causing a gradual or sudden decline in the F1 score after months of consistent performance.\n\n\n\nQ2:\nAn ML engineer needs to process thousands of existing CSV objects and new CSV objects that are uploaded. The CSV objects are stored in a central Amazon S3 bucket and have the same number of columns. One of the columns is a transaction date. The ML engineer must query the data based on the transaction date.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?\nA. Use an Amazon Athena CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement to create a table based on the transaction date from data in the central S3 bucket. Query the objects from the table.\nB. Create a new S3 bucket for processed data. Set up S3 replication from the central S3 bucket to the new S3 bucket. Use S3 Object Lambda to query the objects based on transaction date.\nC. Create a new S3 bucket for processed data. Use AWS Glue for Apache Spark to create a job to query the CSV objects based on transaction date. Configure the job to store the results in the new S3 bucket. Query the objects from the new S3 bucket.\nD. Create a new S3 bucket for processed data. Use Amazon Data Firehose to transfer the data from the central S3 bucket to the new S3 bucket. Configure Firehose to run an AWS Lambda function to query the data based on transaction date.\n\nOption A is CORRECT because using Amazon Athena with a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement allows the ML engineer to create a table based on the transaction date from the data in the central S3 bucket. Athena supports querying data in S3 with minimal operational overhead, and by using SQL-like queries, the ML engineer can easily filter the CSV objects based on the transaction date. This solution avoids the need to move or replicate data and provides a serverless, low-maintenance way to query data directly in S3.\n\nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you have a central S3 bucket named s3://my-transaction-data/ where thousands of CSV files are stored. Each CSV file has the following columns: transaction_id, customer_id, transaction_date, and amount.\nYou want to query these files based on the transaction_date column to find transactions that occurred on a specific date.\n\n\nStep 1: Create an External Table in Athena\nFirst, you would create an external table in Athena that points to your CSV files in S3.\n\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transaction_data (\ntransaction_id STRING,\ncustomer_id STRING,\ntransaction_date STRING,\namount DOUBLE\n)\nROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde'\nWITH SERDEPROPERTIES (\n'separatorChar' = ',',\n'quoteChar' = '\"'\n)\nLOCATION 's3://my-transaction-data/'\nTBLPROPERTIES ('has_encrypted_data'='false');\n\nThis statement creates a table transaction_data that maps to the CSV files in your S3 bucket. Athena understands the schema of your CSV files and can now query them.\n\nStep 2: Query the Data Using CTAS\nNext, you can use a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement to create a new table with only the data you are interested in, such as transactions from a specific date.\n\nCREATE TABLE transactions_on_date AS\nSELECT\ntransaction_id,\ncustomer_id,\ntransaction_date,\namount\nFROM\ntransaction_data\nWHERE\ntransaction_date = '2024-09-01';\n\n\nThis query filters the data to include only the rows where the transaction_date is 2024-09-01 and stores the result in a new table transactions_on_date within Athena.\n\nStep 3: Query the New Table\nYou can now query the transactions_on_date table directly:\nSELECT * FROM transactions_on_date;\nBenefits:\nNo Data Movement: The data remains in S3, and Athena reads directly from it.\nLow Operational Overhead: You don't need to manage servers or data pipelines; Athena handles the query execution.\nScalability: Athena is serverless and scales automatically to handle large datasets.\n\nExample Output:\nAssuming the original data looks like this:\ntransaction_id      customer_id      transaction_date         amount\n1                                 101                         2024-09-01                  100.00\n2                                102                        2024-09-02                 150.00\n3                                103                        2024-09-01                  200.00\n\n\nThe transactions_on_date table will have:\ntransaction_id      customer_id      transaction_date         amount\n1                                 101                         2024-09-01                  100.00\n3                                103                        2024-09-01                  200.00\n\n\nThis table contains only the transactions from 2024-09-01.\n\n\nOption B is INCORRECT because S3 replication and S3 Object Lambda are unnecessary for querying data. S3 Object Lambda is used to modify and process data as it is retrieved from S3, which adds complexity and overhead when Athena can handle the query directly.\n\nOption C is INCORRECT because setting up AWS Glue with Apache Spark jobs introduces unnecessary complexity and operational overhead for a task that can be done directly with Amazon Athena. Glue is better suited for more complex ETL processes, while Athena is more efficient for querying structured data in S3.\n\nOption D is INCORRECT because using Amazon Data Firehose and AWS Lambda to process and query the data adds extra layers of complexity and does not provide the simplest or most efficient solution for querying data based on a specific column like transaction date.\n\n\n\n\nQ3:\nAn ML engineer needs to create data ingestion pipelines and ML model deployment pipelines on AWS. All the raw data is stored in Amazon S3 buckets.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?\nA. Use Amazon Data Firehose to create the data ingestion pipelines. Use Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic to create the model deployment pipelines.\nB. Use AWS Glue to create the data ingestion pipelines. Use Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic to create the model deployment pipelines.\nC. Use Amazon Redshift ML to create the data ingestion pipelines. Use Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic to create the model deployment pipelines.\nD. Use Amazon Athena to create the data ingestion pipelines. Use an Amazon SageMaker notebook to create the model deployment pipelines.\n\n\nOption B is CORRECT because using AWS Glue to create data ingestion pipelines is a common and efficient approach for processing and transforming raw data stored in Amazon S3. AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service that simplifies data preparation tasks. For ML model deployment pipelines, Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic provides an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easy to build, train, and deploy machine learning models, ensuring a seamless workflow from data ingestion to model deployment.\n\nOption A is INCORRECT because Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is primarily used for real-time data streaming to destinations like S3, Redshift, and Elasticsearch, not for comprehensive data ingestion pipelines that involve complex ETL processes. SageMaker Studio Classic is suitable for model deployment, but the data ingestion part is better handled by AWS Glue.\n\nOption C is INCORRECT because Amazon Redshift ML is designed for running machine learning models directly in the Redshift data warehouse environment, not for building data ingestion pipelines. Also, Redshift ML is not suitable for handling raw data directly from S3 in the context of creating ingestion pipelines.\n\nOption D is INCORRECT because Amazon Athena is a query service for analyzing data in S3 using standard SQL, but it is not designed to create full-fledged data ingestion pipelines. Additionally, while SageMaker notebooks can be used for model deployment, they do not offer the same level of integrated pipeline management as SageMaker Studio Classic.",

That's because all apps on iOS are sandboxed. Unless your device is jailbroken, there's no way to see that data.\nWith an Mobile Device Management System you will learn how to detect a geographically-based or wifi-based location and apply a policy to a device within 30 minutes depending on the network connection and the status of the MDM app on the device. For Android devices, MDM immediately detects a wifi-based location for a device.",

These tests will give you an edge, teach you what pitfalls to avoid and get a higher probability of acing the exam.

This gives you an average of 4 mins to answer each question. During the exam, you will have only 90 minutes to answer 55 questions. That is an average of 1m38s per question. So be mindful that these practice tests provide you with more time, in case you want to review documentation while answering the questions, but the real-life exam will be more limited timewise.\n\n\nThe questions are categorized by Knowledge Area to help you identify the module and scope under which each question falls and what documentation to review for answers.

By achieving an 80% score on this practice test, learners can confidently expect to pass the actual Product Consultant exam at an Advanced proficiency level.\n\n\nNeoLoad Exam Policy:\n\n\nExam Structure: The exam consists of 50 multiple-choice questions to be answered within 90 mins\nNumber of Attempts: Learners have 3 attempts to pass the exam.\nPassing Score: The minimum passing score is 80%.\n\n\nThere is no negative marking for wrong answers. After submitting the exam, candidates can immediately see their score, if the exam is cleared then the candidates can download the Certificate.\n\n\nNote: If a candidate fails to pass after the initial 3 attempts, more attempts can be requested by contacting NeoLoad support.\n\n\nBy completing this practice test, learners will gain:\nConfidence in NeoLoad Skills\nExam Readiness\nAdvanced Proficiency\n\n\n\n\nSample Questions:\n\n\n\n\n1. A web app uses the Spring HTTP invoker framework. Is NeoLoad compliant with such a framework?\nThe Java Serialization module must be activated.\nYes, with no additional module.\nThe RTMP module must be activated.\nNo.\n\n\n\n\n2. How can you record interactions between a SOAP client and web services server in NeoLoad?\nBy launching the SOAP client application without any configuration.\nBy configuring NeoLoad as a proxy in the SOAP client settings.\nBy configuring NeoLoad to use a different proxy.\nBy adjusting NeoLoad settings to disable recording\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll Down for the Answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1:\nLets understand how NeoLoad works with Spring HTTP Invoker:\nJava Serialization Module: This module is necessary for decoding Java Serialization requests, which are encapsulated in HTTP. It translates binary data into XML for NeoLoad to process.\nRecording Process: To record interactions, NeoLoad acts as a proxy, capturing the HTTP requests and responses. The Java Serialization module analyzes and decodes these requests during recording.\nRequired Libraries: For successful decoding, the JAR files containing the Java classes exchanged between the client and server must be loaded into NeoLoad.\n\n\nGiven the options:\nThe Java Serialization module must be activated: This is the correct answer, as NeoLoad requires this module to handle Spring HTTP Invoker.\nYes, with no additional module: This is incorrect, as the Java Serialization module is necessary.\nThe RTMP module must be activated: This is incorrect, as RTMP is used for different types of protocols.\nNo: This is incorrect, as NeoLoad is compatible with Spring HTTP Invoker using the Java Serialization module.\n\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is The Java Serialization module must be activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nTo record interactions between a SOAP client and a web services server in NeoLoad, you need to configure NeoLoad as a proxy in the SOAP client settings. Here's how:\nSet Up NeoLoad as a Proxy: Ensure NeoLoad is running and configured to act as a proxy server. The default port for NeoLoad's HTTP recorder is 8090.\nConfigure the SOAP Client: Modify the SOAP client to use NeoLoad as its proxy. This involves setting the proxy host to the machine running NeoLoad (usually localhost) and the port to 8090.\nStart Recording in NeoLoad: Begin a recording session in NeoLoad. Since SOAP requests may not require a browser, ensure the \"Launch browser\" option is unchecked.\nRun the SOAP Client Application: Launch the SOAP client application with the proxy settings applied. NeoLoad will capture the requests and responses between the client and the server.\n\n\nGiven the options:\nBy launching the SOAP client application without any configuration: This is incorrect, as specific configuration is needed.\nBy configuring NeoLoad as a proxy in the SOAP client settings: This is the correct approach, allowing NeoLoad to intercept and record SOAP requests.\nBy configuring NeoLoad to use a different proxy: This is incorrect, as NeoLoad itself should be used as the proxy.\nBy adjusting NeoLoad settings to disable recording: This is incorrect, as recording needs to be enabled.\nTherefore, the correct answer is By configuring NeoLoad as a proxy in the SOAP client settings.",

Getting a CompTIA A+ certificate can lead to a successful IT career. CompTIA created this certificate for people seeking employment as a help desk, support, service center, or networking technician. The CompTIA A+ certification exam covers PC and laptop hardware, software installation, the configuration of computer and mobile operating systems, basic networking, troubleshooting, and security skills. Many enterprises require a CompTIA A+ certificate for their entry-level information technology jobs. Passing the CompTIA A+ certification exam can also serve as a springboard towards other technology certificates and career advancements.\nDo I need CompTIA A+ for Network+?\nGetting the CompTIA A+ certification is not a requirement to get a Network+ certification. Each certification covers a separate area of computer technology. The A+ certification will test your knowledge of PC hardware, mobile device hardware, operating systems, security, cloud computing, and troubleshooting hardware and network connectivity. It consists of two tests. You can acquire the Network+ plus certification by passing one test. This test validates a student's knowledge of wired and wireless networks and their understanding of topics like unified communications and virtualization. While having both the CompTIA A+ certification and the Network+ certification will give an IT technician more opportunities when looking for a job, neither certification is a prerequisite of the other.\nHow hard is the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe difficulty of the test will depend in large part on your interest and experience in the subject. If you are taking the CompTIA A+ exam because you have already been building and fixing computers for a while and have a working knowledge of operating systems, especially Windows, you should have no problem passing the test. The exam consists of two tests. Each has 90 questions, which consist of multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. For each test, you get an hour and a half.\nHow many questions are on the CompTIA A+ exam and what is a passing score?\nThe CompTIA A+ exam consists of two tests of 90 questions each. The problems include multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. The first exam covers hardware, networking technology, mobile devices, cloud computing, virtualization, and networking troubleshooting. The second exam tests the knowledge of software troubleshooting, installing operating systems, configuring operating systems, and security. The passing score for the first exam, 220-1001, is 675 out of a scale of 100-900. For the second exam, 220-1002, a passing score is 700 out of a scale of 100-900. This means that to pass the first test, you need to answer at least 69 out of 90 questions correctly. Whereas for the second test, you need to have 70 correct out of 90.\nIs CompTIA A+ worth it?\nMany entry-level IT jobs require an A+ certification. It proves to the business you are applying to that you have basic IT knowledge. They want to know that you can do the work and don't need basic training. If you have no experience in the industry, having a CompTIA A+ certificate can get you an entry-level job. After that, you can specialize, add other certifications, and advance in your career. The CompTIA A+ certificate has been the first step in a successful career for many IT professionals.\nWhat are the objectives of the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe test objectives are to ensure that an aspiring IT professional has the basic knowledge for an entry-level information technology job. CompTIA A+ applicants should be able to assemble components based on customer requirements. The exam tests applicants on their ability to install, configure and maintain PCs, mobile devices, and software. They should know the basics of networking and security forensics. CompTIA A+ applicants should have basic troubleshooting skills to diagnose, resolve, and document common hardware and software issues. They should know how to provide essential customer support. They should also understand the basics of scripting, virtualization, desktop imaging, and deployment.\nWhat jobs can I get with CompTIA A+?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification is the industry standard for a career in IT and is the preferred credential for technical support and IT operational roles. One job a person with an A+ certificate may choose is IT support specialist. An IT support specialist is responsible for installing and configuring computer hardware and software, monitoring and maintaining computer networks, and providing technical support across a company. Another role someone with A+ certification may choose is help desk technician. A help desk technician diagnoses and supports hardware and software issues across a company.

      "description": "AI-Powered Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Specialist Certification (Using ChatGPT)\nClarity in Projects | Structure Without Stress | AI That Thinks With You\nProject management lives or dies by one thing: effective project planning. No matter how skilled the team, how advanced the tools, or how ambitious the goals—without a solid plan, projects collapse under pressure.\nAnd effective planning isn’t guesswork. It relies on proven tools.\nOne of the most important—and most recommended—planning tools by the Project Management Institute (PMI) is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).\nSo, what exactly is a WBS?\nA Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is one of the most important planning tools recommended by the Project Management Institute (PMI). It is the backbone of project planning—designed to turn overwhelming projects into clear, structured, and achievable plans.\nHere’s how it works:\nAt the top, you define the project goal—the outcome you want to achieve.\nNext, you break that goal into phases—broad categories like Design, Implementation, or Testing.\nEach phase is divided into deliverables—the tangible outputs that must be produced.\nFinally, deliverables are broken into tasks or work packages—specific action steps that can be assigned, tracked, and completed.\nThis hierarchy gives you:\nClarity – Everyone knows what needs to be done.\nControl – You can see how one delay impacts the bigger picture.\nAccountability – Every piece of work has an owner and a timeline.\nSuddenly, what feels complex becomes visible, trackable, and achievable. That’s why PMI calls the WBS a core planning tool for every project manager.\nBut here’s the challenge: while every project manager knows they should use a WBS, building one manually is often tedious, time-consuming, and prone to errors. That’s why many skip it—or create something too shallow to actually guide execution.\nThis course changes that.\nThe AI-Powered WBS Specialist Certification (using ChatGPT) is the first globally accredited program that shows you how to use ChatGPT as your project planning partner.\nThis isn’t a dry, theory-heavy WBS course. It’s a modern, AI-powered approach that gives you:\nThe confidence of a clear WBS\nThe speed of ChatGPT generating structures in minutes\nAnd the flexibility to adapt for Agile, Hybrid, or Traditional projects\nWhat Makes This Course Different?\nMost courses teach WBS like a static checklist. You’ll hear about hierarchy, levels, and maybe a few examples. But in real life, projects don’t wait for you to draw perfect boxes on paper.\nThis course blends the essentials of WBS with the power of AI prompting.\nYou’ll learn:\nWhat a WBS really is and why it’s the foundation of every successful project\nHow to avoid the confusion of vague goals by structuring work into phases, deliverables, and tasks\nHow to use ChatGPT to generate WBS drafts instantly, then refine them with advanced prompting strategies\nHow to format, visualize, and adapt your WBS for teams, leadership, and tools\nAnd how to make AI a repeatable assistant—not a one-off gimmick\nWith this, you won’t just know what a WBS is. You’ll know how to build one smarter, faster, and with AI at your side.\nWhat You’ll Achieve\nBecome a Certified AI-Powered WBS Specialist (Using ChatGPT)\nMaster the fundamentals of WBS—phases, deliverables, and work packages\nApply five powerful AI prompting strategies to build and refine WBS structures\nCreate Traditional, Agile, and Hybrid WBS formats with ChatGPT\nFormat outputs into lists, tables, codes, and slides with a single prompt\nAvoid common pitfalls like vague outputs, hallucinations, and overfitting\nBuild confidence to lead project planning in any industry—without starting from scratch\nWhy This Matters\nBecause projects fail when structure is missing.

That's over 200 questions to see how prepared you are for the real test.  Each practice exam is perfectly balanced as per the domain weightings published in the candidate bulletin.  In addition, after taking the exam you can review your answers compared against the correct answers including explanations and documentation links of each question, the answer options and the recommended approach for getting the answers right.\nUnlike other practice tests, you get LIFETIME access to these questions and explanations. There is no time limit. You can take the quizzes as many times as you like to make sure you're ready to take the exam.\nThe exams are formatted just like the real questions would be. Unfortunately, we are limited in the types of questions we can offer, so this quiz will be multiple-choice and multi-select only unlike the real exam where you can expect additional types of questions like drag-and-drop and hot-area. You can learn more about the different types of questions on Microsoft's certification web site. But we're confident that you will be fairly tested on your knowledge of the Microsoft Power Platform after taking these practice exams.\nThe exams were compiled by an experienced team of Microsoft security professionals whom have all passed the official exams. The test covers all the latest domains and sub-domains as published in the candidate bulletin including:\nImplement and manage identity and access\nImplement and manage threat protection\nImplement and manage information protection\nManage governance and compliance features in Microsoft 365\nFour practice tests allow you the flexibility to attempt one exam early-on during your exam-preparation to adjust your focus-areas and cut down on study time.  The three remaining exams can be used to prove your readiness to take the official exam.  Or you can just use all three in whatever way suits your preparation workflow.\nThis is the perfect tool to assess your readiness, and find those one or two areas that you may want to focus on in the days before taking the test.\nWe are looking forward to seeing you inside the course.",

The Cisco CCNA Network certification tops Global Knowledge's list of top-paying certifications because it's a vendor-neutral certification that will help you land many well-paid, entry-level jobs.\n\n\nWhat is Cisco CCNA and what can you do with it?\nCCNA stands for Cisco Certified Network Associate, which is a certification you can earn after taking the 120-minute exam administered by Cisco. The exam tests your knowledge and skills related to network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security fundamentals, and automation and programmability. Once you earn your CCNA, you can use it to get a job in the information technology (IT) or networking fields. For example, you could work as a Cloud Engineer, Network Administrator, Systems Administrator, or IT Manager. You can also take additional specialized exams to land a more specialized role. If you complete the CCNA Routing and Switching Certification, for example, you are eligible for positions like a Network Analyst or Network Engineer.\nHow can I pass the CCNA with self study?\nMany people pass the CCNA exam through self-study using the latest learning materials supplemented with practical instruction. The exam covers a broad range of basic and modern networking concepts along with real-world Cisco network configuration scenarios. It's important to both understand the concepts and practice applying them. Simulated configuration exercises, practice labs, and sample test questions are especially helpful in preparing for the CCNA exam. Udemy courses can help you master the networking concepts and skills needed. You can also gain hands-on Cisco CCNA configuration and troubleshooting experience through practice labs.\nWhat are the topics covered in the Cisco CCNA exam?\nThe CCNA exam tests your knowledge and skills in networking fundamentals such as routing and switching, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security basics, and automation and programmability. Among the topics covered are how to build simple LANs, how to use a patch panel, troubleshooting routers and switches, IP addressing and subnetting, IPv6 routing, address allocation using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), access control lists (ACLs), basic WAN technologies such as VPN and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), external authentication methods, quality of service (QoS), IP services such as Network Address Translation (NAT). For many years, the CCNA certification involved multiple exams for individual tracks like CCNA Voice and CCNA Data Center. In 2020, Cisco combined all the tracks into one comprehensive CCNA exam based on the latest…\nWhat are the recommended prerequisites for the CCNA exam?\nAlthough there are no formal prerequisites for CCNA certification, most professionals in the field would recommend a thorough understanding of the CCNA topics before taking the exam. A lot of CCNA candidates have one or more years of experience implementing Cisco solutions along with a grasp of basic IP addressing and network concepts.\nIS CCNA required for a CCNP?\nNo, the CCNA is no longer required before you can attain a CCNP or higher-level Cisco certification. However, you need a certain level of competency and knowledge that builds upon skills attained at the CCNA level before you should attempt the CCNP certification. To achieve any of the Cisco professional-level certifications, you must pass two exams. You can earn a CCNP certification in one or more of the following specialties: enterprise (including routing, switching, and wireless networking), collaboration, security, data center, and service provider. Cisco also offers professional-level certifications in Cisco Certified DevNet Professional, which proves your skills in developing and maintaining applications built on Cisco networks, and Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional, which proves your skills in incident response, cloud security, and other active defense security roles.\nWhat are the other Cisso certifications and what do they cover?\nCisco has associate (CCNA), professional (CCNP), and expert (CCIE) certifications. These include the CCNA, Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate (entry security analyst skills), and Cisco Certified DevNet Associate (developing apps on Cisco platforms). CCNP certifications in enterprise (routing, switching, and wireless), collaboration (Cisco apps and services), data center (Cisco infrastructure), security (Cisco security solutions), and service provider (implementing and operating Cisco solutions), along with Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional and Cisco Certified DevNet Professional; CCIE certifications in enterprise infrastructure (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), enterprise wireless (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), data center (building and operating Cisco data center solutions), security (implementing Cisco security solutions)\nWhat should I learn before Cisco CCNA?\nBefore the Cisco Certified Network Associate examination, you should know basic networking, security, automation, programming, and IP addressing. The CCNA examination intends to certify that you know to perform basic Network Associate tasks. These include managing, monitoring, and maintaining an organization's network infrastructure. A CCNA will not need to architect, design, or develop an advanced network, but they will need to understand it, modify it, and configure it. CCNAs generally have some entry-level, hands-on experience in information technology. Many CCNAs will have an Associate's or Bachelors in an IT-related field. Alternatively, those seeking Cisco certification can take Udemy courses to learn the basics of networking and information technology.\nHow do I know if CCNA is right for me?\nA CCNA is generally ideal for those who are pursuing a career in networking or security. Cisco certifications are particularly prized for their rigor and valued by employers across the globe. Entry-level IT professionals who want to expand their career and improve their marketability (or their paygrade) may want to get a Network Associate certification to show their dedication to the field. Alternatively, those who seek to learn more about networking or discover whether networking might be the best path for them may consider taking Cisco certification courses. While alternative certification paths (such as CompTIA's Network+) exist, Cisco generally represents the gold standard in networking and security. Further, Cisco's entry-level certifications lead down a more advanced certification path.\nHow to Get Your CCNA Certification with the 200-301 Exam\nChoosing to earn the Cisco Certified Network Administrator (CCNA) certification is one of the most powerful decisions you’ll ever make in terms of boosting your career.

      "description": "PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.\n\n\nThe abbreviation PHP initially stood for Personal Homepage. But now it is a recursive acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor. (It's recursive in the sense that the first word itself is an abbreviation, so the full meaning doesn't follow the abbreviation.)\nThe first version of PHP has launched 26 years ago. Now it's on version 8, released in November 2020, but version 7 remains the most widely used.\n\n\nPHP has some advantages that have made it so popular, and it's been the go-to language for web servers for more than 15 years now. Here are some of PHP's benefits:\n\n\nCross-Platform: PHP is platform-independent. You don't have to have a particular OS to use it because it runs on every platform, whether it's Mac, Windows, or Linux.\nOpen Source: PHP is open source. The original code is made available to everyone who wants to build upon it. This is one of the reasons why one of its frameworks, Laravel, is so popular.\nEasy to learn: PHP is not hard to learn for absolute beginners. You can pick it up pretty much if you already have programming knowledge.\nPHP syncs with all Databases: You can easily connect PHP to all Databases, relational and non-relational. So it can connect in no time to MySQL, Postgress, MongoDB, or any other database.\nSupportive Community: PHP has a very supportive online community. The official documentation provides guides on how to use the features and you can easily get your problem fixed while stuck.",

If you've taken a college course with a CompTIA certification as part of the curriculum, it's very possible that I was the one that wrote the questions throughout the course, including your midterms and final exams.\nThese 6 practice tests are broken down by domain and individual objective so you can see where your strengths and weaknesses are and spend more time studying up on the areas where you might need a little more practice. You'll have roughly 1.5 minutes per question in these tests, though on the actual exam you'll have 90 minutes for up to 90 questions. Be sure to read each question completely and thoroughly to be sure you understand exactly what the question is asking. Just as with CompTIA's questions, sometimes questions may have extra information that is irrelevant to what is actually being asked, while other questions will be very straightforward.\nWhether you found this course through my YouTube channel or through my website or through some other method, I'd love to hear any feedback you might have about these questions.

I am an Okta Certified Consultant and I have carefully designed this course for you to get to know the aspects of Okta in a simple and pleasant manner.\nCourse is intended for anyone out there working with Okta or simply interested in this field. More specifically, it is intended for those who are trying to get a helping hand into their journey of trying to get to be an Okta Certified Administrator.\n\n\n*ATTENTION*\n1. Please understand this is not an official Okta course, everything you are going to see is designed by myself so my own point of view, but nonetheless a point of view based on the official Okta Administrator Certification Exam Study Guide / public KB articles. In any case, it will NOT grant you the Okta Administrator Certificate, the same as it will NOT provide you with the entire knowledge / answers needed for passing the actual Okta Certified Administrator exam. You are the only one who knows if you are truly ready to take on such an official exam and when.\n2. Those questions you are going to see in the course, questions to which you have to find the correct answer(s), might have just one single correct answer or multiple correct answers, while Okta's official Certification exams have a DOMC (Discrete Option Multiple Choice) structure (not supported by Udemy at the moment).\n3. Each question in the course has at least 3 choices from which you can pick. There isn't a single question providing only two potential answers.\n4. This course is based not only on the direct links' content Okta provides in the Okta Administrator Certification Exam Study Guide, but also on their nested links (with an infinite depth), as that's the only way in which someone can truly grasp the knowledge, by trying to check the extensions as well, which is where fine details reside at times.\n5. Pay attention that these questions might even be harder then the actual ones you'll find in the official Okta Administrator Certification Exam, the same of some of them might feel much easier then what you'll meet in the official examination provided by Okta. This is simply a matter of perspective and level of knowledge. I added a timer of 120 mins and a threshold of 70% for passing this one, as mere guidance.\n\nYou'll get to see:\nA total of 120 questions with related answers (single / multiple choice as correct answer(s)), out of which:\n105 - are uniquely designed for this course\n10 - are shared between this course and the 'Okta Certified Professional Knowledge Base Test' course on Udemy\n5 - are shared between this course and the 'Okta Certified Developer Knowledge Base Test' course on Udemy\n\n\n! Once again, the present course is designed to greatly help you towards achieving the goal of passing the Okta Administrator Certification Exam, but cannot guarantee that, as this course is NOT provided by Okta officials, hence it does not represent a standard in passing the Okta Administrator Certification Exam or gathering the entirety of the knowledge needed for passing it with success.\n\nHaving said the above, wish you good luck!\n\n\n\n\nWith respect,\nSilviu Muraru",

      "description": "Are you aiming to become an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner? Our course, \"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner | 6 Practice Exams,\" is meticulously crafted to help you succeed. With 390 unique, high-quality test questions, spread across six comprehensive practice exams, this course covers all the essential domains of the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. Each question comes with detailed explanations, ensuring you understand the key concepts and principles required for the certification. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional looking to validate your skills, this course will boost your confidence and knowledge, making you exam-ready. Begin your journey to AWS certification success today!\n\n\nWe recommend re-taking these practice tests until you consistently score 80% or higher - that’s when you’re ready to take the exam and achieve an excellent score!\n\n\nSample Question:\nOne of your teammates, who is new to AWS, needs your help protecting an EC2 instance. He has deployed a Web application on that EC2 instance. The teammate wants to ensure that only HTTP and HTTPS traffic are allowed to the EC2 instance. Which of the following options would you recommend to your teammate to ensure that only HTTP and HTTPS traffic are allowed to the EC2 instance?\nNetwork ACLs\nAWS Shield\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nSecurity Group\n\n\nCorrect answer\nSecurity Group: Security Groups act as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances and control inbound and outbound traffic. They are the most suitable option for ensuring that only HTTP and HTTPS traffic are allowed to an EC2 instance as they can be configured to allow specific protocols and ports, such as port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS.\n\n\nOverall explanation\nSecurity Groups are virtual firewalls for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. They operate at the instance level and provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress traffic. Here's why Security Groups are the correct choice:\nInstance-Level Security:\nSecurity Groups are directly associated with EC2 instances. They allow you to specify which traffic is allowed to reach your instances.\nStateful Nature:\nSecurity Groups are stateful, meaning that if you allow an incoming request from a specific IP and port, the response is automatically allowed regardless of outbound rules.\nGranular Control:\nYou can specify rules based on protocol (e.g., TCP), port number (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS), and source/destination IP address or CIDR block.\nEase of Use:\nSecurity Groups are easy to configure and manage. You can quickly set up rules to allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.\nHow to Configure Security Groups for HTTP and HTTPS:\nCreate a Security Group:\nNavigate to the Amazon EC2 console.\nUnder \"Network & Security,\" select \"Security Groups.\"\nClick \"Create Security Group.\"\nAdd Inbound Rules:\nAdd a rule for HTTP traffic:\nType: HTTP\nProtocol: TCP\nPort Range: 80\nSource: 0.0.0.0/0 (for all IP addresses) or a specific IP range\nAdd a rule for HTTPS traffic:\nType: HTTPS\nProtocol: TCP\nPort Range: 443\nSource: 0.0.0.0/0 (for all IP addresses) or a specific IP range\nAssign Security Group to EC2 Instance:\nAttach the newly created Security Group to your EC2 instance.\nWhy Other Options are Incorrect:\nNetwork ACLs:\nNetwork ACLs operate at the subnet level, not the instance level, and are stateless, meaning they do not automatically allow response traffic.\nAWS Shield:\nAWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service. It does not control specific traffic types to EC2 instances.\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC):\nA VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. While VPCs provide networking infrastructure, they do not control traffic to specific instances. Security Groups within the VPC control traffic.\n\n\nResources:\nAWS Security Groups\nAWS Network ACLs\nAWS Shield\nAmazon VPC",

      "description": "Master Course: COBIT 2019 Foundation (101 Level)\nWelcome to the world of COBIT 2019, a globally recognized framework that enables organizations to govern and manage their information and technology effectively. This exam preparation course will serve as your guide to the COBIT 2019 Foundation examination, an entry-level program designed to introduce you to the fundamental principles and concepts of COBIT. Whether you're a newcomer to IT governance or looking to refresh your knowledge, this course is the perfect starting point for your COBIT journey.\n1. Framework Introduction:\nIn this section, the COBIT 2019 Foundation course introduces you to the COBIT framework. You'll gain an understanding of what COBIT is, its history, and its significance in the world of IT governance and management. This topic serves as the foundation for the course, establishing the context for the principles and concepts you'll be learning throughout the program.\n2. Principles:\nThe Principles of COBIT 2019 are a set of seven guiding principles that form the core of the framework. These principles provide a high-level, philosophical basis for the development and implementation of effective governance and management of enterprise IT. Understanding these principles is crucial because they guide how COBIT is designed and how it should be applied in real-world scenarios.\n3. Governance System and Components:\nThis topic delves into the governance system and its various components. You'll learn how the governance system operates and how it is structured. COBIT comprises four primary components: Principles, Policies, Practices, and Enablers. These components work in harmony to help organizations establish a robust IT governance system that aligns IT with business objectives and ensures effective risk management.\n4. Governance and Management Objectives:\nGovernance and Management Objectives (GMOs) are the heart of COBIT 2019. GMOs are specific, actionable goals that organizations strive to achieve when implementing IT governance and management.

Though this practice test would help you to score more than 70% passing mark, however I would suggest to study IICS from Informatica documentation to make solid foundation of knowledge. I hope each and everyone of you will have sufficient IICS hands-one working experience and when that combines with these realistic mock tests, it becomes a deadly combination not only to make you pass in exam but also to help you succeed in your professional work.\nMy intention to prepare this mock test series is to help you preparing for actual certification exam and boost up your confidence with real examination question. Thank you and good luck to you.\nThis entire course has around ~170 questions distributed in 4 sets. Also I have given explanation of difficult questions to help you understand. Still if you have any doubt, I would suggest to consult Informatica documentation or you can contact me via Udemy communication channel. I shall be happy to answer your queries.",

      "description": "Build real, job-ready Azure networking skills while preparing to ace the AZ-700 exam. This hands-on bootcamp walks you from core foundations to advanced, production-grade architectures using the Azure Portal, CLI, and infrastructure-as-code. Every module maps to AZ-700 objectives and pairs clear theory with practical labs, diagrams, and troubleshooting playbooks so you can design, deploy, secure, and operate networks that scale.\nYou’ll start with Azure networking fundamentals—VNets, subnets, IP addressing, and DNS—then move quickly into connectivity. We compare Site-to-Site vs. Point-to-Site VPNs, design high availability, and implement resilient tunnels with correct IPsec/IKE parameters and BGP. You’ll master ExpressRoute connectivity models, SKUs, peering options, Global Reach, and gateway deployment for predictable, private hybrid performance.\nNext, we tackle routing and traffic control: system routes, user-defined routes (UDRs), forced tunneling, Azure Route Server, and dynamic routing patterns that prevent blackholes and asymmetry. You’ll configure Azure Load Balancer (public/internal), inbound NAT, health probes, session persistence, and explicit outbound rules for controlled egress. At layer 7, you’ll build secure, high-performance application delivery with Application Gateway (including WAF), Azure Front Door, and Traffic Manager for global resiliency.\nSecurity is woven end-to-end. You’ll design with Azure Firewall and Firewall Manager, implement rule collections and DNAT/SNAT, and combine NSGs and Application Security Groups for least-privilege micro-segmentation. We go deep on monitoring: NSG Flow Logs, Traffic Analytics, metrics, logs, and Network Watcher tools (Connection Monitor, IP Flow Verify, packet capture) to diagnose latency, MTU, and routing issues fast.\nPrivate access gets first-class treatment. You’ll plan and deploy Private Link and private endpoints, compare with service endpoints, integrate DNS for split-horizon resolution, and enable fully private PaaS access from on-prem via VPN/ExpressRoute. We’ll also cover NAT Gateway for scalable, predictable outbound connectivity.\nThroughout, you’ll use battle-tested checklists, decision trees, and templates to accelerate real deployments—plus quiz questions and exam-style scenarios to lock in AZ-700 readiness.\nBy the end, you’ll be able to:\nDesign secure hub-and-spoke or Virtual WAN architectures.\nImplement VPN, ExpressRoute, and private access with correct routing/DNS.\nConfigure load balancing at L4/L7 and engineer traffic for scale and resiliency.\nHarden networks with Firewall, NSGs, WAF, and Zero Trust segmentation.\nMonitor, troubleshoot, and optimize performance using Azure’s native tooling.\nPrereqs: basic networking (TCP/IP, routing, DNS), an Azure subscription, and comfort with Portal/CLI/PowerShell.

Knowing C# opens a great deal of doors for you as a developer.\nC# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\nThe C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.\nWelcome to the Certified Professional in #C Programming - Practice Test the only course you need to test your skill of coding with #C.\nThe course includes 2 Practice Test builds your programming knowledge while making real-world C# projects.\nIn this course, you’ll be exposed to fundamental programming concepts using C# and to help you practice and test your knowledge using quizzes.\n\n\nHere's a detailed look at what you'll get:\n\nmethods\nvariables\narrays\nif statements\nloops\nClasses and Objects\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\nand much much more!\n\n\nWhat will you need to succeed in this Exam?\n\nNO Android, Java, Swift, or C knowledge is required!\nC# basic knowledge is required though - you don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set (though there are refresher sections in this course!)\nWhat does this course offer you?\n\nThis course consists of 3 practice tests.\nThe practice test consists of 20 questions, timed at 30 minutes\nThe questions are multiple-choice.\nEvery question is associated with a knowledge area.\nThe answers are randomized every time you take a test.\nOnce the test was taken, you will get an instant result report with categories of strength to weakness.\nYou can re-take the tests over and over again as and when it suits you.\n\n\nI'd be very happy to welcome you to the course!",

Supervised learning is a type of Predictive Modeling that involves\nClassification Models, Shallow Machine Learning Models, Ensemble Models, Regression\nModels, and the Black Box technique. We have numerous divisions of each modeling\ntechnique.\nWe thoroughly discuss Probability, Joint Probability, Bayes Rule, and Naive Bayes using a\nuse case. Naive Bayes is not ideal for larger numeric features because numeric features\nmust be converted into categorical ones through discretization or bining. It allows the\ndeletion of missing value entries. This algorithm assumes class-conditional independence.\nThe probability is zero for new words not seen in training data, making the entire calculation\nzero. To encounter this problem, we use Laplace Estimator. French Mathematician\nPierre-Simon Laplace created this algorithm. The default value of the Laplace estimator is 1.\nAny value can be used for the Laplace estimator.\nK-Nearest Neighbor Classifier is also called Lazy Learner, Memory-Based Reasoning,\nExample-Based Reasoning, Instance-Based Learning, Case-Based Reasoning, Rote\nLearning, etc. We understand the differences between the k-means algorithm and kNN. We\nthen understand 1, 2, 3, and 7 Nearest Neighbors. The minimum k value equals 1, and the\nmaximum equals the number of observations. k is a hyperparameter. We then understand\nwhat a baseline model is, where accuracy is equal to the majority class, and for prediction\nmodels, accuracy is greater than 80%. We further understand the Bias-variance trade-off.\nWe jump into the applications and importance of k-NN at the end.\nThe Decision Tree algorithm is a Rules-based algorithm. We understand what a decision\ntree is, followed by learning how to build decision trees, then we dive into the greedy\nalgorithm, building the best decision tree and attribute selection. A decision tree is a tree-like\nstructure in which an internal node represents an attribute, each branch represents the\noutcome of the best and each leaf node represents a class label. There are 3 types of nodes\na root node, a branch node, and a leaf node. So how do we build a decision tree? First, we\nuse training data to build a model, and then the tree generator determines the following-\n- Which variable has to be split at a node, and the value of the split\n- The decision to stop or split again has to be made\n- Assigning terminal nodes to a label\n- A basic or Greedy algorithm is a tree constructed in a top-down recursive\ndivide-and-conquer manner.\n- Further, we analyze Greedy Approach, Entropy, and Information gain.",

Organizations use ITSM to plan, implement, support, and improve services and create value for their customers.\nThese practice tests, which are based on actual exam questions, help you to identify and describe the components of the  IT service management approach. You will:\nDefine IT Service Management and its key concepts.\nIdentify the components of the  IT Service Management framework.\nAnalyze the  IT Service Management practices and guiding principles.\nIdentify the components and functions of the  IT Service Management SVS\nAs you begin to prepare for your certification exam, there are some common-yet-powerful techniques that can make sure you’re not overlooking anything in your preparation. So many professionals prepare for a certification by reading a book and then they’re disappointed if they don’t pass the exam. The reality is, knowing the source information is only a small part of the preparation most people need to go through in order to take their certification exams.\nThe practice tests are timed and at the end of each practice test, you'll receive a score, along with feedback on each and every question telling you exactly why each answer is correct so that you can pinpoint the areas in which you need to improve and perform some additional studying. You should attempt to get at least 80% in each of these practice tests. Remember, you'll need to get 65% or 26 out of the 40 questions correct in order to pass the real examination. You can take these practice tests as many times as you want. Since these questions are based on the real examination questions, the more you practice, the easier it will be for you to pass the real examination.\nToday, I am sharing tips and tricks that will allow you to pass your certification exam regardless of your level of expertise in service management.\nReview the Exam Syllabus\nThe first thing you want to make sure that you have is your exam syllabus, which is also known as a test plan. Consider your exam syllabus, as an outline to the exam. With the syllabus, you will know which topics hold the most weight on the exam and plan to study accordingly. Reviewing the exam syllabus is what you do first, to maximize your study time.\nTake as Many Exam Practice Questions as You Can\nCertification exam practice questions are the most valuable resources to pass the actual ITIL 4 Foundation Certification Exam with confidence!. This will help you refresh all of the information that you have learned during the duration of your study. This is very important if you want to pass. Some of the things you learned in the beginning of the course may have slipped your mind. Additionally, by doing the practice questions, you can see what areas are your strongest and which ones you need to focus on more before the exam day.\nPractice Makes Perfect\nThe practice questions are similar to the actual exam and practice makes perfect. You will become faster at answering the questions correctly, and be prepared for anything that comes your way.\nRead the questions carefully\nTake your time to make sure you understand exactly what you have to do. Always read the questions carefully. Make a note of the key information in the question that you need to answer. Check you have answered the question correctly.\nEliminate obvious wrong answers\nEliminate the obviously wrong answers to arrive at the best answer. Keep a watch on specific keywords in the definitions in the ITIL study material and look out for those keywords in the questions or the answer choices.\nExamination Duration\nIf you do these practice tests, you should have enough time to answer the questions. Usually examinees finish the examination in about 30 minutes. Take the extra time to review questions whose answers you're not confident about.\nTypes of questions to expect\nThe examination tests the recall and understanding the ITSM concepts -\n# Recall questions - Identify a definition / term from the answer choices provided\n# Understand questions - Explain a definition / term / concept from the answer choices provided\nTake Time for You\nYou may think that studying for weeks on end leading up to the exam, is a surefire way to pass, but this is a myth. You have to take breaks to take your mind completely off the exam, or you will suffer from information overload.\nThe Benefit of Taking Time for You\nWhen it is time to take the exam you will have retained all of the information needed in addition to having it separated to avoid a bunch of information running throughout your mind all at once.\nClosing Thoughts\nPreparing to take a certification exam does not have to be hard if you prepare to prepare. It is highly recommended that you start by reviewing the syllabus and form a study group so you have support the entire time. Obviously, you have already made it to the final stretch subsequent to a course of study. Therefore, you know the information to pass, you just have to make sure that you make your weaknesses into strengths and then you are guaranteed to pass your exam.",

Whether you're a seasoned SAP PM professional or a novice, gauge your expertise and readiness for the official certification. Moreover, even if certification isn't your endgame, this exercise is a holistic supplement to any PM training pursued.\nCourse Outline:\nSegmented for clarity and effective learning, this course encompasses six pivotal sections:\nCorrective & Preventive Maintenance\nTechnical Objects, Organizational Units & Master Data\nBreakdown, Refurbishment & Project-oriented Maintenance\nEmerging Technologies & Mobile Maintenance\nAnalytics\nUser Interface, Experience & Overall Usability\nDive deep into each segment with curated questions shedding light on the topic at hand.\nWhy Opt for This Certification Prep?\nAcquiring a SAP certification is a testament to your expertise, giving you an edge in job interviews. Crafted by a seasoned SAP Plant Maintenance consultant, this preparation infuses practical know-how, functional insights, and industry best practices. Aimed at ensuring your success in one go, practice with real-world questions, replete with detailed answers and illustrative screenshots.\nSneak Peek: Sample Questions:\nQuestion 1:\nOn which technical unit can a default Control Key be configured that will be automatically transferred to the operations of a task list / order?\na. Work Center\nb. Planner Group\nc. Plant Section\n\n\nResponse:\na. Work Center\nNeither the Planner Group nor the Plant Section allows a default Control Key to be set.\nThe Work Center, on the other hand, does.\nThis configuration is done in the \"Default Values\" tab of the Work Center view.\nNote: transaction codes needed:\n- IR01: Create Work Center\n- IR02: Change Work Center\n- IR03: Display Work Center\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nWhy create a sub-order rather than just adding a new operation?\na. Because another reference object has to be assigned.\nb. To confirm, approve or close it independently.\nc. To budget it differently.\nd. To assign a different Work Center.\ne. There is no particular reason.\n\n\nResponse:\na. Because another reference object has to be assigned, b. To confirm, approve or close it independently & c. To budget it differently.\nIndeed, Suborders rivals the creation of new operations.\nMany PM users wonder whether it is better to create a Suborder or to add one or more operations in the existing order.\nSuborders are useful in several cases like for exemple assign a separate reference object, separate order budget or also use an independent approval.\nIn the other hand, different Work Center can be assigned to operations inside a same Order. Consequently, that's not a reason of creating a Suborder.\n\n\nUpdates: This course undergoes periodic updates, integrating fresh questions and insights from the community.\nRemember, your future trajectory is influenced by today's endeavors. Take the leap, invest in your professional growth, and stride confidently with Key User Training.\n\n\n#SAPCertification\n#EnterpriseAssetManagement\n#S4HANA\n#AssetManagement\n#PlantMaintenance\n#KeyUserTraining\n#SAPTraining\n#CertificationPreparation",

AI is one of the 3 core pillars for AI and is very relevant moving into the future. This exam is shorter and easier compared to many of Salesforce's certification exams.\n\n\nMy goal is to help you prepare for and feel confident to pass this exam. When I first began my Salesforce career I often wondered how to best pass Salesforce certification exams and heavily leaned on Trailhead, which is a great resource, but practice tests are a good confidence builder and help to determine what you need to go back and study again.\n\n\nThis practice test comes primarily from the content that was provided in Salesforce's AI Associate Trailmix on Trailhead and personal experience preparing for and passing the certification exam. These questions are not exact questions from the exam but cover many of the areas covered on the exam.\n\n\nThis certification likely will not land you a job all by itself but will be useful in combination with other Salesforce certifications. Visit the Salesforce Help Club website for guidance on your Salesforce learning or certification journey.\n\n\nThis practice test is not made by or affiliated with Salesforce the organization, I put this content together of my own accord.\n\n\nI hope this helps you in your certification journey!",

So, I encourage you to try to score above 90% on both simulation exams before taking the real PSM 1 exam.\n\n\nPlease do not try to memorize any questions or answers in practice exams since the questions you will see in the real PSM1 exam might be different. Instead, try to understand the question and explanation if you do not get a correct answer for each question.\nMost questions are constructed to test your knowledge with the Scrum Guide. Please read the Scrum Guide 2020 multiple times before taking a simulation exam. Also, the Scrum Guide 2017 can be a good reference as well since a few questions might still be related to the Scrum Guide 2017. Please also review the Scrum glossary in the Scrum official website since a few terms such as burn-down chart that you should be familiar with before taking the exam.\nPlease take advantage of free Scrum Open Assessments offered in Scrum website. Please make sure that you practice enough and you do not miss more than one question for each assessment like Scrum Open, Product Owner Open, and Developer Open. You will see a few questions from Open Assessments in your PSM1 exam.\nGood luck in pursuing your PSM1 certification!",

      "description": "Python Programming Practice Test Course\nThis course is designed to help you practice and improve your Python programming skills by covering a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced concepts. Whether you are preparing for coding interviews or just looking to reinforce your knowledge, this course offers practical, real-world scenarios to help you deepen your understanding of Python. Each section focuses on key areas of the language, with a variety of question types to test your knowledge.\n\n\nSection 1: Python Fundamentals\nIn this section, you will be tested on the foundational concepts of Python programming. It starts with the basic syntax and structure of Python, which is essential to write clear, readable code. Python uses indentation to define code blocks, and this section will test how well you understand and use this feature. You will also work with comments, both single-line and multi-line, to make your code easier to follow.\nNext, you will focus on variables and data types. This involves working with integers, floats, strings, and booleans, the core data types in Python. You will practice type conversion, which allows you to switch between different types when needed. The questions will also cover how operators are used in Python, including arithmetic operators for performing calculations, comparison operators for making decisions, and logical operators for combining multiple conditions.\nFinally, this section tests your understanding of control flow. This includes using if, elif, and else statements to control the flow of your program based on different conditions. You will also practice working with loops, including for loops and while loops, which are used to repeat actions in your code.\n\n\nSection 2: Functions and Modules\nThis section focuses on functions, which are a core part of Python programming. You will be asked to define your own functions, pass arguments to them, and return values. Functions help make your code more organized and reusable, and in this section, you will practice writing functions that perform specific tasks.\nAdvanced function topics will also be covered, including default and keyword arguments. You will practice using *args and **kwargs, which allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. You will also encounter lambda functions, which are anonymous functions often used for short, simple operations.\nAdditionally, this section will introduce you to Python’s modules and packages. You will practice importing standard libraries like math, random, and datetime, and also learn how to create and use your own custom modules. This is a key skill for organizing your code across multiple files, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n\n\nSection 3: Data Structures\nIn this section, you will work with Python’s built-in data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Lists are ordered collections that can be modified, and you will practice creating lists, slicing them, and modifying their contents. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. You will learn how to use tuples to store fixed collections of data.\nDictionaries are key-value pairs, which allow you to store and retrieve values based on unique keys. You will work with dictionary methods, such as adding, updating, and deleting elements, as well as how to loop through dictionaries efficiently.\nSets are another important data structure in Python, used to store unique elements. You will practice creating sets, adding and removing items, and performing set operations like unions and intersections.\n\n\nSection 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\nThis section introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. You will be tested on defining classes and creating objects, which are the core building blocks of OOP. A class defines a blueprint for creating objects, and you will practice writing classes that encapsulate both data and behavior.\nYou will also explore different types of methods, including instance methods, which operate on individual objects, class methods, which apply to the class as a whole, and static methods, which do not depend on any instance or class variables. Inheritance, a key feature of OOP, allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another. You will practice implementing single and multiple inheritance.\nThe principles of encapsulation and polymorphism are also important in this section. Encapsulation involves keeping an object’s internal state private, while polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as if they belong to the same class. These concepts will help you write more secure and flexible code.\n\n\nSection 5: Exception Handling and File Operations\nThis section focuses on handling errors and working with files in Python. Exception handling allows you to catch and manage errors in your code, preventing your program from crashing unexpectedly. You will practice using try, except, and finally blocks to handle common exceptions, and you will also learn how to raise custom exceptions when specific error conditions occur.\nFile operations are another key topic in this section. You will practice reading from and writing to files, which is an essential skill for working with data in Python. This section will also introduce you to context managers, such as the with statement, which makes it easier to manage file resources by automatically closing files when you’re done with them.\n\n\nSection 6: Advanced Topics and Libraries\nIn this final section, you will explore more advanced Python concepts and popular libraries. Iterators and generators will be a key focus, helping you understand how Python handles sequences of data. You will practice using iter() and next() to work with iterators, and yield to create generators, which allow you to generate values on the fly, improving memory efficiency.\nDecorators are another important topic in this section. You will learn how to write and use decorators to modify the behavior of functions without changing their code.\nFinally, you will work with some of the most popular Python libraries. You will practice using NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualizing data. You will also encounter questions about the requests library, which is commonly used for making HTTP requests in Python.",

Learn how to test for XSS vulnerabilities, identify exploits and protect against them. Attack applications using buffer overflow techniques in order to execute arbitrary malicious code and we will also identify ways to mitigate these attacks.\nThere are practically an infinite number of security testing tools available both free and paid.   In the security testing tools lesson we will begin to scratch the surface of some of these common tools and identify how we categorize them and their uses. Management of logs are a key component of operational security.  These days the velocity, variety and volume of data collected via logs has catapulted log management into the realm of Big Data.   You will learn how to effectively manage these logs and derive useful security information from them in the lesson on SIEM.\nMinimizing the attack surface area of operating systems, databases and applications is a key tenet of operational security.   I will show you techniques for OS/DB and App hardening.  Luring attackers away from critical data and studying their behavior can help us to protect the data that matters most.  You will learn how to use honeypots to tie up attackers and find out what they are up to.\nVulnerability Assessment and Pen Testing are often terms that are used interchangeably.   In this section we will walk through some of the differences and commonalities between the two.",

The questions in the test span across a wide range of topics that anyone planning to appear for Certification exam must be aware of.\n\n\nTest Format\nThe total number of questions in the practice test are same as the actual number of Certification exam Questions (80). The duration of the actual exam is 180 mins, however, the duration of the test has been intentionally kept as 120 mins to help prepare well for the actual exam. If you pass the challenge while practicing for it, you're very certain of passing the real exam.\n\n\nTopics on which questions are asked in the exam and that are covered in the test include:\nUser Management\nReporting\nIntegration\nProducts and Pricing\nQuotation and Sales Order Management\nLead and Opportunity Management\nImplementation Basics\nNotification Process\nAccount and Contact Management\nData Migration\nPersonalization and Extensibility\nSales Planning and Forecasting\nTerritory Management\nVisit Planning and Execution\nFine Tuning\n\n\nWhy should you buy the practice test even if you're already confident about clearing the exam?\nWell, first of all, congratulations for thinking that way. It's good to be confident. It increases your chance of clearing the exam by reducing your nervousness. But is that enough? Knowing concepts fundamentally and theoretically is one thing, having some hands on practice is another, but attempting an objective test is a completely different thing. Passing an exam requires practicing multiple choice and multi-select questions. Also, it is important to understand the specific topics that must be well read (being tricky) before appearing for the exam.\nIf you ask me - \"Can I pass the exam without practice and just going through some documentation and concepts\", the answer is certainly 'Yes' but chances of that yes are much lower if you haven't practiced.\n\n\nSomebody is selling a SAP C4C certification dump for a higher price and claiming a pass guarantee. Why should I buy this test on Udemy?\nDO NOT fall for FALSE claims made by those people who say that they GUARANTEE that you will PASS. Some people use unethical ways to fool people into buying dumps and have made a business out of this. Your chances to succeed depend on your practice to give such tests besides your preparation on those topics.\nHow did I prepare the practice test?\nI've spent more than 50 hours over a span of 1 month going through SAP recommended course material C4C10 and C4C12 to think of potential questions and compiled them along my learning journey. I've practiced on a C4C tenant and compiled some scenario based questions. So, in a way, if you take this practice test, you won't have to revisit a lot of concepts or at least it will save a lot of your time.\n\n\n7 Salient Features of this practice test that will help you be successful\nTimed to simulate the exam environment\nMultiple Choice and Multi-Select questions\nAs many as 6 choices of answers in multi-select questions\nThe right mix of easy, medium and difficult questions\nQuestions covering all 15 topic areas as prescribed in the SAP Certification Hub\nTheoretical and Scenario based questions\nExplanation provided for every answer that is not self-explanatory\n\n\nNOTE: Not only do you get a LIFETIME ACCESS to this test, NEW QUESTIONS will be added regularly based on SAP's latest release updates.\n\n\nACT NOW and ENROL to speed up your SAP CX Learning Journey!",

The detail makes this course worth the investment including the summary at the end and the quizzes that test my knowledge.\"  -- Valentina Kibuyaga\n\nWelcome to Streaming Analytics on Google Cloud Platform This is the Fifth and final course in a series of courses designed to help you attain the coveted Google Certified Data Engineer.\nAdditionally, the series of courses is going to show you the role of the data engineer on the Google Cloud Platform.\nWhile this is a short course the topic matter is dense and while you won't have to author is Java Pipelines for the exam you will need to know a lot about how they are created and executed.\nAt this juncture, the Google Certified Data Engineer is the only real world certification for data and machine learning engineers.\nNOTE: This is NOT a course on programming Apache Beam Pipelines. This is a very targeted course on understanding how Apache Beam and Cloud Dataflow provide us with an infrastructure to build pipelines for streaming data. The course will provide the learner with the nomenclature and process understanding they'll need to pass the Certified Data Engineering Exam.\nStreaming data processing is a big deal in big data these days, and for good reasons. Businesses crave ever more timely data, and switching to streaming is a good way to achieve lower latency.\nThe massive, unbounded data sets that are increasingly common in modern business are more easily tamed using a system designed for such never-ending volumes of data.\nProcessing data as it arrives spreads workloads out more evenly over time, yielding more consistent and predictable consumption of resources.\nIn Google Cloud Platform the main tool we use for building these pipelines Cloud Dataflow. The product itself is a fusion of the code written by Google developers and that of the Apache foundation. The project that came out of that business cohabitation is Apache Beam.\nApache Beam (Batch + strEAM) is a model and set of APIs for doing both batch and streaming data processing. It was open-sourced by Google (with Cloudera and PayPal) in 2016 via an Apache incubator project.\nIn this course, we are going to learn about Apache Beam and Cloud Dataflow. While the course is an entry level course streaming will be new to many. Like most of my other courses in this series, I’ll attempt to break down more complicated topics pictorially.\n*Five Reasons to take this Course.*\n1) You Want to be a Data Engineer\nIt's the number one job in the world. (not just within the computer space) The growth potential career wise is second to none. You want the freedom to move anywhere you'd like. You want to be compensated for your efforts. You want to be able to work remotely. The list of benefits goes on.\n2) The Google Certified Data Engineer\nGoogle is always ahead of the game. If you were to look back at a timeline of their accomplishments in the data space you might believe they have a crystal ball. They've been a decade ahead of everyone.  Now, they are the first and the only cloud vendor to have a data engineering certification. With their track record I'll go with Google.\n3) The Growth of Data is Insane\nNinety percent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years. Business around the world generate approximately 450 billions transactions a day. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5 Exabytes a day. That number doubles every month.\n4) Apache Beam in Plain English\nApache Beam pipelines require basic programming skills. The Google Certified Data Engineering exam will require you are able to identify the parts of a Beam Pipeline in addition to understanding some of the vernacular and nuances behind streaming data.\n5) You want to be ahead of the Curve\nThe data engineer role is new.  While you’re learning, building your skills and becoming certified you are also the first to be part of this burgeoning field.  You know that the first to be certified means the first to be hired and first to receive the top compensation package.\nThank you for your interest in Streaming Analytics on Google Cloud Platform and we will see you in the course!!",

If you can pass the first two, you are ready to sit the final test.\nThe last three exams are harder but they'll teach you more about AWS.\nYou will get help through Udemy's Q&A discussion forum.\nI will endeavor to keep all questions up to date with the latest version of the exam.\nUdemy's mobile support is fantastic and you'll love it.\nMy exams provide a perfect opportunity for you to identify your gaps in knowledge. If you get some questions wrong, you will know which areas to revise and study. That way, you can accurately target your study time and achieve your certification quicker.\n\n\nExam Readiness\nIf you want to know whether you are ready for the actual certification exam, you should try the following:\nIf you score 80% or more on Practice Exam 1 and 2 then you are ready for the final exam.\nIf you score less, you should read our explanations and do a little more study in the areas where you were weaker.\nTo get even better at AWS and further enhance your chances, you should try Practice Exam 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\nFinal words\nI know that this stuff can be challenging but I also want you to know that you are not alone. I know that you can do this and I am here to help you. If you have any questions let me know.\n\n\nBest wishes on your AWS and certification journey,\nMike A.",

      "description": "If you’re a professional in the field of IT, IT security, audit, or general security, you know that certifications are the key to better job opportunities and higher pay. There are many available, from various sources; many of them come from manufacturers and vendors of specific products, many from certification bodies and organizations, and some from government and quasi-government sources. The certifications usually require that you pass a multiple-choice test.\nThis course is meant to help you pass these tests. It contains lists and descriptions of material usually tested, regardless of certifier or test.\n\nI have the SSCP, CISSP, CCSP, CISM, CCSK, and Security+ certifications, and used to hold the SANS GSEC. I’ve taught prep courses for most of them, and am familiar with material that shows up over and over again, on all of them. I’m not an expert in any single area of IT or INFOSEC, nor am I even all that smart....but I am good at passing multiple-choice tests, and I am told that I’m good at conveying information. So I’m offering that knowledge to you.\nI hope you find this course useful\nThis course is not a standalone product: you won’t be able to take the course and just pass the test. The course is designed for practitioners in the field: people who have trained and worked in INFOSEC for some time, who have the background and essentials to get the certifications. In addition to the course, you should be reviewing other sources (especially the sourcebook from the certifying body for the test you’re taking), including sample tests, primary sources, books, other classes, and online content. This course will show you the information you need to know, but you may have to do some additional research to get more comprehensive details about that information; I recommend Wikipedia and other online sources, because they are both exhaustive and -often- free.\n\nI hope the course helps you pass your exam and get your certification. Please let me know what you think of it, whether you think it helped your study efforts or if you know some way it could be improved. Good luck!",

      "description": "Are you gearing up for the Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals - AI-900 exam?\nThis comprehensive practice exams course is designed to give you the competitive edge you need to succeed.\nFirst of all, lets talk about this exam.\nThis exam is very easy and you do not need to be a data scientist or a machine learning expert to clear this exam. All you need to do to pass this exam is to watch any course on Udemy on AI-900 which wont be longer than 4-5 hours and then test whether you are ready for the exam or not by giving practice exams. If you prepare properly then 3 days are enough to clear this exam.\nComing to my practice tests and what makes them different from the other practice tests is that all the questions in these practice tests are very very similar to the real exam. They cant be the exact same, but i can guarantee you that if you are able to score 80% and above in my practice tests then you will be able to pass the real exam as well. And one other important thing is that i have made sure that all the answers in the 5 practice tests are 100% correct. I know how frustrating it gets when you have to doubt your understanding of a topic because of wrong answers. Rest assured it wont be the case with my practice tests.\nEach of the 5 practice tests will have 40 questions and you will get 45 mins to complete each of the practice tests. In the real exam also you will get 45 mins to complete but the number of questions can vary from 35-50.\nI would suggest you to start giving the practice test only when you have covered the complete syllabus of the exam. To complete the syllabus of the exam, follow any course on Udemy or any YouTube video or any study material that you may have for the AI-900 exam. After completing that, start giving the practice test.\n\n\nHOW TO GIVE THE PRACTICE EXAMS\nRemember, that the practice exams are to test your understanding and should not be used as a shortcut to clear the exam. You should not try to learn the answers and expect the same questions in the real exam. This wont be helpful for you at all as the purpose behind giving AI-900 exam is to learn about AI and get a better job (or maybe stop AI from taking your job).\nSo, give the practice exams with the same seriousness and integrity as you would the actual exam.\nMake sure you get 80% and above in each of the practice exam. And be sure to review the questions you answered incorrectly and read the detailed explanations provided to understand the reasoning behind the correct answers.\n\n\nABOUT THE EXAM\nThis exam will provide you with a solid foundation in artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts, and it helps you gain a comprehensive understanding of the related Microsoft Azure services, making it an excellent starting point for both technical and non-technical individuals looking to enhance their skills and advance their careers in the rapidly growing field of AI.\n\n\nAI-900 certification exam has following categories:\n\n\nDescribe Artificial Intelligence workloads and considerations (15–20%)\nDescribe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure (20–25%)\nDescribe features of computer vision workloads on Azure (15–20%)\nDescribe features of Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads on Azure (15–20%)\nDescribe features of generative AI workloads on Azure (15–20%)\n\n\nThese practice tests includes all the questions on all the categories mentioned above according to the latest guidelines provided by Microsoft on AI-900 exam.\nGo ahead and start taking the practice tests. If you score above 80% in all five practice tests, I guarantee you will pass the real exam. So, start giving the tests now!\nIf you need any assistance or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.\nHappy learning and best of luck for your Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals - AI900 exam!",

      "description": "**Course Updated - September 2022**\n\n>> COURSE REGULARLY UPDATED: NEW TIPS, MORE LESSONS <<\n\nData Science grew through our experiences with Business Intelligence BI, a field that became popular in the 1990s. However, the last 20 years have seen unprecedented improvement in our ability to take action using Artificial Intelligence. As we adopt the BI methodologies to AI deployments, how will these methodologies morph to add considerations needed for model deployment, and machine learning?\nToday’s Data Science work deals with big data. It introduces three major challenges:\nHow to deal with large volumes of data. Data understanding and data preparation must deal with large-scale observations about the population. In the world of BI on small samples, the art of data science was to find averages and trends using a sample and then project it using universal population measures such as census to project to the overall population. Most of the big data provide significant samples where such a projection may not be needed. However, bias and outliers become the real issues\nData is now available at high velocity. Using scoring engines, we can embed insights into high velocity. Data Science techniques offer significant real-time analytics techniques to make it possible. As you interact with a website or a product, the marketer or services teams can provide help to you as a user. This is due to insight embedded in high velocity.\nMost of the data is in speech, unstructured text, or videos. This is a high variety. How do we interpret an image of a driver's license and extract a driver's license? Understanding and interpreting such data is now a central part of data science.\nAs these deployed models ingest learning in real-time and adjust their models, it is important to monitor their performance for biases and inaccuracies. We need measurement and monitoring that is no longer project-based one-time activity. It is continuous, automated, and closely monitored. The methodology must be extended to include continuous measurement and monitoring.\n\n\nWhat will you need to succeed in this Exam?\n\n\nExcel, Statistics and Python knowledge is required though - you don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set (though there are refresher sections in this course!)\nNO Android, Java, Swift, or C knowledge is required!\n\nWhat does this course offer you?\n\n\nThis course consists of 2 practice tests.\nThe practice test consists of 20 questions, timed at 30 minutes\nThe questions are multiple-choice.\nEvery question is associated with a knowledge area\nThe answers are randomized every time you take a test\nOnce the test was taken, you will get an instant result report with categories of strength to weakness.\nYou can retake the tests over and over again as and when it suits you.\n\n\nI'd be very happy to welcome you to the course!",

This will help you expand your knowledge and you will be confident when you sit for any interview.\nEach scenario question has been explained and most of the questions involve real time coding and checking how things actually work instead of just telling you the correct answer. So, you won't just get to know the right answer but also understand why the answer is so.",

It was made with the right amount of questions for you to study, practice and feel comfortable to give the official on your first and only try.\n\n\nIn this exam pack you will practice how to pass the PSM I official certification exam. I think the questions were written in the same fashion Scrum-org does and with the same difficulty level.\n\n\nStop doing the free practice tests you find out there. These have be crafted and thought for you to study the best way possible to pass the exam on your first try.\n\n\nI recommend doing over and over these exams until you feel comfortable passing them with over 90%. That´s the moment you should be able to use you official attempt and pass that exam once and for all!\nPlease don´t hesitate to reach out and ask as many questions as you need. I´m here to make sure you are in the best position to give the official exam a try.  The way to pass the PSM I exam is only by doing practice exams, one after the previous one.\n\n\nThank you very much for coming in. You won´t be dissatisfied. This set of exams have been created by me personally. No AI, no robots. Its a Professional Scrum Master experienced from PSM I to PSM II to SPS and growing, passing it on to you. That´s all.\n\n\n\n\nTAMBIÉN HABLO ESPAÑOL!\n\n\n- DESCARGO DE RESPONSABILIDAD -\n\n\nESTO NO ES OFICIAL\n\n\nEste no es un paquete de examen de 1.000 preguntas. Se hizo con la cantidad adecuada de preguntas para que estudies, practiques y te sientas cómodo/a para dar el oficial en tu primer y único intento.\n\n\nEn este paquete de exámenes practicarás cómo aprobar el examen oficial de certificación PSM I. Creo que las preguntas fueron escritas de la misma manera que Scrum-org y con el mismo nivel de dificultad.\n\n\nDeja de hacer los test de práctica gratuitos que encuentras por ahí. Estos han sido diseñados y pensados para que estudies de la mejor manera posible para aprobar el examen en tu primer intento.\n\n\nRecomiendo hacer estos exámenes una y otra vez hasta que te sientas cómodo/a aprobándolos con más del 90%. ¡Ese es el momento en el que deberías poder usar tu intento oficial y aprobar ese examen de una vez por todas!\n\n\nPor favor, no dudes en comunicarse y hacer todas las preguntas que necesites. Estoy aquí para asegurarme de que estés en la mejor posición para probar el examen oficial. La forma de aprobar el examen PSM I es únicamente realizando exámenes de práctica, uno después del anterior.\n\n\nMuchas gracias por estas aquí. No quedarás insatisfecho/a.

Our practice tests have been proven to help 15,000+ students achieve their certifications.\nAll questions are crafted by cybersecurity experts and reviewed by an experienced professor. Our commitment to excellence and content quality is unparalleled.\nFEATURES & BENEFITS\n1. Authentic exam experience.\nQuestions are formatted similarly to the actual CompTIA Security+ exam, providing a genuine test-taking experience (different from CompTIA's preparatory exams and quizzes).\nPlease note: The CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 exam presents a pre-determined selection of direct, interpretation, and scenario-based practice questions that simulate real-world situations. The multiple-choice questions may offer 4, 5, or 6 answer options. Currently, our practice tests are THE ONLY AVAILABLE STUDY resource that accurately reproduces the combination of format and difficulty level of the questions found on the actual exam.\nOur practice exams also have the same number of questions, covering all the domains with the same relative weight of the official of the Security+ SY 701 exam:\nDomain 1 - General Security Concepts (12%)\nDomain 2 - Threats, Vulnerabilities and Mitigations (22%)\nDomain 3 - Security Architecture (18%)\nDomain 4 - Security Operations (28%)\nDomain 5 - Security Program Management and Oversight (20%)\n2. Detailed explanations of each question.\nFor each question you get a detailed explanation that includes references to the study material. Notably, each correct option is justified, and (very important) each incorrect choice is also justified. You will learn to explain WHY the correct answer is the right answer, as well as why the remaining options (even though they may sometimes appear similar) are wrong.\n3. High-quality and relevant questions.\nExam questions are written and reviewed by an experienced professor, and then further reviewed by Cybersecurity specialists who have taken the Security+ SY0 701 exam themselves, so as to further guarantee quality and relevance.\n4. Full control throughout the entire exam.\nPause or stop the exam whenever you like and practice on your own time, at your own pace and as many times as you want.\nPlease also check out our Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) Practice Exams on Udemy.\nTESTIMONIES\nDon't take our word for it, hear some of the many inspiring testimonies from our successful 10K+ students (from our other exam courses):\n\"I love taking the tests and having an understanding about each question and the right and wrong answers thoroughly! I will be getting more courses from this group!\" — K.S. (5 stars)\n“Great Exam Prep, Passed the exam within 15 days with the help of this. This helps you to understand your weak topics, also provide description on answers for studying. However, you don't get similar questions in the exam. (One should not expect) It helps you change your mindset and feeds the logic to your mind.” — Altaf F (5 stars)\nTAKING THE PRACTICE EXAM\nThese Practice Tests will help you get a hands-on feeling of what the real exam will be like. The only difference is that, in the real exam, Practice Based Questions are animated.\nExam duration: 90 minutes\nExam content: 77 questions (75 multiple choice questions + 2 PBQ questions) some require selecting two options\nPassing score: 750 points (on a scale of 100-900) ~ 80%\nImportant details:\nAfter passing the exam, you must adhere to CompTIA's Continuing Education (CE) program to maintain your certification;\nRetake fees apply if you need to take the exam again;\nThe exam can be taken at an authorized Pearson Vue testing center or online;\nCompTIA's training materials are available for purchase or through their official partners\nThe actual number of questions is 77 (not 75, as advertised on CompTIA's web site!)\nFOR COMPANIES\nCompTIA Security+ certifies cybersecurity skills and has become recognized all over the world after becoming a requirement for IT positions in the US Department of Defense. DON'T MISS OUT ON THE OPPORTUNITY. Get your team certified and enhance your organization's security posture and regulatory compliance while at the same time improving employee retention.\nFURTHER BENEFITS\nLifetime Access to the tests and companion material, as well as to all future updates and revisions.\nA 30-day money-back guarantee, if you are not satisfied with the quality, for whatever reason.\nDISCLAIMER\nAll our practice questions are original and maintain the same format and difficulty level as the actual exam, aligning with the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam domains. The questions and their answers are created by experts in education and cybersecurity, and then refined by student feedback. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of quality and integrity. We do not provide exam dumps.",

      "description": "**Course Updated - August 2022**\n>> COURSE REGULARLY UPDATED: NEW TIPS, MORE LESSONS <<\n\nPHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.\nPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[9] and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.\nThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.\nThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\nW3Techs reports that, as of January 2022, \"PHP is used by 78.1% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know.\" PHP version 7.4 is the most used version. Support for version 7.3 was dropped on 6 December 2021.\n\n\nAbout Course\n\n\nThe course includes 2 Practice Test builds your programming knowledge while making real-world PHP projects.\nIn this course, you’ll be exposed to fundamental programming concepts using PHP and to help you practice and test your knowledge using quizzes.\n\n\nHere's a detailed look at what you'll get:\n\nmethods\nvariables\nFunction\nif statements\nClasses and Objects\nand much much more!\n\n\nWhat will you need to succeed in this Exam?\n\nNO Android, Java, Swift, or C knowledge is required!\nPHP  basic knowledge is required though - you don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set (though there are refresher sections in this course!)\nWhat does this course offer you?\n\nThis course consists of 2 practice tests.\nThe practice test consists of 20 questions, timed at 30 minutes\nThe questions are multiple-choice.\nEvery question is associated with a knowledge area.\nThe answers are randomized every time you take a test.\nOnce the test was taken, you will get an instant result report with categories of strength to weakness.\nYou can re-take the tests over and over again as and when it suits you.\n\n\nI'd be very happy to welcome you to the course!",

Citrix is making the exam more and more tricky, and your only way to work around that and pass on the first attempt, is to study and understand Citrix Virtualization in depth, which is the core design philosophy of this course/content.\nAccording to Global Knowledge and Penton Survey Citrix Certifications were listed as top-paying certifications in the recent list. The Average Salary Reported for Citrix Certified Engineer is $104,240. So what are you waiting for Jump into this course and take your Citrix skills to a new level.\nThis is the Third Course on Citrix XenDesktop 7.15 series. Here in this course I have five different topics that I want to work through, where we begin first with PowerPoint, in helping you understand the Provisioning Services architecture. What we're doing here really does look a lot like Windows Deployment Services, or again, Symantic Ghost. But if you're not familiar with how that works I want to walk you through the ways in which Provisioning Services actually gets these operating systems streamed down from some piece of storage somewhere in the environment. Once we understand how things work there at a high level, we'll go through the installing then of Provisioning Services, as well as its underlying prerequisites. Provisioning Services has a heavy reliance there on DHCP, and in fact DHCP provides some of the configurations that your booting clients will need to connect up into your Provisioning Services infrastructure. Once we've installed Provisioning Services we'll then go about provisioning machines using Provisioning Services.This provisioning process is not terribly difficult, but does involve some work there in the PVS console, which can kind of be sometimes difficult to navigate around. And so, we'll spend some pretty detailed time in here helping to understand how that console actually gets those machines provisioned out. Yet another step, once you've provisioned those machines is updating them when it comes time for new applications or updates. The neat part here is that the update process with PVS is actually pretty slick. And then lastly, we have what will be a fairly long module here in managing the other bits of provisioning services, and specifically configuring it for high availability.\n\n\n4 Things YOU need to know about this Citrix XenDesktop Course\n\n\n#1: BRAND NEW - Recorded in 2021\n\n\n#2: HANDS-ON - The best way to learn Citrix XenDesktop is to get your hands dirty!\n\n\n#3: Designed absolutely to take you from beginner level to Expert level\n\n\n#4: FREE Practice Test - Test if you are ready for the exam",

This certification proves that the candidate has an overall understanding and in-depth technical skills to participate as a member of a project team. The scope of SAP Commerce Cloud knowledge in the courses stated within \"Topic Areas\" is narrower than the scope of knowledge checked in the certification questions. In addition to the courses stated as covering the topics within \"Topic Areas\" , as preparation for this certification exam, candidates must also study the SAP Commerce Cloud Suite documentation located at sap help portal.\nExam Preparation\nAll SAP consultant certifications are available as Cloud Certifications in the Certification Hub and can be booked with product code CER006. With CER006 – SAP Certification in the Cloud, you can take up to six exams attempts of your choice in one year – from wherever and whenever it suits you! Test dates can be chosen and booked individually.\nEach specific certification comes with its own set of preparation tactics. We define them as \"Topic Areas\" and they can be found on each exam description. You can find the number of questions, the duration of the exam, what areas you will be tested on, and recommended course work and content you can reference.\nCertification exams might contain unscored items that are being tested for upcoming releases of the exam. These unscored items are randomly distributed across the certification topics and are not counted towards the final score. The total number of items of an examination as advertised in the Training Shop is never exceeded when unscored items are used.\nPlease be aware that the professional- level certification also requires several years of practical on-the-job experience and addresses real-life scenarios.",
