Thanks\" - Angel B.\n\"These tests are super helpful for preparing. Initially I was demotivated as I was getting 55-65 in each tests but the explanations were really good. High difficulty level is what's great about these tests because CCNA was difficult too. Finally passed my CCNA, yet to receive marks though.\" - Amarjeet Sehrawat\n\"I just passed the CCNA exams. These questions really helped in preparation. At first I was not scoring good in the practice tests but for each question I missed I reviewed it extensively and researched more questions about it. This is a very good course as it covers all topics well.\" - Dennis T.\n\"Thanks for these exam sets Shaun, I just passed my CCNA and these question sets are quite instrumental to fill in the gaps.

We'll create an Azure account using a free trial, and then apply for permission to create and Azure OpenAI resource. Once that permission is generated, we'll create the resource, and deploy a GPT-3.5-turbo model (this is the technology behind ChatGPT) in the Azure OpenAI Studio.\nGenerate natural language responses by using Azure OpenAI. We'll use the GPT Chat playground to send prompts and receive responses. We will also download Visual Studio Code and write code in Python and C#.\nApply prompt engineering techniques by using Azure OpenAI. We'll improve the quality of the prompts with Primary and Supporting Content, cues, system and assistant messages, chain of thought prompting, and more, with our GPT Playground (or ChatGPT).\nGenerate and improve code by using Azure OpenAI. We'll create and amend Python, C# and SQL code, using section dividers, comments, and unit tests.\nGenerate images with DALL-E in Azure OpenAI. We'll create images based on prompts, and write code in Python and C# to generate it in our program.\nUse Azure OpenAI on your data. We'll upload PDFs into our GPT-3.5-turbo model, which will provide updated information or company documents for our GPT model to use.\nThere are several Practice Activities and quizzes throughout the course, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nBy the end of the course, you'll be much more confident about developing generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service, using GPT, ChatGPT or DALL-E.",

Domain controllers provide access to many different resources, and they contain information about users and their passwords. If a single domain controller is compromised, any objects in the same Active Directory domain or in any trusted domain are at risk of being compromised, too.\nThe Windows Server 2016 operating system provides features and apps that you can use to help secure your network against security threats. The operating system provides measures to secure domain controllers by minimizing their attack surface and determining their domain-controller placements. The operating system also determines the AD DS roles that are used for administration and design, and implements password security, in addition to auditing when attacks occur. You also can use domain controllers to deploy security measures to other clients and servers in your Windows-based infrastructure.\nAD DS administrators must understand the threats to domain controllers and the methods that they can use to secure AD DS and its domain controllers.\n\n\nObjectives\nAfter completing this module, you will be able to:\n· Secure domain controllers.\n· Implement account security.\n· Implement audit authentication.\n· Configure managed service accounts (MSAs).",

      "description": "<<The course is updated as per the skills measured on Dec 27, 2023>>\n\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU BUY MY PL-900 COURSE?\na. 140+ deeply researched questions for PL 900. I create no more than three questions/day to maintain high-quality.\nb. There are no 'What is the...', 'Which is the...\" type of one-line questions. Each question is based on your understanding of a scenario. The questions challenge you to understand, apply, and analyze your knowledge.\nc. I simulate the actual PL900 Microsoft exam experience for you in the form of single answer or multiple answer questions, statement analysis, active screen questions, drag and drop questions, build list and reorder questions and so on.\nd. Clear and lucid explanations for both correct & incorrect answers.\ne. Supporting visuals created by me to drive better understanding (Not taken from Microsoft documentation)\nf. Explanations run parallel to the product. Every detailed explanation has corroborating evidence with the Microsoft product (like Power BI or Power Apps or Power Automate or PVA) shown in screenshots and clear callouts.\ng. Explanations are NOT directly copied from Microsoft documentation. I have rephrased all the reasoning in a simple and easy-to-understand language.\nh. No step-motherly treatment of incorrect answer choices. I took enough effort to explain the rationale for each answer choice (whether correct/wrong), including the reference links.\ni. Don't worry about inaccurate sentence framing/wrong grammar/incorrect punctuations. I use Grammarly to review every question.\nj. Almost non-existent repetition of questions only to increase the question count.\nk. For some questions, you may have to search for answers in the given reference link. A Quick Preview feature shows a screenshot of the relevant paragraph to which the correct answer refers.\nl. I love to help you succeed. If you need to discuss, we have an Active Q&A dashboard and expect fast responses (save for my sleeping hours, which are generally less).\nm. As soon as there is an update from Microsoft, I try to update my course, keeping it always fresh.\nn. The question bank is peer-reviewed every three months to ensure exam relevance.\no. Still not convinced? Check out sample questions on my YouTube channel/website before you decide to buy.\n\n\nFeel free to connect with me through my website for any issues/questions.\n\n\nThe questions are collected from a variety of domains and sub-domains with extra care taken to equal attention to each exam area. Also, the questions are on different levels.\n\n\nFor example:\nRemember-level questions test whether you can recall memorized facts, & basic concepts.\nUnderstand-level questions validate whether you can explain the meanings of terms, & concepts.\nApplication-level questions test whether you can perform tasks using facts, concepts, & techniques, and,\nAnalysis-level questions validate whether you can diagnose situations & solve problems with concepts & techniques.\nA mixture of questions at different levels reinforces your knowledge and prepares you to ace the exam.\n\n\nThese are the exam

      "description": "Passing an exam is not an easy task and acing it is even more difficult and that is why we, at Certification Champs, offer Practice exams that are right from the top drawer of the top shelf.\n\n\nUPDATE: Check the Announcement section for the exam-day revision notes PDF\nThese carefully handcrafted 90 questions distributed in 2 practice tests in accordance with the Databricks exam syllabus give you an integrated feel of the actual exam. Each question is made to test one of the topics of the actual exam and gives you a detailed explanation for every question. These practice exams enable you to clear the certification in your first attempt.\n\n\nThe explanation part of the questions not only gives you an in-depth explanation but also explains the concept behind the question in detail.\nLet’s get you started with a sample question from the practice exam.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE about a Job cluster in Databricks?\nA Job cluster can be created using the UI, CLI or REST API\nMultiple users can share a Job cluster\nJob clusters can be restarted as per need\nThe Job cluster terminates when the Job ends\nJob cluster works only with Python Language notebooks\nCorrect Option: Option 4 (The Job cluster terminates when the Job ends)\n\n\nExplanation\nLet us look at the options and see which option is correct for a Job cluster.\n\n\nA Job Cluster can be created using the UI, CLI or REST API\nINCORRECT. A job cluster is created by the job scheduler when you run a job. It cannot be created using the UI, CLI or REST API.\n\n\nMultiple users can share a Job cluster\nINCORRECT. A job cluster cannot be shared between users as it is automatically created and terminated.\n\n\nJob clusters can be restarted as per need\nINCORRECT. An all-purpose cluster can be restarted as per need, but a job cluster is for one-time use only.\n\n\nThe Job cluster terminates when the Job ends\nCORRECT. As it is a one-time use cluster, it is terminated as the job ends.\n\n\nJob cluster works only with Python language notebooks\nINCORRECT. A job cluster is not confined to Python language notebooks, it can be used for other languages notebooks too.\n\n\nAs you would know, there are two types of clusters in Databricks - a Job cluster and an All-purpose cluster.\nAdditionally, let's quickly check which of the above options are valid for an all-purpose cluster.\n1. An all-purpose cluster can be created using the UI, CLI or REST API - TRUE\n2. Multiple users can share an all-purpose cluster - TRUE\n3. All-purpose clusters can be restarted as per need - TRUE\n4. An all-purpose cluster terminates when the job ends - FALSE\n5. All-purpose clusters work only with Python language notebooks - FALSE\nAlso note, that the clusters (any type) can be used with any language supported by Databricks notebooks. A cluster is not bound to a language. The same cluster can run Python code and can also be used for executing SQL statements. The clusters are not language-dependent.\n\n\nCERTIFICATION SYLLABUS\nThe certification syllabus is distributed in five sections:\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform - 11 questions i.e. 24%\nELT with Spark SQL and Python - 13 questions i.e. 29%\nIncremental Data Processing - 10 questions i.e. 22%\nProduction Pipelines - 7 questions i.e. 16%\nData Governance - 4 questions i.e. 9%\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nAlthough the passing percentage is just 70% you should consider getting at least 85% in each practice exam before going for the actual exam.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThese questions are designed by our team to give you a feel of the level of questions asked in the actual exam. We are not affiliated to Databricks or Apache.\n\n\nFor more information, you can find us on LinkedIn!\n\n\nBest of luck for your exam!",

In this course, we will be looking at a variety of different types of programs and concepts around programming.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\n\n\nWe'll start off with looking at Core Programming. We will download for free the Visual Studio Community edition, and use it to investigate the fundamental VB .Net statements. We'll look at decision structures such as If and Select Case, repetition such as For loops, While loops and recursion, and then we'll look at errors and find out how to handle them.\nWe'll then look at Object-Oriented Programming. We'll go deeper into concepts that we have already used, such as subroutines, functions and classes, and add to them using events and constructors. We'll see how you can duplicate and develop classes using inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.\nNext up is General Software Development. We'll look at various different data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues and linked lists, and we'll also look at sorting algorithms. We'll then take a step back and look at application life cycle management, and how to interpret application specifications.\nThe next thing to look at is Web Applications. We'll look at web page development using HTML, Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript. We'll then investigate ASP.NET web application development, web hosting and web services.\nThen we'll look at Desktop Applications. We will have been creating a lot of Console-based applications earlier in this course, but we'll add to this with Windows apps and Windows Services.\nWe'll finish by looking at Databases. We look at the basics of Relational Database Management Systems, look at database query methods, including the six clauses of the SELECT statement, and find out how to connect to databases from Visual Studio.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get Visual Studio for free!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of Software Development.\nSo, without any further ado, let's have a look at how you can use Udemy interface, and then we'll have a look at the syllabus for this course.",

      "description": "Are you starting your cloud journey and want to learn more about Azure AD? Are you an experienced IT Professional expanding your knowledge to include Microsoft’s cloud native identity solution? Are you interested in proving your cloud skills with one of Microsoft’s Azure certifications? Or, are you simply interested in learning how to synchronize your Windows AD identities to Azure AD? If any of the above apply, then this course is for you.\nThis course starts with the basics, an understanding of Microsoft’s different Active Directory Solutions; Windows AD, Azure AD and Azure AD Domain Services. After that, we go deep into the requirements of implementing a Hybrid Identity solution that synchronizes users and devices from Windows AD to Azure AD. We then move onto common configuration and management tasks to support a secure and reliable Hybrid Identity solution.\nThis course uses a combination of lectures to help the student comprehend key concepts followed by a hands-on lab to put the concepts in practice. The mix of lectures and labs helps the student understand concepts, and build confidence in applying the concepts in real-world situations.\nHybrid Identity with Windows AD and Azure AD is intended to give students the knowledge to implement and maintain a hybrid identity solution with Azure AD. This course can also be used as a study guide, covering the skills measured in the following exams:\nAZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals\nDescribe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features\nDefine Azure Active Directory\nDescribe the functionality and usage of Azure Active Directory\nDescribe the functionality and usage of Conditional Access, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Single Sign-On (SSO)\nAZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator\nManage Azure identities and governance\nCreate users and groups\nManage user and group properties\nManage device settings\nConfigure Azure AD join\nConfigure self-service password reset\nProvide access to Azure resources by assigning roles at different scopes\nAZ-303 Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies\nImplement Azure Active Directory\nAdd custom domains\nImplement self-service password reset\nImplement Conditional Access including MFA\nConfigure verification methods\nImplement and manage hybrid identities\nInstall and configure Azure AD Connect\nIdentity synchronization options\nConfigure and manage password sync and password writeback\nConfigure single sign-on\nConfigure Azure AD Connect cloud sync\nUse Azure AD Connect Health\nAZ-304 Microsoft Azure Architect Design\nDesign authentication\nRecommend a solution for single-sign on\nRecommend a solution for authentication\nRecommend a solution for Conditional Access, including multi-factor authentication\nRecommend a solution for a hybrid identity including Azure AD Connect, Azure AD Connect cloud sync and Azure AD Connect Health\nRecommend a solution for user self-service\nThis course requires a lab that includes a Windows AD Domain and a Windows client. There is an option to create these in your own lab environment. Alternatively, a lab can be created in Azure for the purposes of this course. In most cases, an introductory Azure credit will cover costs to run the course lab in Azure. Steps are taken in the labs to keep costs at a minimum.\nAzure AD is a global service, and impending Hybrid Identity with Azure AD requires a publicly routable domain name to locate organizational resource in the domain. A publicly routable domain name with access to external DNS is required for this course. The public domain cannot be part of an existing Azure AD tenant. Public domain names can be acquired through a registrar for a nominal fee.",

The client's data warehousing solution requires regular loading of large datasets into Redshift for complex querying, as well as periodic unloading of query results back into S3 for long-term storage and further processing. The consultant needs to ensure that these load and unload operations are performed efficiently and securely.\nWhich combination of methods should the consultant recommend to perform these operations effectively? (Select TWO)\n\n\nA) Utilize the COPY command in Amazon Redshift to parallelize data loads from Amazon S3, making use of Redshift's MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) architecture.\nB) Use the INSERT INTO command to load data from S3 to Amazon Redshift, ensuring transactions are logged for data integrity.\nC) Implement Redshift Spectrum to directly query data on Amazon S3 without loading it into Redshift, reducing data movement.\nD) Configure Redshift to automatically unload query results to S3 using the UNLOAD command, with encryption enabled for data security.\nE) Set up AWS Data Pipeline with a custom script for moving data between S3 and Redshift, allowing for complex data transformation during the transfer.\n\n\nNow take a guess. The correct answer is... [SCROLL DOWN]\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nCorrect Answers:\nUtilize the COPY command in Amazon Redshift to parallelize data loads from Amazon S3, making use of Redshift's MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) architecture.\nThe COPY command is specifically designed for bulk data loading into Amazon Redshift from Amazon S3. It takes advantage of Redshift's MPP architecture to execute fast parallel loads, which is ideal for handling large datasets efficiently.\nConfigure Redshift to automatically unload query results to S3 using the UNLOAD command, with encryption enabled for data security.\nThe UNLOAD command in Amazon Redshift is designed to export data to S3. It can perform parallel unloads, similar to the COPY command, and supports encryption to maintain data security during the transfer process.\nIncorrect Answers:\nUse the INSERT INTO command to load data from S3 to Amazon Redshift, ensuring transactions are logged for data integrity.\nThe INSERT INTO command can be used for adding data into Amazon Redshift, but it is not suitable for bulk operations. It is less efficient than the COPY command for large datasets due to the way it handles individual transactions.\nImplement Redshift Spectrum to directly query data on Amazon S3 without loading it into Redshift, reducing data movement.\nWhile Redshift Spectrum allows querying data in S3 without loading it into Redshift, this scenario specifically requires data movement for further processing, making Spectrum an auxiliary tool rather than a primary method for load/unload operations.\nSet up AWS Data Pipeline with a custom script for moving data between S3 and Redshift, allowing for complex data transformation during the transfer.\nAWS Data Pipeline is a service for orchestrating data movement, but for the specific use case of moving data between S3 and Redshift, using the native COPY and UNLOAD commands is more efficient and less complex than writing custom scripts in Data Pipeline.\nReference:\nLoading Data from Amazon S3\nUnloading Data to Amazon S3\nNote: There will be links in the actual practice exams in the reference section.",

      "description": "***The only complete CCNA project course using packet tracer on Udemy.***\n\nWhenever I finished teaching CCNA in a classroom, my students ask me to give them a full project to apply their knowledge and master their practical skills. And from there, the idea of this course came. Usually, when students study CCNA, they practice technologies in separate labs for each technology. Therefore, they feel that they are lacking practicing labs where multiple technologies interact, and depend on each other. For example, if your layer 2 technologies such as trunking and EtherChannel do not work, then your layer 3 technologies such as routing will not work. Furthermore, students want to practice labs that simulates real networks in production as much as possible. For these mentioned reasons, I have created this course so that students:\nRefresh, strengthen, and master CCNA knowledge and practical skills.\nApply CCNA knowledge in a full project that simulates real networks in production.\n\nFeel how the configuration section in the CCIE lab looks like , with many required tasks, and where multiple technologies interact and depend on each other , but at the CCNA level.\nLearn how to use techniques that speed up and ease configuration, and minimize mistakes such as using history command and notepad. These techniques are useful even when working with real projects in production.\nYou can use this course to refresh or complement your CCNA studies. Please do not depend on it alone for your CCNA studies. It is assumed that you are either finished CCNA currently or long ago, or are studying for it currently.\n\nThis course contains articles, videos, the network topology in packet tracer, files of the required tasks and complete solutions. Each task is solved in a separated video that is preceded by an article that contains a brief explanation of technology in the task, its configuration and verification. I strongly recommend reading each article before watching the companion video. Also, try to solve each task yourself first before watching the solution in the video or reading it in the solution file.\nThis course consists of six sections:\nCourse Introduction and overview: where I explain the network design and topology, and you will find the packet tracer topology, and the tasks required to be configured.\nConfiguring the Main Site: where Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies are configured to achieve full connectivity within the main site.\nConfiguring the Branches: where the branches are configured so that we achieve full connectivity within the whole network.\nConfiguring Additional Features and Security: where features that enhances the performance and security of the network are implemented.\nConfiguring Internet Connectivity: where connectivity to and from the Internet is configured securely.\nFinal Verification and Full Solutions: where final & full verification of our configuration is done and a file of the full solutions is provided.",

Topics covered in this course will include; IP configuration, Vlan and Inter-Vlan communication, the use of the IP Helper-Address, Access-List (both extended and standard), the NAT protocol and backing up the startup-configurations to a TFTP server.\nThis course is very different from the rest because It's the beginning of a new way of teaching using Smart Board Technology. (We've come along way from the traditional Whiteboard).\nThis is a fun & interactive course that will give you the knowledge to master these subjects and prepare you for the CCNA certification. (..and yes, I said fun!)\nYou will need a simulator if you want to follow along. (i.e.: Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, Boson or live equipment). The course was created with the Cisco Packet Tracer.\nPlease Note: Unfortunately, the Cisco Packet Tracer is proprietary to Cisco and it is not part of this course. So, if in any of the lectures, you hear me say that I would provide the CPT, please disregard this for I cannot provide it and it is not part of the course.\n\nDISCLAIMER:   Please note that the simulators/emulators used in this course are not part of the course. It is the students responsibility to have these to practice with. The Cisco Packet Tracer and/or VIRAL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab) are Cisco proprietary software and can only be obtained through Cisco. It is up to each student to obtain the simulator/emulator of their choice to study along with this course.\nThe course will also show students advanced configurations of the Cisco Packet Tracer Server components, DHCP, DNS and HTTP. Students will acquire and have a better understanding of the topics covered to guide them towards the CCNA or CCNAX certification.\nThis course is primarily hands on using the Cisco Packet Tracer with some lectures using the NEW & Improved Smart Board Technology. This type of course is most helpful, not only for the CCNA, but also for real world implementation of networks.\nHandouts and labs will be available to facilitate learning and practice.\nOnce the student finishes the course they will be comfortable with IP configurations, Vlans, Access-lists, and Router configuration. It will also help them in preparing for the CCNA certification so they can have an advantage and pass the exam…also, for those already in the field, it will help them to better understand the use of the topics covered so they can implement it in their prospective networks.\n(Please always check the ANNOUNCEMENTS section for new updates and events, since I am always letting you guys know of my newest and latest endeavors!)",

However, in June 2025, this Applied Skill has been retired.\nIt will also help with the Microsoft exam AI-102 \"Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution\".\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\n\n\nWhat do people like you say about this course?\nDuncan says: Excellent course, especially for beginners with Python (with previous coding experience in another language). I passed the Microsoft Assessment after this with 100%. The course doesn't give you answers word for word but rather teaches you the skills just like a good course should.\nAdam says: The instructor knocked it out of the park with this one. Sure, the concepts were pretty simple and that makes it easy, but I've seen plenty of instructors mess this up. The instruction was clear and concise and I had no problem following along.\nLi says: This is really a course that fully meets or even exceeds my expectations. The instructor explains each function in great detail, and I have to do all the exercises again. I am really lucky to be able to find this course. Yes! Recommended to you who need to use Document Intelligence!\n\n\nWhat will we do in this course?\nFirst, we’ll sign up for a free Azure subscription. Then, we’ll create a Document Intelligence resource, and use it to analyze documents. We’ll use the general-purpose read and layout models, before looking at prebuilt models such as the invoice model .\nAfter that, we’ll analyze the data using Python and C#. We connect to the Document Intelligence resource and analyse documents both on the Internet and on our computer, extracting paragraphs, tables, key value pairs, and more.\nFinally, we’ll create our own custom extraction model. We’ll upload documents into an Azure Storage Account container, train the model based on selected fields, and test it using the portal, Python and C#.\nThere are several practice activities throughout the course, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nBy the end of the course, you'll be able to analyse your own documents in the portal and using Python and C#, and perhaps even take the official Microsoft assessment.

      "description": "Do you want to learn how to launch managed Relational Databases or RDS on AWS? Do you want to learn how to connect to your RDS DB instances using Python and psycopg2 library and implement all Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations? Or do you want to learn how to implement NoSQL DynamoDB Tables on AWS and work with data from scanning, querying to update, read and delete operations?\nThen this is the course you need on RDS and DynamoDB on AWS!\nIn this course, we’ll start by taking a look at the tools and the environment that we need to work with AWS resources. We’ll be using Python 3 and as per the IDE I recommend you to use PyCharm from Jetbrains. It has a free community edition even!\nAfter I teach you how you can set up your environment on both MacOS and Windows, we’ll create our credentials for AWS as being the AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Access Key for programmatic access to AWS resources. You’ll learn how you can set your AWS credentials globally on your computers using AWS CLI. Before jumping into the implementation, for one last tip, I’ll show you how you can have auto-complete capabilities on your PyCharm IDE with PyBoto3!\nOnce we’re ready with our environment setup, we’ll start implementing our solution on AWS! And remember we’ll do everything with Python code; not a single thing manually or by hand!\nWe’ll start off with RDS or Relational Database Service from AWS. I’ll teach you how to launch your own Amazon RDS Instances purely with your Python code! Then we’ll learn how to connect to our RDS database instance using Python and psycopg2 library. After that, I’ll teach you how to execute your queries against RDS PostgreSQL using psycopg2 library and we’ll implement SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE so basically all the CRUD opreations against our own-launched RDS PostgreSQL instance on AWS!\nNext up is DynamoDB! With this very-popular NoSQL service from AWS, I’ll teach you how to create your own DynamoDB Tables on AWS with Python! You’ll learn how to provide a key schema, attribute definitions and apply throughput to your tables.\nAnd I’ll share the great news for you that there is a Local version of DynamoDB that you can simply run on your computer to play around with! I will show you how you can get and run the Local version of DynamoDB on your computer and we’ll setup our environment and boto3 client configuration accordingly.\nThen we’ll start making our way to putting new items, updating, deleting and reading them. Once we learn the basic CRUD operations with DynamoDB, we’ll move on to rather advanced operations like scanning and querying.\nWe’ll also implement a script to insert our sample data set of “movies” into our DynamoDB Movies table! Once we insert the data, we’ll start exploring how we can search it using DynamoDB query operation and we’ll also learn how we can use conditions. And finally, we’ll take a look at the scan operation which basically scans your whole data and retriveves the results you need. So to filter out the results from scan operation, we’ll apply filter expressions to our scan operation and see how things work with DynamoDB.\nLots of information, hands-on practice and experience is waiting for you in this course on AWS. So, don't miss any more time and join me in this course to sharpen your skills on AWS using Python and Boto3!",

      "description": "UPDATE - DO CHECK THE ANNOUNCEMENT SECTION. DATABRICKS NOTEBOOKS ADDED IN EACH CODE-BASED QUESTION.\n\n\nPassing an exam is not an easy task and acing it is even more difficult and that is why we, at Certification Champs, offer Practice exams that are right from the top drawer of the top shelf.\n\n\nThese carefully handcrafted 180 questions distributed in 3 practice tests in accordance with the Databricks exam syllabus give you an integrated feel of the actual exam. Each question is made to test one of the topics of the actual exam and gives you a detailed explanation for every question. These practice exams enable you to clear the certification on your first attempt.\n\n\nThe explanation part of the questions not only gives you an in-depth explanation but also explains the concept behind the question in detail. Also, each code-based question has a Databricks Notebook attached to it. You can easily import the Notebook into your Databricks account to play around the code.\nLet’s get you started with a sample question from the practice exam.\nQuestion: A query is created for sending notifications to the team when the number of pending orders is more than 100 for a manufacturing startup. The query is set to refresh every hour. For the past 10 hours, the pending_orders column returned the following values:\n120, 115, 109, 98, 67, 101, 121, 98, 79, 131\nHow many times the notification would be sent to the team if Just once is selected in the When triggered, send notification field?\n3 times\n1 time\n5 times\nNo notification will be sent\n6 times\nCorrect Option: Option 3 (5 times)\nExplanation: In the above question, Just once is selected in the When triggered, send notification field. Let us look at the status after every hour:\n120 -> Changed to TRIGGERED (Notification is sent for the first time)\n115 -> Remains in the TRIGGERED state\n109 -> Remains in the TRIGGERED state\n98 -> Changed to OK (Notification is sent for the second time)\n67 -> Remains in the OK state\n101 -> Changed to TRIGGERED (Notification is sent for the third time)\n121 -> Remains in the TRIGGERED state\n98 -> Changed to OK (Notification is sent for the fourth time)\n79 -> Remains in the OK state\n131 -> Changed to TRIGGERED (Notification is sent for the fifth time)\nThis analysis makes it clear that while using Just Once, the notification is sent to the team whenever the status is changed from OK to TRIGGERED or TRIGGERED to OK. Moreover, if the status remains in the TRIGGERED or OK state for more than one hour, the notification will be sent only for the first hour. For instance, in the first 3 hours, the status remains TRIGGERED but the notification is sent only for the first hour. Similarly, the status remains OK for the next 2 hours but the notification will be sent for the first time the state is changed i.e. in the fourth hour.\n\n\nCERTIFICATION SYLLABUS\nThe certification syllabus is distributed in five sections:\nDatabricks Tooling - 12 questions i.e. 20%\nData Processing - 18 questions i.e. 30%\nData Modeling - 12 questions i.e. 20%\nSecurity and Governance - 6 questions i.e. 10%\nMonitoring and Logging - 6 questions i.e. 10%\nTesting and Deployment - 6 questions i.e. 10%\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nAlthough the passing percentage is just 70% you should consider getting at least 85% in each practice exam before going for the actual exam.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThese questions are designed by our team to give you a feel of the level of questions asked in the actual exam. We are not affiliated with Databricks or Apache. All the screenshots added to the answer explanation are not owned by us. Those are added just for reference to the context.\n\n\nFor more information, you can find us on LinkedIn!\n\n\nBest of luck for your exam!",

These 6 full-length practice exams with 90 questions (including simulation-style questions or PBQs as CompTIA calls them) are timed for 90 minutes to help you pace yourself for the real exam. I have carefully hand-crafted each question to put you to the test and prepare you to pass the certification exam with confidence.\n\nYou won't be hoping you are ready, you will know you are ready to sit for and pass the exam. After practicing these tests and scoring an 90% or higher on them, you will be ready to PASS on the first attempt and avoid costly re-schedule fees, saving you time and money.\n\nYou will receive your total final score, along with feedback on each and every question, telling you exactly why each answer is correct, and which domain (and objective) you need to study more in order to pinpoint the areas in which you need to improve and perform some additional study.\n\n\nThis course is designed to help prepare you for the CompTIA Linux+ (XK0-005) certification exam and covers all four domains of the Linux+ (XK0-005) certification exam:\n\nSystem Management (32%)\nSecurity (21%)\nScripting, Containers, & Automation (19%)\nTroubleshooting (28%)\n\n\nOur CompTIA Linux+ (XK0-005) practice exams provide you with realistic test questions and provide you with interactive, question-level feedback.\n\nI have some of the highest-rated CompTIA training courses on the Udemy platform and I invite you to visit my instructor profile to learn more about me, the certifications that I hold, and read the reviews of my courses. This course is consistently updated to ensure it stays current and up-to-date with the latest release of the CompTIA Linux+ exam, and also provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked!\n\nWhat others are saying about my CompTIA practice exam courses:\n\nThe questions were tough and it took me about 3 times for each test to reach 100%. I hope they are like the test... Really hope. Great training resources because the explanations are very useful. (Rick, 5 stars)\n\nGreat tests that provide something close to the scenario-based questions that the exam will show (it's hard as Udemy's platform isn't designed to allow them properly) Diverse questions. Really good explanations. Great learning tool for passing the test as the exams cover a lot off! (Aimee, 5 stars)\n\nThis course of practice exams has some good concept reinforcing questions and does a good job of rotating/varying the types of questions asked. Highly recommend if preparing for the certification exam. (Matthew, 5 stars)\n\nThese questions are unique and well-conducted to prepare for the exam with relevant information. I am using multiple resources and this is definitely one to have. (Valdrin, 5 stars)\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will earn 6 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",

CompTIA Security+, in particular, says that a candidate understands basic cybersecurity concepts and can perform cybersecurity tasks. When you're new to the field, this certification proves you have this knowledge when you have little experience. The CompTIA Security+ certification tops Global Knowledge's list of top-paying certifications because it's a vendor-neutral certification that will help you land many well-paid, entry-level jobs. Once you have several years of experience in IT security it will be more important than certification.\nWhat skills are assessed in Security+?\nThe CompTIA Security+ exam (SY0-701) tests the applicant's basic knowledge to perform IT security tasks and work in cybersecurity. Applicants will demonstrate skills in assessing the security of an enterprise environment, finding security flaws, and implementing solutions to improve security. They will also need to know how to monitor and secure cloud, mobile and IoT environments. The exam will test knowledge of and ability to follow governance, risk and compliance principles. Candidates who pass CompTIA Security+ certification will also be able to identify, monitor and respond to a security-related incident in the corporate IT environment. CompTIA Security+ is an entry-level certification and the first certification an IT security candidate must earn.\nWhat areas does the CompTIA Security Exam cover?\nThe CompTIA Security+ exam is a vendor-neutral exam that tests applicants' knowledge of IT security and their ability to perform key security functions. About 20% of the questions will cover threats, vulnerabilities and attacks. Applicants must understand the various types of compromises and understand penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. An equal portion of the test will cover the technologies and tools a security professional will use to perform their security tasks. Then, about 16% of the test will be questions that test a candidate's knowledge of identity and access management. Approximately 15% of the exam will cover secure network concepts, architecture and design. The remainder of the exam will validate the applicant's knowledge of risk management best practices, cryptography, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).\nWhat are some careers using CompTIA Security+?\nCompTIA Security+ certification is the industry standard for testing the minimum skills an IT security professional needs on the job. This certification complies with ISO 17024 standards and meets the requirements of the Department of Defense directive 8140/8570.01-M. This certification covers the role of junior IT auditor/penetration tester. Another job title a Security+ holder may pursue is system administrator, whose responsibilities include maintaining user accounts and access that requires corporate security knowledge. Network administrator and security administrator jobs may also require applicants to be CompTIA Security+ certified. Of course, any hiring manager looking to fill positions involving IT security, such as a security professional, security consultant or security engineer will likely consider the Security+ certification as a bonus.\nIs the CompTIA Security+ worth it?\nCertifications tell hiring managers that potential hires have the necessary skills to perform specific tasks and can save time spent on training. Specifically speaking, the CompTIA Security+ says that a candidate understands basic cybersecurity concepts and can perform cybersecurity tasks. When you are new to the field, this certificate proves you have this knowledge when you have little experience. The CompTIA Security+ certification ranks high on Global Knowledge's list of top-paying certifications because it is a vendor-neutral certification that will help you get many well-paying, entry-level jobs. Once you have a few years of experience working in IT security, it will count for more than the certification.\nWhat are the skills evaluated in Security+?\nThe CompTIA Security+ exam (SY0-501) tests that the applicant has a basic knowledge to perform IT security tasks and work in the cybersecurity field. Applicants will demonstrate their ability to assess the security of an enterprise environment, find security flaws, and implement solutions to improve security. They will also need to know how to monitor and secure cloud, mobile, and IoT environments. The exam will test knowledge of the principles of governance, risk, and compliance and the ability to follow those principles. Applicants that pass the CompTIA Security+ certification will also be able to identify, track, and respond to a security-related incident in the enterprise IT environment. The CompTIA Security+ is an entry-level certification and is the first certification an IT security candidate should earn.\nWhat types of places hire people with a Security+ certifaciton?\nJust about any business that requires IT staff to manage the software, applications, and infrastructure necessary to keep the business running are looking for security professionals that have a CompTIA Security+ certification. Because this certification meets the Department of Defense standards for security professionals, a Security+ professional can find a job working for a government agency, for laboratories that do work for the government, and for other companies that have government contracts. Other businesses looking for penetration testers, systems administrators, network administrators, and security administrators that are Security+ certified include major tech companies, state universities, healthcare companies, and insurance companies.\nWhat skills or experience do I need before pursuing the CompTIA Security+ certifaction?\nThe CompTIA Security+ certification is an entry-level certification for information technology security professionals, so it is the first certificate a candidate on the CompTIA+ cybersecurity career path should take. Although this is an entry-level certificate, there are some things you should know to ensure you can succeed at taking the Security+ exam. You should have a fundamental knowledge of computer and networking concepts. It will also help if you already have the CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications or equivalent knowledge. You should have some on-the-job experience in the IT field as well. It is recommended that you have six to nine months of networking experience and two years of IT administration experience before you take the exam.\nWhat domains are covered in the CompTIA Security+ exam?\nThe CompTIA Security+ exam is a vendor-neutral exam that tests applicants' knowledge of IT security and their ability to perform core security functions. Around 20% of the questions will cover the topics of threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. Applicants will have to understand various types of compromise and understand penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. An equal portion of the test will cover the technologies and tools a security professional will use to accomplish security tasks. Next, about 16% of the test will be questions that test a candidate’s knowledge of identity and access management. Around 15% of the exam will cover secure network concepts, architecture, and design. The remaining portion of the exam will validate an applicant's knowledge of risk management best practices, cryptography, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).\nWhat are some careers that use CompTIA Security+?\nThe CompTIA Security+ certification is the industry standard for testing the minimum skills that an IT security professional needs on the job. This certificate complies with ISO 17024 standards and meets the directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements of the Department of Defense.

Another job title an applicant with a Security+ might pursue is system administrator, whose responsibilities include maintaining user accounts and access, which requires a knowledge of enterprise security. Network administrator and security administrator jobs may also require that applicants have CompTIA Security+ certification.

Definitely recommend this course!\"\nSelim says: \"I had the opportunity to get detailed information about Azure Files and Azure Blob Storage. By going through the examples, I did not become confused. Everyone's learning method is different, I learn more easily by first learning with examples and then building on what I have learned by listening to the topics explained in detail in different videos. It was a good explanation, thank you. I can go over the practical activities one more time and now I can take the exam. Thanx\"\nSanjeev says: \"Very good introduction to azure storage!\"\n\n\nIn this 2½ hour course we’ll cover the skills that you need for the APL-1003 Microsoft Applied Skills credential for Power Automate.\nThe tasks that you need to perform to get this skill are:\nCreate and configure a storage account. We'll quickly creating a storage account and a container and upload a file. Then we'll look in some detail at storage account configuration, both when creating the storage account and after it has been created.\nCreate and configure Blob Storage. We'll look at blob access tiers, lifecycle management, soft delete and versioning for blobs, together with Shared Access Signatures.\nCreate and configure Azure Files. This allows you to create directories and putting your files into these folders.\nConfigure encryption. We'll look at how you can change the encryption key, and configure infrastructure encryption and encryption scopes.\nConfigure networking for storage. We'll look at how your storage account can interact with Virtual Networks.\nWe’ll go through several practical examples, so you can see how you can secure your own containers\nBy the end of the course, you'll be much more confident about using securing Azure Files and Blob Storage and perhaps even take the official Microsoft assessment. That would look great on your CV or resume.",

      "description": "From this course, you can learn everything you need to know to pass Oracle Certifications 1Z0-819, 1Z0-809 & 1Z0-817.\nThere are a lot of other courses on this topic. So, why would you choose exactly this course?  Here are just a few reasons:\n\n- Coding examples\nTo learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.\n\n- Open source code\nWe hide nothing from our students! Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.\nYou are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.\n\n- Q&A support\nThe significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer.\nIn this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue.\nSo with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh? :) ), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course.\n\n- Relevant knowledge\nAfter our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!\nThe instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha.\nWith this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT consultants in the world.\n\n- Free mobile App without limits for our students\nKnowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :) Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes.\nIn this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms)\nThe instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview.\nAlso, only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.\n\n- High concentration of useful material in each lesson\nSometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson.\nThis is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes 10 times as much (sometimes even 20) as the final lesson duration after video editing.\nAlso, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered.\nGo and try it yourself! We will appreciate your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nSo don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts!\nBuy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE!\nFor those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup? In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation!\nHope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better! Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever!\nSee you at the lessons! :)",

It's also one of the hardest testing your knowledge and hands-on experience configuring and troubleshooting topics such as:\nIPv6 addressing\nConfiguring VLANs\nApplying IPv4 access lists\nConfiguring OSPF and static routes\nUnderstanding Cloud Computing models\nSecuring routers and switches\nConfiguring DHCP, DNS and NTP\nUnderstanding WAN technologies\nConfigure Wireless LANs\nUnderstand Quality of Service (QoS)\nExplain Network Automation concepts such as APIs and CRUD\nIn order to pass the exam you must know the theory very well but also have high level hands-on skills. The element most students forget it drilling their knowledge with a ton of practice exams. Practice exams help you learn to apply theory to questions as well as expose weak areas in your knowledge.\nThe CCNA exam currently costs around $300. It consists of around 50 multiple choice questions as well as several hands-on lab scenarios. The pass mark is around 85%. The pass rate is only 50% which means that half of the students taking it walk out of the exam feeling dejected and of course $300 worse off.\nIf you combine practice exams with reading and hands-on lab time you greatly increase your chances of passing the exam. Let me help you by testing you on all the latest CCNA exam topics. I hit you with subjects from all exam areas and for many of the questions I give you explanations and tips to increase your understanding.\nThere are six practice exams in total, broken into various CCNA syllabus topics. There are over 430 exam style questions in total. Take the exams as many times are you wish and when you are getting around 95% every time you know you are ready for the real thing. I've been prepping students for their CCNA exams since 2002, let me help you too.\nSee you on the inside.\nPaul Browning",

We took a lot of time preparing, testing, writing, practicing, and reviewing them. We more than welcome any and every feedback and comment.\nAll questions and answers are designed and tested using the latest Jira Software Cloud Standard and Premium versions.\nAlmost all questions have explanations for correct and incorrect answers.\nAll questions have references to the official Atlassian Documentation and/or Community.\nAll questions were designed by Atlassian Certified Experts, among which some are also Atlassian Community Champions.\nAll our instructors got more than 90% in this ACP-120 certification on their first attempt.\nAll questions will be regularly updated since Atlassian continuously updates the exam topics.\n\n\nAccording to Atlassian, \"In a 2019 survey, 80% of Atlassian Certified professionals reported their credential boosted their earning power.”\n\n\nACP-120 / ACP-JCA Exam details:\nNumber of questions: According to Atlassian, up to 75 questions\nPassing score: 63%\nExam time: 180 minutes (3 hours)\nPrice : $250 + tax\nWhere to schedule your exam: Online by going to the Atlassian University Website\nAtlassian Products covered: Jira Software Cloud (including Automation). Pay attention: The new administration portal is included. I would also recommend a broad knowledge of other Atlassian products, especially Atlassian Access, Jira Service Management Cloud, Jira Work Management Cloud, and Confluence Cloud.\nExam Location: Online or at Testing centers\nPermitted test aids:\nA hard copy of English or English Translation Dictionary (allowed both online or at testing centers)\nPencil/Pen and Paper (allowed at testing centers only, and must be supplied by the testing center)\nWater in a clear container\nValidity: Your Certification will be valid for 24 months.

According to Stackoverflow’s 2020 survey, TypeScript is the 2nd most loved programming language in the world (it was 3rd most loved in 2019) - clearly showing that the increase in popularity is quite astounding.\nTypeScript (developed by Microsoft) is an open-source programming language that compiles into JavaScript. Since its release in 2012, the language has remained in active development and is gaining popularity and recognition every year.\nThe development community strongly associated TypeScript with Angular in the early days but now you can use it with practically anything like ReactJS, Node.js, Deno etc.\nIs it too late to start learning TypeScript now?\nWell, it is never too late if you start TODAY! Gain an advantage by being the one among those who really understand TypeScript and not just treats this as a college project.\nTypeScript & JavaScript are the same right? NO!\nWhile TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript; it means TypeScript eventually gets compiled into JavaScript, so they are not the same.\nThe main benefit of TypeScript is its static typing feature that provides additional information about your code which serves as better documentation for other developers and enables them to catch more mistakes during compilation right away.\nThe language is modern with features like interfaces, unions, intersection types, enums, classes, and visibility scopes. Additionally, because it is a superset, it has all the modern JavaScript features like destructuring, arrow functions and optional chaining operators too.\nThis course is just not about the basics, I will take you to advanced levels with practical real-world interview questions which will help you to understand the concept and also answer properly at the same time.\nWhat's in the course?\nLike all my courses, we have sections packed with beginner to advanced level content, so it is advised to check the full course curriculum first to get a clear idea of all the topics and then start step by step. Here's a quick summary of what you'll find in the course:\nIntroduction\nTypeScript fundamentals\nArray & Tuple\nFunctions\nENUM\nObject Oriented TypeScript\nTypeScript compiler\nInterface\nDecorators\nTypeScript Modules & Namespaces\nI recommend that you have a good understanding of OOPs concepts and basic JavaScript before continuing on with this tutorial, so as to make the most of it. If you have any JavaScript-related questions, feel free to check out my JavaScript course.\nTake action today and enroll in this comprehensive course.",

Beyond that, questions tend to become repetitive, adding less value.\nNot all TOGAF Series Guides are equally important. Below are the top 3 guides most frequently mentioned during the TOGAF's exam:\nA Practitioners’ Approach to Developing Enterprise Architecture Following the TOGAF® ADM\nIntegrating Risk and Security within a TOGAF® Enterprise Architecture\nUsing the TOGAF® Standard in the Digital Enterprise\nWe asked about the types of questions they most frequently encountered in the part 2 exam. From this, we created a list of 20 question types found in the TOGAF Part 2 exam. For each type, we developed an exclusive step-by-step method to help you find the correct answer on the first try.\nThousands of students have successfully passed the TOGAF exam with the help of these practice tests. Here are a few testimonials:\n\"Hello James, I wanted to thank you for your UDEMY course which helped me achieve my TOGAF certification. I look forward to following more of your advice as I advance my career.\"\n— Senior Consultant, Deloitte\n\"The practice tests were extremely helpful in understanding the expectations for the TOGAF exams.

The structure, explanation, and depth of the questions helped me think critically, especially when selecting the most accurate answer. Additionally, the TOGAF Part 2 questions simulate real-world use cases, preparing me to apply the TOGAF framework in practice. This preparation allowed me to pass my TOGAF certification.\"\n— Siyabonga, SAP Consultant, South Africa\nWho Should Enroll:\nAnyone looking to pass the TOGAF 10 Part 2 exam\nEnterprise Architects\nIT Professionals\nPrerequisites:\nFamiliarity with Enterprise Architecture Concepts: A solid understanding of enterprise architecture principles and the TOGAF framework is required.\nCommitment to Learning: Be prepared to actively engage in course activities, including quizzes and practice exams.\nThis course has been developed under the commercial license of EA Consulting France.",

Excel is a part of Microsoft Office suite and is compatible with other applications within the Office suite.\nExcel is most commonly used for storing, organizing, and manipulating data along with visualization of data in the form of charts and graphs. Excel is popularly used across all industries, domains, academic institutions, businesses, and for accomplishing personal tasks such as managing home budget and financial analysis.\nExcel features the ability to perform basic to advanced calculations, use graphing tools, create pivot tables and create macros. It essentially uses a collection of cells arranged into rows and columns to organize and manipulate data. This information can then be displayed as charts, histograms and line graphs.\nExcel permits users to arrange data so as to view various factors from different perspectives. VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is used for programming in Excel, allowing users to create a variety of complex numerical methods. Programmers are given an option to code directly using the Visual Basic Editor, including Windows for writing code, debugging and code module organization.\nThis Microsoft Excel Training by Uplatz provides a deep-dive into the world of Microsoft Excel and prepares you well for data and analysis related jobs.\n\n\nThe main uses of MS Excel include:\nData entry & management\nData manipulation & calculations\nAccounting & financial analysis\nVisualization & charts\nProgramming\nTime management\nProject management\nData modeling & analytics\nForecasting\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM)\nAlmost anything that needs to be stored/managed/organized!\n\n\nMicrosoft Excel course curriculum\nIntroduction to Microsoft Excel\nKey in Data\nFont and Alignment\nCut, Paste, Format Painter\nCtrl + Keys\nHome Tab and Clipboard\nFile Tab\nSorting & Filtering\nFormulas - General, Financial, Logical, Text, Date & Time, Statistical, Array, more\nDynamic Formulas\nVLookup & HLookup\nPivot Tables\nCharts & Graphs\n\n\nWhy Should I Learn Microsoft Excel?\nWe all deal with numbers in one way or the other. We all have daily expenses which we pay for from the monthly income that we earn. For one to spend wisely, they will need to know their income vs. expenditure. Similarly, a business needs to record and analyze the daily transactions and determine the monthly sales and profit. Educational and government institutions need to maintain a whole lot of data about people, cities, planning work, tenders, contracts, and so on.\nMicrosoft Excel comes in handy when we want to record, analyze and store such numeric or textual data.\n\n\nWhere can I get Microsoft Excel?\nThere are number of ways in which you can get Microsoft Excel.

      ],
      "description": "Welcome! I'm here to help you to master the basics of Cloud computing on AWS.\n\n-- Please read carefully --\n\nThis course is primarily intended for beginners who have NO experience with Cloud computing and/or AWS.\n\nI want to help YOU master the basics of Cloud computing and AWS.\nThe Cloud Computing on AWS: Ultimate Beginners course has been structured in a simple and logical order. Everything that has been designed from the styling to the graphics and topics covered is crafted with the absolute duty of care towards the student.\n\n\nThis course is intended for complete beginners to AWS and it will cover various topics to help you to build a solid foundation:\n\nCloud computing Introduction\nWe will start the course off very slowly by learning general IT concepts, and then we will slowly transition into the field of cloud computing. Here we will learn what cloud computing is and how it solves the problem of traditional IT. Moreover, we will examine the various cloud deployment models and types of cloud computing that are available.\n\n\nIntroducing AWS - Key theoretical concepts\nOnce we have a fundamental knowledge of what cloud computing is, and how it is applied to our lives. We will begin to look at the key theoretical concepts that are associated with AWS. In terms of AWS regions, VPC's, Availability Zones and Subnets. These are all important pieces of terminology that are needed to understand the basic eco-system of AWS.\n\n\nIdentity and Access Management - IAM\nIAM is a service that enables you to manage user identities and control access to AWS resources. It allows you to create and manage users, groups, and roles, defining their permissions through policies. With IAM, we will be able to enhance the security of your AWS infrastructure and ensure that only authorized individuals and applications can access your resources.\n\n\nAWS setup and configuration\nIn this section we will create an AWS account, explore the AWS management console, and setup a designated budget to manage and track our costs.\n\n\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2\nAWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to quickly provision virtual servers, known as instances, with a variety of operating systems and configurations. We will learn how to launch our very first EC2 instance, how to change instance states, manage our security groups, and how to build our very own AMI (Amazon Machine Image).\n\n\nScalability and High Availability\nWhen it comes to cloud computing. Two very important terms are scalability and high availability. Scalability focuses on the ability to handle growth and increased workload efficiently, while availability focuses on ensuring uninterrupted service and minimizing downtime by eliminating single points of failure and implementing redundancy.\n\nElastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling\nIn this section we will learn how to create an application load balancer, and how to also setup an auto-scaling group which will allow us to automatically add and remove EC2 instances based on our preferences.\nElastic Load Balancing is a service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, improving availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. Auto Scaling is a feature that automatically adjusts the number of instances in a resource group or fleet based on defined conditions, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.\n\n\nCloud Storage services\nAmazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS, so we will learn how to work with buckets and objects, how to create a bucket policy, host a static website and so much more. Additionally, we will learn about how to work with EBS volumes and explore additional storage services, such as EFS and EC2 instance store.\n\n\nDatabases\nDatabases are crucial to storing and maintaining our data. Amazon RDS is a relational database service that we can utilize to create popular databases, such as PostgreSQL and MySQL. For those that are interested in NoSQL services, we will delve into DynamoDB.\n\n\nDeployment on AWS\nDeployment is always a popular topic, we will therefore explore services such as CloudFormation which will help us to create infrastructure as code. For developers who simply want to upload their code without the stress of handling infrastructure, we will look at Elastic Beanstalk. And of course, for those interested in the DevOps side of things, we will explore the typical CI/CD approach with AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline and so much more.\n\n\nDNS services and content delivery\nAWS Route 53 is a popular service that is used for managing our DNS records, and so we will use it for registering a domain name. Additionally, a domain name is always coupled with an SSL/TLS certification, so we will use Amazon Certificate Manager for that. In terms of content delivery we will look at how we can improve the perform of our applications by utilizing CloudFront and AWS Global Accelerator.\n\nContainers on AWS and Serverless computing - [Theory]\nDocker is an important tool for all developers. So we will learn a bit more about how we can manage docker containers on AWS, and utilize serverless computing in the form of AWS Lambda.\n\n\nMonitoring the cloud\nOnce our application is running on AWS, it's important that we know how to monitor it in terms of analyzing metrics, evaluating the health of our services, and setting up a CloudTrail of events.\n\n\nCloud application Integration\nIf a certain event occurs on AWS, it would be great to receive a notification of what is going on. Therefore we will learn about the Amazon Simple Notification service. In addition to this we will learn how to create a queue with SQS and reflect on how it can be used with our applications.\n\n\nSecurity and encryption\nSecurity is a hot topic right now so we will explore key theoretical concepts and also evaluate the AWS services which we can use to encrypt our EBS volumes, and utilize to better protect our applications.\n\n\nAnalytics\nSince this is a beginners course, we wont go into heavy detail with the analytics services that are part of AWS. So, a basic theoretical approach will be more than sufficient.\n\n\nOther services\nA few bonus services will be included in this course. Such as how to store secrets with AWS Secret Manager, and how to utilize machine learning with Amazon Rekognition.\n\n\nExtra course information:\n\n\nIt covers all the basic topics that a new beginner to AWS and cloud computing is expected to know and be aware of.\nIt is mixed with theory and practical hands-on demonstrations.\nThe course is structured in a logical and cohesive way - not just random slides plastered everywhere.\nIt starts off very simple and then builds on gradually throughout the course.\nYou will also learn 30 + AWS services\nThis course is jam-packed with lecture slides, PDF walkthroughs, code snippets/references and comes along with the full project source code - as a zip file.\nAll 400 + slides are available as a downloadable PDF.\n\nThe Cloud Computing on AWS: Ultimate Beginners Course is a highly practical course and allows you to apply your knowledge.\n\n\nYour instructor:\nMy name is Arno Pretorius. I'm a qualified IT teacher who has taught programming both in-person and online. My main passions are teaching and technology, so I thought why not just combine the best of both worlds to create something truly amazing and valuable. Over the years, I have created and deployed many real-world Django-based applications, including a job portal for university graduates and an exclusive social network.\nI'm a Software developer, an AWS Solutions Architect and Developer associate. I have a keen interest in cloud computing, web development and everything that relates to programming and technology.\nSo, let's go and become fluent in AWS.\nTrust me you are in good hands!\n\n\nThis course also comes with:\n- 13 + hours of on-demand video\n- Full lifetime access\n- A Udemy certificate of completion\n- 11 downloadable resources\n- Access on mobile and TV\n\n\nJoin me in this course if you want to master the basics of Cloud computing on AWS and kick-start your career in cloud computing.",

We believe that only a student who understands the why of fundamentals can become a good developer so If you desire to learn JavaFX the right way and how to apply it in a real-world application beyond the basics, then we believe this is the course for you.\nA few things you will learn in this course:\n- JavaFX architecture and execution cycle.\n- How to use a project management tool to manage your application's lifecycle.\n- Different ways to design JavaFX applications.\n- How to customize and style controls and layouts.\n- Best design patterns and data structures frequently used in JavaFX.\n- How to create data persistence with databases.\nWhy would you learn JavaFX?\nThe truth is there probably are more reasons to learn JavaFX than one can count, but the one I usually give is simply because one is curious. JavaFX has come a long way and as such has seen a multitude of applications even on mobile and will continue to be widely used even in the face of a growing shift to internet-based applications. However, with all that being said perhaps the biggest impact it can have on new students is to broaden their knowledge of Java and programming at large while also serving as an important addition to one's resume and portfolio.",

It is the students responsibility to have these to practice with. The Cisco Packet Tracer and/or VIRAL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab) are Cisco proprietary software and can only be obtained through Cisco. It is up to each student to obtain the simulator/emulator of their choice to study along with this course.\n\nStudents will get a thorough understanding of switching and how we would implement it in a real world environment.\nWe will discuss the following concepts switching services and rules we should follow when segmenting networks. We will also compare bridging vs. LAN switching focusing in great detail on the Spanning-tree protocol. We will look at the switch Functions at layer two, such as how a switch learns about the nodes on the network and how it makes its decisions to forward the information and most definitely how to secure our ports on the switches.\nOnce get an understanding of how switches work and their administrative configurations we will then go into explain and creating vlans and inter-vlan connectivity and what would be the benefits of using VLANs on our network. You will learn the different port types and encapsulation methods we use when using vlans, and will fully understand the difference between trunking a port and the VTP protocol.\nThis is a lecture based course using the Touch-IT Technology Smart board, which will make learning very interactive and engaging. Hands on labs will be used to drill down the concepts learned in each lecture using Cisco’s Packet Tracer.\nMy method will make you feel like you are sitting in a classroom environment and give the most needed hands on experience!\nHandouts will be available to facilitate learning and practice.\nThis course will help the student become familiar with layer 2 switching and vlans and how to implement them in your environment…but it will also help in preparing for any networking certification or Computer Science Degree; not to mention the fact that for those already in the field, it will further improve routing decisions in their particular networks.",

The content goes into great detail for the exam. Passed on my first try with this plus a video course. (Eric S., 5 stars)\nIt's good that it's a bit harder than the actual exams. The PBQs were somewhat different than the exam, but similar enough to give you enough information on what to expect. Would recommend, helped me pass at 760+ first attempt. (Habib F., 5 stars)\nI passed the Network+ exam on my first attempt yesterday. I used these exams and the full course for my studies. The exams cover 99.99% of the real CompTIA Network+ test. I was not surprised by all the questions in the real CompTIA Network+ exam because Jason Dion's materials cover them all. (Man H., 5 stars)\nThese practice exams were integral in my preparations to pass the Net+ exam. If you are serious about passing the exam, I cannot recommend these enough. (Brandon W., 5 stars)\nThese tests are perfect to test your skills. Personally, I thought they had harder questions than the actual CompTIA test. I highly recommend. (Bronson P., 5 stars)\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will earn 9 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA Tech+, A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",

      "description": "Advanced Routing, Switching and Services networking course provides you with the skills and knowledge to implement and troubleshooting for advanced routing technologies and services, including – Layer 3 services, Infrastructure security, Infrastructure services, L2 services etc. This course will provide you the knowledge and skills you need to install, configure, operate, and troubleshoot an enterprise network. This networking course helps prepare you to upskill yourself for day to day networking tasks as a Network Engineer.\nIf you want to start earning more while doing what you love, well then this course is perfect for you. Even if you have knowledge of creating networks or knowing different communication tools, still this course will teach you everything in depth you need to know about hubs, switches, networking, routers, etc.\nThe course has multiple modules which will enhance your knowledge in the particular technologies and features:\n\n\nSwitching : The switching course has everything you need to know about switches. How switches learn MAC addresses, what VLANs and trunks are and how spanning-tree is used to create loop-free topologies. You will also learn more complex topologies like SDM, CEF etc.\n\n\nSpanning Tree : When you add redundancy in your switched network, you add potential loops. Spanning-tree is used on switches to create a loop-free L2 topology. In these lessons you will learn the basics of spanning-tree and the different versions: PVST, RPVST, and MST.\n\n\nEIGRP : EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is Cisco’s IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) that was made an “open standard” in 2013. It is a distance vector routing protocol similar to RIP but has many advanced features. In these lessons, we start with the basics of EIGRP and end with the most advanced topics.\n\n\nOSPF : OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a popular link-state routing protocol. Routers exchange pieces of information called LSAs (link state advertisement) and build a topology database which we call the LSDB (link state database). In these lessons, we start with the basics and work our way through the most advanced OSPF topics.\n\n\nBGP : BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the routing protocol of the Internet, used to route traffic from one autonomous system (AS) to another. It’s an important topic to understand if you work at an ISP or at a large company that is connected to two or more ISPs. Unlike IGPs like OSPF or EIGRP, BGP uses a set of attributes to determine the best path for each destination.\n\n\nIPv6 : IPv6 is the successor of IPv4 and the main reason we need it is because we are running out of IPv4 address space. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses and offered us about 4.3 billion addresses, IPv6 offers 128-bit addresses so we have a huge amount of available addresses. These lessons will explain the basics of IPv6 and how to configure it on Cisco IOS routers.\n\n\nIP Services: All about the different Load Balancing protocols to achieve high availability e.g NHRP, VRRP and GLBP etc.\n\n\nStatic Routing Concepts : Deep dive in the logic of Static Routing so that you understand the basic building blocks of networking.\n\n\nDefault Routing : This course will make you understand the topics from a packet level, so that trouble shooting becomes a fun part for you.\n\nWe will be continuously uploading more and more sections and lectures to this course.\nTargeted course duration is 50 hours plus content.\n\n\n[Updated on 17-08-2022]\nUploaded Access Control Lists ACL section:\n\n\n[Updated on 18-08-2022]\nUploaded Network Address Translation section:\n\n\n[Updated on 17-09-2022]\nUploaded L2 Switching Concepts section:\n\n\n[Updated on 17-09-2022]\nUploaded Inter-Vlan Routing section:\n\n\n[Updated on 18-09-2022]\nUploaded Spanning Tree Protocol Basics section:\n\n\n[Updated on 18-09-2022]\nUploaded Etherchannel / Port-Channel / Link Aggregation section:\n\n\n[Updated on 28-10-2022]\nUploaded DHCP-Server / DHCP-Relay Agent Section:\n\n\n[Updated on 28-10-2022]\nUploaded Securing your Switch in the Network\n\n\n[Updated on 03-02-2023]\nUploaded Section \"IP Services - HSRP, VRRP & GLBP\"\n\n\n[Updated on 12-08-2023]\nNew Section Added: \"IPSec VPN on Cisco IOS\"",

It starts off as a beginner beginner level course, but it then very quickly transitions to intermediate and advanced topics\n- Getting your hands dirty - If you're itching to actually start using Kubernetes then this course gives you every opportunity to follow along.\n- Watch Kubernetes in Action - This Udemy medium is perfect for showing you how to use Kubernetes rather than going through Powerpoint presentations. That's why in this course, I'm going to Powerpoint presentations to an absolute minimum.\n\n\nI'll be performing all of the demos on a Apple Macbook. However most of the commands I'll use will work irrespective of whether you're using a Mac, Linux, or Windows workstation. The main difference being the initial workstation setup. For most of this course I'll use an instance of Kubernetes that's running locally on my Macbook. I'll also cover how to set up a kubernetes cluster in the cloud.  The demos I'll show will work just as well on a local workstation as well as a proper production cloud provisioned Kubernetes cluster.\n\n\nThis is a follow along hand-on Kubernetes course. By the end of this course you will be able to:\nCreate your own Kubernetes environment running on your local workstation\nWrite yaml files that defines Kubernetes objects\nCreate all kinds of Kubernetes objects, from Pods to Services\nUltimately the aim is to get you confident with using the kubectl command and writing Kubernetes yaml files.",

For each question I provide a summarized version of the answer (suitable for revisions) and a detailed answer (for in-depth learning).\nf.

Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of the test you will get an explanation for each question and explaining to why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does.\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions\nAsset Security – 13 questions\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions\n\nI recommend students to do 1,500-3,000 easy/mid CISSP practice questions and 1,000-1,500 HARD CISSP practice questions before the exam.\nI only know of 3 hard CISSP practice sets: my own hard questions, Boson questions, and SNT. Wentz Wu also has hard questions on his CISSP blog, but not as full practice tests.\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it. This is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right and answering from an IT Security manager's point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.\nOn hard questions, you will score lower. It is normal to score 80%+ on easy/mid questions and 50-60% on hard questions.\nThe point of all questions is to find the gaps in your knowledge, learn how to deconstruct questions, argue WHY the answer you chose is the RIGHT answer in this scenario, making you ready for exam day.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nYou'll Also Get:\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days no questions asked, money back guarantee.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

      "description": "Quick Info:\nLatest update: Jan 2024\nMore than 220 Lectures\nVery Comprehensive with extra lectures on Database Administration\nMay help in obtaining Oracle Database 12c SQL Certification.\nWith FULL Subtitles for all the video lessons\nAbout This Course:\nWelcome to the course, The Complete Oracle SQL Course.\nThis course introduces SQL, which is an acronym for 'Structured Query Language', to its students. This is based on Oracle's SQL implementation for Oracle Databases. The lessons are based on Oracle 12c Database and SQL Developer Tools running in Windows 10.\nThis course may help you in taking a step towards..\nin becoming an 'Oracle SQL Developer'\nin achieving 'Oracle SQL Certification'\nAbout the Name of this Course:\nWhen I started out to create this course, I wanted to create a Beginner Level Oracle SQL course. So I named it as 'SQL Development for Beginners'.\nHowever as I progressed, I decided to make it much more comprehensive and cover most of the topics in the curriculum of Oracle SQL exam 1Z0-071. And so I renamed it to, The Complete Oracle SQL Course.\nSo, this course starts with Beginner Level lessons and progresses into next levels.\nAbout SQL:\nSQL is used to interact with Database Systems. As per ANSI (American National Standards Institute), SQL is the standard language for Relational Database Management Systems.\nSQL has been the prominent language to interact with various Database Systems for many decades. While many languages that existed two decades ago are extinct now, SQL has always maintained its supremacy in the RDBMS world. Over the time, it has only advanced with new features and standards. And it seems to stay that way for years to come.\nAbout Oracle Database:\nOracle Database is one of the prominent Database Systems in the RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) segment. Some of the other prominent Database Systems are\nMicrosoft SQL Server\nMySQL\nSybase ASE.\nThey also use SQL to interact with their Database Systems. While there are subtle differences between each of their SQL implementations, a SQL as a whole, is generally very standard. So a person with SQL knowledge in one platform such as Oracle, may find it easier to learn and code for other Database Systems such as Microsoft SQL or MySQL.\nThe point is, once you learn SQL, then your reach into the job market is very wide.\n\n\nAbout the Curriculum:\nThe curriculum has been carefully designed to introduce the Oracle RDBMS environment first.\nThen it moves on to various types of SQL Statements such as DDL, DML and TCL.\nAnd next, it goes to the depths of various SQL Statements, Conditions, Sorting, Functions, Grouping etc..\nIt also gives Database Administration tips, as needed.\nIt is also covers most of the topics from the Oracle SQL Certification Exam 1Z0-071\n\n\nOracle Certification:\nOracle awards certain certifications that are recognized globally\nOne such certification is Oracle Database 12c SQL Certified Associate\nThe exam for that certification is (currently as of May 2016), 1Z0-071.\nThe topics in this course covers most of the topics for that exam.\n\n\nOracle Certification - Declarations\nWhile this course covers most of the topics for that exam, this course is not a sole material for that exam. Additional materials such as Oracle's recommended Books may be needed.\nThis course is NOT an official course from Oracle Corporation.\nThis course has been developed individually by its author.\n\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nThe instructor of this course, Mr.Sam Dhanasekaran, has more than 20 years of IT experience. It predominantly includes Database Support, IT Support and Recruiting.\n\n\nAbout Previews:\nMore lessons have been opened for public previews than the required amount. Please take your time to go through all of them. This will give you an idea about the instructor's presentation style, technical knowledge etc.\n\n\nSubtitles/Closed Captions:\nAll the video based lectures contain subtitles or closed-captions. You would be able to enable them if needed.",

Once you have several years of experience in IT security it will be more important than certification.\nWhat skills are assessed in Security+?\nThe CompTIA Security+ exam (SY0-701) tests the applicant's basic knowledge to perform IT security tasks and work in cybersecurity. Applicants will demonstrate skills in assessing the security of an enterprise environment, finding security flaws, and implementing solutions to improve security. They will also need to know how to monitor and secure cloud, mobile and IoT environments. The exam will test knowledge of and ability to follow governance, risk and compliance principles. Candidates who pass CompTIA Security+ certification will also be able to identify, monitor and respond to a security-related incident in the corporate IT environment. CompTIA Security+ is an entry-level certification and the first certification an IT security candidate must earn.\nWhat areas does the CompTIA Security Exam cover?\nThe CompTIA Security+ exam is a vendor-neutral exam that tests applicants' knowledge of IT security and their ability to perform key security functions. About 20% of the questions will cover threats, vulnerabilities and attacks. Applicants must understand the various types of compromises and understand penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. An equal portion of the test will cover the technologies and tools a security professional will use to perform their security tasks. Then, about 16% of the test will be questions that test a candidate's knowledge of identity and access management. Approximately 15% of the exam will cover secure network concepts, architecture and design. The remainder of the exam will validate the applicant's knowledge of risk management best practices, cryptography, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).\nWhat are some careers using CompTIA Security+?\nCompTIA Security+ certification is the industry standard for testing the minimum skills an IT security professional needs on the job. This certification complies with ISO 17024 standards and meets the requirements of the Department of Defense directive 8140/8570.01-M. This certification covers the role of junior IT auditor/penetration tester. Another job title a Security+ holder may pursue is system administrator, whose responsibilities include maintaining user accounts and access that requires corporate security knowledge. Network administrator and security administrator jobs may also require applicants to be CompTIA Security+ certified. Of course, any hiring manager looking to fill positions involving IT security, such as a security professional, security consultant or security engineer will likely consider the Security+ certification as a bonus.\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

      "description": "*** Very Similar to my INE Course: CCNA Cyber Ops Labs - Create Your Labs ***\nNote: This course will be updated frequently. Lectures about theory concepts, tools' usage, and practical labs will be added to the course gradually\n\n\nIt is estimated that there will be about 1.5 million unfilled jobs in cyber security by the year 2020. A more recent statistic increased this number for cyber security unfilled jobs to be 3.5 million by the year 2021. In addition, recent article highlights Cisco Systems intention to become a cyber security force. For these reasons, Cisco created the CCNA Cyber Ops certification, which can become one of the most certifications in demand in the near future. Furthermore, Cisco created a scholarship program for this certification, which emphasis its importance.\nIn this course you will learn about the tools that you can use for your study of the CCNA Cyber Ops certification and the current Cisco CyberOps Associate certification. Learning the theory side is important, but the hands on side is more important, since the main purpose of your study is to apply your knowledge in production, and since your hands on will enforce your theory knowledge. You can not teach someone how to drive a car by showing him or her how to do it, but you have to let him try and practice how to do that. Furthermore, showing you hands on labs and how to use tools without teaching you how to create these labs and install these tools, might not give you the ultimate benefit from your study . For this reason, I have created this course to teach you how to create your own home labs, and to understand the core usage and important features of the tools used in them. I believe in the saying: \"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime\". If you have access to online labs, such as that offered by Cisco through their scholarship, you still need to know how to create your own home labs to continue practicing and experimenting, which is what this course will help you to achieve. On the other hand, this course will prepare you to go through these online labs quickly, and with confidence, since you will be familiar with the tools used in them.  And not just online labs, but any other hands on Cyber Ops courses, like what I intend to publish in the near future.\nThis course will teach you how to use the following tools:\nSecurity Onion (Including VM installation, working with PCAP files, ELSA, Sguil. Squert, and Kibana).\nWireshark.\nKali Linux.\nMetasploit.\nNmap.\nVirtualBox.\nGNS3.\nThis course includes several practical assignments and a practice test, in order to asses your understanding of the material included. I strongly recommend that you try the assignments and answer the question included in them, after trying solving the task practically, or even after watching the solution video. Each assignment will give you thorough and comprehensive understanding of the related topic.\nI hope that you will join me in this course and start your Cyber security journey. Happy learning!\n\n\nVery Important: How to use this course\nBased on students' feedback, you can view this course by going directly to the section you are interested in. However, it is recommended that you at least skim quickly over the other preceding sections.\nFor example, you can go to the ELSA and Sguil sections (the core of the course) directly if you are already familiar with VirtualBox and the Security Onion installation process, or skim quickly over those sections as a review.",

      "description": "This a truly an age of Cloud Computing, and needless to say, AWS is the leader in this industry. It is way ahead of its competitors like Microsoft and Google in terms of innovation. More and more companies, whether small-to-medium enterprises, or big corporations like GE and Netflix are harnessing the power of this truly great platform. This means that there is and will be a huge demand of AWS professionals, including Solutions Architects, who can very well guide clients and organizations through all phases of deployment of the entire infrastructure on AWS platform.\nAs an experienced AWS Solutions Architects, I have found that there is a huge gap between the skills required and employers’ expectations. There are a lot of courses in the marketplace that will guarantee you passing of the certificate examinations, but never let you know what you’re going to do afterwards. Apart from looking for certified professionals, employers are keenly looking for a right skill set and practical exposure, which these courses will not render you. Hence, I have come up with this course that will cover all aspects, including giving you enough practical exposure and hands-on knowledge.\nWhy you should go for this course?\nNo empty promises: This course is intended to give you as much practical knowledge as I can. It all depends how much you can grasp from it.\nUpdated content: AWS developers are very fast in updating their services and features. I always make sure to update lectures and demos whenever some changes are announced.\nComplete questionnaire: At the end of this course, you will get access to three sets of quizzes, with 60 questions in each. These 180 questions are real time questions that will help you clear your AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate examination with an excellent score. You don’t need to buy a separate course to get access to these kind of practice tests, and the best part is that there is a proper explanation for each of these questions.\nDetailed documentation: Each section consists of some detailed documents and assignments for you to access and hone your skills.\nHelp & guidance: I’m available for you to guide you through any of your queries and problems. After you raise your question, you will be guaranteed a response within 24 hours.\nLive sessions: I will be hosting live sessions on monthly basis. This will give you an opportunity to interact with me and get your questions answered.\nLet’s see in a nutshell what topics you’ll learn in this course:\nIntroduction to AWS\nAWS Global Infrastructure\nElastic Compute (EC2)\nLambda\nElastic Beanstalk\nCommand Line Interface (CLI)\nSecurity Groups\nClassic Load Balancer\nApplication Load Balancer\nAuto Scaling\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM)\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nRoute 53\nElastic Block Store (EBS) Volumes\nEBS Snapshots\nSimple Storage Service (S3)\nDatabase\nCloudWatch\nCloudTrail\nOpsWorks\nCloudFormation\nTrusted Advisor\nSimple Queue Service (SQS)\nSimple Workflow Service (SWF)\nSimple Notification Service (SNS)\nElastic Transcoder\nDisaster Recovery\nTroubleshooting\nYou can refer to some of the recent feedbacks given by students:\nJuan Gongora: I'm almost halfway done through this course, and I can definitely say in good confidence, that the content supplied here is great. I took Rohan's previous course \"Learn AWS the Hard Way\" and learned a ton about cloud computing in general. So I was eager to enroll to this one when I found out he had released a Solutions Architect course. I will update this review once I have taken the exam to let you guys know how it went. But so far I can say that I am definitely enhancing my current understanding of AWS, as well as learning some new usages.\nDennis John: A wonderful course. Having gone halfway through the course (and also having gone through another course by the same author), I can say, I like the way he presents the course, first explaining the theory in detail, then getting hands on and doing a demo of the feature that he explained. The author seems to have very good experience on the topic, especially when he mentions the \"gotcha\" scenarios. Looking forward to the remainder of the course.\nAt the end, you may be thinking whether I should go for this course? The answer is – 'Definitely Yes'. It is worth giving it a try by clicking on “Buy Now” option. After enrolling yourself, you can start learning by going through sections and lectures. Just in case if you don’t find this course meeting your expectations, you can always ask Udemy to refund your money within 30 days of your enrollment.\nSo what are you waiting for? Sign up today and make yourself proficient in one of the hottest and most in-demand skills in today’s IT world.",

Easy to use, fast, agile, and packed with great features, it removes a lot of the tedious administrational tasks you tend to associate with pretty much every other database. It’s no wonder why it’s had the level of success it has and its great fun to use. I hope you find this content helpful.\nThe sheer simplicity of the Snowflake means it is straightforward to getting up and running. This also means a lot of users don’t move past the basics, because they never need to. For everyday workloads Snowflake runs out of the box and if queries start to take a little longer, well, you can always scale up at the touch of a button!\nThe questions contained in these practice tests cover the follow subject areas:\nSnowflake Overview and Architecture\nSnowflake Virtual Warehouses\nSnowflake Storage and Protection\nData Movement (Loading & Unloading)\nSnowflake Account, Security and Sharing\nSnowflake Performance and Tuning\nWorking with Semi-Structured Data\nStreams & Tasks\nThe exam does not cover cloud fundamentals or basics of SQL syntax, but some questions on the exam assume knowledge of these concepts. It's worthwhile brushing up on some of these areas if your not familiar with them.\nThis guide does not guarantee success but forms part of your preparation to succeed.",

      "description": "The single biggest reason students fail the RHCSA exam is a lack of hands-on practice. You can read books and watch lectures for weeks, but the real exam is a live, practical test. Are you truly prepared?\nThis course closes the gap between theory and exam-day reality. Designed by a best-selling author and Linux expert, Ghada Atef, these aren't just questions—they're a complete training simulation. Students who complete these exams don't just hope to pass; they walk into the test center with the confidence to score 300/300.\n\n\nImportant: Which RHCSA Exam Version Is This For?\nThis is the most important section to read before you enroll!\nThis course is 100% focused on the RHCSA 9 (EX200V9K) exam based on RHEL 9. It fully covers the RHCSA 9 objectives, including podman for containers.\nThis course DOES NOT cover the new RHCSA 10 exam or its objectives (like Flatpak). A brand new course for RHCSA 10 is coming soon!\nWhy is RHEL 8 mentioned? The core skills for RHCSA 8 and 9 are 95% identical. To help students who still work on RHEL 8 systems, a dedicated PDF with RHEL 8-specific solutions is included as a resource.\n\n\nPowerful Resources Included with Your Enrollment\nTo ensure you are perfectly set up for success, this course provides crucial resources before you even start the first practice exam. Linked in the description of each practice test, you will find:\nYour Complete Exam Success Guide: A detailed PDF covering exam overview, preparation strategies, instructions for creating your own RHEL 9 study environment, and final tips for exam day.\nPractice Exam Requirements PDF: Each of the six practice exams comes with its own PDF detailing the specific tasks and objectives you need to complete.\nRHEL 8 Q&A PDF: For those who need it, this separate guide contains tasks with solutions that are different in RHEL 8 than 9, along with tasks suitable only for RHEL 8.\n\n\nTwo Ways to Train: Practice Mode & Exam Mode\nEvery practice test in this course can be taken in two distinct modes, giving you complete control over your study sessions:\nPractice Mode: This is your low-stakes training ground. There is no timer and no passing score. You can take your time, answer questions at your own pace, and review the detailed solution immediately after each task. It's perfect for learning the concepts without pressure.\nExam Mode: This simulates the real test experience. You have 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete all questions, with a passing score of 90%. You can mark each task as \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" as you go. To see the detailed solutions, you must click \"Finish Test,\" which forces you to practice under realistic, timed conditions.\n\n\nWhat You'll Master\nSimulate the Real Exam Many Times Over Tackle six full-length, timed practice exams that mirror the difficulty, format, and pressure of the actual EX200 exam. Eliminate surprises and master your time management.\nNever Guess Why an Answer Is Correct For every single question, you get a detailed, step-by-step solution. I'll walk you through the entire process on the command line, explaining the \"how\" and the \"why\" so the concepts stick.\nBuild Unshakeable Confidence Go beyond memorization. By completing these real-world scenarios, you'll gain the practical, hands-on experience you need to solve any problem the exam throws at you.\n\n\nJoin Hundreds of Certified Students! (Our Wall of Fame)\n\"I passed with 300/300! These practice exams were all I needed to get certified!\" – Joseph Villa\n\"This course was key in my preparation. I passed my RHCSA exam with 285 marks!\" – Annu Lohan\n\"I passed my RHCSA today, and this course helped me A LOT! The scenarios are very similar to the real exam.\" – Muhammad Shaheer Munir\n\n\nThis Course Is Your Perfect Final Step If You Are:\nA student who has finished a theory course but needs intense, hands-on practice.\nA System Administrator aiming to get officially Red Hat certified on RHEL 9.\nAn IT professional who feels nervous about passing the performance-based EX200 exam.\nAnyone looking to validate their Linux skills with a globally recognized certification.\n\n\nYour Enrollment Includes:\n6 Full RHCSA 9 Practice Exams\nDetailed Step-by-Step Solutions for Every Task\nComprehensive PDF Guides for exam strategy and lab setup.\nLifetime Access to All Course Materials and Future Updates\nInstructor Support for Any Questions You Have\n30-Day Money-Back Guarantee (Enroll with zero risk!)\nDon't leave your certification to chance.

      "description": "Course Introduction:\nComputers have become an integral part of our daily life. The Management Information Systems course explains the benefits of computers to organisations, how the work of an organisation is affected by computers and how you can deploy and manage them to support your organisation’s goals and strategies.\nWhy Learn MIS?\nComputers, in all forms, have become an integral part of our daily life. Some estimates say that by the end of 2015, there will be more Indians carrying smartphones in their pockets than there are Americans doing so! Computers may not appear essential for everyone but today, the lives of each and every person are affected—and often benefited – by their use and deployment. Governments, corporations and other organisations cannot operate efficiently and effectively without them. Some businesses, such as Amazon and Flipkart, run almost entirely on computer systems. In other cases, the use of computers by organisations, such as banks, ensure better services to customers.\nThe Management Information Systems course will help you understand the benefits of computers to organisations and, more importantly, how to deploy and manage them to support an organisation’s goals and strategies. No matter which function of an organisation you work in—finance, marketing, human resources or production—you will need to understand how your work is affected by and how you may effectively deploy computer systems.\nLearning Plan\nYou are expected to spend the following effort in completing this course:\nActivity Time Spent (hrs.)\nRead Learner Handbook 1\nWatch videos for all modules 20\nSelf-Assessment Exercises 5\nTotal 26\nWhat Next?\nThis course provided you an overview of the field of MIS. To gain further competency as an MIS professional you would need to gain an understanding of one or more of the following areas:\nSystems Engineering\nInformation Systems Project Management\nSystems Development Methodologies\nDatabase Administration\nData Administration\nNetwork and Systems Administration\nSystems Architecting and Design\nUser Experience Design\nWeb Applications Deployment\nMobile Applications Deployment\nMIS is a rapidly and constantly changing field. To remain employable and competitive, you need to be frequently taking courses and equipping yourself on the latest developments in technologies, methods and strategies.\nAll learners upon successful completion of Post course assessments shall be getting a verifiable e-certificate from Manipal Global Education which will be globally valid.",

This comprehensive course covers the operational aspects of privacy, focusing on aligning privacy strategies with organizational goals, ensuring compliance with global privacy regulations, and fostering a culture of accountability and data protection. Participants will gain insights into the day-to-day responsibilities of privacy managers, including stakeholder engagement, cross-functional collaboration, risk mitigation, and policy development. By the end of this course, participants will be equipped to manage complex privacy programs, navigate evolving regulatory landscapes, and develop strategies to protect personal information effectively.\n\n\nModule 1: Introduction to Privacy Program Management\nThis module introduces the fundamental elements of managing a privacy program. It begins by defining the key roles and responsibilities necessary for overseeing privacy within an organization, including the structure of accountability and the distinctions between managing global versus regional privacy compliance. Participants will also learn about the critical roles various stakeholders play in ensuring the success of privacy programs, emphasizing the importance of collaboration across departments to meet privacy objectives.\n\n\nModule 2: Privacy Governance\nIn this module, participants will explore the governance structures required for an effective privacy program. This includes understanding the placement of the privacy function within an organization’s hierarchy and examining the responsibilities of the Data Protection Officer (DPO), including their reporting lines and the importance of independence. Participants will also learn how to define the scope and objectives of a privacy program through the creation of a privacy charter and the development of a privacy strategy that aligns with organizational goals and mitigates operational risks. Additionally, the module will cover cross-functional support, engaging departments like legal, HR, and IT to ensure cohesive privacy governance, and aligning with major privacy frameworks such as GDPR, CCPA, and others.\n\n\nModule 3: Applicable Laws and Regulations\nThis module focuses on the regulatory environment governing privacy. Participants will examine key privacy laws and regulations across various jurisdictions, including GDPR, CCPA, and other global privacy frameworks. The module will highlight the challenges of cross-jurisdictional privacy requirements and provide strategies for harmonizing privacy efforts across different legal landscapes. Participants will also learn how to align privacy compliance with broader organizational strategies and stay current with evolving privacy laws to maintain continuous compliance.\n\n\nModule 4: Data Assessments\nIn this module, participants will learn how to assess their organization’s privacy posture through various tools and processes. This includes creating and maintaining accurate data inventories and maps to understand data flows within the organization. Participants will conduct gap analyses to identify compliance gaps between current practices and regulatory requirements, and learn when and how to conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) to ensure privacy risks are mitigated. Vendor assessments will also be covered, with a focus on evaluating third-party vendors for privacy compliance risks.\n\n\nModule 5: Policies\nThis module will focus on the development and implementation of privacy-related policies within an organization. Participants will learn about common types of privacy policies, such as those related to data retention, data sharing, and data protection, and best practices for structuring and communicating these policies. The module will also cover the integration of privacy policies into operational processes to ensure that employees across the organization understand and comply with these policies.\n\n\nModule 6: Data Subject Rights\nIn this module, participants will explore how to communicate and enforce data subject rights, such as access, rectification, and erasure. The module will cover strategies for crafting clear and comprehensive privacy notices, managing choice and consent mechanisms to allow individuals to opt-in or opt-out of data processing, and ensuring that procedures are in place to facilitate data subject requests for access and correction. Participants will also learn about data portability and erasure, and how to implement procedures for transferring or deleting personal data.\n\n\nModule 7: Training and Awareness\nThis module emphasizes the importance of privacy training and awareness programs within organizations. Participants will learn how to develop effective privacy training tailored to the specific needs of different departments and roles, ensuring that all employees understand their privacy responsibilities. The module will also cover ongoing awareness campaigns to promote privacy within the organization and methods to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy training initiatives.\n\n\nModule 8: Protecting Personal Information\nIn this module, participants will examine strategies for protecting personal information through a holistic approach, including the application of Privacy by Design (PbD) principles.

Participants will learn how to develop comprehensive incident response plans, including breach notification procedures in compliance with regulatory requirements (such as GDPR’s 72-hour rule). The module will also cover crisis management strategies, including coordinating efforts between legal, public relations, and other departments during a breach, and conducting post-incident reviews to improve processes and prevent future incidents.\n\n\nModule 10: Monitoring and Auditing Program Performance\nIn the final module, participants will learn how to monitor and evaluate the performance of privacy programs to ensure continuous compliance and improvement. The module will cover key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure the effectiveness of privacy initiatives, as well as audit procedures for conducting both internal and external privacy audits. Participants will explore strategies for using audit results to drive continuous improvement in privacy practices, and the importance of reporting audit findings to stakeholders.

Our IT Risk Fundamentals course covers the fundamentals of risk management; from identifying and prioritising risk to responding and communicating the risk to management. You’ll learn about six functions throughout the course:\n\n\nDomain 1 - Risk Introduction and Overview (5%): We start by setting a strong foundation and understanding of risk. In this domain we will cover fundamental concepts of IT risk management. We will discuss how risks links to business functions, the importance of the three lines of defense and the role of IT controls.\n\n\nDomain 2 - Risk Governance and Management (15%): We will explain the structure of risk governance and management and how it's used to set a direction for a business. We will discuss risk appetite, risk tolerance, and risk capacity and introduce the risk management cycle.\n\n\nDomain 3 - Risk Identification (20%): Risk identification is the process of spotting and documenting the risks a business faces. It is crucial because only identified risks can be assessed and responded to. In this domain we will talk about assets, threats, and vulnerabilities and how we can use them to identify risk.\n\n\nDomain 4 - Risk Assessment and Analysis (25%): After identifying risk, the next step is to understand its impact on the business. In this domain, we will discuss the different approaches to risk assessments, how to use risk registers to document risks, and the importance of risk aggregation.\n\n\nDomain 5 - Risk Response (15%): After risk has been identified and assessed, decisions need to be made about the appropriate risk response. In this domain we will discuss risk response strategies, control design and implementation and other response approaches.\n\n\nDomain 6 - Risk Monitoring, Reporting and Communication (20%): The monitoring and reporting of risk play an important role in the risk management process. Indicators for risk and performance should be considered carefully and chosen deliberately, based on their alignment with enterprise goals. Because of the changing nature of risk and associated controls, ongoing monitoring and reporting are essential steps in the risk management process.",

      "description": "Ace the GitHub Copilot Exam with Confidence!\nDominate your GitHub Copilot certification with this comprehensive practice exam course. Crafted by a certified GitHub Copilot enthusiast and co-instructor, this course offers unique, challenging questions designed from scratch to mirror the real exam experience.\nHere's what makes this course stand out:\nExpertly Curated:  Benefit from my firsthand experience as a GitHub Copilot certificate holder and co-instructor. I've poured my knowledge and insights into creating a practice exam that truly prepares you for success.\nIn-depth Explanations:  Don't just get the right answer – understand why it's right! Each question comes with a detailed explanation, ensuring you grasp the core concepts and best practices.\nComprehensive Coverage:   This practice exam covers all the essential areas and topics featured in the official GitHub Copilot exam.\nAlways Up-to-Date:  The world of GitHub Copilot is constantly evolving. Rest assured, this course is regularly updated to reflect the latest features and exam changes. You can see the change log in the last topic.\n*** Practice Exam details ***\nThis practice covers seven domains based on the study guide and my experience, ensuring that you won’t miss anything.\nDomain 1: Responsible AI 7%\nDomain 2: GitHub Copilot plans and features 31%\nDomain 3: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data 15%\nDomain 4: Prompt crafting and Prompt engineering 9%\nDomain 5: Developer use cases for AI 14%\nDomain 6: Testing with GitHub Copilot 9%\nDomain 7: Privacy fundamentals and context exclusions 15%\n*** Example Question ***\n** Question 1:\nWhat is the relationship between the \"toxicity filter\" and the \"hate speech filter\" in GitHub Copilot?\nAnswer Options:\n1. The hate speech filter is a component of the broader toxicity filter.\n2. The toxicity filter and the hate speech filter are independent and operate separately.\n3. The toxicity filter is triggered only after the hate speech filter detects offensive language.\n4. The hate speech filter is more lenient than the toxicity filter, allowing for some forms of offensive language.\nCorrect Answer:\n1. The hate speech filter is a component of the broader toxicity filter.\nExplanation:\nGitHub Copilot's toxicity filter is designed to catch various kinds of harmful language, and the hate speech filter is specifically designed to catch hate speech. This means that the hate speech filter is just one part of the overall toxicity filter.\n** Question 2:\nYou want Copilot Chat to generate code for a simple JavaScript function. Which of the following are acceptable ways to phrase your request (Select two)?\nAnswer Options:\n1. write a javascript function to [function purpose]\n2. /new javascript function to [function purpose]\n3. @javascript write a function to [function purpose]\n4. create function to [function purpose] in #file\nCorrect Answers:\n1. write a javascript function to [function purpose]\n4. create function to [function purpose] in #file\nExplanations:\nOption 1 is correct because it's a clear and direct instruction to Copilot Chat. For example, you could say \"write a javascript function to calculate the area of a triangle\".\nOption 2 is incorrect because \"/new\" is usually used for creating new files or projects, not for individual functions within a file.\nOption 3 is incorrect because there's no \"@javascript\" command or participant in Copilot Chat.\nOption 4 is correct because it clearly tells Copilot what you want (\"create function\") and provides context by specifying the file where the function should be added (using the \"#file\" variable).\nReady to boost your confidence and pass the GitHub Copilot exam with flying colors? Enroll now and take your coding skills to the next level!\n*** Github Copilot Update ***\n** September 2025\nIn Sept 2025, GitHub Copilot had major upgrades: the coding agent went GA, letting it open PRs, update code, and respond to reviews.

I hope they are like the test... Really hope. Great training resources because the explanations are very useful. (Rick, 5 stars)\n\nGreat tests that provide something close to the scenario-based questions that the exam will show (it's hard as Udemy's platform isn't designed to allow them properly) Diverse questions. Really good explanations. Great learning tool for passing the test as the exams cover a lot off! (Aimee, 5 stars)\n\nThis course of practice exams has some good concept reinforcing questions and does a good job of rotating/varying the types of questions asked. Highly recommend if preparing for the certification exam. (Matthew, 5 stars)\n\nThese questions are unique and well-conducted to prepare for the exam with relevant information.

The only requirement of this course is a solid understanding of python.\nTest your python knowledge now!!!!\n\n\nPython defination:\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.\n\n\nPython is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\n\n\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.\n\n\nPython consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.",

Companies are constantly searching for ways to make better and faster and smarter decisions. Therefore they rely heavily on data. Small company or Multinational -  data driven decision making is the key to success for any business in the world of tomorrow.\nBecause of that companies are drastically increasing to step up their efforts to find skilled employees and freelancers with the necessary capabilities to help with analyzing data and creating valuable highly profitable insights.\nSince there is way more demand than supply it is a \"War for talent\".

      "requirements": [],
      "description": "Will I Pass the Exam if I Buy this Course?\nI'm putting this question first as not to disillusion anyone. The tests cover all the important topics and coupled with finishing the Python Essentials courses on OpenEDG, then you'll be in a very good position to pass the exam. These tests will supplement your learning and prepare you for the exact format of the exam to maximise your chances on passing.  I've yet to come across any other course that mimics the actual exam and has detailed answers for each questions - it's not just copy pasta, that mean's there's over 160 pages of explanations!\n\n\nWhy these practice tests and not the others on Udemy?\nFirst, this one is focused on PCAP-31-03 not the 02 syllabus.\nSecond, I've tried others and searched for questions in the same format and standard as the actual exam but there is very little available, especially as the PCAP exam has now changed its syllabus so many topics from PCAP-31-02 are no longer tested in PCAP-31-03. The practice tests are built around the actual syllabus and you don't have to worry about being tested on topics that will never come up.\nFinally, many of the other tests are either not at the right level, lack explanations or just copy and paste code from else where. Although this course does use reuse some of the code (and I'm talking less than 10%) from the Python Institute courses, the questions asked are not the same so you must have understood the concept to get the right answer. The explanations are very thorough and the code is provided so you can test the answers yourself. Have a look at the preview video to see how questions are presented, the answers and source code given (link to the github repo is in the answer section for question 1 of each of the tests).\n\n\nWhat are in these tests?\nFour 40 question practice tests (so 160 questions total) in the same format and style of the actual PCAP-31-03 exam. The topics covered are only from the PCAP-31-03 syllabus and in the exact same proportion as will be on the exam:\nThis Mock Tests cover the following topics:\nModules and Packages (questions 1-6)\nExceptions (questions 7-11)\nStrings (questions 12-19)\nObject Orientated Programming (questions 20-31)\nMiscellaneous: List Comprehensions, Lambdas, Closures, and I/O Operations (questions 32-40)\nAll questions are bespoke.\nThe test includes detailed explanations to help improve your understanding as well as code so you can run the snippets yourself. If you find specific topics difficult, you can reference the Python Institutes own course (which is free) on their OpenEDG website - it is recommended for you to complete that course as all the information needed to pass the exam is in that course and the questions from the questions are heavily influenced by it.\n\n\nWhat do you mean by actual test format?\nHave a look at the promotion video for examples but they are delivered in the same style as the actual exam. This means:\n* 40 Questions with 65 minutes\n* Only topics listed in the syllabus covered\n* The split of questions are the same as the actual exam: 6 questions for Modules and Packages, 5 for Exceptions, 8 for Strings, 12 for Object Orientated Programming and 9 for Miscellaneous\n* Number of choices for a multiple selection question is listed and usually restricted to two (like the exam)\n* Number of options to the questions is four (actual exam can go up to five but is rare)\n* The style of the questions is the style you'll encounter in the real exam\n\n\nWhat is the standard of questions?\nThe content is based around the Python Institute courses on OpenEDG (Python 1 and 2 Essentials) and the syllabus so all the topics covered are from there so no niche or advanced topics that you don't need to know but some of the questions can be more focused.\n\n\nAre the questions too easy then?\nNot at all, to answer the questions you need a firm understanding of the concept being questioned - superficial knowledge won't be enough. Some nuances of topics are asked but nothing that wasn't covered in the OpenEDG course. The standard is harder than the actual exam but for the right reasons - testing full grasp of the pertinent topics, not because you are tested on hyper specific irrelevant things.\n\n\nAre there any Explanations?\nYes! There are detailed explanations to help explain the answers, you aren't just spoon fed things. If you learn the concepts you can apply them to other questions and improve your overall Python knowledge. Along with the explanations you can find a link to download a file with all the source code for the questions - the link to the source code is at the beginning of the answer for Question 1 of each test.\n\n\nWhether you choose to take this course or not I wish you all the best with the exam. :)",

Scroll below for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 3.\nThe way consumers maintain membership in a consumer group and ownership of the partitions assigned to them is by sending heartbeats to a Kafka broker designated as the group coordinator (this broker can be different for different consumer groups). As long as the consumer is sending heartbeats at regular intervals, it is assumed to be alive, well, and processing messages from its partitions. Heartbeats are sent when the consumer polls (i. e., retrieves records) and when it commits records it has consumed.\nWhen closing a consumer cleanly, the consumer will notify the group coordinator that it is leaving, and the group coordinator will trigger a rebalance immediately, reducing the gap in processing.\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nThe questions are as per the Confluent exam syllabus of the official documentation\nRetake Endlessly - You can retake the exams as many times as you want\n100% Exam Coverage - Tests are updated regularly to keep them up to date with the current syllabus\nDetailed Explanations - You get detailed explanations for all the answers with reference links and official documentation\nMimic Real Exam - 60 multiple-choice questions, duration is 90 minutes and passing grade is around 70%\nMobile-Compatible - All practice tests are compatible with the Udemy App\n30-Day Money-Back Guarantee - Get your money back if you're not satisfied\n\n\nWe hope that by now you're convinced!

      "description": "The Cisco CCNA is one of the most widely recognized and respected qualifications in the IT industry. Every year, tens of thousands of people embark towards taking the exam via private study, Cisco Academy courses, or online training.\nThe sad truth is most students quit along the way, and for those few who actually do attempt it, only 50% pass. All that time, effort, and money wasted! If there are so many manuals, CBT courses, lab simulators, exam engines, and study resources out there, then what goes wrong?\nThis is the question Cisco trainer Paul Browning wanted to get to the bottom of. After interviewing thousands of students, he discovered that most people quit because they are simply overwhelmed with the sheer volume of material they need to digest and, of course, the large number of hands-on skills they need to be able to demonstrate in the exam. Add to that the day-to-day stresses of commuting to work, bringing up a family, and the distraction of everyday problems and challenges; it’s no wonder people quit.\nThis is where Cisco CCNA in 60 Days can help. Devised by four industry experts and countless Cisco students just like you, the 60-day programme breaks down every exam requirement into a daily study task. All you need to do is turn up at the relevant day (from 1 to 60), watch the theory, and complete the lab and practice exam. This method has helped tens of thousands of students study for the CCNA exam since 2006.\nHOW IS THIS COURSE DIFFERENT?\nEvery other CCNA course throws information at you and hopes it sticks. You have to work out what to study, what to revise, what to lab up and which practice exams to take. We do all of this for you using advanced learning methods. Every subject is covered multiple times through:\nVideos\nExams\nHands-on labs\nCram guide\nChallenge labs\nReview sessions\nComplete revised and updated for the new Cisco CCNA 200-301 exam.\nYou can do the hands-on labs using Packet Tracer, GNS3, your home rack or a remote rack. Watch as the expert configures and troubleshoots all the technologies you need to master for the exam such as NAT, Access Lists, IPv6, RIP, DHCP and much more. We walk you through the entire process.\nHERE IS WHAT YOU GET:\n60 daily study tasks\nComplete Cisco CCNA study guide (800+ pages / readable online)\nFull explanations of theory\nReal-world tips and advice\n60 practice exams\nOver 47 hands-on labs, plus two bonus downloadable lab books\nCCNA  cram guide\nBonus VLSM guide\nMotivational goal-setting guide\nUpdated for the new CCNA exams as of 2021.\nFree support on using the Q and A here. The experts will log in every day to help you pass the exams and understand the technology.",

There are different ways in which we can ingest data into a data warehouse. We will learn how to use Data pipelines, T-SQL and Data Flow Gen2 to ingest data into a data warehouse. We won't be done there. We will learn how to design Fact and Dimension tables within a data warehouse.\nNext it will be time to perform a deep-dive into Lakehouses. We'll again use Data pipelines and Data Flow Gen2 to ingest data into a lakehouse. We'll learn on how to use Notebooks to in interact with data within a lakehouse.\nNext comes the Eventhouse. How do we get data into the eventhouse. How do we stream a continuous data streams into the eventhouse. And then how to use the Kusto Query Language to query for data.\nAs per the exam , we need to focus on key security concepts, such as how to secure access to items in Microsoft Fabric. How do we enforce column and row level security.

Think of it as the foundation for turning data into a strategic advantage.\n\n\nData Governance\nData governance is the framework of policies, processes, and responsibilities that ensure data is managed properly. It defines who is accountable for data, how it should be used, and how it's protected.\nWhy it's important: Data governance ensures data integrity, compliance with regulations (like GDPR), and reduces risks associated with data breaches or misuse. It's like the guardrails that keep data safe and useful.\n\n\nWhy are these concepts important for companies?\nIn data-driven world, companies that effectively manage and govern their data have a significant competitive edge. Here's why:\nBetter Decision-Making: High-quality data leads to informed decisions, reducing the risk of costly mistakes.\nImproved Efficiency: Streamlined data processes save time and resources.\nIncreased Revenue: Data-driven insights can identify new opportunities, improve customer targeting, and optimize pricing strategies.\nEnhanced Compliance: Proper data governance ensures adherence to data privacy regulations, avoiding hefty fines and legal issues.\nStronger Reputation: Trustworthy data builds trust with customers and partners.\n\n\nWhy is knowledge of these concepts important for business and IT experts and managers?\nBoth business and IT professionals need a solid understanding of data quality, management, and governance to:\nBridge the Gap: IT experts understand the technical aspects of data, while business leaders grasp the strategic implications. Knowledge of these concepts allows them to collaborate effectively.\nDrive Innovation: By understanding data's potential, they can identify new ways to leverage it for innovation and growth.\nChampion Data Literacy: They can promote data literacy within their teams, empowering everyone to make data-informed decisions.\nMitigate Risks: Knowledge of data governance helps them understand and address potential risks associated with data.\nLead with Confidence: In a data-centric world, leaders equipped with this knowledge can confidently steer their organizations towards success.\n\n\nData quality, management, and governance are no longer just IT concerns; they are critical for every aspect of a successful business.

All questions and answers in these practice exams have been carefully curated and updated to be fit for 2021 AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. Every question has a detailed explanation of why an option is correct and why the other options are wrong.\n\n\nThe scenarios covered in this practice tests and the breadth and complexity of the questions here are indicative of what you see in the real exam. I update this course regularly to include new up-to-date content at no extra charge. If you have questions, raise them in Q&A - I offer full support, answering any questions you have 7 days a week.\n\n\nThis course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. If you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, please ask for a refund. 30 day refund policy applies. You literally can’t lose.\n\n\nApologies for the high number of questions in each practice exam. Udemy has a limit of 6 practice tests per course so I had to cram 200 questions into each practice test for your exam preparation.\n\n\nEvery question has a detailed explanation of why an option is correct and why the other options are wrong. Here is an example:\n\n\nQ. Which AWS Service when used in combination with AWS Shield provides you comprehensive availability protection against all known infrastructure (Layer 3 and 4) attacks?\nA. WAF.\nB. Elastic Load Balancer.\nC. CloudTrail.\nD. CloudFront.\nWAF. is not correct.\nAWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define.\nRef: <url>\nElastic Load Balancer. is not correct.\nElastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, Lambda functions, and virtual appliances. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.\nRef: <url>\nCloud Trail. is not correct.\nCloud Trail is pefect for this requirement. Unusual activity detection use case: You can detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts by enabling CloudTrail Insights. For example, you can quickly alert and act on operational issues such as erroneous spikes in resource provisioning or services hitting rate limits.\nRef: <url>\nCloudFront. is correct.\nWhen using Amazon CloudFront, AWS Shield Standard automatically provides comprehensive protection against infrastructure layer attacks like SYN floods, UDP floods, or other Reflection attacks. AWS Shield Standard’s always-on detection and mitigation systems automatically scrubs bad traffic at Layer 3 and 4 to protect your application. Over 99% of infrastructure layer attacks detected by AWS Shield Standard are automatically mitigated in less than 1 second for attacks on Amazon CloudFront.\nRef: <url>\nSee you on the inside (hurry, your practice tests are waiting!)",

I was one of the first people to take and pass the Consul Associate, and I also hold the Consul Intermediate and Advanced partner certification from HashiCorp and was the first person in the world to earn both. With a 4.7 star rating across my courses and practice exams, I strive to provide solid content to students and take feedback very seriously.\nFeedback for this practice exam:\nI used these practice tests to pass the official exam. The questions are similar to the real ones and are excellent practice. - Jeremy C\n\n\nThese practice exams were extremely helpful! The recent addition of getting a breakdown of questions by topic allowed me to see where I needed to focus additional study on. - Brian M\n\n\nThis along with the HashiCorp study guide adequately prepared me to pass the exam. Many thanks. -Ryan\nAbout this Practice Exam:\nTest your knowledge of HashiCorp's Consul with 177 questions designed to help you gain the confidence to pass the HashiCorp Certified: Consul Associate exam. This exam covers a wide variety of topics, from explaining basic Consul architecture all the way to registering services and creating Consul ACLs. The practice exams include true/false, multiple-choice, and multi-select questions that include screenshots, code, and detailed explanations which make this practice exam the ultimate study guide. These practice exams are intended to test your knowledge of where you may need to focus before taking the real test.\nAbout the HashiCorp Certified: Consul Associate Certification:\nThe Consul Associate Certification is for Site Reliability Engineers, Solutions Architects, DevOps professionals, or other Cloud Engineers who know the basic concepts and skills to build, secure, and maintain open-source HashiCorp Consul. Candidates will be best prepared for this exam if they have professional experience using Consul in production, but performing the exam objectives in a personal demo environment may also be sufficient. This person understands what enterprise features exist and what can and cannot be done using the open-source offering.",

      "description": "Now is the time to get certified for Python!\n\nITS-303 Python (Information Technology Specialist)\nFormerly Microsoft MTA 98-381\n\n\nThere are six Practice Tests with preparation questions from all knowledge areas\nto prepare for the ITS-303 Python (Information Technology Specialist) exam at Certiport (Pearson VUE).\n\n\nEvery question has an explanation and a Try-It-Yourself-Code\nwhich you can run to better understand the topic.\nYou can download the Try-It-Yourself-Code for all questions.\n(The download link will be in your welcome message.)\n\n\nExam Syllabus\n\n\nOperations using Data Types and Operators\nEvaluate expressions to identify the data type Python assigns to variables:\nstr, int, float, and bool\nPerform and analyse data and data type operations:\nData type conversion, indexing, slicing, construct data structures, lists, list operations\nDetermine the sequence of execution based on operator precedence:\nAssignment, comparison, logical, arithmetic, identity (is), containment (in)\nSelect operators to achieve the intended result:\nAssignment, comparison, logical, arithmetic, identity (is), containment (in)\n\n\nFlow Control with Decisions and Loops\nConstruct and analyze code segments that use branching statements:\nif, elif, else, nested and compound conditional expressions\nConstruct and analyze code segments that perform iteration:\nwhile, for, break, continue, pass, nested loops, loops that include compound conditional expressions\n\n\nInput and Output Operations\nConstruct and analyze code segments that perform file input and output operations:\nopen, close, read, write, append, check existence, delete, with statement\nConstruct and analyze code segments that perform console input and output operations:\nRead input from console, print formatted text (string.format() method, f-String method), use command-line arguments\n\n\nCode Documentation and Structure\nDocument code segments:\nUse indentation, white space, comments, and documentation strings; generate documentation by using pydoc\nConstruct and analyze code segments that include function definitions:\nCall signatures, default values, return, def, pass\n\n\nTroubleshooting and Error Handling\nAnalyze, detect, and fix code segments that have errors:\nSyntax errors, logic errors, runtime errors\nAnalyze and construct code segments that handle exceptions:\ntry, except, else, finally, raise\nPerform unit testing\nUnittest, functions, methods, and assert methods (assertIsInstance, assertEqual, assertTrue, assertIs, assertIn)\n\n\nOperations using Modules and Tools\nPerform basic file system and command-line operations by using built-in modules:\nio, os, os.path, sys (importing modules, opening, reading and writing files, command-line arguments)\nSolve complex computing problems by using built-in modules:\nMath (fabs, ceil, floor, trunc, fmod, frexp, nan, isnan, sqrt, isqrt, pow, pi) datetime (now, strftime, weekday), random (randrange, randint, random, shuffle, choice, sample)\n\n\n\nWhy learn Python?\nPython is easy to learn. The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:\nAutomation\nPython can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.\nWeb Development\nPython is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.\nData Science\nEarlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.\n\nPython is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.",

I have based each and every question off of the objectives directly from CompTIA to help you prepare to take and pass the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 exam on your first try as many of the students in my live classes have done!\nI have written thousands of practice questions very similar to these for college courseware vendors that are used globally for IT courses. If you've taken a college course with a CompTIA certification as part of the curriculum, it's possible that I was the one that wrote the questions throughout the course, including your midterms and final exams.\nThese 5 practice tests are broken down by domain and individual objective so you can see where your strengths and weaknesses are and spend more time studying up on the areas where you might need a little more practice. You'll have between 1 and 2 minutes per question in these tests, though on the actual exam you'll have 90 minutes for up to 90 questions. Be sure to read each question completely and thoroughly to be sure you understand exactly what the question is asking. Just as with CompTIA's questions, sometimes questions may have extra information that is irrelevant to what is actually being asked, while other questions will be very straightforward.\nWhether you found this course through my YouTube channel or through my website or through some other method, I'd love to hear any feedback you might have about these questions.

It is not meant to test your reading ability or ability to apply those concepts in complex environments, but rather to ensure that you are able to define what each of these components are. If you can define the components, you should be able to apply logic and reasoning for how they may be able to be used in both the real world as well as the exam.",
        "Please note that this set of practice tests should not be your only form of preparation for the exam. It is simply designed to help measure some of the areas where you have knowledge compared to areas where you do not to help you build your knowledge well before taking the real exam."

Look no further than these high-quality AWS DevOps Professional practice exams to assess your exam-readiness and get certified for DOP-C02.\nOur course includes 6 AWS practice exams that include a total of 130 unique practice questions. All of our practice tests accurately reflect the difficulty of the Amazon Web Services exam questions and are the most realistic AWS exam experience available on Udemy.\nIf you're looking for easy-to-pass questions, our Amazon AWS practice tests may not be for you. Our students love these high-quality practice tests because they simulate the actual certification exam and help them get a better understanding of AWS concepts.\nOur questions are continually revised based on feedback from students who have recently taken the AWS exam, so you can be sure that they are up-to-date and reflect the latest exam format.\nOur practice exam course is designed to give you a thorough understanding of the key concepts and topics covered in the DOP-C02 exam. Based on your test report that provides you with detailed feedback, you get to identify areas where you need to improve and build the confidence you need to succeed in the actual exam.\n\n\nTOP REASONS WHY THESE PRACTICE EXAMS ARE YOUR BEST CHANCE TO ACE YOUR AWS EXAM\n100% ALIGNED WITH LATEST DOP-C02 EXAM: All practice tests on Udemy are scenario-based reflecting the latest AWS exam question/answer format (1 answer from 4 options, or 2 or more answers from 5 or more options)\nSIMULATE THE REAL CERTIFICATION EXAM: Practice tests are timed (130 min to answer 65 questions) and scored (passing score is 72%) accurately mirroring the real exam environment. This allows you to become familiar with the AWS exam format\nDETAILED EXPLANATIONS FOR ALL ANSWERS: Once you complete our practice tests, you'll have the opportunity to review and check your answers. Each question includes a detailed explanation that describes why each answer is either correct or incorrect, supporting your understanding of AWS Services which is key to passing the exam\nREGULAR UPDATES OF QUESTIONS: We are constantly improving and updating our questions based on exam feedback from thousands of our students. As a result, most of our students achieve exceptional results, with an average exam score of over 85%.\nTEST REPORT: Upon completion of the practice test, you'll receive a comprehensive report that provides insight into your progress and highlights the AWS knowledge areas you need to focus on the most in your studies\nRESPONSIVE SUPPORT: All of your questions, concerns, and feedback will be comprehensively addressed by our team of AWS experts\nACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD: Participate in AWS-related discussions on our Q&A discussion board, where our students share their exam experiences and offer valuable feedback on the topics covered.\nMOBILE ACCESS: Study on the go and access all practice questions from your mobile phone - anywhere, anytime\n\n\nHOW TO BEST PREPARE FOR YOUR AWS CERTIFICATION EXAM\nKEY TRAINING ADVICE: While the pass mark for the actual AWS exam is 72%, we highly recommend that you continue taking our AWS practice exams until you achieve a consistent score of 80% or higher. Once you reach this recommended score on our practice tests, you'll be well-prepared to sit the actual exam and achieve a great score.\nGET FAMILIAR WITH THE ACTUAL EXAM FORMAT: Our AWS Certified DevOps Pro practice exams are specifically designed to help you become familiar with the test question format and structure of the actual AWS exam. Unlike many other practice tests on the market, our exams closely match the format of the real AWS exam, ensuring that you are adequately prepared for the real AWS exam.\nDEEPEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE: It's important to note that while our AWS practice exams match the style and pattern of the actual exam, they are not brain dumps. Simply memorizing answers will not prepare you for the real AWS certification exam. Instead, we recommend using our AWS DevOps practice exams to deepen your understanding which will give you the best chance of passing your exam no matter what questions you encounter on exam day.\nCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: These days, most IT roles require AWS training and certification, as Amazon Web Services has become the leading provider of cloud computing services. Our AWS practice tests and supporting training resources are designed to give you a competitive edge and help you pass your AWS Certified DevOps certification exam with confidence.\n\n\nYOUR INSTRUCTOR\nHi, I'm Neal Davis, and I'm delighted to be your instructor for this course.

No matter if you wish to pass Python PCEP Certified Entry-Level Programmer or check your skills for a junior Python developer interview, these practice tests will help you gain more confidence and recap Python foundations.\nThe tests in this course are fully PCEP-aligned. The number and type of questions correspond 100% to the certification format. You'll have the same time limit and the same passing score as in the real exam. This means the tests are an excellent way to check your skills before you take the exam.\nThe tests don't just verify your knowledge, they also teach. The questions come with explanations that will help you understand why a certain answer is correct. However, keep in mind these tests are not a complete Python course and they are not intended for complete beginners. If you have never written a line of code before, you may first want to look for a dedicated PCEP course here on Udemy.\nThe time for each test is 45 minutes. The passing score is 70%. Each test contains 30 questions:\nExam Block #1 Computer Programming and Python Fundamentals (7 questions)\nExam Block #2 Control Flow (8 questions)\nExam Block #3 Data Collections (7 questions)\nExam Block #4 Functions and Exceptions (8 questions)",
