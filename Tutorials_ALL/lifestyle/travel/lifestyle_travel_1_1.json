We can get you there!\nWithin 1 hour you will have gained the knowledge that it took me 5 years to obtain.\n\nUpdate July 2018: Added a section that teaches you how to keep your points from expiring. Because I earned hundreds of thousands of points in the past couple of years I needed to keep them from expiring. I added a lecture that teaches you that. Cheers.\n\n\nI'm giving you this knowledge so you can be inspired to travel but also have a means to travel. Everybody wants to see other countries but they just don't know how to make it work. I will show you how to overcome the biggest obstacle - the plane ticket.\nOver the past 5 years I've traveled to over 10 countries and my flights have been FREE! I paid the taxes on the ticket and that's it! I do this by taking advantage of credit card sign up bonuses.\nIn this course you will learn how to do the same.\nThis course is for students who live in the United States.\nThis course is NOT for students who have a significant amount of credit card debt.",

      "description": "Do you want to be a digital nomad, work as an expat employee, or retire in another country?\nDo you feel overwhelmed thinking about all the steps involved in moving to a foreign country?\nAre you unsure or anxious about preparing to move abroad?\n\n\nIf you answered “YES!” to any of these questions, then this course is for you!\n\n\nHow to Move, Live and Work Abroad: Start Your Expat Journey is THE course you need to begin planning your life abroad! By the time you finish the course, you'll have an actionable step-by-step plan for all of the things you need to do in the months before your moving date.\n\n\nNo matter where you are moving from and where you want to go to, you’ll come away from this course knowing exactly what you need to do to get ready for the next international chapter of your life!\n\n\n===\nPlease note that this is the first course in a 2-part series on moving abroad and settling in a new country. This course is focused on the steps you need to take before your moving date. The second course in the series, “How to Move, Live, and Work Abroad: Settling Into Expat Life,” covers everything you need to do within the first year after moving to a new country.\n===\n\n\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THE COURSE\n\"This is very useful. When coming from someone who has done it themselves, you get these details and caveats that you will never learn when simply researching the information online on your own. David provides the framework that allows you to not get overwhelmed by the number of things you need to consider when moving abroad. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is serious about moving abroad!\" - Louigi\n\n\n\"This was a very thoughtful and informative course. David provides step-by-step instructions on how to successfully reach your goal of living and working abroad. Through his story and experiences, he shows you how attainable this dream can be with careful planning and hard work. Living abroad can seemingly be a daunting, scary endeavor but with David’s course you’ll hopefully see that it doesn’t have to be!\" - Andrew\n\n\n\"This course was great! It covered everything I could think of for moving abroad. David's presentation was straightforward and easy to understand - I especially liked that he gave specific examples of services I could use for shipping my things abroad, etc. Thanks, David!\" - Thomas\n\n\nWHO THIS COURSE IS FOR\nAnyone interested in or considering the idea of going abroad for work or travel - this course is not specific to any particular countries, nationalities, or lifestyles, so people moving from and to anywhere for any reason will be able to get a ton of value out of it!\nAspiring expats and nomads who are already making plans to go abroad - even if you are already in the middle of planning your international journey, take this course to make sure you don’t forget to add some important items to your to-do list!\nCurrent expats and nomads thinking about moving again - it’s good to have a reference guide handy to keep you on track even if you have been through the painful and challenging process of moving abroad before!\n\n\nWHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THIS COURSE\n\n\nIf you’re looking for empty platitudes and generic information that won’t help you to achieve your international goals, then look elsewhere! Expat Empire courses are focused on providing useful, honest, and actionable advice to help students just like you to take their next steps abroad.\n\n\nThe content in this course is comprised of a mix of 1) your instructor David’s personal experiences and learnings that you can apply to your situation and 2) thorough discussions on the lesson topics along with actionable recommendations.\n\n\nOriginally from the United States, David has lived in Singapore, China, Japan, Germany, and Portugal, and he will share all the tips and tricks he has picked up over the last decade in this course. Most lessons feature David speaking over presentation slides so that you can hear his advice and perspective while seeing the main takeaways to take notes easily.\n\n\nIn addition to in-depth videos on all these topics, most lessons include additional resources such as relevant blog posts, important takeaways from the discussions, and Google Sheets worksheets to help you implement the material taught in the lessons.\n\n\nCOURSE STRUCTURE & CONTENT\n\n\nThis course is separated into two main sections, 3+ Months Before the Move and Less than 3 Months Before the Move, so that you can refer to the information you need exactly when you need it. Ideally, you will want to make sure to complete the tasks in the first section before the 3-month mark prior to the flight to your destination and then tackle the tasks in the second section in the last 3 months leading up to your moving date.\n\n\nAfter completing this course, you’ll be able to:\nDetermine the lifestyle you want to have abroad and balance the cost of living with your budget\nUnderstand how you can make money abroad and maximize your potential earnings\nGather the documents you’ll need for your visa application\nManage your money across countries and currencies\nHelp your pets have a smooth landing in your new country\nPlan for the best education options for your children abroad\nSave money on booking flights and accommodation\nLive a more minimal life by reducing the belongings you’ll take overseas\nDeal with the hassles of postal mail and international shipping addresses\nPrepare your phone numbers, SIM cards, and more so you can use them abroad\n\n\nIn short, you’ll be able to confidently move forward with your international plans with a solid understanding of the multitude of challenges you’ll have to overcome.\n\n\nMEET YOUR INSTRUCTOR\nDavid McNeill is the founder of Expat Empire, a company committed to helping people around the world to move abroad.

B. wirst du in der First Class oder Business Class fliegen und das zum Economy Preis. Ich zeige dir wie du kostenloses Hotelübernachtungen erhältst oder von Hotel und Mietwagen-Upgrades profitierst. Sei auf deinen Reisen vollkommen abgesichert. Erhalte durch deine täglichen Ausgaben und dem richtigen System Sachprämien oder Cashback zurück. Bezahle deine Fixkosten wie Miete, Versicherungen, Strom mit den richtigen Tools und generiere dadurch Meilen. Ich zeige dir wie du durch verschiedene Verknüpfungen doppelt und dreifach punktest.\n\n\nIch erzähle dir davon, wie ich es geschafft habe von Frankfurt nach Dubai in der First Class und Business Class zu fliegen und dafür 240€ bezahlt zuhabe (Stand März 2022). Anhand meines Beispiels wirst du erkennen wie leicht es ist deine Traumreise zu realisieren und das ohne dein Ausgaben sonderlich zu erhöhen. Wenn du die Tipps, Tricks und Hacks umsetzt, bereit dazu bist ein bisschen Zeit und Geld zu investieren dann wird das dein Reisekomfort in den kommenden 6-12 Monaten erhöhen.\n\n\nKurz zu meiner Person:\nIch bin Robert und wohne seit meiner Geburt in Heilbronn. Ich arbeite seit einigen Jahren als Arbeitnehmer im Angestelltenverhältnis und beziehe ein in Deutschland geltendes durchschnittliches Gehalt. Wie du siehst ein recht „normaler“ Mensch und kein Fußballprofi, Hollywoodstar oder Multimillionär.\n\n\nMeine Leidenschaft galt schon immer dem Reisen. Selbst wenn ich nur einmal im Jahr, National oder International vereiste, stellte ich mir immer einige Fragen: wie reise ich komfortabler, wie erhalte ich Flug oder Hotel Upgrades, benötige ich Versicherungen usw. vielleicht kommen dir diese Fragen bekannt vor. Wenn JA dann bist du hier genau Richtig.

You'll come away from it with an actionable step-by-step plan for all of the things you need to do in the first year after leaving home.\n\n\nNo matter where you are moving from and want to move to, you’ll come away from this course knowing exactly what you need to do to get comfortable and make a successful transition to your life abroad!\n\n\n===\nPlease note that this is the second course in a 2-part series on moving abroad and settling in a new country.

This course is focused on everything you need to do in the first twelve months after moving to a new country.\n===\n\n\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THE COURSE\n\"I could not believe all the different details and specifics this class provided-I found this course as I was looking for a broader overview on moving to other countries after living abroad in one spot for a couple years, and David's experience was just what I needed to prepare for another big move!\" - Ellen S\n\n\n\"I totally recommend this course to anyone planning to relocate! It's really informative and useful. David is very knowledgeable and has very interesting insights about life abroad.\" - Natalia\n\n\n\"This course complements David's first one quite well, highlighting the exciting (and challenging) aspects of life abroad. Everything from learning the local language to doing your taxes in one or more countries, David clearly lays out everything you'll need to anticipate. He's very succinct in his delivery, but uses relevant personal experiences to make the content come to life!\" - Amy J\n\n\nWHO SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE\nAnyone interested in or considering the idea of going abroad for work or travel - this course is not specific to any particular countries, nationalities, or lifestyles, so people moving from and to anywhere for any reason will be able to get a ton of value out of it!\nAspiring expats and nomads who are already making plans to go abroad - even if you are already in the middle of planning your international journey, take this course to make sure you don’t forget to add some important items to your to-do list!\nExpats and nomads who have recently gone abroad - if you are wondering how you are going to manage everything you have on your plate as a new person living outside of your home country, watch this course to get some answers!\n\n\nWHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THIS COURSE\n\n\nIf you’re looking for empty platitudes and generic information that won’t help you to achieve your international goals, then look elsewhere!

      "description": "Do you have the desire to travel but just don't know where to begin?\nWell, I've got your back. With eight years of travel experience, I have built this comprehensive course to give you the knowledge, skills, and confidence to plan and execute your dream trip.\nI've divided it up into 9 easy-to-follow sections from common misconceptions, choosing and organizing your itinerary, finding affordable flights, and booking your perfect accommodation, a pre-trip checklist, to on-the-trip advice. I hand over to you all my top budgeting tips on how to make your trip stretch from a month to six months, as well as my ultimate guide to staying safe on the road.\nBasically, this course is everything that I wish I knew before I left on my first backpacking trip in 2014.\n\nYou get instant access to:\n4 hours of invaluable travel content with coinciding tasks to ensure you are taking the necessary steps toward your dream trip.\nA downloadable pdf guiding you through the course.\nAccess to the Travel with Jules exclusive Facebook group where you can connect with other aspiring travellers on the course.\nThe option to reach out to me personally through various social media forms or a videocall to settle any questions you may have.\nLifetime access to the course and all future updates.\n\n\nBut what will you learn in detail in this course?\nMisconceptions: In this beginning section, I crush the common misconceptions that prevent people from travelling. You'll maybe realise that one of them resonates with you, and it will give you a push in the right direction to start planning your trip. You'll jump to the next section with excitement and motivation.\nWhere to begin?: Now that you understand what has been stopping you from travelling, we'll start with how to choose your destination, and how to begin planning and figuring out what kind of traveller you are. You will discover whether you are a fast vs slow traveller and about the dangers of overplanning. Once the destination is decided and the trip is semi-planned, we'll move on to your saving goal and how to reach it.\nFlight hacks: In this crazy time in which we are living, flight prices have skyrocketed making travelling to distant destinations almost out of reach. Well, maybe for those who have zero clue about flight hacking. Lucky for you, I have it sussed out and in this detailed section I hand over to you my top tips for cheating the airlines and finding affordable flights. You'll learn all the hacks to finding the best and most affordable flight for your trip (so that hard-earned money can be put aside for your actual trip).\nFinding and booking that perfect accommodation: With hostel life booming and more and more hostels popping up throughout the globe, scrolling through Hostelworld and finding the right hostel has become a tough task. Having slept in 100s of hostels over the years, I've got you covered with a comprehensive guide to finding the perfect hostel for you. You'll learn how to suss out the best hostels, including what to look for in terms of location, price and amenities, and how to sidestep the god-awful ones. Hostel life not for you? I've thrown in an extensive Airbnb guide for good measure. You'll learn how to spot the good Airbnbs from the bad as I share with you my own experiences. You'll leave this section full of the insight and confidence to book your ideal hostel or Airbnb.\nPre-trip checklist: This section is an important one and one your mum & dad would want you to watch. We're talking packing lists, visas, vaccines, travel insurance, money management on the road and must-download travel apps. Trust me you'll thank me later.\nTravelling on a small budget: This section is my favourite as it covers ways to stay on a low budget and crushes the most common misconception of 'I need so much money to travel'.  You'll gain an insight into ways to stretch that budget further like using Workaway, Couchsurfing and hitchhiking to ramble your way around the world. You'll learn top budgeting tips from my eight years of low-budget travel and finish the section feeling positive that any travel is possible on a budget.\nOn-the-trip advice: This section is really knowledge and advice which I wish I had before starting my travelling journey. You'll gain an insight into the common feelings you will have when on the road (because let's be honest, it's not all rainbows and sunshine), how to make those connections with other travellers and have more of an understanding of Instagram vs reality.\nSafety and scams: This is the final section of the Travel like a Pro course. As a solo female traveller for many years, I hand over my ultimate safety tips to other female travellers. But listen up, these tips can help all travellers (irrelevant of gender) so if you want to learn how to keep yourself and your belongings safe on the road and how to avoid the most common travel scams, tune in for my final section.\nOur Satisfaction Guarantee\nWe have a 30 day 100% money back guarantee. So if you are not satisfied with your purchase, you will get all your money back immediately!\nI'm looking forward to guiding you towards your dream trip!\nJules",

I’ve enjoyed living here so much, and I wanted to create a course to share just how easy it is for others to make this great country their home. This course walks students through the process of applying for an economic independence visa to live in Portugal. It also covers banking, taxes, and tax-preferred status for foreign residents. It outlines the process for purchasing a car and getting a driver license in Portugal. It goes over what options you will have for healthcare here in Portugal – including access to public health service. The final module goes over some different locations around Portugal that you may choose to visit as you search for your new home. I tried to include locations based on a variety of interests and financial needs. This course includes reflective activities, samples of documents, links to outside sources to assist you in the immigration process, as well as resources for contacts who can assist you with things you may need once you arrive in Portugal. Just a note, I am not an attorney or financial professional. This course is informational and reflects my experiences only. It’s always best to seek out a licensed professional before you make immigration or financial decisions.",

Molte agende digitali includono notifiche, timer e suoni per segnalare il passaggio da un’attività all’altra, rendendo ancora più efficace la gestione del tempo.\nIn questo breve corso inserisco anche un Tutorial per l'utilizzo della App Visual Agenda (disponibile sia su Apple che su Google).\n\nInsieme all’agenda, è utile la Task analysis, uno strumento visivo che scompone un’attività in passaggi semplici e sequenziali, facilitandone l’apprendimento. Di questo tratterà l'ultimo video del corso, proponendo 3 esempi (lavare la mani, preparare un panino, apparecchiare la tavola).\nAgenda visiva e task analysis si completano a vicenda e sono utilizzabili con bambini e adulti, anche in contesti scolastici, terapeutici o lavorativi.",

Detailed descriptions of the best beaches all over the island will help you plan the perfect beach day to remember for a lifetime.

The Maui Quick Start Travel Guide was written with one goal in mind – to make sure you have the best experience possible while visiting the Valley Isle!\nAbout the Expert\nDena Gray is a writer and graphic artist who lives in Upcountry, Maui with her husband and two children. After moving to Maui in 2010, she set out to learn all there was to know about this island paradise she now calls home.

      "description": "Navigation: Piloting Small Boats\nAs a Naval Officer I learned a navigation protocol that says do not rely on one method of navigation. So that would mean we should not rely heavily only on our GPS devices. Let's look at a couple of scenarios.\nScenario 1: You are just starting out in boating. Maybe you are a little unsure how to navigate to a port a short distance away and you plan on using your GPS to get there. You don't plan on using a paper chart since a chart is loaded onto your GPS. The problem with this scenario is that you are depending 100% on your GPS to get where you want go. If the GPS fails you will be in a dilemma. Once you leave port it is difficult to look at a surrounding shore line to determine your position.\nScenario 2: Maybe you have many years of boating experience. You plan to go to a destination in Open Ocean that is 30 NM away. You plan to use your GPS to navigate all the way. You do have charts and probably have them open on your navigation table, but you haven't been using the charts to correlate and verify your position with the GPS. You may have a very good idea where you are on the chart, but if the GPS batteries die, you are stuck with getting your positon updated on the chart.\nIn this course I will show you how to plot a course to your destination. Take the Lat/Long coordinates from your GPS and mark them on your plot. Take sights on landmarks to confirm your location on the plot. Use depth sounder data to confirm your position. Be able to dead reckon your progress on the plot.\nThe course will use charts from the New England coast. The skills I will show you will be easily adaptable to lakes and rivers of the USA and also to other international waters of the world. I will mention areas where differences may be an issue.",

We’ll teach you the shortcut for how to plan your retreat WHILE building your business and help you get clear on what to teach and who your tribe is.\nAround half of our group tends to be newbies.

But ask them – how many international retreats have THEY actually designed, planned, and run successfully (meaning they actually filled it and made money)?\nJust because someone has RUN a few retreats – that does NOT make them an expert!\nThrough our travel company, Journeys of the Spirit, we’ve planned and managed OVER A THOUSAND retreats. And through our coaching company, Wanderlust Entrepreneur, we’ve educated over 15,000 retreat leaders through our retreat training programs.\nWe know what it takes to launch a successful and lucrative transformational retreat that’s deeply life-changing.\nWe know the law.\nWe know the problems that can arise on a retreat because we’ve actually experienced them.\nWe’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly – and we’re here to share our expertise so that YOU don’t have to experience the mistakes and issues that we did when we started back in 2003.\nSo again, YES you should attend this event because there’s NO ONE out there with our level of experience – PERIOD.\n\n\nHi! I’m Sheri Rosenthal, and like many of you I’m a coach, author, speaker, and retreat leader.\nAfter 18 years of practicing medicine and being trapped in an office, my biggest fantasy was creating a lifestyle that allowed me to travel, work, and live anywhere in the world.\nWhen I sold my practice, I felt like I could FINALLY create my dream life.\nThat was back in 1998, and after leaving medicine, I started studying with and working for don Miguel Ruiz, author of The Four Agreements.\nWorking for don Miguel was the biggest blessing in my life because I got to plan and manage all his retreats – which were life-changing for me!\nThe experience inspired me to open my own travel company in 2003, Journeys of the Spirit® – a boutique travel agency specializing in worldwide experiential travel and transformational destination retreats.\nOver the past 22 years, we’ve planned and managed over 1000 retreats!\nAfter seeing how many retreat leaders were struggling with how to design, properly price, market, and monetize their retreats – I decided it was time to put an end to that struggle and properly train our amazing retreat leaders on how to run safe (with the proper legal forms and insurance) and lucrative retreats that fill with the perfect people.\nSo in 2014, I created Wanderlust Entrepreneur, where I’ve taught over 15,000 passion-driven entrepreneurs how to design experiential and transformational destination retreats through our online programs, as well as our live and virtual events (like this one).\nThe bottom line is that there’s no one out there right now teaching about retreats that has the depth and breadth of experience like we do.\nWe’ve seen it all: the good, the bad, and the ugly – and we consider it our honor and our mission to train our transformational leaders so that they can confidently handle any issue that comes up during the planning and execution of their retreat.\n\n\nLOVE FROM OUR STUDENTS:\n\n\nI’m absolutely loving this retreat training event! Sheri seriously rocks! I’ve been a professional life and business coach and therapist for over two decades, and so often these trainings leave you flat and still seeking value. However, this training has been invaluable – I can’t wait to finish and get started on development.\nBrett Baughman, CEO Master the Masses - Life & Business Coach\n\n\nI’ve invested over 6 figures on education in the last decade from seminars, trainings, and masterminds for business and personal development from the top leaders in the space, and while most of them were amazing, Sheri Rosenthal’s way of teaching tops ALL of them. PS: most of the education here is not new to me – but the way you have put it together and deliver it hits home deeply.

There is a window of opportunity (and who knows how long it will be open for).\nI started my location-independent business back in 2012 and I've been traveling the world, going to exotic locations like Chang Mai, Thailand, Medellin, Colombia, and even areas off the beaten path, like El Tuno, El Salvador.\nOver the last 8 years, I've deconstructed the digital nomad lifestyle into a science. I've broken down step-by-step how to earn income, travel around the world, meet cool people, and what's more, do it legally (haha).\nWhile enjoying the laptop lifestyle, I also noticed that it comes with it's own set of problems.\nAs I got older, I started to wonder about things like:\n- Health Insurance\n- Paying Taxes\n- Longterm Visa Requirements\n- Safety & Security\nI put together this digital nomad framework so that you can hit the ground running. Rather than waiting years to pursue your dream, you can get started within the course of 60 days!\nThese are practical and powerful strategies to immediately see progress towards this dream. It's a surefire formula for earning a location-independent income online, along with some freshly minted insights into the BEST places to travel around the world as a digital nomad.\nI've broken this entire system down into three major components:\nI: Income independence - earn income anywhere\nL: Location selection - choose the best digital nomad hub for your needs\nL: Lifestyle mastery - knowing how to make friends, safeguard your health, and more.\nYou'll gain profound clarity once you get your hands on these resources, which I deliver in an easy-to-digest bite-sized manner.\nHow many years have you already wasted dreaming about the digital nomad lifestyle?\nThis time next year would you rather stuck in traffic on the way to your 9-5 job, or sipping on an iced coffee, answering some emails, taking in the sun, and relaxing on a pristine beach in Thailand.\nThis is your passport to a totally new career, lifestyle, and future. All you gotta do is claim it as yours!",

      "description": "(Please note that this is the free version that does not contain all the content described below)\n\n\nThe travel industry is dead it is said. Fear and lockdowns have grounded most international flights as most air travel has come to a halt. Many think it is impossible to travel during times like these. As for me, I've travelled to Asia, Latin America and Africa during these times of global lockdowns. It is absolutely possible. Things are obviously much more difficult then they were in the past. But it is going to be what it is. I'm a living testimony that going out and seeing the world is still something that can be done. One merely needs to have the will and determination to do what it is that they want to do.\n\n\nFolks that aren't convinced like to tell me how lucky I am for being able to travel to all of these different places. I smile politely. But what I don't tell passing acquaintances is that I grew up in a low income household and qualified for US Federal Aid to help me through college.\nI've lived like a pauper at times, but the places I've been and the people met has made it all worth it.\nThis course will be us walking through the process of making that happen for you. And this is all personal, hard earned experience which I have learned over the past few years living and traveling in East Asia to North America, South America & Africa.\nAnd yes, even during the lockdown ridden post Covid Pandemic world. I muddled my way through university. If I can do it, why can't you?\n\n\nThe New Normal Abroad\n\n\nThose that have done any international travel will likely look back on those times with nostalgia because they aren't coming back for a long time (think years).\nThere is already plenty of blogs, articles, podcasts and the like related to the travel/overseas-living sector. But most of it has been made irrelevant by the upheaval of 2020.\nBut I have been on the ground moving and living country to country, continent to continent since this mess all started. This wild ride has taken me from Asia to N. America, S. America & Africa.\n\n\nTo Give You A Better Understanding of What You'll Be Getting, here is a course overview (please note that this course overview is for the full course, not the free version):\n\n\nModule 1: Preplanning: Steps to take before your departure\nFolks worry about not having money to make the leap. I'll walk you through what I did when I was a corporate cog. From alternative FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) to \"Travel Hacking\" techniques I haven't found anywhere else.\nModule 2: Picking Your Destination: COL (Cost of Living) Arbitrage\nLife abroad doesn't mean a glamourous \"makin' it rain\" lifestyle (though it can be). Being an accountant, I'll break down costs to expect as well as my own personal P/L statements across 3 continents (in Thailand, Mexico & Tanzania)\nModule 3: West Meets the World: Adjusting to Living Overseas\nCulture shock is real. From safety to banking, culture and language with everything in between, I'll show you everything I've learned on how to insert yourself into a foreign country.\nModule 4: Covid Travels (Movement in the Age of Travel Restrictions)\nIf you think culture shock is rough, think of adjusting from the 2010's travel to the 2020's is an electrocution. Face palm misadventures. I'll take you through adjusting and adapting to a new type of international citizenship.",

      "description": "High Altitude Vacationing is for people who are planning to vacation in a mountain region. The higher altitude reduces the amount of oxygen that will reach the body’s tissue, including the brain. You may have heard of people going to Denver, and other high altitude locations, to train for elite sports. But we won’t need an elaborate training center. This training is designed for those of us who live at lower altitudes. You’ll progress through 10 exercises that will help your body begin to adapt to the higher altitude while still in the comforts of home, even if you're at sea level. Changes in your body can include an increase in red blood cells, giving your blood more oxygen carrying capacity prior to your vacation. You will learn a more functional breathing pattern that gives greater tissue oxygenation and less shortness of breath. Using the new, more optimal breathing pattern and techniques will allow you to maintain a higher blood oxygen level, ease work of breathing, and have more energy when traveling. Vacations can be expensive. Don't waist money, or your time, feeling poorly. After training for 4-6 weeks prior to your trip, you will be able to enjoy new activities, feel stronger, happier and get more enjoyment while exploring new places and making new friends.",

      "description": "Juneau, Alaska is an integral part of the United States, yet offers up the feeling that’s it’s a world away from the Lower 48. Juneau holds the unique title of being not only the largest capital city by land mass but one of the most remote as well. Inaccessible by land, Juneau is a city that requires visitors to make the trek by sky or sea when the siren call of Alaska rings out loud and clear. While some are called in the pursuit of a wild adventure in the heart of nature, others make their way unassuming by cruise ship, only to get caught up in the unexpected beauty and grace this island city provides. Whether it’s glaciers, bear, whales or the charm of a downtown dotted with boutique shops that appeal to the adventurer in you, Juneau is worth a visit.\nRich in history and culture, this is a city that provides a look at a native past that’s delicately balanced against an ever-growing hub of tourism. Learn to let go of expectations when you arrive in Juneau. It’s a city that asks you to put one foot in the rainforest and one in the ocean for an experience quite unlike any other.\nAbout the Expert\nCaitlyn Knuth is a lifelong writer who was inspired to put a pen to paper as a child long before spelling skills were acquired. Constantly captivated by the pictures words have the power to paint and the owner of a spirit that is always ready for the next travel adventure, she’s found her muse alive and well through the process of exploring new cities and sharing what she’s found with the world.\nAn initial trip to Juneau several years ago left a bigger impression than she originally expected. Prepared for bears, she fell in love at first sight with the whales that call this area home. Unaccustomed to the raincoat culture that is essential to Juneau, she found herself enamored with the endless mist and fog that frequently roll in and give this rainforest packed city an enchanting take on weather patterns. It’s a place that’s hard to shake long after the trip has ended. When new cities follow you around, they’re worth writing about. A passion for discovering the unexpected inspired her to put together a comprehensive guide to visiting the best of Juneau—with the understanding that this course is nothing more than an encouraging starting point to a greater adventure.",

      "description": "Have you ever said to yourself \"I'd like to hike but I don't have the right gear?\" and then not gone on a hike?\n\nYou may be worried that you'll:\n\n\nhave to spend hundreds of dollars on hiking gear - that you may not even use all that often\nbuy expensive hiking boots that will be useless because they give you painful blisters\nforget something important like toilet paper - and only realize it at an inopportune moment\nhave to spend hours researching which hiking gear to buy - and you don't have time for that\nbring so much gear that you won't be able to walk - let alone hike\nbuy gear that you'll never use and it will just sit in your closet collecting dust\nI get it. Because that was me when I first started hiking. That's why I created this hiking gear guide - so that you can avoid the expensive (and painful) mistakes I made.\n\nHi, I'm Laurel\nI'll never forget the first pair of hiking boots I bought over 20 years ago.\nI bought them in the morning in my regular size and wore them for a few hours in the afternoon to break them in before wearing them on an easy hike the next day.\nWithin minutes I could feel both my big toes rubbing on the tip of my boots. The pain intensified as the day went on and became unbearable on the way back which was downhill, further smashing my big toes into boots.\nWhen I arrived home and took off my boots, my feet were covered in blood and my toenails had already started to blacken.\nBut I had spent a lot of money on these hiking boots which were now non-returnable since I'd already worn them. So after giving the blisters a week to heal and convincing myself that I just \"need to break them in\", I stupidly wore them again, and again.\n\nI stupidly hiked in these boots that gave me blisters and hurt my feet for another six months - not wanting to waste money.\n\n\nI later learned that \"expensive\" didn't always mean better and learned a costly lesson about when not to buy hiking boots.\n\n\nWhile it took me a while to learn that lesson, I still had a lot to learn when it came to gear - sometimes I overpacked, other times and one time I didn't bring enough and encountered a freak snowstorm with only a light summer jacket for protection. Brrrr.\n\n\nThat's why I've created the How to Buy the Right Day Hiking Gear Course - to take the guesswork out of what to bring so that your hikes are memorable - for all the right reasons.\n\nIn How to the Buy the Right Hiking Gear Course You'll Learn:\n\n\nWhat to buy for your first hike - hint: likely nothing\n\nthe 3 most important pieces of gear + tips for choosing the right ones - saving you hundreds of dollars on gear you'll never use\n\nRecommended additional gear - saving you $$$ and tons of research time\n\nHow much water to bring and recommended snacks to eat when hiking - so that you'll feel your absolute best\n\n2 recommended very affordable luxury items - that will make you feel oh-so-good after your hike and enable you to walk the next day\n\nHiking gear checklist for easy reference - so you'll never forget anything again and can pack in just minutes",

Dive DEEP into foreign cultures and enjoy authentic, rich connections with the people who live in the places you visit.\nTaught by a professional travel writer, world explorer, and former Rick Steves tour guide   ~   Dave Fox has been featured for his knowledge of foreign cultures on the History Channel, Channel NewsAsia, National Public Radio in the United States, and ABC Radio in Australia.\n\n\nHave you ever known somebody who goes on vacation and comes home with larger-than-life tales to tell – every single time? Have you ever wondered why some people have incredible adventures when they travel, while others have a good time but never seem to go beyond the generic tourist experience? Have you ever wished you could be one of the people who has all the incredible adventures – an intrepid explorer who plunges deep into local cultures, connects with fascinating people, transcends cultural differences, and comes home with wild stories?\n~  This course teaches you how to make that happen ... even if you're an introvert!  ~\nHuge, crazy, life-changing travel experiences don't happen by accident. Yes, there's an element of chance involved as to when they occur, but they happen far more frequently to people who travel with a certain mindset, a special attitude, a willingness to venture beyond the usual guidebook recommendations and dive deep into local life.\nTo some people, that might sound scary, but if you follow the tips in this course, it won't be. You'll discover how to slowly, gently stretch the boundaries of your cultural comfort zones, tiptoeing lightly at first until you gain the confidence to plunge deeper into the enthralling world of culture shock.\nYou'll discover how to...\nTravel with the mindset necessary to transcend mainstream tourism and dive deep into unfamiliar places.\nExplore the challenges (and thrills) of culture shock, and flow with those challenges so that traveling in a foreign environment doesn't feel intimidating.\nConnect with people who live in the places you visit – in authentic ways that are far more sincere and intimate than any scripted tour company activity.\nMake yourself approachable as a traveler, so you meet new friends and gain invitations into people's lives.\nMeet people safely, reading their attitude and body language, and developing a sense of when it's okay to trust a stranger or a potential new friend.\nThis course also includes an interview with Beth Whitman, author of Wanderlust and Lipstick: The Essential Guide for Women Traveling Solo, about travel safety concerns specific to women.\n\n\nDave Fox is a professional travel writer and bestselling author ... and he's one of those people who has deep, rich encounters with the local culture whenever and wherever he travels. For years, Dave has been exploring the world, seeking out unique, sometimes wacky adventures, and teaching aspiring travel writers how to craft amazing tales.\nNow, in this course for non-writers and writers alike, he explains his techniques for plunging deep into foreign environments, immersing himself confidently in cultures he doesn't understand, and connecting with the people who live in the places he writes about.\nAnd hey, Dave believes learning should be entertaining ... so his lessons aren't just full of useful tips for connecting with people in the places you visit. He also weaves lively personal anecdotes into each lesson to illustrate what he teaches! He offers tales from his journeys on five continents as he reveals how he connects with people wherever he goes.\nWhether you're an experienced explorer seeking a deeper level of excitement in your travels, or a new adventurer planning your first trip abroad, you'll discover how to transcend mainstream tourism, break free from guidebook \"must see\" checklists, and connect with local cultures in authentic ways that most travelers wish they could do, but don't know how to.\nIf you've read this far, that probably means you love to travel. You're curious about the world and you want to have the biggest, boldest travel experiences you possibly can. The skills you learn here will enrich your life with extraordinary adventures as you discover how to connect in any culture with people who are different from you.\nMost tourists just skim the surface of the places they visit.

I’m Dave Fox. I’m a freelance travel writer, a bestselling author, and writing and creativity coach. I’ve worked in more than 50 countries as a freelance travel writer, workshop presenter, and international tour guide. I help people write amazing tales about their journeys.\nIf you have dreams of becoming a travel writer – whether it’s so you can publish your work professionally, create a popular personal travel blog, or just write about your travels for the fun of it – I can help you achieve your goals.\nBeginning travel writers: If travel writing is something you’ve wanted to break into, but you haven’t known how to get started, this course will teach you all you need to know to begin writing lively and exciting travel tales today.\nIntermediate travel writers: If you’ve done some travel writing before, but you want to create more polished, compelling stories – stories that stand out in the crowded arena of aspiring travel writers – this course will help you hone your skills, and it will give you a clear understanding of how to succeed in the writing business and get published.\n\nFollow these lessons, and I guarantee you will see an immediate improvement in your writing. You'll learn skills you can start using right away – and skills that will evolve and get even better over time as you keep writing. You’ll gain a clear understanding of the techniques professional writers use to write captivating travel essays, and you’ll discover your own, unique writing voice.\n\nSome of the topics we’ll cover include:\nTransforming your “rough-draft” travel diaries into compelling personal travel essays with attention-grabbing beginnings, streamlined middles, and meaningful endings – and why you must follow a very different writing style from your “on-the-road” journals when you write travel tales for others to read.\nSpotting and capturing the details that make a story sparkle and writing about them in ways that make readers feel like they’re right there with you.\nBringing characters to life through quotes and vivid description, and navigating the ethical and legal issues that come with writing about other people.\nAvoiding stale clichés that weigh down potentially great writing and coming up with fresh, original alternatives.\nGetting started in travel blogging.\nPitching and selling your articles to newspapers, magazines, and anthology books. (Thousands of newspapers and magazines pay freelance writers more for a single story than you'll pay for this workshop!)\nThe most common beginners’ mistake that keeps many aspiring travel writers from getting published – and how to fix it.\nAnd tons of other easy-to-act-on writing tips.\nIf you want to be a great travel writer, there’s another thing you must also be able to do. You must know how to have big adventures – because those adventures will spark your boldest stories. So I’ll also share my tips on how to make exciting things happen when you travel – how to find richer cultural experiences and more meaningful personal encounters in the places you visit. (Even if you’re an introvert!)\n\nThis course is different from other travel writing courses. It doesn’t just offer tips on how you should write; it also explains how you shouldn’t write.\nLots of people try to break into travel writing. Those who don’t succeed usually blame it on not being talented enough – but that’s often not their real problem. Their real problem is they have adopted a set of habits that are weakening their writing.\nOver the two decades I’ve been teaching travel writing workshops, I’ve identified a series of common mistakes beginning writers make. These mistakes weigh their writing down, and hold them back from writing to their full potential. These habits are easy to fix once you know how to spot them in your own work. This course teaches you how.\n\n\nQ: True or False: Only a few lucky people get to become successful travel writers.\nA: False! Being “lucky” has nothing to do with it!\nTalent doesn’t really work that way.\nIf you’re smart enough to understand this webpage, you’ve got all the brain-cells you need to become a successful writer. Doing it on your own is tough, however. Success will come more quickly if you have a teacher, a mentor, to help guide the way.\nI love engaging with my students, and answering  questions in our online forums. So ask me questions at any time! I’m here to help! (I also offer in-depth critiquing and one-on-one coaching for an additional fee – but we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

      "description": "What began as a wild idea turned into the adventure of a lifetime - this is the story of how I traveled around world at age 19, and who I met on the journey. Cult members and college students, chainsmokers and cameramen, this story recounts a slew of traveling adventures and misadventures. It’s about holding your cool while detained in airports, extreme and convoluted economizing, and getting lost at all hours of the night. It includes everything from hitchhiking at 5am to trying on a 1140 dollar dress on a dare. Gratitude and wonder are the hallmarks of my voyage, both for the opportunity to see and experience iconic sites (Louvre, Great Wall of China, Leaning Tower of Pisa) but also for the chance to meet so many wonderful people (and some strange ones, too). It’s being overwhelmed in the Vatican and petting kangaroos on Mount Fuji, but it’s also making friends on airplanes and being so engrossed in conversation that you don’t notice an entire night slip away. This 225-day adventure was the fruit of months of planning, years of working, and a lifetime of dreaming – and no amount of preparation could have helped me anticipate all the outlandish and lovely experiences that awaited me along the way.\n• A trip around the world in 225 days described in about 25,000 words.\n• This story spans three continents, beginning/ending in Philadelphia, PA and going through Hawaii, Japan, China, Vietnam, England, Whales, France, Italy, the Vatican, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hungary. It includes places that were familiar to me (Hawaii, Japan) and places that were brand new and overwhelming (e.g. the Vatican).\n• Everywhere I went, I managed to be both awed and a little homesick – not just for my home, but for the places and people I had already left behind.\n• Some places I spent more time in than others, so some places get two chapters (France) while other countries share (e.g. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hungary).\n• The book is a balance between funny stories/encounters, descriptions of people, and descriptions of the places I visited/sites I saw. It includes stories of both good things that happened as well as some set-backs (including a lot of time spent lost, friction in some relationships, mistakes I made…)\n• The narration is in the first person, in the past tense, and the stories are based on a combination of my travel-journal and my recollections. As such, the perspective is of me, 22 year-old Briana, looking back on the actions of my 19 year-old self. Rather than just being a summary of events, the benefit of 2 years separation allows for quite a bit of reflection about the lessons I learned along the way.\nAbout the Expert\nBriana Grenert was born and raised in Kailua, HI, where she currently resides in a house filled with Star Trek paraphernalia. She recently graduated from Bryn Mawr College where she double majored in Classical Studies and Linguistics, and minored in Neuroscience (because it turns out that being silly does not exclude people from being studious). Languages, alive and dead, are her passion and she’s studied everything from Syriac to Klingon. Currently she works as an instructor, teaching Art, French, Ancient Greek, and Christian History. When people are looking for her, they usually check her church, the library, or the beach. If she’s none of those places, she’s probably on a mountain somewhere (lost). She’s not sure what she wants to be when she grows up…maybe a pastor? Or a professor? Or a writer? But she’s not exactly sold on the entire concept of adulthood and might just put it off indefinitely.",

Constantly captivated by the pictures words alone have the power to paint, and the owner of a spirit that is always ready for the next travel adventure, she’s found her muse alive and well in the city of Paris, France.\nAfter several years spent studying and working in the City of Light and eventually returning home, she realized that no matter how far she went, Paris was always there in the back of her mind, demanding to be acknowledged, in the chicest way possible of course.\nSo…she gave in to the call of the city once again and began writing about her own experiences in France. Through these recollections and personal points of insight, she hopes to reach those who feel Paris inspiring them from a distance and help them find the courage to set off on their own adventures in the City of Love and Light.",

Esto ha generado una transformación de los ecosistemas naturales en ciudades, que hoy están conformadas por distintas tramas y recorridos para los diversos métodos de transporte y conexión. Sin embargo, una de las consecuencias de la incesante construcción de edificios y rascacielos es el distanciamiento que se ha generado entre nuestra vida diaria y los entornos naturales, ricos en biodiversidad, llenos de calma, silencio y conexión interna.\n\n\nHoy, cada vez más personas reconocen la necesidad e importancia que tiene el salir de las ciudades para visitar estos lugares despojados del ruido de las bocinas y el smog. No obstante, la falta de cultura de cuidado de nuestra sociedad hace que el impacto de nuestra visita no sólo sea el de la huella de nuestros zapatos, sino también el de nuestros desechos personales y el de envoltorios u otro tipo de residuos que dejamos olvidados.\n\n\nEn este curso online y de la mano de profesionales y organizaciones expertas en la materia, conocerás el impacto que generan nuestro paso por estos entornos naturales y, por ende, en la salud de los seres vivos que allí habitan, en el equilibrio mismo de ese ecosistema. Aprenderás distintas maneras de prevenir la generación de residuos y cómo hacernos cargo, de manera responsable y sustentable, de aquellos que requieren una gestión posterior.\n\n\nAl finalizar esta experiencia, podrás sentir orgullo por permitirte disfrutar de la naturaleza de manera respetuosa y responsable.",

I was totally broke and had little consistent income.\nBut I took a risk and bought a plane ticket, and now I can happily say, 5 years later, that taking that first step was the best decision of my life.\nNow it is your turn.

Not only for the Hindus but also for the Buddhists Nepal offers a unique -place of pilgrimage as it happens to be the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the apostle of peace and compassion.\nNepal is a place of festivals with some part of the kingdom or the other celebrating some festival during everyday of the year. Festivals may be linked with the remembrance of the departed soul, to herald the different seasons, to mark the beginning or end of the agricultural cycle, to mark the national events, or just family celebrations. On a festive day the Nepalese take their ritual bath, worship different gods and goddesses, visit temple, observe fasting and undertake feasting.

I've worked as a freelance writer and editor for 20+ years, and successfully pitched hundreds of articles and stories over this time. I've also written four books and I run my own blog, What Katie Did Now.\nFor the past two years, I've helped shortlist winners for the TravMedia Awards UK, where I’ve had the privilege of reading hundreds of top travel articles and guidebooks from some of the best writers in the industry. This has given me a unique insight into what makes a good travel story tick.\nIn this course, I pass that intel onto you.\nDuring the course, we'll look at some examples of successful travel writing together and discuss what makes them a success. I also encourage you to try the practical writing exercises that will challenge you to apply what you’ve learned along the way, and which I encourage you to do. Writing is a muscle, and it needs constant toning and practice!\nI've kept the course deliberately short, so that you can get a general awareness of how a travel story should sound, and not feel too overwhelmed by excess information. By the end you should have a better understanding of the travel writing, and hopefully feel more confident and inspired to get going and start practicing.\nMy aim is to not only motivate you to pitch  any outlets you think are suitable, but also to start a blog or write better travel emails for friends and family when you're away, or just better journal entries and stories for yourself.\nMy courses offer more than just technical skills—they provides a supportive and caring community of fellow writers who are as passionate about storytelling as you are. Together, we'll celebrate each milestone, from your first pitch to your first published article.\nWhether you're new to travel writing or  just looking to hone your craft, this course will guide you through the process. Discover the joy of sharing travel stories that matter, and let your writing make a difference. Join us and turn your dreams of being a published writer into reality.\nI'm really looking forward to having you with me on this journey!",

      "description": "Welcome!\nMany people want to go into the backcountry on a camping trip, but don’t know how. There are so many things to learn, and many are vital to you having a good time and returning home, safe and unharmed. A lot of these topics are also really important for the wildlife and environment that you’re going to be visiting, and you should know how best to protect them, if you are heading out to enjoy their areas. Everything in this course is explained simply, but in great detail. You are able to learn at your own pace, from anywhere that is convenient for you, and can go through the entire course in a day, or a year, it’s totally up to you.\nI created this online course so people who are new to backcountry camping, or want to learn more about it, can have just one place to go to, to learn all of the things needed to head out on a backcountry camping trip, from start to finish. I have also priced it economically, as my real passion is to have people head out into the backcountry with the knowledge required for a safe and successful adventure. I sincerely want people to embark on their adventure feeling confident and able to deal with most issues that will arise,  and be able to handle them with ease.\nIn this course, you will find 22 sections each covering a specific topic. Each section will have lectures inside of it, which will go over the items related to that topic. Each lecture will consist of a short video, combined with pictures and examples to go along with what that lecture is covering. Each lecture will cover as much detail as needed for that particular subject. There are over 100 lectures in this course!\nAt the end of some sections, I have also included Alternative Lessons, showing the same topic being discussed in an outdoor setting and in another way, to help those of you who may learn a bit differently. Some sections have resources at the end of them, and others have quizzes, so you can test your knowledge along the way. The entire course is also full of tips and tricks that I’ve learned over the years. You can pick and chose parts of this course, if you are already familiar with certain topics, but as each lecture is short, it is recommended that you view all of the lectures, as there are many ways to do things. You never know what new information you might discover.\nMy name is Christina, and I will be leading you through the course. I have 19 years of experience backcountry camping. The majority of the trips I’ve gone on in the past five years have been solo trips in remote areas. I have also successfully completed many courses in kayaking, canoeing, navigation and wilderness first aid and have gained valuable information along the way. I began sharing my experiences through my blog and YouTube channel in 2015. In 2017, I began creating backcountry camping presentations to share in front of large audiences at events and trade shows, and that has all led me here.\nSo many people have fears associated with backcountry camping, but sometimes, fear can be disguised as a simple lack of knowledge. Learn about all the things you need to know while backcountry camping, and your fears should subside. With knowledge, you have power and my goal here is to give you as much knowledge as possible, so you are sufficiently prepared for your backcountry camping trip and it is filled with incredible moments that will last a lifetime. What are you waiting for? Let’s get started!\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  A paddling course or paddling experience is a pre-requisite for this course, and something that is highly recommended if your backcountry trip involves paddling in any way, and you are not heading out with experienced paddlers.",

      "description": "Are you feeling trapped by your timeshare? You’re not alone—and you’re not powerless. My name is Wayne C. Robinson, and for 15 years, I worked as a frontline timeshare salesperson across the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. I was the person convincing people to buy, but I never saw what happened after the sale. It wasn’t until I retired that I discovered the truth: many of my former clients were frustrated, disappointed, and desperate to cancel their timeshares because the system didn’t work as promised.\n\n\nI was shocked to learn how many owners believed they couldn’t cancel. Determined to help, I did my research and found out that cancellation is not only possible—it’s often much easier than you’ve been led to believe. I created this course and have published many books on online bookstores to share everything I’ve learned, so you can legally and confidently cancel your timeshare without paying thousands to lawyers or cancellation companies.\n\n\nWhy Trust This Course?\nInsider Knowledge: I spent over a decade on the inside, so I know every trick and tactic resorts use to keep you locked in.\nReal Results: Hundreds of owners have already used my step-by-step methods to cancel their timeshares—many in less than 90 days.\nNo Gimmicks, No Scams: I’ve faced criticism from timeshare attorneys, but I’m not practicing law or charging for legal services. I’m simply sharing proven strategies that work.\n\n\nIf you’re skeptical, I understand. The timeshare industry is full of empty promises and expensive “solutions” that rarely deliver. That’s exactly why I built this course—to give you the truth, the tools, and the confidence to take back control.\n\n\nWhy Aren’t There More Reviews?\nMany successful students are required to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) as part of their cancellation process, which prevents them from sharing public reviews. But here’s what I can say: not one person who followed the steps in this course has said it didn’t work.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\nThe legal rights you have as a timeshare owner in the U.S., Mexico, and the Caribbean\nHow to cancel your contract without hiring a lawyer or third-party service\nWhy threats about your credit or lawsuits are empty—and how to protect yourself\nHow to document your cancellation for full legal protection\nThe secrets resorts don’t want you to know (and how to use them to your advantage)\n\n\nWho Is This Course For?\nU.S. timeshare owners (deeded or right-to-use)\nMexico or Caribbean vacation club members\nAnyone tired of rising maintenance fees and broken promises\nOwners who’ve tried contacting the resort and got nowhere\nAnyone ready to cancel and move on, but unsure how\n\n\nThe Truth About Timeshare Cancellation\nFor U.S. Owners:\nIf your timeshare is paid in full, you can cancel—no permission needed.\nThe resort cannot sue you or report you to credit bureaus if you’ve met your obligations.\nYou own the deed, but they own the property—you’re simply returning it.\n\n\nFor Mexico & Caribbean Owners:\nWhether your membership is paid off or not, you can cancel.\nContracts signed in Mexico or the Caribbean are not enforceable under U.S. law.\nU.S.-based offices have no legal power over you.\nCancellation will not affect your credit score.\nWith the right steps, you can cancel in as little as 7 business days.\n\n\nWhat’s Included\nStep-by-step video lessons (U.S. and Mexico/Caribbean modules)\nAll required templates and documents—just fill in your info, notarize, and send\nPersonalized support via email for your questions\n100% Money Back Guarantee—no risk, just results\n\n\nWhy My Method Works\nYou don’t need the resort’s permission to cancel. If your U.S. timeshare is paid off, you can legally walk away. If you own a vacation club membership in Mexico or the Caribbean, you can cancel—no matter what the resort says. Everything you need—the exact steps, documents, and strategies—is inside this course.\n\n\nLegal Disclaimer\nI am not an attorney, and this course does not create a lawyer-client relationship. This is a practical, educational guide based on my experience and research, designed to empower you to take action on your own.\n\n\nTake Action Now\nYou’ve been misled long enough. It’s time to take back control of your finances and your peace of mind. Enroll today and discover the proven, legal way to cancel your timeshare—quickly, affordably, and stress-free.\n\n\nUnlock your freedom. Start your timeshare cancellation journey today!",

Imagine you could then decide, 6 months later, to pick another country to move to and do the same all over again. Imagine your professional life could continue as before. Imagine bringing your spouse along for this foreign adventure.\nThis is the life I have been leading for the past 6 years. My wife and I have been living in 7 different cities on 3 different continents. And guess what, I am an entrepreneur, but my wife has worked exclusively in the corporate world (read: employee). We have still been able to make all this relocation and moving abroad work. And in this course I show you how.\n*\n\nSee what other students have had to say:\nI watched the three first Videos and I loved the introduction so much , because it gives you the hope and the will to travel abroad , I hope that I will find my pursuit in this course thank you :)) ! - Bouchaib Charioui\nI especially appreciate the sections for company employees, since they tend to be neglected in most of these \"work for yourself\" online type of courses. Thanks! -Mark\nGreat information! - May Thida\nLots of useful tips I am incorporating into my plan. - Francis Zariņš\n*\n\nThis is for Anyone, Entrepreneur or Employee, who wishes to relocate and live in a foreign country.\nThis course will not tell you how to earn a living online and then tell you \"Now Travel!\". This concentrates on everything having to do with relocation, so it will walk you through the concrete steps you need to relocate to a new country, from deciding upon the country to move to, to figuring out what to do with your possessions, home, car, friends, and your life in general, to establishing a new life in the new country, with a new home, car, friends, etc. in your new city/country abroad. This relocation course will also walk you through the logistics (storage, visas, payment issues, etc.) that you are bound to encounter when relocating, whether to a foreign location or to another city.\n\n\nSo if you would like to relocate, to move abroad, to live in a foreign city, or to just travel more, then this is for you.",

      "description": "Welcome!\nMany people want to go on a winter camping trip, but don’t know how. There are so many things to learn, and many are vital to you having a good time and returning home, safe and unharmed.  Everything in this course is explained simply, but in great detail. You are able to learn at your own pace, from anywhere that is convenient for you, and can go through the entire course in a day, or a year, it’s totally up to you.\nI created this online course so people who are new to winter camping, or want to learn more about it, can have just one place to go to, to learn all of the things needed to head out on a front country winter camping trip.  I have priced it economically, as my real passion is to have people head out in winter, with the knowledge required for a safe and successful adventure. I sincerely want people to embark on their adventure feeling confident and able to deal with most issues that will arise,  and be able to handle them with ease.\nIn this course, you will find many sections each covering a specific topic. Each section will have lectures inside of it, which will go over the items related to that topic. Each lecture will consist of a short video, combined with pictures and examples to go along with what that lecture is covering. Each lecture will cover as much detail as needed for that particular subject. There are over 100 lectures in this course!\nSome sections have resources at the end of them, and others have quizzes, so you can test your knowledge along the way. The entire course is also full of tips and tricks that I have learned over the years. You can pick and chose parts of this course, if you are already familiar with certain topics, but as each lecture is short, it is recommended that you view all of the lectures, as there are many ways to do things. You never know what new information you might discover.\nMy name is Christina, and I will be leading you through the course. I have over 30 years of experience camping, over 20 years backcountry camping and over 5 years of experience winter camping. Since my very first winter camping trip in 2015, I have immersed myself in the topic of winter camping, creating 3 of my very own hot tents, from scratch.  Doing this has given me a huge amount of insight and knowledge and given me a reason to find out all there is to learn on this journey into camping in another season.  As I was also a new winter camping, not that long ago, the information, along with tips and tricks I've learned along the way, are all top of mind.  I have camped and still camp using every method in each lecture, and the entire course is not only based on my first hand experience, but also full of information that I've learned from other winter campers, by attending symposiums and winter camping shows,  and by doing lots and lots of research.\nI have created this entire course, from scratch, writing it from start to finish myself.  Occasionally you may notice me reading the words I'm sharing with you while watching the videos. Please note they are all my words and notes that I am sharing with you, not someone else's.   You will be receiving the benefit of my failures and successes, not only learned from front country winter camping, but also from the many solo winter backcountry trips I've successfully completed, some in extremely cold temperatures and challenging conditions.\nSo many people have fears associated with winter camping, but sometimes, fear can be disguised as a simple lack of knowledge. Learn about all the things you need to know while winter camping, and your fears should subside. With knowledge, you have power and my goal here is to give you as much knowledge as possible, so you are sufficiently prepared for your winter camping trip and it is filled with incredible moments that will last a lifetime. What are you waiting for? Let’s get started!",

But after several trips across the globe, I now know the truth.\nI realised, this was because I didn't you could travel on 15 a day.\nDo you want to leave your boring job and travel full time?\n- Travel for free?\n- Travel with next to no money?\n- Spend less travelling then what you would spend back home?\nThe biggest reason why people never travel is because they think they need money, but that is a lie!\nSimply KNOWING how and where to spend your money overseas will be all you need to live on 15 a day.\nMost people in their lifetime don't travel full-time because:\nThey think they need a full-time job to support themselves\nThey are afraid of loosing everything or going bankrupt\nThey don't think they can travel with a family or mortgage\nThey think travelling is boring without spending a lot of money\nIf you don't take this course, you continue to think and feel just like those people.\nBut how can you learn how to travel full-time if so many other people don't?\nI'm Justin light and I have been living the wildest travel lifestyle since 2014.\nIn this comprehensive video course, I take you gently by the hand as I show you not only how to travel the world on 15 a day, but I also show you do it in 1 foundational course.\nYou do not need an expert lonely planet writer or guide book.\nIf you just make a few changes to your spending while overseas, the huge debt that you would usually accumulate travelling, will be non existent.\nYou won't have to work and save as frequently.\nYou will have more, longer lasting trips and deeper memories.\nYou will have less worry about your depleting funds.\nAnd, if you're smart you might even be able to save money. (WHILE TRAVELLING)\nUse my experience, my knowledge from 3 years of serious travelling, researching and lived experience. I wake up everyday so incredibly grateful that I can wake up on a beach in Thailand, or snowboard in the alps, or have sushi in Japan without commenting to a 9-5 job. But I could only make this travel reality true by learning how to spend less.\nFollow my videos and exercises - and soon you'll be waking up everyday doing exactly what I do. You might even be teaching others to do it too ;)\nI have actually caught myself (many times) saying:\n\"How have I made this my life? Is this real? I am so lucky...\"\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nA minimalist once told me. In order to become richer - don't earn more, spend less.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nIf you want a life of travel, this course is for you.\nIf you want more knowledge, more advice on awesome travel destinations for dirt cheap, this course is for you.\nIf you want to travel the world with next to no money, this course is for you.\nIt doesn't matter whether you're old, young, no previous experience poor, family or single – anyone can travel the world on 15 a day, and I show you how to do this.\nAs with all of my training and future courses:\nyou have unlimited lifetime access at no extra costs, ever\nall future additional lectures, bonuses, etc in this course are always free\nthere's an unconditional, never any questions asked 30 day money-back-in-full guarantee\nmy help is always available to you if you get stuck or have a question\nTake this course now, before anymore time not doing what you desire, travelling. The sooner you take this course, the sooner your time can start wandering... the beautiful globe.",

Here are some common snorkeling problems to be aware of:\n\n\n1. *Mask Leaks*: Water can enter the mask if it doesn't fit properly. This can be distracting and make it hard to see underwater. Proper fitting and adjusting of straps can help mitigate this.\n\n\n2. *Fogging Up*: Masks often fog up due to temperature differences. Anti-fog solutions, toothpaste, or even saliva can help prevent or reduce fogging.\n\n\n3. *Breathing Difficulties*: Some beginners may feel anxious while breathing through a snorkel. It’s important to practice breathing calmly and deeply through your mouth.\n\n\n4. *Water in the Snorkel*: Water can enter the snorkel, especially if you dive or splash. Learning to clear the snorkel (by exhaling sharply) can help manage this.\n\n\n5. *Buoyancy Issues*: Poor buoyancy can make it difficult to stay at the right depth. Use a properly fitted wetsuit or flotation device if needed.\n\n\n6. *Strong Currents*: Strong water currents can make snorkeling challenging and dangerous. It’s essential to check local conditions before heading out.\n\n\n7. *Sunburn*: Spending hours in the water without proper sun protection can lead to sunburn. Apply waterproof sunscreen and consider a rash guard for protection.\n\n\n8. *Communication*: Communication underwater can be challenging. Use hand signals to communicate with your snorkeling buddy before going underwater.\n\n\n9. *Marine Life Encounters*: Some snorkelers may encounter jellyfish, sharp corals, or other dangerous marine life. Maintaining a safe distance and being aware of your surroundings is crucial.\n\n\n10. *Location Safety*: Not all snorkeling locations are safe, especially for beginners. Researching and picking a suitable spot is important to avoid hazards.\n\n\n11. *Fatigue*: Snorkeling can be surprisingly tiring, especially for beginners. It’s essential to take breaks and stay hydrated.\n\n\n12. *Wildlife Protection*: Snorkelers may inadvertently harm marine life or coral reefs. It’s important to practice responsible snorkeling by not touching or stepping on delicate ecosystems.\n\n\nBy being aware of these potential problems and preparing accordingly, you can have a much more enjoyable and safe snorkeling experience.",

Je m'appelle Nicolas et je me considère comme un Digital Nomade ! A travers ce cours, je vous présente ce mode de vie, je vous donne tous les conseils dont vous avez besoin, ainsi que les bonnes informations !\n\n\nCe mode de vie n'ai bien évidemment pas adapté à tous le monde. En revanche, pour certaines personnes, c'est la solution idéale pour une vie épanouie en fonction de ses convictions. Vous en avez peut être marre de suivre la masse, de rester dans le même système, d'avoir un boulot sans le moindre épanouissement, de rester au même endroit, de ne pas agir, d'être entouré de trop de choses matérielles, et j'en passe.\n\n\nActivité dématérialisée. Pour devenir Digital Nomade il est indispensable de créer une activité en ligne. Pour cela, il y a plusieurs solutions. Par expérience, je vous donne des pistes pour créer une activité stable. A vous, ensuite, de vous investir à fond, et d'optimiser une activité qui vous corresponde. Un ordinateur pour un travail.\n\n\nVous en avez marre du quotidien et de votre style de vie ? Effectivement cela arrive aux personnes qui n'ont pas la même échelle de valeur que la majorité, rassurez vous il n'y a pas de problème.\n\n\nVous en avez marre de vivre dans le même type de société ? Je ne vous le cache pas, le monde est vaste et on peut trouver des pays où ils fait bon vivre et découvrir en fonction de ses critères de choix.\n\n\nVous voulez choisir une zone géographique ou un pays ? Je vous donne des conseils en fonction de mon expérience personnelle et je propose un tableau ludique pour faire des comparatifs.\n\n\nVous pensez que ce n'est pas possible ? Vous savez il y a des années quand j'ai observé ces quelques personnes qui avaient ce mode de vie, je me suis dit que c'était fait pour moi, pour ma personnalité, sans penser y arriver. Et un jour j'ai mis en place les actions et je me suis focalisé la dessus chaque journées jusqu'à réussir, et devinez quoi, j'y suis arrivé.\n\nVous avez soif de liberté?  Vous avez envie d'aventure ? Vous voulez changer de mode de vie ? Vous voulez voyager ? Vous voulez vivre différemment que dans la zone de confort du quotidien ?

La présentation qui en est faite s’appuie quant à elle sur mon expérience et sur mes recherches personnelles. Dans mon podcast PERIPLE HUMANITAIRE, je vous propose des témoignages de travailleurs humanitaires qui vont également dans le sens de ce qui est présenté dans cette formation. Il s’agit donc d’un ensemble de ressources qui vous sont partagées afin que vous puissiez vous-même progresser dans votre parcours personnel.\nLa formation GESTION DU STRESS EN MISSION HUMANITAIRE présente différents travaux de recherche. Dans un premier temps, nous regarderons le cycle de l’expatriation qui est une représentation issu des travaux sur l’ajustement culturel des chercheurs Black, Mendenhall et Oddou (1991). Cette représentation explicative du choc culturel peut être utilisée comme un outil très pratique pour se préparer au départ.\nEnsuite, nous aborderons les travaux du psychiatre du Comité International de la Croix-Rouge, Bierens de Haan (2002) qui a notamment travaillé sur les différentes formes de stress qui touchent les travailleurs humanitaires. Ces travaux nous servirons de base pour aborder les conséquences graves du stress chez les travailleurs humanitaires comme le syndrome de stress post-traumatique (INSERM, 2020) et le risque suicidaire (Ramchand et al., 2017).\nEn complément la formation s’intéressera aux principaux modèles théoriques du stress au travail (Karasek, 1979; Siegrist, 1996). Nous aborderons le fonctionnement biologique du stress au travail (INRS France, 2009). La formation abordera également la question du burnout (Guseva Canu et al., 2021; Maslach & Jackson, 1981) et les facteurs des risques psychosociaux (Gollac & Bodier, 2011).\nEnfin, la formation se conclura sur un atelier de gestion du stress basé sur le modèle de l’effort-récupération. Les exercices proposés sont inspiré directement de l’étude menée par Sonnentag (Hahn et al., 2011; Sonnentag & Fritz, 2007).\nTout au long de la formation, vous retrouverez les sources sur lesquelles je m’appuie. Vous trouverez également à la fin de ce syllabus la bibliographie. Il s’agit ici seulement des travaux qui ont servi pour la réalisation de cette formation en ligne. Il existe une littérature beaucoup plus large sur le sujet.",

You are about to understand what works and what doesn't on CouchSurfing. If you are a beginner, this is an all inclusive course which will teach you everything you need to know about CouchSurfing - from how to create an outstanding profile, to how to find a safe & reliable host, who you can trust and feel comfortable with and how to fix all the logistics on your travel. All questions that you might have about CouchSurfing will be covered - Is it safe? Is it free? How to arrange it? Where to start?\nI want my students to have a great time while learning & that is why I made the course as entertaining and actionable as possible. You will be able to apply the theory at every step of the course and thus by end of it you will have an outstanding CouchSurfing profile & you will be ready for your first amazing CouchSurfing experience.\nWhat Some Students Say About My Courses:\n''This course offers a ton of value and was presented in a compelling way... Recommended.'' - Jimmy Naraine (bestselling instructor on Udemy)\n\n\"Martin explains everything very clear and with a lot of passion. \" - Joepperd D\n\n\"The best step by step guide to Couch Surfing that I've found so far.\" - Adam Naraine\n\n\"Very energetic videos that are motivating by conveying your high vibe and your easy to understand, practical content. I found lots of good advice in them that I will start to implement right away. Thank you Martin!\" - Gergely Horváth\n\"He explains step by step not just what to fill in (and what is not needed) but also why and tips and tricks to make sure you are successful. Many of these things I never would have thought of on my own. His videos are high quality, his voice is clear, and the content is well thought out.\" - Michael Glasser\n\n\"This course is filled with great tips ... very practical, but if I had one tip for everyone reading this. Make sure you do it step-by-step instead of watching it through THEN attempting to implement.\" - Kevin Hunter\n\"Overall, Martin is a very inspiring, charismatic and positive trainer who inspired me to get on the fast track to my goals!\" - Diana Dimitrova\nBy implementing the material from this course, you will be able to find a free couch to stay anywhere you go, all over the world. (And I'll let you in on a little secret – sometimes you get much more than a couch, like a comfortable spare bedroom all to yourself.)\n\nConsider that staying in the average hostel costs 25 US dollars per night, while the average hotel room costs 60 US dollars per night. Obviously, in some parts of the world accommodation costs a lot more than even that.\nIf you take action and implement what I teach in this course - and you land even just two couches – your entire course is already paid off!\n_________________________________________________________________\nNow, You could try to do it all yourself and learn from your own mistakes as you go, but you should be prepared for a lot of trial and error and wasted time, and you could end up far from home in a dangerous situation if you do something wrong.\nI would like to save you the time and effort and make sure you start out couch surfing as if you were already an experienced pro.",

There are so many ways you can use Airbnb to upgrade your situation. This course ROCKS.\" -- Jeff Tran\n\"Fantastic Investment. I signed up for this course when it first came out a little over a month ago. I was already a host but I was in what Evan called the \"beginning blues\" where I was getting bookings but not enough and for little money. I took his course and I'm happy to say already in a month, his techniques are making a really big difference. My bookings next month are already up 30% in price and I'm getting close to filling all my weekends I wanted. Next month I've already booked $2300, which is really exciting. I've gone back to this course so many times already because its been so valuable. Evan's even helped me out on several occasions. I just wanted to come back and write this review to encourage anyone reading this to take this course. Its already paid for itself many times over.\" -- Laura Greer\n————————————————————\nI once made $7,579 while vacationing in Bali. How did I make that much? By doing nothing. Absolutely nothing. All I had to do was rent my apartment out on Airbnb and leave for the month.\nI know it sounds ridiculous but it's true. I got paid $260 / day to simply not be in my apartment.\nI bet that by now you've heard of Airbnb. If you don't use it, chances are someone you know does. Airbnb lets you rent out your spare room or entire space for money, and the company has been growing like wildfire. Airbnb now has over 350,000 hosts, who are just ordinary people, renting their spaces in over 192 countries. They have booked over 10 million rental nights in homes, apartments, rooms, and spaces just like yours.\nYou know what the best part is? A private room on Airbnb rents for an average of $120 / night. You could make that by renting out a spare room - or 3x that for your whole space.\nI have personally made over $60,000 renting out my space on Airbnb. On average I spent about 4~ hours per week handling guests, maintaining the space, and everything else involved. On a typical month I would make $4,000 - $5,000. If I was traveling I would make between $7,000 - $10,000 a month.\nIs this abnormal? Not at all. I have helped several of my friends list their places on Airbnb and they all make a minimum of $2,000 / month. Thousands of hosts on Airbnb make well over $100,000 a year from their rental income and with only one property.\nWhen I first started hosting on AirBNB, I thought, \"What the heck, its worth a shot.\" I had just moved to San Francisco and signed a big one-year lease for an apartment that was $3,000 a month. Not to mention being self employed with a business that ebbs and flows. What if I hit a bad month and couldn't make rent? A terrible feeling that most of us have probably had.\nThe first month I started Airbnb, I made $4,963. That blew my expectations away. It covered my rent, utilities, cleanings, and I pocketed an extra $1,500. Airbnb saved me like it's saved so many others.\nJust so you know, the spaces on Airbnb are not hotel quality spaces. They're spare rooms, apartments, and homes that everyday, ordinary people live in. Spare bedrooms, living rooms, empty condos, spare family homes, and any other dwelling you can think of.\nDo you have extra space where you're living? Do you ever leave for the weekend or go home for the holidays? Can you crash at a significant other's for the weekend? If you're like me, or really anyone else, I'm sure you can think of a time where you've had unused space. You could be missing out on a significant amount of money. Money that could make a big difference in your life.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nSome things you'll learn in the course:\n- How to step-by-step get your spare room or space renting for up to $5,000 / month, or your entire space for up to $10,000 / month\n- Everything you need to know before starting the process so you can hit the ground running\n- How to scope out your competition, create a plan, and land on the first page of search\n- How to perfect your listing: from photographs to thumbnails to listing descriptions\n- Every tip and trick I used to triple my booking inquiries in jone month\n- How to limit your rental related work to 3-4 hours a week\n- How to virtually guarantee 5-star reviews from each guest\n- How to become a SuperHost and join the top 5% of Airbnb hosts\n- Plus so much more. There are over 100+ lectures and 13 hours of content included in this course.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nSome common questions:\nCan anyone do this?\nYes, absolutely anyone can do this. Airbnb is in 192 countries and even in cities with fewer than 10,000 people. With my course I'll show you exactly how you can be successful in any environment.\nWhat if my space isn't nice?\nEvery space has a price and if you follow my steps you can maximize that price. If you're not happy with the price you get, follow my advice and you can easily get more and more per night.\nWhat if I don't own my space, I just rent it?\nEven if you don't own your space, even if you don't think you have room, even if you think your city is too small, you can rent out your space.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nAirBNB was a life changer for me and I want it to be the same for you. I've studied the AirBNB market, have hosted over 200 guests, and collaborated with five other rockstar hosts to bring this course together. In this course you'll get everything you need to skip the painful learning process and start maximizing your profit quickly.",

Por eso en lugar de ‘decirte’, es necesario enseñarte exactamente de qué va todo esto.\n\n\nAntes que nada, debes saber que este curso no es sólo teoría. Todo lo que aprenderás dentro es consejo práctico y real que yo mismo he utilizado desde que comencé a viajar por el mundo.\n\nDado que para mí siempre fue algo ‘normal’ o intuitivo, siempre pensé que todos sabían estas estrategias pero fue sólo años después que la gente me hizo entender que no era tan obvio.\n\nPor eso, me tomó mucho tiempo entender el poder y potencial de esto y solamente después de 9 años de viajar, decidí compartir lo que he utilizado para ahorrar miles de dólares.\n\n\nEste curso (qué he creado en conjunto con Sara Nuñez - una chica que también lleva muchos años viajando) te ayudará a entender cómo es que puedes tomar ventaja de las aerolíneas y los errores que han cometido las agencias de viajes en la última década.\n\n\nEntender la industria, los pequeños detalles y todos los secretos detrás de cómo funciona la industria, te dará una ventaja competitiva y te permitirá construir tus viajes de una forma que tendrás flexibilidad, poder sobre el precio y control absoluto de tus boletos (o de otras personas a quien les ayudas a conseguir sus tickets).\n\n\nCon la economía de hoy basada en habilidades y resultados más que honorarios por tiempo, no sólo podrás utilizar estas habilidades para ti mismo, sino también para encontrar clientes que deseen viajar y contratarte a ti como 'broker de boletos' para conseguirles los mejores vuelos que existen (cómodos, directos, baratos y customizados a sus necesidades)\n\n\nEso significa, que podrás no sólo ahorrar dinero, sino también generar ingresos brindando un servicio único en el mundo (¡¿alguna vez habías escuchado algo así?!).\n\n\nY lo mejor de todo es que este curso cuesta mínimo unas 10 veces menos de lo que podrás ahorrarte en el primer vuelo que compres después de aprender los secretos que tenemos para ti.\n\n\nAhora la pregunta es, ¿estás listo para volverte un experto 'armando' boletos de avión?\n\n\n**Recuerda...

The Spanish landed first in La Guajira in 1499 and by the mid-16th century colonized parts of the region, establishing the New Kingdom of Granada, with Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. Independence from the Spanish Empire was achieved in 1819, with what is now Colombia emerging as the United Provinces of New Granada. The new nation experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858) and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. Panama seceded in 1903, leading to Colombia's present borders. Beginning in the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence, both of which escalated in the 1990s. Since 2005, there has been significant improvement in security, stability and rule of law, as well as unprecedented economic growth and development.\nColombia is one of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries; it has the second-highest level of biodiversity in the world.[15] Its territory encompasses Amazon rainforest, highlands, grasslands and deserts. It is the only country in South America with coastlines and islands along both Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\nColombia is a member of major global and regional organizations including the UN, the WTO, the OECD, the OAS, the Pacific Alliance and the Andean Community. It is also a NATO Global Partner. Its diversified economy is the third-largest in South America, with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects.\nEnrol today!",

      "description": "Curious about Worldschooling?\n\n\nYou’re not alone! In recent years, families all over the world have felt freed up to explore different lifestyles, untethered to offices and classrooms, with a new ability to work and learn from almost anywhere. Leaving your country and planning the journey that’s right for your family takes time and intention, and this course will walk you through each step.\n\n\nThe worldschooling community is expanding. You can be a part of it.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you’ll understand the challenges and opportunities associated with worldschooling and be fully prepared to leave your home. You will understand how to:\n\n\nFund your journey for stress-free travel\nChoose destinations, speed of travel, and pacing\nRecognize and address true risks to stay healthy and safe\nKeep your children socially well-adjusted\nEngage with other worldschooling families\nEducate your children in ways that are right for them\nRespect people, the planet, and wildlife as travelers\nInfluence concerned or unsupportive loved ones\n\n\nAre You a Worldschooling Family?\n\n\nEach day, people say goodbye to friends, family, and neighbors for extended journeys that last several weeks, months, or years. Some have firm dates of return. Some know they’ll go home but without an end date in mind. Some plan never to return, having sold and stored their belongings.\n\n\nWorldschooling families have children of all ages. We travel anywhere outside of our national borders. We sleep in guesthouses, five-star hotels, campervans, tents, hostels, Airbnbs, or RVs. We unschool, purchase curriculum, follow national standards, or encourage play-based learning. We stay in one flat for six months, move hotels every two nights, spend one month in ten countries each, or exhaust an entire continent.\n\n\nAny family can worldschool. While each family bases their choices on a variety of personal variables, we all share a few common beliefs.\n\n\n· We understand the power of international travel to deepen learning through experiences.\n· We know that personal growth in traits like self-confidence, grit, open-mindedness, and perseverance can be immense.\n· We prioritize quality time with our children, strengthening relationships and creating memories.\n· We understand that travel can build and strengthen empathy, which our planet sorely needs.\n\n\nAbove all, we believe that we can make our trip happen, that we can surmount barriers, create a funding plan, garner support from friends and family, and educate our children. If you don’t carry this belief yet, this course will give you that confidence, coupled with the knowledge you require.\n\n\nHow This Course Can Help\n\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE: As evident by its title, this course is a comprehensive review of the common topics family’s tackle prior to worldschooling. Most families have similar concerns and barriers when making their journey come to life. We address each in enough depth for you to understand the main points and challenges and to consider their impact on your specific family.\n\n\nINDIVIDUALIZED: You’ll be encouraged through videos, resources, and assignments to consider what your family needs, wishes for, and desires. Instagrammers and bloggers paint beautiful portraits of their family travels, but their approaches may be completely wrong for you. After all, your family is unique. I’ll walk you through each step of how to create the trip that’s right for you.\n\n\nILLUSTRATIVE: I apologize in advance for the millions of pictures of my daughters. I include them not because they’re two of my favorite people in the world but because they’re modeling a worldschooling experience. Not only do they illustrate a day-in-the-life to help you visualize your own children in these places, but the richness, color, and beauty of the settings might keep you inspired and motivated.\n\n\nINCLUSIVE: Because each worldschooling family differs, my voice alone isn’t enough. I’ve reviewed elements of this course with multiple families prior to mass publication, and I include a special lecture devoted solely to the advice and insights of other worldschooling families with different experiences out in the world.\n\n\nDETAILED: For those of you who want to move from dreaming and visioning, you’ll be able to get down to business! I provide resources like task lists, budgeting templates, methods for earning money while traveling, three pages with up-to-date worldschooling hubs, and more. You’ll get as much out of working the assignments and resources as you will consuming the videos.\n\n\nSUPPORTIVE: Most worldschoolers report that the biggest hurdle in leaving their country was their mindset. They felt overwhelmed by all they needed to accomplish to depart. They wondered if they were ruining their children’s relationships and educations. They feared they were compromising their careers. In this course you’ll see that, not only are these concerns normal, but they’re surmountable. And indeed, surmounting them may be the best decision of your life.\n\n\nMeet Your Instructor\n\n\nWhen I was 12-years-old, I traveled to the Dominican Republic with my mom, sister, and new stepfamily. We were meant to bond. We booked a house in a 7,000 acre gated resort with endless buffets of Western fare, golf courses, and swimming pools. One night, my mother and stepfather inquired about eating authentic food beyond the gates—they always enjoyed varied cuisine—and later that night, we found ourselves in the center of La Romana, then a small city in which most resort workers lived.\n\n\nMy mouth dropped open as we walked down uneven streets past typical homes, stray dogs and cats, and bits of trash, and into a worn restaurant to sit on plastic chairs for the most delicious meal of our trip. Later, we laughed with the owner over our horrendous Spanish as we munched on sweetened corn pudding.\n\n\nThat was the night I got it: Vacations are not all equal. Some can keep you comfortable, and others can blow your mind.\n\n\nThirty five years and nearly 50 countries later, I still search for moments like this for my own daughters who are both near 12 themselves. Moments of connection, of simplicity, of authenticity, of experiences beyond the gates.\n\n\nNow for the boring part: I’ve spent almost 20 years in the nonprofit sector in Portland, Oregon, USA as an executive director, fundraiser, and marketing executive. I’ve traveled as a teenage exchange student three times, founded a non-profit to take teenagers from low-income families abroad, lived in West Africa for more than two years as a Peace Corps Volunteer, and worldschooled my own children through 15 countries… and counting.\n\n\nI own Deliberate Detour which supports traveling families in making their dreams come true through online courses, coaching, and writing. I'm contributing to a book coming out in 2023 entitled Worldschooling: Innovative Parents Turning Countries into Classrooms published by Nomad Publishing.",

Before You Go Overseas offers a one-stop shop for everyone’s travel needs, distilling decades of travel experience into one comprehensive course.\nWhereas most travel guides emphasize one component of travel, Before You Go Overseas divides every aspect of it into clear and manageable sections, such as how to set a budget, coordinate logistics, manage risk, adjust expectations, overcome jet lag, prepare spiritually, and stay safe.\nAbounding with personal travel stories, Before You Go Overseas reveals secret travel tips, offers excellent travel advice, and pulsates with a contagious enthusiasm for everything related to travel.\nConveniently divided into seven parts, Before You Go Overseas guides learners as they imagine what kind of traveler they want to be (Part 1), as they design their travel experience (Part 2), as they consider the cultural components of travel (Part 3), as they fall into the rhythm of being overseas (Part 4), as they synchronize in mind, body, and soul (Part 5), and as they return home to process all they learned, discovered, and experienced (Part 6). Finally, the last part of the course focuses on practical guidelines (Part 7) learned when overseas.\nAbout the Instructor\nDr. Derek Cooper is managing director of Thomas Institute, an educational travel company specializing in learning on location. He has visited more than 80 countries and earned a PhD in the history of religion and an MBA in international business. He additionally runs a YouTube channel called Thomas Institute that features hundreds of videos filmed on location in various countries throughout the world. He has led thousands of individuals overseas since the year 2000.",

      "description": "Ami Londra? Ti piacerebbe visitarla nell'epoca di Dickens e della Regina Vittoria? Se pensi che viaggiare nel tempo sia impossibile, ti sbagli. Il mio video corso ti spiega dove andare a Londra, che cosa vedere e come muoverti per scoprire e capire tutti quei luoghi che ci rivelano com'era la città nell'Ottocento.\nCominceremo con una sezione in cui ti accompagno attraverso la storia di Londra fino ad arrivare a cavallo dell’Ottocento: è impossibile capire la misura in cui l’Ottocento abbia rappresentato un balzo in avanti rispetto agli altri secoli senza un parametro di riferimento. Nel mio racconto ho scelto di assumere una prospettiva ben precisa, cioè focalizzata sugli avvenimenti che hanno portato a un cambiamento strutturale della città in modo da renderlo un corso estremamente pratico, che non ti dia le nozioni teoriche che puoi trovare su libri, ma ti offra gli strumenti per muoverti all’interno della città capendo il senso profondo di quello che hai attorno.\nStudieremo poi com’era Londra durante l’epoca vittoriana e come cambiò nel corso dei decenni del regno della Regina Vittoria. Scopriremo la nascita degli edifici più famosi, perché sono importanti, sfateremo qualche mito e capiremo perché ha senso andare a Londra e cercare la Londra ottocentesca.\nEsploreremo com’era fatta una città ottocentesca, impareremo a leggere le mappe di quel tempo e usarle per orientarci all’interno della città. Capiremo com’è divisa Londra oggi, com’era divisa nell’Ottocento, e ci focalizzeremo su alcune zone in particolare per arrivare a un lungo elenco di posti e dritte che ti darò per andare alla ricerca di luoghi nascosti e poco conosciuti che ti mostreranno una Londra che non immaginavi.\nTi ho preparato anche una super mappa personalizzata in Google Maps, che ti fornirò insieme a una guida all’uso per far sì che tu possa girare per la città e scoprire con un clic se attorno a te si trova uno dei luoghi di cui ti ho parlato nel corso. Non ti proporrò dei veri e propri itinerari o passeggiate preconfezionate: preferisco insegnarti a farlo in autonomia così puoi costruirti il tuo soggiorno perfetto a Londra, che corrisponda ai tuoi gusti e quelli di nessun altro. Voglio che tu riesca a mettere a frutto ogni secondo del tuo prossimo viaggio a Londra.\nIscrivendoti avrai accesso a 27 video lezioni, quasi 4 ore di contenuti, dispense scaricabili, risorse di approfondimento e una mappa personalizzata. Vedrai, avrai una marea di appunti di prendere.\nTi avverto però: già dopo le prime lezioni, sarai tentato di prendere il primo volo per Londra e cominciare subito l'esplorazione.\nIscriviti, ti aspetto!",

Et en matière de voyage plus qu'ailleurs, c'est une question de méthode (contrairement à ce que l'on entend souvent !)\nLe voyage m'a bien prouvé une chose : il est très difficile de démêler le vrai du faux car les voyageurs ont tendances à … amplifier un peu tout ! En même temps, difficile de dire \"c'était pas terrible\" ou \"j'ai un peu gâché 2 semaines\", ou encore \"j'ai tellement galèré que je m'en rappellerai toute ma vie\" :) Bref, ce programme vous donnera les avantages et les inconvénients car oui, il y a des 2 !\nÀ l'origine, j'ai conçu ce programme pour les entrepreneurs qui veulent créer un business et voyage autour du monde en même temps. Autant vous dire que nous irons directement à l'essentiel, et que ce cours est un guide complet, qui vous prend par la main de A à Z. Et bien sûr, nous discuterons de votre voyage de vive voix :)\n\n\nJe vous expliquerai notamment :\n\n\n- Pourquoi les pays riches coutent en réalité beaucoup moins chers pour voyager\n- Comment j'ai traversé 80 % des USA pour 130 € (17 destinations, 140 h de transport)\n- L'équipement vraiment obligatoire pour un voyageur (croyez moi, le poids du sac est un véritable challenge)\n- Les réflexes de la sécurité en voyage (c'est un peu mon métier - je suis instructeur Krav-Maga)\n- Comment gérer LE truc qui fait que beaucoup abandonnent au milieu de l'aventure ( Réponse : les temps de transport)\n- Le plus beau voyage de votre vie (étapes, parcours, prix … etc).\n- Les endroits qui valent moins le coup que d'autres, et pourquoi (oui, ça existe)\n- Et bien sûr, énormément de choses supplémentaires (je manque de temps pour écrire. J'ai faim, et un couscous m'attends :)\n\n\nATTENTION : je le répète : votre temps est précieux. Je vais droit au but, et je parle de TOUS les domaines, avec une touche d'humour, et rien n'est objectif dans ce programme. Je donne mon avis, et j'explique pourquoi :) Bien sûr, vous vous ferez le vôtre quand vous partirez faire le tour du monde :)\nSi vous êtes déjà courageux, rejoignez-moi :)",

      "description": "If you’re skeptical or worried this might be just another timeshare cancellation scam—I completely understand. So many timeshare owners in Mexico feel trapped, frustrated, and unsure of who they can trust. That’s exactly why I created this course. With over 15 years of experience inside the timeshare industry across the U.S., Mexico, and the Caribbean, I’ve seen every trick resorts use—and, more importantly, I know exactly how to legally cancel a Mexican vacation club contract without paying thousands to a service that may never deliver.\n\n\nAs the #1 recognized expert in timeshare cancellation, I’ve authored numerous books and created many courses on this subject. Hundreds of owners have already taken this course—or one of my other courses—and have successfully canceled their memberships, often in less than 90 days.\n\n\nYou might wonder why there aren’t more public reviews. That’s because one of the key documents used in the cancellation process is a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), often required by the resort as part of the legal cancellation. This NDA prevents owners from publicly sharing their results, even though they’ve been successful.\n\n\nBut here’s what I can tell you: Not one person who completed the course and followed the steps has said it didn’t work.\n\n\nYou don’t need to feel trapped. There is a legal, proven way out—and I’ll walk you through every step.\n\n\n100% Success Rate: Cancel Your Mexico Timeshare FAST!\nEvery single owner who followed this method has successfully canceled their Mexican vacation club membership—most within 60 days, some in as little as 7 business days.\n\n\nWhy is this course so successful? Because you don’t need the resort’s permission to cancel. Whether your membership is paid off or not, the resorts can’t stop you. Everything you need—the exact steps, documents, and legal strategies—is inside this course.\n\n\nDon’t wait. Get started today and break free from your timeshare—FAST.\n\n\nDiscover the Ultimate DIY Guide to Mexican Timeshare Cancellation\nTired of being tied down by your vacation club? This course has everything you need to break free—without costly services or attorneys! Inside, you’ll find all the templates and step-by-step instructions required to legally cancel your membership. Simply:\n\n\nFill in the provided templates with your information.\nHave them notarized.\nSend them off.\n\n\nThat’s it—your timeshare will be canceled! No confusion, no hidden fees, and no waiting years for results. Take control today and experience the freedom you deserve!\n\n\nWhy You CAN Cancel Your Mexico Timeshare\nMexico does not sell timeshares—they sell vacation club memberships. Like any other membership, you can cancel it whether you still owe them or not, and they know there is nothing they can do about it. They can’t even affect your credit rating—guaranteed.\n\n\nWhy I Created This Course\nAfter 15 years as a licensed timeshare sales agent and real estate agent in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean, I learned the secrets the industry doesn’t want you to know. When I retired, I was shocked to hear from so many people who felt misled and wanted out. I started helping owners for free, but when timeshare attorneys accused me of “practicing law without a license,” I realized the best way to help was to create a course—giving you the tools and knowledge to cancel on your own, without paying anyone.\n\n\nSince then, I’ve helped countless families cancel their Mexican vacation clubs within 90 days. My courses are user-friendly and give you direct access to me for support during your cancellation process.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Get\nStep-by-step video lessons focused on Mexican vacation club cancellation\nAll required templates and documents—just fill in, notarize, and send\nPersonalized support via email for your questions\n100% Money Back Guarantee—no risk, just results\n\n\nAbout Me\nI am a former licensed timeshare sales agent with extensive experience in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. I have written and published numerous books and courses on timeshare cancellation, and I am widely considered the #1 expert in the field. With degrees in Sales Management and Communications, and as a certified trainer, my mission is to empower owners to make informed decisions and break free from unwanted contracts.\n\n\nEnroll Now!\nYou don’t have to stay stuck. There is a legal, proven way out—and I’ll guide you through it. Enroll today and learn how to legally cancel your Mexico timeshare—confidently, affordably, and stress-free.\n\n\nUnlock your freedom.

      "description": "Taught by a bestselling travel author, professional writing and life coach,\nand former website editor for Rick Steves' Europe!\n\n\nThe stories we collect when we travel are some of the biggest tales of our lives. We get to keep those stories for a lifetime – if we can remember the details. Journaling about them in a travel diary, helps keep our memories vivid.\nMost travel diaries fizzle, however. By day six of a big trip, people struggle to recall what happened on days three, four, and five. They return home with mostly blank pages, or bland writing that fails to capture the full spirit of their travel adventures.\nWhat’s the tool most people use to document their travels? A camera. Nearly everyone brings a camera of some sort on their vacations. Yet there is so much we can't frame in a photograph that we can capture in a well-written travel journal – all of our senses, the unique emotions we experience in unfamiliar places, the tales we hear from people we meet, challenges we overcome, that sense of wonder we feel as we travel through foreign environments, and so much more. You can also journal in tandem with your travel photography to tell the stories behind the photos.\nSo if travel journaling is such a powerful tool for remembering our trips, why is it a struggle for so many people? There are two common frustrations many travel journalers express:\nIt’s hard to find time to write in the middle of an exciting vacation.\nTheir writing falls flat. They are having some of the biggest adventures of their lives, yet their words are merely step-by-step accounts of their days. Their writing fails to capture the full scope of their adventures.\nThis course will help fix both of those problems.\nYou’ll learn how to splash bold and vivid details into your travel journals – quickly – so you maximize your time for exploring and your writing won’t gobble up precious vacation time.\nYou’ll also discover writing techniques that enhance your experiences, making you more aware of your surroundings as you travel. And you’ll learn fun and efficient ways to write, so that travel journaling doesn’t feel like a chore in the middle of an exciting trip.\nThis lively and informative workshop includes 75 minutes of video lessons and set of supplementary readings. Best-selling travel author and humorist Dave Fox teaches you how to write boldly and adventurously as you explore the world. You'll write vivid accounts of your trips, gain a deeper awareness of your surroundings, and keep your memories alive and bright for years to come.\nThis course is for you if:\nYou've tried writing a travel journal in the past but you want to do it better\nYou've never journaled about your travels before and want to do it right the first time\nYou haven't managed to get much written on previous trips and want to write more – in ways that bring you deeper in touch with your surroundings and make your journeys more exciting\nYou haven't journaled about past journeys and you wish you had. (There's still time to write about trips you've already taken – even if you think you can't remember the details. This course will show you how!)\nYou're an aspiring travel writer who needs help spotting and collecting the \"raw footage\" that will make for great travel tales later. (My follow-up course, “Travel Writing: Explore the World and Publish Your Stories,” teaches you how to transform your on-the-road travel journals into tales for others to read.)\nYour travel plans have been cancelled due to Covid and you want to relive your past adventures.\nSo sign up today and get ready to write, and travel, like you never have before – with an enhanced awareness of your journeys and an ability to write about those trips in ways that will keep your memories bright for years to come.\n“Dave Fox understands how journaling can help that great trip become a candy jar of memories that you can dip into for the rest of your life.\"\n-- Rick Steves, PBS TV host and author of Europe Through the Back Door\nAlso check out my other courses on Udemy:\nTravel Writing: Explore the World and Publish Your Stories\nDeep Travel: Have Adventures No Guidebook Can Tell You About\nProfessional Humor Tricks for Writers, Speakers, and Other Misfits\nThe Writing Mind 1: Defeat Writer's Block & Write Confidently\nThe Writing Mind 2: Overcome Distractions & Get More Written",

They can improve their geography skills. It can help you if you are interested in Baltic state countries. Also, learn more about how are they similar or different to other European nations. Since Latvia's location is in the northeast, the culture and climate have similarities with Scandinavian, Germanic and Slavic cultures. Even some Latvian words have origins from those cultural languages.\nAnother reason to take this course is in case you are interested in visiting the Baltic states. It can be an insight into what to expect. Like a traveller can prepare for the journey for things like temperature change according to seasons. Since Latvia has rainy or sunny summers, winters can become very cold and have snow & ice everywhere. Cuisine can be valuable to know since some travellers can have specific tastes or even allergies. Even though Latvian cuisine isn't known to contain spicy food, some dishes can be fatty or heavy.\nI can add that religious and traditional understanding can be practical. If a traveller wants to participate, for example, in the Līgo celebration, one of the biggest celebrations of the year, symbolising summer solstice.",

      "description": "U.S. law sets out many standards under which a visa application may be denied.\nMore than 2 million US visa applicants are denied every year by embassies and consulates around the world.\nApproximately 75% of these applicants are individuals, who did not\nprove they would return to their home country or otherwise prove\neligibility.\nConsular officers have a difficult job — they are on the front\nlines of our fight with terrorism; must deal with fraudulent\ndocumentation submitted in support of visa applications; and have very\nlittle time to interview applicants.\nBecause of their limited time and resources, it is not surprising\nthat consular officers frequently make factual mistakes, misunderstand\napplicants, make legal errors, and ignore relevant facts and\ndocumentation in reviewing legitimate applications.\nThe course provides relevant information on the student’s US VISA\nprocess. It is recommended for any individual who has got an acceptance\nletter from an institution of the United States, and wants to know about\nthe ways through which he or she can go through the daunting VISA\nprocess and secure a place in the institution of his or her choice.\nThese videos will provide all the necessary information related to\nthe student’s VISA along with the ways through which you can crack the\nVISA interview. Our informative video will surely improve your chances\nof getting a student VISA, and help you live your dream of studying in\nthe United States of America.",
