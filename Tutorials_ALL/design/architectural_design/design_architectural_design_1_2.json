      "description": "Hello!\nWelcome to this course!!\nBeing in the MEP industry, I found many of the personal do not have proper knowledge of the fire hydrant system and their constraints set by the international codes. Hence, I decided to share my knowledge through the course making on this particular topic covering all the important concepts on very minimal price. I used to update and add the courses every week for the learners convenience and understanding.\nThis course is designed in such a way that everyone can understand the concepts easily. I tried to give live example with the help of images to make it easy to understand. However, if you have any doubts, you can send me question in group chat, I will answer your question as soon as possible.\nFirst section of the course contains basic information about the component of wet-riser system like hydrant valve , hose, pipes pumps etc. All the required specifications & operational procedures has been discussing in the lectures. Second section contains design concepts and suggested formulas by NFPA 14.\n\n\nI hope that you would have a lot of question in your mind before taking the course but I am sure that those all will be answered after completing the course.\n\n\nThanks & Regards\nKundan Kumar\n\n\nSee you inside !!",

      "description": "The first step in passive solar design process is to determine solar access for a building and site. This will help designers determine strategies to control daylight and heat gain. Shading mask diagrams are very resourceful tools to determine solar access. This course will equip you to read and create shading masks so that you can use them in your design process.\nA shading mask is a representation of the sky as viewed from a reference point, indicating the portion of sky that is visible and obstructed. Access to sky means access to daylight. When combined with a sunpath diagram, solar access can be determined. This makes the shading mask diagram a nifty tool for designing passive solar buildings. Additional data such as solar insolation, relative humidity etc can further be overlapped on the sunpath diagram making this a very interesting design tool. This course will ensure you have a thorough understanding of the concept of shading mask and equip you to read the diagram.\nFurther, the course includes a tutorial that shows how you can create a simple DIY shading mask kit inorder to create diagrams on your own. Software that can be used to create shading mask is also shared.\nA separate module on the application of shading mask as design tool walks you through some of ways this tool can be used. Design decisions such as the size of shading devices, the right orientation of buildings, identification of the location for solar renewable systems, determining the height of building forms at a master plan level and many others can be informed using this simple tool.\nThis course is designed in a highly engaging content giving you a learning experience that’s comprehensive and fun at the same time. By the end of the course, you’ll be ready to use shading masks in your design process.",

El dominio del Diseño Computacional y Generativo abre la posibilidad de aplicar un gran número de técnicas innovadoras para la concepción de proyectos y la evaluación de múltiples alternativas de forma eficaz y veloz obteniendo resultados inmejorables.\nEn este curso abordaremos una de las aplicaciones más interesantes que encontramos en la actualidad dentro del diseño computacional: el Diseño Generativo. Gracias a que en módulos anteriores se habrá entendido cómo traducir los requerimientos de diseño en reglas programables, ahora se podrán utilizar algoritmos de optimización que iteren sobre dichas reglas en un rango de valores previamente determinados por el diseñador. De esta forma, se ampliará nuestro universo de opciones de unas cuantas alternativas a miles o cientos de miles, lo que se traduce en soluciones óptimas aún en los casos más complejos y difíciles de evaluar.\nLa posibilidad de aplicar nuevas técnicas de diseño amplia significativamente la gama de soluciones a ofrecer a los clientes finales para la ejecución de proyectos. A la vez que brinda al diseñador la oportunidad de crecer en competitividad, enfrentándose a nuevos retos.",

Así mismo experimentar con los colores y tonalidades que tu quieras para que mientras haces la presentación también consideres varias opciones de tonos del material que mejor le va al diseño.\nEn este curso aprenderás a crear perspectivas fotorealistas usando como base modelados muy simples sin texturas que pueden ser modelados en Maya, 3dMax o hasta el mismo Autocad sumamente simples hasta transformarlos en renders fotorealistas en donde colocarás cielo, entorno, naturaleza, calles, texturas, personas, reflejos y resplandores con la única finalidad de impresionar y que sea fácil de realizar.",

      "description": "This course is about the solar energy as you know that solar energy is the type of renewable energy and we get energy from sun Millions of years ago, so this course emphasizes on the solar thermal energy. In solar thermal energy we can use energy from the sun without using photovoltaic cells. There are two type of solar thermal energy one is active, and another is passive so solar thermal energy having lot of applications like with the help of solar energy we can generate electricity by using concentrated solar thermal power plant. We can also use solar thermal energy for the drying of crops, food and other thing by using solar thermal air collectors. Similarly, we can also design Colling system using solar energy this can be happened by using solar absorption chillers. Similar we can also use solar thermal for space heating. We can also use solar energy for cooking of meal so we can use solar cooker. Similarly for purification of sea or salty water we can use the process of desalination for that process we can also use solar thermal systems. Solar geezer is one of the most useful systems in these days. So, at the end of this course, we can also design solar evacuated collector system and solar heating system by using Revit which is one of the most useful tools in this century for mechanical work.\nCOURSE CONTENT\nINTRODUCTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THEIR TYPES\nTYPES OF SOLAR ENERGY\nSOLAR THERMAL ENERGY\nCLASSIFICATION OF SOLAR THERMAL ENERGY\nApplication of Solar Thermal Energy\nSolar Radiation\nTYPES OF SOLAR RADIATIONS\nLATITUDE AND LONGITUDE\nSolar Space Heating.\nSolar Water Heating\nForced-Circulation Systems :\nSolar Concentrator\nTypes of Solar Concentrator\nSolar Cooking\nTypes of Solar Cookers\nThermal Energy Storage\nLow Temperature Solar Thermal Plant.\nSolar Drying.",

Используя эту программу, создавал чертежи по строительству (как крупных объектов, так и небольших особняков и коттеджей), Разрабатывал дизайн ландшафта, опираясь на рельеф местности, приобрёл большой опыт в проектировании мебели. С помощью AutoCAD я даже разрабатывал сувенирную продукцию в виде значков и настольных настольных скульптур. Большую часть часть проектов у меня составляют рабочие чертежи по дизайну Интерьеров.\nЯ использую такие расширенные версии Автокад ,как AutoCAD Architecture, который использует BIM технологии для создания архитектурных строительных чертежей (очень похож на Revit), собственно это тот же AutoCAD, но с очень расширенным арсеналом инструментов для решения соответственных задач, также немного разбираюсь в AutoCAD CIVIL 3D, в котором решаются задачи по рельефу, прокладке дорог, трубопроводов и т.д. Уже 8 лет я занимаюсь преподавательской деятельностью. Курсы, которые я предоставляю Вашему вниманию:\n1. Основы Автокад - это курс из 19 занятий, в котором я даю максимальный набор знаний для работы в AutoCAD на примере проектирования 2-х этажного домика. (Домик, сразу скажу, так себе и по дизайну и по конструктивным особенностям. Но в нём есть все необходимые моменты, чтобы изучить как работает AutoCAD, как программа, как инструмент.\n2. Курс по рабочим чертежам Интерьера - это продвинутый курс для людей уже уверенно работающих в AutoCAD, где я показываю как использовать AutoCAD Architecture для создания полного комплекта чертежей по Интерьерам:\nа) Обмерный план существующего или строящегося здания\nб) План перепланировки. Монтаж и демонтаж перегородок и конструкций.\nв) Маркировочный и обмерный план после реконструкции\nг) План расстановки мебели и оборудования\nд) План напольного покрытия с автоматическим расчетом Экспликации\nе) План потолков и потолочных конструкций. Также с Экспликацией\nж) План расстановки электрооборудования (розетки и осветительные приборы с выключателями. (Предполагаю также дополнить курс занятием по плану развет. коробок и разбивке электрики на группы) Экспликация заполняется автоматически\nи) Расчёт отделки по стенам.\nк) Развертки по стенам.\nК видео курсу прилагается Проект-Шаблон из файлов DWG (Основной файл для работы в AutoCAD), где уже настроены необходимые стили, слои, наборы характеристик, на создание которого я потратил около 2-х лет, при этом я продолжаю его совершенствовать и у Вас в дальнейшем будет доступ к обновленным версиям этого Шаблона",

      "description": "No curso de Revit Famílias da NeuroBIM você aprende a não apenas entender como uma família funciona dentro do Revit, mas principalmente a ter autonomia para editar ou criar as suas próprias famílias ricas em parâmetros e cheias de informação.\nCURSO ATUALIZADO COM AULAS QUE ABRANGEM FUNÇÕES DO REVIT ATÉ A VERSÃO 2025.\nFamílias são a base de tudo no Revit. O profissional que entende as funcionalidade e as configurações das famílias entende a lógica por trás do Revit e consegue expandir os limites de sua modelagem. Compreender famílias significa expandir seu template, criar elementos novos e parametrizados que podem atender a diversos projetos diferentes, alterar elementos já configurados para atender uma nova demanda e produzir projetos mais próximos da sua realidade de trabalho.\n\n\nDesenvolvido por Engenheiro Civil, com ampla experiência na criação de famílias de diversas tipologias, o curso foi feito para todos que sonham em ter melhor desempenho em seus projetos dentro do Revit pois um projeto inteligente depende de famílias inteligentes. Vale sempre lembrar que tudo que existe de elemento dentro do Revit é uma família.\n\n\nAo longo do curso nós vamos executar vários exercícios de revisão que aos poucos vão abrir sua mente sobre todas as possíveis aplicações das famílias e dos parâmetros ao mesmo tempo que te ajuda a fixar todo o conteúdo aprendido.\n\n\nTodas as famílias criadas no curso são desenvolvidas do zero, onde o professor explica o passo a passo de como chegar no resultado final e o por que de cada parâmetro ou geometria criada.\n\n\nNesse curso estamos disponibilizando todos os templates base para criação de famílias que são oficiais da Autodesk, para alunos que eventualmente não os tenha instalados em seu computador. Além disso nós também disponibilizamos todas as famílias desenvolvidas no curso para que o aluno possa comparar com os seus arquivos e verificar possíveis dúvidas.\n\n\nAs vídeo-aulas são sempre atualizadas com dicas e/ou esclarecimentos sobre as principais dúvidas dos alunos. Nenhum aluno termina o curso com dúvidas em nenhum dos tópicos contemplados no conteúdo programático.\n\n\nNa seção 11 do curso disponibilizamos para download uma pasta com mais de 20.000 famílias separadas por:\nAcessibilidade\nArquitetura\nMinha casa minha vida\nPerfis\nPaisagismo\nMeios de Transporte\nModelos\nSímbolos Gráficos\nTexturas",

Por deficiências do ensino nem sempre os alunos recebem de seus professores a didática necessária para o desenvolvimento de um método para projetar. Nesse sentido, cabe chamar a atenção para o fato de que as deficiências no aprendizado levam a incorporar vícios no processo de desenvolvimento dos projetos e que se transformam em grande empecilho para alcançar níveis de excelência, e assim para usufruir da capacidade criativa de maneira plena. Com efeito, os softwares disponíveis (2D e 3D) nada mais são que meios para desenvolver e/ou para apresentar ideias. A criatividade, portanto, permanece  como um fator imprescindível e um diferencial do profissional da Arquitetura exigido pelo mercado de trabalho.\n\n\nPara os exercícios oferecidos, os alunos podem usar os programas que melhor dominam: AUTOCAD ou BIM, pois o que importa é o resultado e não os meios. Este é um curso que trata da criatividade e não tem como objetivo ensinar o uso do softwares aplicados à Arquitetura e nem aferir o quanto o aluno domina essas tecnologias. Parte-se do princípio de que o que faz um arquiteto é sua criatividade, e não o domínio do conhecimento sobre aplicativos (!). Este curso propõe o aprendizado do processo criativo considerando o  cumprimento dos demais protocolos de natureza técnico-funcional. Uma vez apreendido o conteúdo, o aluno será capaz de alcançar maior rendimento na prática de projetar, sobretudo, no sentido da obra arquitetônica como expressão formal, entendida como consequência da coerência lógica do arranjo dos espaços em planta.\n\n\nA partir disso, o conteúdo do curso foi construído tendo como início o  entendimento de que é o projeto arquitetônico: um equacionamento simultâneo de fatores intervenientes construídos a partir da análise e síntese do tema considerando os aspectos funcionais (quantitativos) e plásticos (qualitativos) que envolvem a arquitetura como arte utilitária.\n\n\nAlém disso, pensar a  obra arquitetônica pressupõe pensar aspectos humanos, filosóficos, ecológicos, tecnológicos, econômicos, históricos e geográficos. Sendo assim, o curso oferece a devida ênfase à conceituação como o diferencial fundamental da boa arquitetura e como gatilho indutor do processo criativo.  Como consequência, o aluno é levado a pensar a obra arquitetônica como resultado de um conceito físico (síntese), mas que atenda às necessidades particulares e imediatas de um indivíduo e/ou grupo.\n\n\nOs protocolos ensinados como etapas do processo são:\n1- A formulação do Conceito;\n2- A montagem do Programa de Necessidades;\n3- A construção do Organograma;\n4- A construção do Fluxograma;\n5-  Partido Arquitetônico: o lançamento de manchas (a pré-planta-baixa);\n6- Execução de estudo volumétrico.\n\n\n\n\nSão oferecidos exercícios intermediários anteriores ao Exercício Final. No Exercício Final, em nível de Estudo Preliminar, o aluno é convidado a pensar uma solução para o tema proposto: uma casa, e assim ter a chance de praticar o que foi ensinado.\n\n\nImportante: não faz parte do conteúdo do curso ensinar o dimensionamento de espaços no que diz respeito, por exemplo, ao tamanho de aberturas para a iluminação natural, já que isso é consequência da fidelidade aos parâmetros determinados por lei. Ademais, a configuração geométrica dos espaços e suas dimensões assumem possibilidades infinitas, sem que para isso seja possível impor fórmulas exatas.\nO curso tem 17 aulas de curta duração de conteúdo objetivo nas quais é oferecida a teoria ilustrada por meio de vídeos e slides, de maneira a tornar o ensino dinâmico e prazeroso.\n\n\nAlém das aulas, o aluno poderá contar com recursos pedagógicos: links de vídeos extraídos da internet que ajudam a reforçar o conteúdo teórico.\n\n\nVocê terá acesso vitalício, além de ter a chance de se comunicar com o instrutor e assim, poder tirar dúvidas e/ou aprofundar o conteúdo oferecido sempre queira. As respostas serão enviadas com a maior celeridade possível.\n\n\nAlém do certificado o trabalho final pode ser incorporado ao portfólio e assim, proporcionar a qualificação necessária para as oportunidades de trabalho, durante a graduação ou como profissional formado. Vale lembrar que os estudantes de Arquitetura podem participar de concursos de ideias, e que o projeto do TCC pode ser selecionado para participar do concurso \"Ópera Prima\", que tornou-se uma oportunidade tradicional para que novos talentos se apresentem para o mercado de trabalho. Um dos alunos foi agraciado com menção honrosa em concurso de ideias e credita esse feito ao método aqui oferecido e, por certo, terá a partir disso um reconhecimento que o ajudará na carreira desde o período da graduação.\n\n\nÉ recomendável que o aluno atenda também o curso \"Aprendendo a Geometria Construtiva (Níveis 1 e 2)\" para o exercitar a expressão de formas.\n\n\nInscreva-se já (!) e comece a praticar o método ensinado em concursos de ideias para estudantes de Arquitetura. São grandes oportunidades de ter o seu nome reconhecido como um talento antes da finalização da graduação, a exemplo do que aconteceu ao aluno citado. Acompanhe essas chances oferecidas pelos sites de Arquitetura e mãos à obra!\n\n\nOs que se inscreverem receberão o link para assistir na íntegra e gratuitamente o documentário: Oscar Niemeyer - Sensibilidade e Erudição e o link para acessar um dos números da Revista Pináculo, dedicada exclusivamente aos estudantes de Arquitetura - a primeira do Brasil.",

AutoCAD gibi popüler çizim programlarından çizimleri kolaylıkla alabilmesi, ayrıca Lumion, Keyshot, Vray gibi render programlarıyla sorunsuz entegrasyon sağlaması, bu programın geniş kitleler tarafından tercih edilmesine yol açmaktadır. Bu özellikleri, SketchUp'ı hem başlangıç seviyesindeki kullanıcılar için ideal hem de profesyonel projelerde tercih edilen bir araç haline getirir.\nBu kurs kapsamında, SketchUp programını başlangıç seviyesinden ileri düzeye kadar kullanmayı öğreten bir dizi video hazırladım. Mimarlık alanında uzman olduğum için, öğrencilerin SketchUp ile yapısal modelleme ve çizim becerilerini geliştirmeleri amacıyla, bu branşa özgü örnekleri kurs boyunca detaylı bir şekilde ele aldım. Böylece, kursiyerler hem programın temel ve ileri düzey özelliklerini öğreniyor hem de mimari projelerde nasıl uygulanabileceğini pratik örneklerle görüyorlar.\nKurs İçeriği Özet Olarak;\nGiriş:\nKurs tanıtımı, öğrenilecek konular.\nSketchUp Hakkında:\nSketchUp’ın temel özellikleri ve kullanımları.\nProgram yükleme ve kurulum süreçleri.\nResmi web sitelerinin tanıtımı.\nSketchUp ile Modellemeye Giriş:\nProgram arayüzü ve navigasyonu.\nÇizgi, yüzey, seçim işlemleri ve temel modelleme komutları (Push/Pull, Move, Rotate).\nSketchUp ile Modelleme:\nGeometrik modelleme uygulamaları.\nOffset, Scale, Flip gibi gelişmiş komutlar.\nGruplar ve komponentler oluşturma.\nSketchUp ile Mimari Proje Çizimi:\nMimari projelerde duvar, kapı, pencere, döşeme, peyzaj ve çatı modelleme.\nSketchUp 3D Warehouse kullanımı ve mobilya ekleme.\nSketchUp ile Görselleştirme:\nMalzeme atama, stiller, gölgeler ve sahne oluşturma.\nRender alma ve görsellerin dışa aktarılması.\nLumion ile Render Görüntüleri Oluşturma:\nLumion arayüzü ve navigasyonu.\nSKP dosyalarının Lumion’a aktarımı.\nMateryal düzenleme, fotoğraf ve video render alma.\nSketchUp Diğer Konular:\nArazi modelleme ve 3D yazılar oluşturma.\nSketchUp ile Animasyon:\nAnimasyon uygulamaları ve örnek çalışmaları.\nSketchUp Eklentiler (Extensions):\nSketchUp eklentilerinin kullanımı ve indirme kaynakları.\nÖne çıkan eklenti özellikleri ve uygulama örnekleri.\n\nKurs içerisinde SketchUp Programı ile Modelleme Uygulamaları Olarak;\nBaştan sona bir yapı tasarımının CAD dosyası altlığından çizilerek modellemesi, materyal işlemeleri ve görselleştirilmesi örnek uygulama olarak yapılmıştır.\n\nBu kurs sonunda;\nSketchup programını tam yetkinlik seviyesinde kullanabilecek ve modellemek istediğiniz herşeyi modelleyip, materyalini hazırlayıp, görselleştirip, render imajları ve animasyonları üretebileceksiniz.\n\n\nVideo anlatımının, kurs boyunca öğrenci tarafından uygulanması ve deneyimlenmesi beklenmektedir.\nDers uzunlukları ortalama 10’ar dakikadır.\nÖğrenim metodu olarak, gerekli kaynakların indirilmesi ve ardından video takip edilerek uygulamanın deneyimlenmesi önerilmektedir.",

      "description": "Olá alunos,\nSejam bem-vindos ao curso de SketchUp – Modelagem Arquitetônica, meu nome é Ulisses Oliveira e serei seu professor nessa jornada rumo ao domínio da modelagem 3D em um dos programas mais utilizados mundialmente na apresentação de Projetos Arquitetônicos, de Interiores e Paisagismo.\nAlém do aluno poder assistir as aulas online nos dias e horários mais adequados, esse curso conta com uma apostila em .pdf com a qual o aluno irá acompanhar as aulas e atividades propostas. Também como diferenciais há matérias que poderão ser baixados diretamente da plataforma como blocos, plantas, plugins e texturas, sem nenhum custo a mais para o aluno. No final desse curso o aluno receberá um Certificado de conclusão emitido pela Plataforma.\nComo o objetivo do curso é que no final deste o aluno esteja apto a desenvolver qualquer projeto arquitetônico, desde uma edificação simples até empreendimentos mais sofisticados, por isso esse curso inicia em uma Introdução ao SketchUp em que há uma apresentação do programa e como desenhar geometrias em 2D.\nNa sequência há um Módulo em que é lecionado ferramentas e recursos para modelagem 3D e a partir deste o aluno executa a modelagem de uma edificação de dois pavimentos, Modelagem de mobiliários e inserção de blocos para Design de Interiores.\nPara que o aluno alcance um nível mais avançado em modelagem 3D, na sequência há outro Módulo em que é lecionado o uso e aplicação dos principais Plugins essenciais para modelar elementos arquitetônicos complexos de forma prática e ajustes personalizados.\nEm seguida há um Módulo em que o aluno aprende a modelar um terreno em aclive contendo elementos como caminhos, escadas, rua, calçada e piscina. Também neste módulo o aluno a prende a inserir elementos paisagísticos como plantas, árvores e mobiliário.\nNo final do curso há uma Avaliação de aprendizagem, que na verdade é uma atividade em que o aluno poderá aplicar e avaliar os conhecimentos adquiridos durante as aulas.\nEnfim, nesse curso eu transmito boa parte do meu conhecimento e experiência em projetos 3D, adquiridos em mais de 10 anos como desenhista cadista, onde participei de projetos nas áreas de mobiliários, lojas, lanchonetes, supermercados, edificações, urbanismo e paisagismo. Também não posso deixar de mencionar a minha experiência de mais de 10 anos no ensino de AutoCAD, SketchUp e Revit para alunos de Arquitetura, Engenharia Civil e Design de Interiores.\nParabéns pela compra! Boas aulas e não deixe de tirar dúvidas e comentários.",

      "description": "Tras haber iniciado mis estudios en Arquitectura y con el único deseo de poder expresar mis ideas de una forma más allá de las palabras, incursioné en el mundo del modelado 3D con programas tales como Sketchup Pro, AutoCad 3D, ArchiCad, entre otros; claro, no todos los dominé al instante, pero si con el tiempo y siguiendo los consejos de profesionales en el tema, pude yo también convertirme en uno, aunque debo admitir que uno mis métodos favoritos de expresión hasta el día de hoy es SketchUp Pro.\nDurante mis estudios, siempre estuve rodeado de compañeros (no solo en el ámbito de la arquitectura, también de interiores, urbanismo, diseño industrial, estructurales, entre otros) que al no tener un buen dominio de esta herramienta de trabajo 3D la presentación de sus ideas no alcanzaba su 100% ; nada muy alejado de la realidad laboral, en donde día a día muchos de mis colegas pierden buenas oportunidades por las mismas razones. Razones que a través de todos estos años fueron formando mi habilidad de ayudar con mis conocimientos a estos compañeros y colegas que se convirtieron en mis alumnos.\nMi experiencia enseñando SketchUp pro ha sido tan eficaz que decidí crear un curso práctico cargado con toda mis conocimientos  y consejos útiles, y lo mejor de todo, accesible con solo un click a todo aquel que desee aprender. Dentro de este curso no solo encontrarás las descripciones detalladas de como utilizar cada una de las herramientas sino que, a lo largo de cada capítulo te iré dando mis mejores tips, trucos y estrategias que te convertirán a ti también en un experto en poco tiempo.\n¿Qué esperas?, este curso es ideal para ti, atrévete a convertirte en un experto y expresa tus ideas de la forma que siempre has querido.\n¡Adelante, nos vemos en el primer capítulo!",

Bu dolu dolu ve öğretici eğitim setini senin için hazırladım. Eğer 3d modelleme hakkında hiçbir bilgin yoksa, öğrenmeyi istiyor ama \"vaktim yok\" ya da \"zaten öğrenemem\" gibi endişelerin varsa bunlar artık geride kaldı. Bütün öğrenme sürecin boyunca yanında olacağım. Senden sadece bir isteğim var öğrenmeye ayırabileceğin süre haftada iki saatse de her gün iki saatse de bu vaktini düzenli olarak ayırmanı istiyorum. Az ya da çok çalışabilmen önemli değil, bir yarışın içinde değilsin kendini geliştirmek istiyorsun ve ben senin yanındayım. Üç boyutlu modellemeyi severek öğreneceksin.\n\nBu eğitim setini hazırlarken hedefim üç boyutlu modelleme hakkında hiçbir bilgisi olmayan, tamamen sıfırdan başlayan bir kişiye basamak basamak üç boyutlu modellemenin mantığını öğretebilmek ve eğitimi tamamladığında istediği herhangi bir çalışmayı rahatlıkla modelleyebilir seviyeye getirmek eğer kişi orta seviye bilgiye sahipse de onun bilgisine bilgi katmaktı.\n\nBu bilgileri aktarırken de mümkün olduğunca sizinle birebir bir ders işliyormuşuz gibi bir anlatım benimseyerek, öğrenme motivasyonunuzu arttırmayı hedefledim.\n\nÜç boyutlu görselleştirmede Yapay Zeka'nın etkisi hızla artmakta, sizin de bildiğiniz gibi gelişen teknolojiler render motorlarını geçersiz kıldı/kılacak. Render motorlarının vazifesini yapay zeka aldıkça 3d görselleştirme için temiz ve kaliteli modelleme yapabilmek, bu gün olduğundan da kıymetli bir hal alacak. Yapay Zeka, render motorlarının yapabildiklerini tamamen yapabilir olduğunda, temiz ve kaliteli modeller oluşturabiliyor olmak için özenle, detaylı ve akıcı hazırlamış olduğum bu modelleme eğitimine hemen başlayalım.\n\nEğitim setinin içerisindeki bütün videolar ülkemizde ve dünyada çok yaygın bir şekilde kullanılan adeta sektörü domine etmiş olan 3ds Max programı ile hazırlandı hiçbir video daha eski bir sürümle çekilmedi. Sizler için zaman zaman sunduğum avantajlardan faydalanabilmek için Linkedin hesabımı da takip edebilirsiniz.\n\nBu eğitim setindeki içeriğin çok büyük yoğunluğunu doğrudan uygulamalarla gerçekleştirerek size katabileceğim maximum faydayı sağlamaya çalıştım. Üç boyutlu modellemeyi öğrenebilmek için istemeniz, videolarımı izlemeniz ve size tarif ettiğim şekilde uygulamanız yeterli olacaktır. Eğitimin içeriğinde öğrettiğim şekilde çalıştığınız takdirde çok çok kısa bir zaman içerisinde siz de rahatlıkla 3d modeller üretebildiğinizi fark edeceksiniz.",

Além de tudo isso, exploraremos as ferramentas disponíveis no software para o bom desenvolvimento de um projeto luminotécnico funcional, garantindo o maior conforto possível para as pessoas que irão de fato morar naquela residência. Exploraremos formas de trabalho para a modelagem e criação de bancadas de granito que permitam um melhor detalhamento e extração de quantidades no projeto.\nUma das maiores dificuldades que muitos profissionais no mercado de trabalho enfrentam é apresentar um modelo BIM que de fato tenha informações relevantes, muitos se apegam somente à modelagem e ao nível de detalhe daquela geometria e se esquecem de agregar ao modelo aquilo que realmente é relevante, a informação.\nNeste treinamento iremos aprender não somente a modelar elementos em nosso projeto, mas a agregar informações em todo o projeto de forma que as tabelas de quantidades de nosso modelo sejam úteis e facilitem o trabalho do cliente ao procurar por um determinado tipo de material.",

      "description": "Autodesk Revit adalah salah satu alat (tool) software yang digunakan dalam industri konstruksi bangunan untuk mencapai Building Information Modelling, atau yang disingkat dengan BIM.\nRevit bukanlah sekedar alat permodelan 3 dimensi, namun jauh lebih dari itu. Revit dapat menciptakan sebuah project, yang seluruh bagian dari project tersebut terintegrasi satu sama lain. Perubahan di satu aspek project seperti denah atau tampak, akan langsung bepengaruh tehadap bagian lain dari project tersebut, sehingga gambar akan selalu terupdate dari sisi manapun, dan hal ini mengurangi pekerjaan berulang yang biasa dilakukan, sehingga mempersingkat waktu, memperkecil kesalahan dilapangan. Dan anda bisa lebih fokus melakukan hal yang paling penting bagi Anda, yaitu menciptakan karya Arsitektur yang terbaik.\nTutorial online ini cocok untuk anda yang belum memiliki pengalaman apapun, ataupun Anda yang sudah menggunakan program ini untuk beberapa waktu. Didalam tutorial ini kita akan mengulas satu persatu seluruh hal yang berhubungan dengan pengaplikasian software Revit Architecture ini, untuk menciptakan sebuah project arsitektural.\nKita akan Belajar tentang Prinsip-prinsip pengoperasian Revit pada level awal. Ada beberapa hal yang tidak kita bahas, karena dianggap kurang relevan dengan tingkat pembahasan kita pada saat ini.\nKonsep pembelajaran pada tutorial ini adalah dengan memahami prinsip dasar elemen-elemen yang ada pada Revit, dan langsung menerapkannya pada sebuah project, dalam hal ini kita akan membuat Rumah Tinggal 2 Lantai Sederhana.",

Each direction is associated with specific elements and energies, and proper alignment is believed to bring positive vibrations.\nFive Elements: Vastu considers five elements – earth, water, fire, air, and space – and their balanced presence within a building. Proper placement of these elements is believed to promote harmony and balance.\nSite Selection: The selection of a suitable site for construction is crucial in Vastu. Factors such as soil quality, slope, shape, and surrounding environment are considered to determine the positive or negative effects on the occupants.\nRoom Layout: Vastu suggests specific guidelines for the layout and design of different rooms within a structure. For example, the placement of the master bedroom, kitchen, and living room is given special attention to ensure the flow of positive energy.\nEnergy Flow: Vastu emphasizes the smooth flow of energy (prana) throughout the building. The positioning of doors, windows, and architectural elements is planned to facilitate the circulation of positive energy and prevent blockages.",

Você construirá o contexto urbano da cena e aplicará as texturas e iluminações, desfrutando de controles dinâmicos de ajustes desses elementos. Depois, a partir das colocações das câmeras, você poderá complementar seu modelo com objetos complementares como quadros, móveis, objetos de decoração. Você ainda será guiado sobre a inserção de itens de vegetação, veículos em movimento, personagens animados, pássaros, peixes e outros itens de humanização.\nDepois de tudo isso, você exportará as imagens estáticas e os vídeos de seu modelo de estudo. Adicionalmente, você fará a edição destes vídeos no próprio Twinmotion, gerará imagens panorâmicas e verá como usá-las e ainda verá a exportação de um pacote interativo de apresentação.\nSe sua intenção é melhorar a relação entre o tempo empregado em suas produções 3D e a qualidade dos seus trabalhos finais, esse curso é para você!",

Autodesk Revit - очень многогранное и разностороннее ПО, которое требует последовательного подхода к изучению. По сравнению с тем же AutoCad, у Revit достаточно высокий порог вхождения: чтобы работа в программе не вызывала негатива и давалась легко и быстро - нужно знать и понимать множество аспектов работы. В данном курсе мы разберём принципы и методы моделирования геометрии, а также все необходимые сопутствующие вещи. По итогу Вы научитесь моделировать всё, на что хватит воображения, и даже больше!\nВ данном курсе разбираются приёмы работы, которые подходят к любой специальности. Этот курс даст вам самое главное - понимание принципов работы программы, на постижение которых мне потребовалось 2 года работы и внедрения Revit в различные организации. Знание этих принципов позволит вам не потеряться абсолютно в любой сложной ситуации и понимать куда \"копать\", чтобы найти ответ. Кроме того, в курсе есть углубление в основные инструменты моделирования, чтобы вы всегда могли при необходимости обратиться к видео и решить какую то возникшую сложную проблему. Вам не обязательно сейчас знать и понимать как работают все нюансы, но стоит один раз посмотреть чтобы понимать куда потом вернуться. Приятного Вам процесса обучения! При возникновении вопросов в курсе есть беседа со мной в телеграм, где есть люди уже прошедшие курс.",

Poznasz ścieżkę projektową i dowiesz się jak stworzyć projekt przy pomocy Archicada od pustej kartki, przez koncepcję po gotowy model budynku 3d i jego dokumentację.\nKurs podzielony jest na 4 sekcje. W pierwszej z nich dowiesz się jak stworzyć kontekst i podkłady  potrzebne do przygotowania koncepcji architektonicznej. Następnie koncepcję budynku przedstawisz na rysunkach w szczegółowości przystosowanej do prezentacji przed inwestorem lub komisją konkursową. W sekcji trzeciej uszczegółowisz model budynku za precyzując materiały budowlane, struktury warstwowe, wykończenia, profile złożone i inne. Na koniec wygenerujesz dokumentację w szczegółowości projektu budowlanego.\nW naszym biurze na co dzień szukamy czystych i minimalistycznych rozwiązań  architektonicznych - Archicad daje nam do tego praktyczne narzędzie, a zdobytą wiedzę przekazujemy Wam.\nCo daje nam znajomość programów BIM podczas codziennej pracy w biurze Trzy14 Architekci?\nNa bieżąco oglądamy projektowane budynki w 3d, łatwo tworzymy realistyczne wizualizacje w czasie rzeczywistym, zwiedzamy projektowaną architekturę w goglach wirtualnej rzeczywistości, drukujemy modele w 3d, szybko rozwiązujemy skomplikowane problemy projektowe.\nPo prostu nasza praca jest przyjemniejsza i prostsza ;)\nKurs skierowany jest do studentów architektury i osób chcących rozpocząć swoją przygodę z architekturą. Uczymy systemu pracy od podstaw, możesz wziąć udział w kursie nie mając żadnej wiedzy o tym programie.\nZapraszamy na nasz nowy kurs!\nUwaga: Na stronie Udemy dostępne są jedynie materiały wideo używane jako pomoc podczas kursu na żywo: \"Projektuj z Archicadem\". Dowiesz się z nich między innymi jak przygotować w Archicadzie model do wizualizacji. Jednak sam proces tworzenia wizualizacji przekazujemy bezpośrednio kursantom podczas zajęć, dlatego nie jest ujęty w zgromadzonych tu filmach.",

Il tutto partendo da una planimetria in DWG.\n\nAnche se non interessato all'esame di certificazione, il percorso formativo offre comunque suggerimenti e metodi per impostare correttamente e gestire agevolmente il tuo modello BIM durante le fasi progettuali ma soprattutto come avere il massimo controllo su ogni suo aspetto grafico in ogni vista del tuo progetto Revit.

Bunu bilerek kursa kaydolmanızı rica ederim.\n\n\nKURS AÇIKLAMASI\nBu kurs tamamen gerçek verilerden elde edilmiş örnek Apartman projesi üzerinden ilerliyor. Kursun asıl amacı ruhsat projelerinin revit ile nasıl daha pratik ve doğru şekilde çizilebileceğini uygulamalı örnek üzerinden göstermektir.\nSektörde Revit ile proje çizenlerin sayısı Autocad ile çizenlere göre epeyce azdır. Halbuki Revit ile daha gerçekçi çizimler oluşturulduğu için daha doğrusu yapıyı arazi ile birlikte modelleyebildiğimiz için oluşabilecek sıkıntıları erkenden fark edebiliyoruz. Bu sayede daha sorunsuz projeler elde etmek çok kolay.\nBu kurs sayesinde piyasada iş arayan değil, aranan kişi olun.

      "description": "\"Do que vale olhar sem ver?\"\nGoethe\n\n\nEste é um curso on-line e, por conseguinte, para que o aprendizado tenha efeito, é necessária a participação do aluno, e assim fazer os exercícios propostos; oferecer questionamentos; e buscar aprofundar o conteúdo. O dinamismo do curso é decorrente disso de forma inexorável. Ademais, o aprendizado depende sempre em boa parte da vontade de quem quer aprender (!).\n\n\nO desenvolvimento de tecnologias tem transformado essencialmente a dinâmica da profissão, sobretudo, na \"produção do projeto\" nos escritórios. Mas, o talento é algo que independe disso. A Arquitetura continua a ser uma área que exige profissionais criativos, que sejam capazes de oferecer boas soluções técnico-funcionais transformadas em expressão formal de qualidade, já que a obra arquitetônica é em sua quintessência uma expressão formal. Ademais, todo estudante  Arquiteto, a princípio, espera que o curso o capacite a ter sua assinatura  reconhecida como a de um profissional criativo.\n\n\nDe acordo com correntes de pensamento, este curso parte do princípio de que a multidisciplinaridade ou a interação entre as matérias de teoria e as da prática ou de ateliê são o caminho ideal para uma dinâmica de aprendizado que corresponda aos novos tempos. O objetivo é de que o aluno passe a perceber a maneira como o conhecimento oferecido pelas matérias pode e devem retroalimentar- se e assim, como o estudo da teoria, sobretudo, a que trata da análise das Artes em geral contribui para o rendimento nas práticas de ateliê ou nas matérias dedicadas ao projeto.  O estudo da Teoria da Arte, portanto, não pode permanecer apenas como tradição \"burocrática do ensino da Arquitetura\", conquanto,  seja ele, por si só, fundamental para forjar talentos a partir da construção do olhar sensível e analítico das obras de Arte. Reinterpretando o pensamento de Le Corbuiser: \"O respeito pela Arte  dos períodos passados, incluindo a Arquitetura, deve ser o mesmo que um filho tem pelos pais\".\n\n\nLer a obra arquitetônica é, com efeito, saber analisá-la. Análise, palavra de origem grega, significa decompor. Sendo assim, este minicurso tem como objetivo principal capacitar o aluno para saber analisar a obra arquitetônica e, a partir disso, poder construir um repertório de referências que o induzam às escolhas certas na busca pelas soluções de natureza formal. Entender os componentes ou funcionamento do arranjo de formas é fundamental para a formação do Arquiteto. Nas palavras do autor Simon Unwin: \"(...) a forma mais bem-sucedida de se começar a enfrentar as dificuldades de praticar qualquer disciplina criativa é mostrar-se curioso e analítico com relação à obra de outros (...) Tudo exige análise - entender e avaliar o que aconteceu antes - como base para a ação criativa\"\nComo meios e parâmetros para esse tipo de análise, são ensinados os princípios de duas áreas do conhecimento: Semiótica e Gestalt. Os conhecimentos da Semiótica são usados para a compreensão das características simbólicas da obra arquitetônica, bem como, para a compreensão de como as formas podem traduzir intenções dessa natureza determinadas ainda na fase de concepção da ideia, ou seja, na formulação de um conceito. Da Gestalt, é extraída a Teoria da Forma relacionada à percepção humana a partir de suas capacidades instintivas e as cognitivas, desenvolvidas ao longo da vida  - a  cognição consiste em um conjunto de habilidades mentais e cerebrais que são necessárias para a apreensão do conhecimento sobre o mundo, incluindo a compreensão das formas: Tanto as naturais como as pensadas pelo Homem, sobretudo, as arquitetônicas.\n\n\nEspera-se ainda que ao final do curso o aluno esteja apto a aprimorar a maneira como justifica suas intenções formais além das demandas de ordem técnico-funcional. Outra expectativa é de que o aluno inicie a construção de um senso estético apurado, construído a partir do estudo e da observação.  Como parte do conteúdo teórico, são oferecidos estudos de casos exemplificando os conceitos ensinados.\n\n\nA cada princípio ensinado, um estudo de caso é oferecido. Esse dinamismo é reforçado pelo uso de vídeos, animações  e slides com narração. Como parte dos recursos pedagógicos são disponibilizados links de vídeos da internet e textos contendo artigos.\n\n\nAo final, é oferecido um trabalho de conclusão do curso que permite ao aluno exercitar o conteúdo transmitido.\n\n\nRecomenda-se que o aluno matricule-se em outros dois cursos de autoria do instrutor: \"Método para projetos de Arquitetura\"  (Nível 1) e \"O processo criativo para arquitetos: Aprendendo a  projetar \" (Nível 2). São cursos cujos conteúdos tem íntima relação com o que aqui é ofertado  no sentido de proporcionar o desenvolvimento da capacidade de projetar.\n\n\nInicie agora! Aproveite o aprendizado aqui ofertado para buscar o melhor rendimento possível em seu curso, e assim levando-o alcançar os diferenciais necessários para se destacar no mercado de trabalho. Ao contrário da vocação, o talento pode sim ser forjado (!).\n\n\nOs que se inscreverem receberão o link para assistir na íntegra e gratuitamente o documentário: Oscar Niemeyer - Sensibilidade e Erudição.",

Uno strumento potentissimo e molto ricercato.\nNel corso non è richiesta una particolare abilità o conoscenza del settore della computer grafica, né tanto meno in quello della programmazione. I due software adottati, Blender (2.7x) per la modellazione 3D e per la renderizzazione \"statica\" e Unreal Engine 4 per l'interazione sono entrambi Open Source e GRATUITI. La potenza e la professionalità di entrambi e assolutamente rinomata.\nIl corso è strutturato in 3 moduli:\n- BLENDER - COSTRUZIONE DEL MODELLO ARCHITETTONICO PER RENDER STATICO;\n- BLENDER - COSTRUZIONE DEL MODELLO ARCHITETTONICO PER INTERAZIONE;\n- UNREAL ENGINE 4 PER 'INTERAZIONE.\nIl corso segue un percorso preciso in cui ci si prospetta di realizzare un modello di una villa completa, con gli interni e gli esterni, realizzando viste fotorealistiche. Il Primo modulo è pensato per le viste statiche (render) interne ed esterne, mentre il secondo rivede la modellazione per essere poi esportata in Unreal Engine 4 per l'interazione.\nL'approccio è pratico e essenziale in base agli argomenti esposti (architettura), ma consente, una volta appresi i concetti di spaziare da soli in altri progetti e campi.\nNon è richiesta alcuna competenza in materia di programmazione, in quanto la programmazione visuale (Blueprint) in Unreal Engine 4 è spiegata per quanto attiene gli argomenti affrontati (Player, materiali, animazione porte, accensione luci).\nSono forniti tutti gli asset necessari per procedere con i progetti e possono essere scaricati dalle lezioni di competenza.\nInoltre, in regalo, sono forniti:\n- il PRIMO VOLUME di \"BLENDER - LA GUIDA DEFINITIVA\", il primo di una serie di ben 5 libri (2500 pagine) che affrontano ogni aspetto in dettaglio di Blender;\n- il volume \"PBR THEORY & BLENDER\", in cui si siegano i concetti fondamentali del fotorealismo in funzione del comportamento reale della luce incidente sulle superfici;\n- il volume \"UNREAL ENGINE 4 PER TUTTI\", in cui si procede passo passo nella creazione di un breve videogioco.\nBuon divertimento!",

En aquellos sistemas más complejos que requieran circulación de agua caliente o fría por tuberías como válvulas, bombas etc., se requerirá una información adicional para el diseño en detalle de estos elementos, ya que el incluirlo en el programa del curso hubiera aumentado excesivamente la duración del mismo.\nHe intentado que el curso sea ameno y fácil de comprender. He incluido catálogos de fabricantes y ejemplos, de forma que sea lo más práctico y útil posible.\nSe hace especial incidencia en sistemas de alta eficiencia y aprovechamiento de energías renovables porque creo que es importante que la actividad humana sea compatible con un bajo consumo de recursos energéticos.",

Mediante ejemplos prácticos, específicos, desarrollaremos distintos tipos de familias, entre ellos:\nFamilia paramétricas sencilla (tinaco )\nFamilia paramétrica media (registro sanitario)\nFamilia paramétricas compleja (Tanque estacionario)\nFamilia anidada (lavabo - Monomando - cespol - ovalín)\nFamilia referenciada a un anfitrión (viquieta y bovedilla)\nFamilias de Etiqueta (Plumbing Fixtures Tags)\nEjercicios (cisterna)\nEdición de Familia (puerta pivote)\nFamilia eléctrica (Luminaria Decorativa)\nComenzamos con un a introducción teórica breve donde conocerás conceptos básicos, del programa, saber como se clasifican los elementos, el flujo adecuado de trabajo con familias, y a ubicar los archivos de plantillas y familias por defecto.\nPosteriormente en los ejercicios prácticos, se irán desarrollando paso por paso, cada una de las familias cargables, en el cual se irán aplicado las herramientas que ofrece Revit para parametrizarlas, y automatizarlas. De las que destacan: la creación de geometría sólida, geometría vacía,  creación de parámetros (tipo e instancia), formulas, restricciones, referencias, y muchas otras mas.\nA diferencia de las familias de sistema, las cargables se crean en archivos RFA externos y se importan (se cargan) a los proyectos.\nLas familias cargables se utilizan para crear:\nComponentes de edificación que normalmente se adquieren e instalan en un edificio , como ventanas, puertas, mobiliario y vegetación\nComponentes de instalaciones que normalmente se adquieren e instalan en un edificio, como calderas calentadores de agua, unidades de tratamiento del aire y muebles sanitarios\nComponentes de anotación que se suelen personalizar, con la información que deseamos mostrar\nAl poderse personalizar tanto, las familias cargables son las que se crean y modifican con mayor frecuencia en Revit.\nAsí mismo si están interesados en una familia en particular puedes ir directamente a la clase de su desarrollo y descargar su archivo \".rfa\" para que las uses en tus proyectos. No sin antes recomendarte ver la clase No. 3 (revisión) para su adecuada manipulación",

      "description": "Este é um curso on-line e, por conseguinte, para que o aprendizado tenha efeito, é necessária a participação do aluno: Fazer os exercícios propostos; oferecer questionamentos; buscar aprofundar o conteúdo. O dinamismo do curso é decorrente disso de forma inexorável. Ademais, o aprendizado depende em boa parte da vontade de quem quer aprender (!).\n\n\nO curso de Arquitetura tem em sua grade curricular ensinamentos que possibilitam a especialização em vários temas, que, por sua vez, podem ser um trunfo para a inserção no mercado de trabalho. Soma-se a isso, o aumento de alternativas na chamada ação empreendedora ou empreendedorismo. O Arquiteto também pode ser um empresário.\n\n\nÉ grande a oferta, por exemplo, de produtos e serviços oferecidos por empresas especializadas em cozinhas planejadas que, por sua vez, demandam especialistas tanto para a venda como para uma consultoria no sentido de atender as necessidades de cada cliente, sejam as relativas à estética e aos limites físicos dos espaços. Projetar uma boa cozinha é uma arte!\n\n\nHá também o mercado de Cozinhas Industriais, que leva a conhecer mais profundamente o tema, pois é necessário ampliar tanto o conhecimento sobre o processo para a produção de refeições como sobre os equipamentos. O Arquiteto pode, portanto, tornar-se um especialista, e assim atender não só as indústrias como também restaurantes, hotéis e hospitais.\n\n\nApesar da duração do curso de Arquitetura ser de cinco anos, é impossível o aprofundamento necessário em muitos dos conhecimentos aprendidos. Não há nenhuma matéria voltada pra um aprendizado capaz de tornar o estudante um especialista em projetos para cozinhas, e muito menos no caso das industriais. Esse conhecimento acaba sendo apreendido na prática ou de maneira empírica. Sendo assim, um dos objetivos deste minicurso é oferecer um complemento ao curso de Arquitetura.\n\n\nÀ guisa de introdução, são ensinados os princípios de importantes áreas do conhecimento: a Ergonomia e a Antropometria. A Ergonomia é a disciplina científica relacionada ao entendimento das interações entre seres humanos e outros elementos de um sistema de trabalho. O seu conhecimento induz a projetar a fim de otimizar o bem-estar humano e o bom desempenho nos ambientes de trabalho. A Antropometria reconhece os diferentes biotipos e assim, as medidas do corpo humano que variam de acordo com a raça. Assim, esse conhecimento torna-se um forte aliado do bom rendimento de ambientes de trabalho, pois como nos ensina a própria arquitetura: \"As coisas devem estar às medidas do Homem\".\n\n\nAlém disso, são ensinados os princípios para pensar o lay-out  de acordo com as especificidades das cozinhas residenciais e industriais.\n\n\nExercícios são oferecidos  para a prática da teoria. O conteúdo é formado por aulas de curta duração com objetividade e dinamismo.\n\n\nO curso é vitalício e conta ainda com a interação entre aluno e instrutor, que tem como princípio responder os questionamentos da maneira mais célere possível.\n\n\nComo em qualquer curso, recomenda-se um estudo contínuo por meio de outras fontes. No caso das cozinhas industriais, recomenda-se visitas às empresas especializadas após a conclusão deste curso a fim de adquirir maior conhecimento, sobretudo, o relativo aos equipamentos e tecnologias disponíveis no mercado. Visitas a cozinhas de hospitais e hotéis são  uma alternativa a considerar a fim de que sejam feitos estudos de casos.\n\n\nAos leigos que se interessarem pelo curso, o conteúdo pode servir como aprendizado para formar critérios de avaliação do trabalho de profissionais a serem contratados e, como consequência, assim, para aferir a qualidade do projeto e dos produtos aplicados.\n\n\nComece já e acrescente mais uma especialidade à sua formação para ampliar as chances de inserção no mercado de trabalho.",

Con este método, puedes disminuir sustancialmente la factura de la luz y aumentar el confort y salud de tus clientes en el interior de sus viviendas al incorporarlo dentro de tu método de diseño. Ya que primero se realiza un análisis de los parámetros existentes del entorno, y una vez que has realizado el análisis completo y tienes el comportamiento de ese proyecto en una zona determinada se proponen una serie de estrategias pasivas para optimizar la iluminación natural, la ventilación y el uso de los recursos naturales para calentar y enfriar la vivienda.\nEn este curso aprenderás los motivos por los cuales construir de forma sostenible es muy importante, y una vez que lo conozcas entraremos de lleno en el desarrollo de dos tipos de estrategias, las de verano que están encaminadas en reducir el uso del aire acondicionado mediante estrategias que ayuden a refrescar el proyecto. Y por otro lado tendremos las estrategias de invierno que lo que buscaremos es calentar de forma natural ese proyecto que estés diseñando en este momento.\nSi estas buscando dar más valor a tus clientes, ¡La arquitectura bioclimática, te ayuda a lograrlo!\nEste es el mejor inicio en la arquitectura sostenible y mejorar la eficiencia energetica de tus proyectos a través de un diseño pasivo.",

Esse curso de capacitação foi elaborado pelo escritório AF Arquitetura e Construção, que possui o selo Multitop 2018 de Qualidade e Excelência nos serviços prestados. Muito desse prêmio se deve ao fato de os projetos saírem com excelente aceitação por parte dos clientes.\nDurante o curso serão demonstradas as principais ferramentas do \"V-Ray\". Trabalharemos cenas interna e externa. A cena interna foi trabalhada na cozinha, haja vista a complexidade de se criar imagens fotorrealísticas em tal ambiente, por meio de criação e edição de materiais, iluminação e configurações de cenas. Para a cena externa, foi pensada uma \"renderização\" a partir da rua que faz frente ao imóvel, trabalhando toda a iluminação, o entorno, a humanização externa e as configurações da cena.\nEsse curso é demonstrado com a versão \"Next\" do \"V-Ray para Sketchup\", mas abrange alunos que pussuem o \"V-Ray\" a partir da versão \"3.4\".\nNão é exigido um conhecimento prévio do software \"V-Ray para Sketchup\", apenas é interessante que se tenha um conhecimento prévio do software de modelagem 3D \"Sketchup\", além da força de vontade do aluno em assimilar o conteúdo.\nAqui o aluno encontrará tudo o que precisa para fazer imagens 3D realistas, com todo o suporte necessário.\nSem delongas, aguardo-os nas aulas.",

      "description": "Este é um curso on-line e, por conseguinte, para que o aprendizado tenha efeito, é necessária a participação do aluno e assim: fazer os exercícios propostos; oferecer questionamentos; e buscar aprofundar o conteúdo. O dinamismo e a eficiência do curso são decorrentes disso de forma inexorável. Ademais, o aprendizado depende em boa parte da vontade de aprender (!).\n\n\nImportante; este minicurso é a continuidade do minicurso: \"Método para projetos de Arquitetura\" (Nível 1). Recomenda-se, portanto, que este seja atendido como etapa preparatória para o melhor aproveitamento do conteúdo ofertado nesta nova oportunidade.\n\n\nNos dois cursos, o objetivo primordial é oferecer o conhecimento necessário para a prática projetual, ou seja, para que o aluno possa usufruir de um método de trabalho eficiente que o permita projetar a obra arquitetônica em qualquer tema ou nível de complexidade.\n\n\nComo no primeiro nível 1, o conteúdo do curso foi construído sem deixar de considerar que o projeto arquitetônico é, com efeito, um equacionamento simultâneo de fatores intervenientes construídos a partir da análise do tema do ponto de vista funcional  e, em especial, da formulação da conceituação. Mas pensar a  obra arquitetônica, pressupõe considerar também aspectos humanos, filosóficos, ecológicos, tecnológicos, econômicos, históricos e geográficos. Nesse sentido, é enfatizada a formulação de conceitos como diferencial fundamental da Arquitetura em relação à mera construção e como a etapa fundamental do processo criativo de uma atividade essencialmente alimentada pela criatividade para pensar formas e aspectos  de natureza funcional.\n\n\nComo consequência, nas primeiras aulas o principal objetivo é levar o aluno a entender que um conceito deve ser o elemento condutor primordial do processo criativo que pode se dar a partir do exercício de analogias e abstração como meios para alcançar novas abordagens para o tema em questão. Ademais, o conceito deve ser capaz de promover a articulação de todas as condicionantes inerentes ao projeto arquitetônico - sem conceitos, a obra arquitetônica nada mais é do que uma mera construção, que pode ser pensada por outros profissionais e até mesmo por leigos.\n\n\nSendo assim, além da revisão das definições dos protocolos que constituem o Processo Criativo apresentados no primeiro curso,  é enfatizado o uso do protocolo fundamental: a conceituação. Nesse sentido, são oferecidos estudos de casos a partir do pensamento e obras de preclaros da Arquitetura como exemplos de conceitos que resultaram em obras consideradas icônicas. Além disso, espera-se que o aluno perceba que a Arquitetura é sempre resultado da evolução do pensamento.\n\n\nUm exercício é oferecido como preparação para o trabalho final. O aluno é convidado a formular um conceito para um projeto por meio de uma curta redação. É, com efeito, um exercício que parte do princípio de que o primeiro passo é compreender o tema a partir do exercício da abstração. E de que o estudo de um objeto parte necessariamente do seu entendimento tanto a partir das experiências do observador - considerando a própria vivência - e da definição do objeto historicamente construída e pensada.  O domínio da cultura arquitetônica é parte da base importante da criatividade e é disso que o espírito criador sempre se alimenta.\n\n\nMais uma vez, um exercício final é proposto: um projeto de média complexidade no nível de um Estudo Preliminar cujo tema é a escola. A tarefa possibilita que o aluno aplique o método ensinado no qual estão incluídos os protocolos inerentes ao desenvolvimento do projeto arquitetônico. Quais sejam:  O Programa de Necessidades,  Organograma, o Fluxograma, o Lançamento de Manchas, e o Estudo Volumétrico.\n\n\nPara os exercícios, os alunos podem usar os programas que melhor dominam: AUTOCAD ou BIM. O que importa é o resultado e não os meios. Ademias, este é um curso que trata da criatividade e não do ensino de tecnologias para o desenvolvimento de projetos ou dos softwares aplicados à Arquitetura. O que o faz um arquiteto é sua criatividade, e não o quanto domina o conhecimento sobre aplicativos.\n\n\nA segunda parte do curso, que corresponde ao terceiro nível do curso de processo criativo, oferece um segundo método para pensar a obra arquitetônica: o SCAMPER.  A metodologia foi criada na década de 70 por Bob Eberle. O método SCAMPER é uma ferramenta para o desenvolvimento da criatividade utilizada para organizar o processo de brainstorm. Pode ser utilizada para encontrar soluções e também para desenvolver novos projetos e produtos. Atualmente, o modelo é utilizado em empresas para estimular a buscar ideias inovadoras.\n\nEssa metodologia foi adaptada para criação da obra arquitetônica utilizando os seus princípios. Quais sejam:\n1- Substituir\n2- Combinar\n3- Adaptar\n4- Modificar\n5- Propor\n6- Eliminar\n7- Rearrumar\n\n\nUtilizando o método SCAMPER, como prática de brainstorming, o principal objetivo é fazer com que os alunos apreendam técnicas para desbloquear o potencial criativo e explorar novas formas de pensar. Espera-se que eles assimilem um processo criativo para desenvolver a destreza na criação de conceitos que possam, a posteriori, ser aplicados em qualquer tema de projeto abordado independentemente do nível de complexidade.\n\n\nEspera-se, portanto, que os alunos desenvolvam habilidades para a resolução de problemas de forma inovadora, aprendendo a identificar desafios e gerar soluções criativas de maneira eficaz. Assim, é esperado também que os alunos saibam aplicar seus conhecimentos em projetos práticos ou em situações do mundo real.\n\n\nO curso oferece aulas com objetividade e dinamismo, por meio do uso de vídeos, animações e slides.\n\n\nCabe ressaltar que além do certificado, o trabalho final pode ser incorporado ao portfólio, e assim proporcionar a inserção no mercado de trabalho, durante a graduação ou como profissional formado. Outrossim, vale também lembrar a possiblidade de participar de concursos de ideias, e que o projeto do TCC pode ser selecionado para participar do concurso \"Ópera Prima\", que se tornou uma oportunidade tradicional para que novos talentos se apresentem para o mercado de trabalho. Um de meus alunos foi agraciado com menção honrosa em concurso de ideias creditando esse feito ao método ensinado.\n\n\nO acesso ao curso é vitalício, possibilitando, portanto, acessar as aulas quantas vezes forem necessárias. Além disso, plataforma permite que o aluno entre em contato com o instrutor à medida em que dúvidas surgirem, bem com, para a apreciação dos tarefas.\n\n\nComo aula bônus, o curso oferece como ensinamento os princípios para a boa escrita do Memoriais Descritivo e Justificativo. Nem sempre o autor do projeto tem a oportunidade de defender suas ideias pessoalmente, como acontece nos concursos de ideias de Arquitetura. A escrita, portanto, é uma forma importante de comunicação entre o Arquiteto e público para explicar o raciocínio adotado para encontrar a solução adotada. Expressar-se bem, falando ou escrevendo, é um dos diferenciais que definem um bom profissional, qualquer que seja a área de atuação profissional.\n\n\nInscreva-se já! Comece a praticar o método ensinado tanto nas matérias de projeto como nos concursos de ideias para estudantes de Arquitetura. São oportunidades de ter o seu nome reconhecido como um talento antes de finalizada a graduação.\n\n\nOs que se inscreverem receberão como bônus o link para assistir na íntegra e gratuitamente o documentário: Oscar Niemeyer - Sensibilidade e Erudição.",

      "description": "Ao contrário do que é oferecido nos vídeos disponíveis na internet, este minicurso tem como forte diferencial a visão de um professor sobre o tema. Nesse sentido, o objetivo é a melhor preparação possível desde a fase da escolha orientador e do tema a ser abordado até a apreciação da banca de avaliação. Um dos questionamentos mais comuns entre os estudantes reside na pergunta: \"O que a banca espera de um projeto de Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso (TCC ) ou que faz essa banca examinadora perceber que o aluno está apto a exercer a profissão?\". Essa é uma das perguntas respondidas neste curso.\n\n\nO TCC que é apenas a finalização da primeira etapa da vida profissional que, com efeito, começa no dia em que o estudante inicia o curso. Ademais, o projeto do TCC deve ser encarado como o mais importante do portfólio, pois além de sintetizar todo o conhecimento adquirido, pode significar a primeira oportunidade de reconhecimento profissional, vide os concursos tradicionais como o \"Ópera Prima\" e outros, que têm contribuído para a descoberta de novos talentos para um mercado de trabalho cada vez mais acirrado , mas que sempre está aberto aos novos talentos. Um TCC bem-sucedido pode significar oportunidades trabalhos determinantes para uma carreira bem-sucedida.\n\n\nO projeto do TCC é o único projeto em que o estudante escolhe o tema. A definição do tema é, portanto, uma fase crucial. Essa escolha deve depender das experiências durante o curso, incluindo as habilidades desenvolvidas. Sendo assim, o curso oferece a oportunidade para fazer uma reflexão sobre a relação entre o tema abordado e os objetivos profissionais almejados.\nConsiderando que o TCC é um trabalho científico, e assim sujeito à normatização, fazem parte do conteúdo as orientações para escrever a monografia.\n\n\nO curso, entretanto, exime-se da obrigação de ensinar aspectos formais tais como as normas para a inserção de citações ou normatização de fonte e parágrafo. Entende-se que a normatização pode ser facilmente apreendida por meio de pesquisa na em páginas que disponibilizem o que determina a ABNT (Associação de Normas Técnicas) ou pela coordenação do curso.\n\n\nAconselha-se a atender os cursos \"Método para projetos de Arquitetura\" (Nível 1) e o \"O Processo Criativo para Arquitetos: aprendendo a projetar\" (Nível 2), já que um dos temas considerados no conteúdo é o domínio do processo criativo para projetar as obras arquitetônicas como item, em princípio, a ser necessariamente aferido pela banca examinadora.\n\n\nO curso também se exime da obrigação de ensinar aspectos formais tais como as normas para a inserção de citações ou normatização de fonte e parágrafo. Entende-se que as normatização pode ser facilmente apreendida por meio de pesquisa na em páginas que disponibilizem o que determina a ABNT (Associação de Normas Técnicas) ou pela coordenação do curso. Entretanto, como recurso pedagógico, é oferecido o link do vídeo que ensina a maneira de formatar o arquivo o Word de acordo com o que determina a norma.\n\n\nO conteúdo é formado por aulas curtas e objetivas que contam com animações de maneira a torná-las dinâmicas e cativantes. Mas é importante a interação entre o aluno e instrutor, pois o aprendizado depende em grande parte da vontade de quem quer aprender. Nenhum exercício é oferecido, entretanto, como a plataforma possibilita a comunicação entre aluno e instrutor, coloco-me à disposição para a acompanhar todas as etapas a serem cumpridas no TCC.\n\n\nO curso é vitalício e pode ser acessado de acordo com a disponibilidade de tempo do aluno. Além disso, as aulas podem ser vistas quantas vezes forem necessárias - um excelente custo-benefício.\n\n\nComo bônus, é oferecido o link para assistir o documentário \"Oscar Niemeyer . Sensibilidade e Erudição, produzido pelo Documenta, canal da Arquitetura.\n\n\nInscreva-se e inicie o mais rápido possível para garantir o sucesso na apresentação de seu TCC!",

Além disso, você vai ver também como criar um novo arquivo, escolher um template preferido e posteriormente salvar um template conforme suas necessidades e salvar e editar elementos favoritos.\nNa parte de documentação você vaio entender como criar os cortes transversais e longitudinais, além de editar as configurações como por exemplo definir se o corte vai ser em preto e branco ou colirodo, com ou sem transparência em materiais como vidro por exemplo. Vai aprender também a criar as fachadas do projeto e fazer as mesmas definições como fez nos cortes. Depois de criar os desenhos vai compreender como criar as cotas cotas de nível, de elevação, e cotas comuns, nomes e informações de ambientes como área medida e quando finalizar a documentação você vai aprender a salvar vistas de cada desenho de forma que cada um possa ter uma configuração diferente de escala, conjuntos de vegetais (camadas/layers), e etc.\nNa parte de plotagem você vai aprender a criar um novo Leiaute Mestre.

El Diagramas de Interacción es la región geométrica que define la zona en las que cualquier combinación de cargas de flexo-compresión pueden ser resistidas por la columna y su armado en la dirección de análisis.\nEn el pasado se recurría a diagramas genéricos creados por \"expertos\", que permitían estimar la resistencia de cualquier columna, pero que dependía de cargar con nosotros un libro de dichos diagramas para calcular las columnas. Sin embargo, hoy día con el uso de las computadoras, llevar un archivo en Excel en un USB es la cosa más práctica que ha venido a sucedernos.\nNo obstante, pocos son los que saben como calcular estos diagramas y de los muchos que se publicitan en la red, sus intrincadas formulaciones y protecciones de código impiden saber que tan aplicables son a nuestras normativas, o bien las consideraciones y criterios que el creador está usando.\nEste curso pretende traer luz a esa problemática mostrándote como interpretar el modelo normativo de las Normas Técnicas Complementarias de Cd. de México y mediante un algoritmo básico convertirlo en una aplicación automática sobre Excel.\nOBJETIVO: Al terminar el curso, el participante podrá crear sus propios diagramas de interacción de columnas rectangulares de concreto reforzado con varillas de acero, comprendiendo el modelo empleado por las Normas Técnicas Complementarias CDMX 2017. Así mismo podrá crear una hoja de cálculo Microsoft Excel (R) que le permita generar de forma automatizada y mediante el empleo de VBA, los diagramas.\nSe te explican los mecanismos de análisis, y se te lleva paso a paso en el razonamiento del algoritmo para crear tu automatización en Excel, para luego darte una pequeña introducción en la creación de tus propios comandos en VBA que sean aplicables a tu automatización.\n\n\nLOS PARTICIPANTES COMENTAN:\n\n\nDECISIONES EXCELENTES\n\nExplicación Clara, Información Útil, Actividades Prácticas.\nExcelente decisión.\nRicardo Hugo Morales Bartolon\n\n\nExplicación Clara, Información Útil, Actividades Prácticas.\nJorge Edgar Palma Carrillo",

      "description": "Autocad programını çok basit şekilde, kolayca ve etkili olarak sıfırdan rahatça kullanmayı öğreneceksiniz. Bu set içinde size \"AutoCAD'te bu da mı varmış?\" dedirtmeye çalıştım. Bunun yanında max gibi modelleme programı kullanarak mimari projelere hacim kazandıran arkadaşların uygulaması gereken, onlara \"Oh!\" çektirecek hazırlık safhasını da anlatmaya çalıştım. Bu eğitimi hazırlamamın bir sebebi ise piyasada neredeyse herkes autocadi kullandığını söylüyor ama mimari plan çizimlerinde dahi bir tık zor çizim verince tıkanan insanlar görmek beni üzdü. gelin eksiklerimizi görüp tamamlayalım. Gayet basit ama bir o kadar da etkili komutları kullanmayı ve karşılacak problemlerin çözüm yöntemlerini anlayıp bu problemlerle baş edebilme yollarını anlayalım. Günümüz teknoloji çağında artık el ile çizim diye bir şey kalmadığına göre, mesleğinize uygun çizim programını blmelisiniz deriz. AutoCad bu programlardan biri değildir çünkü bu program tek bir mesleğin kullandığı bir program değildir. Neredeyse her sektörün her mesleğin kullandığı ilk programdır. Özellikle tüm dünyada 2d çizim denilince akla ilk gelen programdır. 2d çizimde çok etkili olmasına rağmen son yıllarda 3d konusunda da önemli ihtiyaçları da karşılayabilen bir programdır. AutoCadi kullanan meslekleri ve alanları saymakla bitiremeyiz. Ancak belli başlıları mimarlık, inşaat, makina demekle bile ne kadar geniş bir sektörde karşılığı olduğunu hemen anlarız. Bu sebeple teknik hangi dalda meslek sahibi olursanız olun bilmeniz gereken ilk program AutoCad olarak karşımıza çıkar.",

Deze werden geconcipieerd en opgenomen door Stefan Boeykens en maken gebruik van ArchiCAD 18 NED (de regionale versie van ArchiCAD voor België en Nederland, verdeeld door Kubus). Het grootste deel van de inhoud is bruikbaar met andere taalversies of ook (iets) oudere versies van ArchiCAD.\nDeze module omvat de ontwerpfase \"VoorOntwerp\", met de focus op een niet-gedetailleerde, schematische weergave van het model, zoals gebruikt tijdens de conceptfase en de eerste ontwerp presentaties.\nEr wordt een 3D Model van een kleine, eengezinswoning uitgewerkt. Hoewel alle stappen worden doorlopen, wordt niet iedere modelleerstap voorgedaan.\nEr wordt wel een algemene bouwkennis verondersteld en ook een zekere ervaring met algemene grafische software is aanbevolen.\nHet ontwerp bevat een aantal bewust gekozen elementen, zoals een deel plat dak en een deel hellend en ook de aansluiting tegen een buurwoning.\nAndere modules (in andere cursussen) zullen verder ingaan op een \"UitvoeringsOntwerp\" en andere aspecten van de ArchiCAD software.",

      "description": "Este é um curso on-line e, por conseguinte, para que o aprendizado tenha efeito, é necessária a participação do aluno e assim: fazer os exercícios propostos; oferecer questionamentos; buscar aprofundar o conteúdo. O dinamismo do curso é decorrente disso de forma inexorável. Ademais, o aprendizado depende em boa parte da vontade de quem quer aprender (!). O talento para qualquer atividade pode ser forjado, ao contrário da vocação. Não há atalhos para quem pretende alcançar o grau de excelência em qualquer atividade profissional que depende sempre da prática insistente alimentada pela teoria. Ademais, uma coisa retroalimenta a outra.\n\n\n\"A arte não reproduz o visível, mas torna visível. A essência da arte gráfica conduz facilmente e, com toda razão, para a abstração\". (Paul Klee).\n\n\n\" (...)ao formar, ao dar forma à imagem, o artista é obrigado a deformar. Por necessidade substituirá as formas existentes na natureza por outras. (...) Mesmo querendo inspirar-se em formas da natureza, o artista as abandona para criar formas de linguagem\" . (Ostrower)\n\n\nRecomenda-se que o aluno atenda o curso: \"Saber ler obras arquitetônicas como obra de arte\". Este curso tem com um dos objetivos ajudar a construir um olhar sensível e crítico para a forma ou a composição formal. Além disso, ensina a relação entre as formas e seus significados simbólicos a partir da capacidade cognitiva.\n\n\nEste curso, em duas seções,  foi pensado para estudantes de Arquitetura e assim, como alternativa para o aprendizado na matéria oferecida na grade curricular do curso. Mas, estudantes de Design gráfico ou os que interesse sobre o tema são bem-vindos e podem, da mesma forma, aproveitar os ensinamentos, pois os ensinamentos já que fazem parte do estudo da linguagem visual como forma de expressão, incluindo, portanto, a Arquitetura e o Design, especial, o Gráfico.\n\n\nO conteúdo foi pensado como caminho para a especialização e alternativa de prestação de serviços. Espera-se que os ensinamentos oferecidos aqui e, sobretudo, os resultados provenientes dos exercícios, levem o aluno a desenvolver a criatividade do ponto de vista  formal, aplicando-a em seus projetos de Arquitetura, bem como, de Design, incluindo o Gráfico, e em outras formas de expressão artística. O mercado de trabalho tem exigido versatilidade, capacidade de adaptação e, sobretudo, inovação.\n\n\nUm dos objetivos é instigar o olhar curioso e arguto para o mundo a nossa volta - o natural e o construído - para perceber a compreensão da complexidade de formas os geométricas bidimensionais e tridimensionais. A rigor, as formas geométricas são puros entes mentais que registramos simbolicamente, valendo-nos do desenho, para sua conservação e sua comunicação com os demais homens. A palavra “desenho” resulta, em seu mais profundo significado linguístico, altamente reveladora, porque mediante o desenho,  traçam-se sinais, ou seja, símbolos e formas de expressão artística.\n\n\nDos objetos e formas geométricas fundamentais, o aluno é levado a fazer análises – por meio do desenho de seus ‘objetos’ (arte como imitação), avança-se em direção à interpretação e à abstração (arte como criação), que objetiva o desnudamento de seus padrões orgânicos em objetos, muitas vezes ocultos. O curso busca a sensibilização do olhar para características/propriedades dos materiais nas criações artísticas bi e tridimensionais a partir do conhecimento (Seção) sobre as proporções áureas e a sequência de Fibonacci. Esses conhecimentos impõem-se como um importante instrumento ordenador para os fazeres da arte e das linguagens visuais de maneira geral, incluindo a Arquitetura. A seção áurea configura uma relação constante e invariável entre fatores sempre variáveis, individuais e únicos no espaço e no tempo.\n\n\nOutro objetivo é de levar o aluno a perceber, nas composições formais criadas, os sentidos de: Ritmo, equilíbrio, contraste, unidade, cor, harmonia e proporção como importantes propriedades composicionais. Além desses valores, é  estimulado  sentido tátil como meio de ampliar a percepção das texturas dos diferentes materiais utilizados na execução dos trabalhos.\n\n\nO minicurso conta com aulas curtas e objetivas, cuja a dinâmica é alcançada por meio de vídeos, animações e slides com áudio.  São oferecidos vários exercícios apoiados na teoria ensinada, levando a prática intensa a cada conceito ou princípio transmitido. Os exercícios são oferecidos, apoiados em aulas expositivas que servem de motivação e suporte conceitual para cada um dos temas propostos. Entre os objetivos específicos dessas tarefas estão: desenvolver a capacidade de criação de configurações tridimensionais com elementos semelhantes; desenvolver a capacidade de criação de coerência formal em composições tridimensionais; desenvolver a capacidade de efetuar a coordenação dimensional ou modular.\n\n\nO curso é vitalício e permite o contato com o instrutor ad eternum , ou seja, o aluno pode, sempre que for o seu desejo, voltar ao conteúdo para a revisão, bem como, manter contato com o instrutor a fim de superar outras dificuldades que surjam a partir da prática a posteriori.\n\n\nEste minicurso faz parte de uma estratégia didática construída pelo instrutor no sentido do desenvolvimento da versatilidade para o ato principal do Arquiteto, ou seja, projetar. Nesse sentido outros cursos são oferecidos e que tem íntima relação com esse objetivo: Quais sejam:\n\n\n1_ \"Método para projetar obras arquitetônicas\" (Nível 1) e \"O processo criativo para arquitetos: Aprendendo a projetar\" (Nível 2).\n\n\n2_ \"Saber ler obras arquitetônicas como obra de arte\" .\n\n\nInicie o mais rápido possível! Comece desde já a construir uma carreira pautada na versatilidade e assim, na capacidade de oferecer vários talentos.",

      "description": "AutoCAD è lo strumento indispensabile per tutti i progettisti, gli architetti, gli ingegneri, i geometri, i designer e gli strutturisti, il moderno tecnigrafo dell'era digitale.\nSemplice all'uso, veloce, intuitivo e versatile, AutoCAD dispone di tutti gli strumenti per disegnare, impaginare e stampare qualsiasi progetto. Ricco di librerie esterne, facilmente reperibili anche online, permette di spaziare in qualsiasi campo progettuale e di interfacciarsi con molti altri software.\nQuesto corso tratta esclusivamente - e volutamente - dell'aspetto 2D del disegno automatico, benché AutoCAD abbia gli strumenti per realizzare anche modelli 3D, incluso l'editor dei materiali e del rendering.\nTuttavia siamo del parere che ogni software nasce ed è pensato per uno scopo primario e quello di AutoCAD pesa principalmente nella rappresentazione tecnica bidimensionale di un progetto. AutoCAD nasce per realizzare tavole progettuali e dettagli tecnici in 2D. Per la rappresentazione 3D, specialmente quella fotorealistica, si rimanda e si consiglia vivamente l'utilizzo di altri software dedicati come 3D Studio Max, Blender e Maya, così come per i modelli destinati alla prototipazione ci si dovrebbe sbilanciare su Rhinoceros e per la rappresentazione tridimensionale di aspetto più \"volumetrico\" o \"a mano libera\" probabilmente è Sketchup il programma più indicato.\nAutoCAD resta comunque e sempre lo strumento base della progettazione, sia essa architettonica, strutturale o esecutiva; un elemento fondamentale per qualsiasi professionista del settore.\nNella quarta lezione sono disponibili file e materiale didattico.",

Soy un fanático del diseño y tambien tengo publicado en udemy otros cursos relacionados con diseño como Photoshop e Illustrator para novatos desde cero.\nEn esta clase vamos a iniciar aprendiendo las herramientas básicas y haciendo ajustes de imagen básicos que mejoren la iluminación de las imágenes y render.\nEste curso es para principiantes que inician desde lo básico, y que están orientado a proyectos de arquitectura y diseños de interiores.\nVamos a hacer un proyecto de diseño de interiores en el cual te voy a enseñar como partir desde un espacio vacío y llegar poner multiples elemento de ambientación y decoración.\nLuego vamos a hacer una planta arquitectónica, te voy a mostrar cómo iniciar desde un plano a blanco y negro que viene de un programa de cad y poner todos los elementos.\ntambién vamos a hacer una perspectiva desde cero. Este proyecto te va permitir la libertad de explorar un acabado completamente diferente para las elevaciones y perspectivas arquitectónicas. vamos a iniciar desde una perspectiva en líneas planas blanco y negro de tu programa de CAD, hasta hacer toda una representación artística de la estructura.\n¿Sabes los que son los render en pases?\nLos render en pases son una técnica en la cual puedes sacar los render en diversas piezas como color, fondo, mapas de sombras y otras características más, según el motor de render que uses. De esta forma puedes hacer más eficiente los fotomontajes en photoshop.\nFinalmente vamos a hacer una pieza de arte publicitario, en el cual te voy a mostrar como hacer un volante publicitario de un proyecto inmobiliario, para que puedas ver el proceso paso a paso.\nEste curso está basado en aprender con ejercicios prácticos, de modo que cada concepto aprendido será parte de un proyecto que vas a poder hacer desde cero, y te voy a dar las imágenes y recursos para que puedas seguir los videos tal cual.\nTambién te voy a pedir que hagas proyectos propios, basados en los mismo conceptos, que te ayuden a reafirmar los conocimientos y habilidades aprendidas.\nAsí que que te invito a iniciar, que yo te voy a yudar en el camino.",

Section 2 will explain and demonstrate how to plot a site survey, select the proper scale (in either Imperial or Metric) and use triangulation to locate objects within the property accurately.  Finally, Section 3 will cover proper planting graphics and symbols used in garden design for both conceptual and working drawings as well as coloring the plan by hand using colored pencils and pastels for presentation.  No prior drafting experience is required, but access to the equipment demonstrated is highly recommended.",

Começamos configurando um arquivo-modelo (layers, estilos de cota e texto, escalas e boas práticas), para que você trabalhe com organização e velocidade desde as primeiras etapas. Em seguida, avançamos para a construção do conjunto 2D: plantas baixas, cortes e fachadas, incluindo locação e situação, mobiliário e anotações essenciais (cotas, textos e áreas). Udemy+1\nVocê também vai manipular blocos de forma produtiva e gerar tabelas automáticas de esquadrias, garantindo consistência de informações e padronização do desenho. Na fase final, aprende a montar o layout, definir escala correta e plotar em formato padrão, entregando pranchas limpas e profissionais — prontas para impressão ou PDF.\nA metodologia é passo a passo, sempre conectando ferramenta a resultado de projeto. Cada módulo foi desenhado para que você veja imediatamente a aplicação prática do que está aprendendo, construindo um portfólio real ao longo do curso. Se você é iniciante, vai se sentir seguro com a progressão didática; se já tem experiência, vai padronizar seu fluxo e ganhar produtividade.\nAo final, você terá domínio para desenvolver um sobrado completo no AutoCAD, com pranchas apresentáveis e um processo replicável para outros projetos.

      "description": "Embarking on the architectural conceptualization phase is a crucial step in shaping the visual and functional identity of a space. This course serves as a guide through this initial stage, where the intricate decisions regarding spatial aesthetics and purposeful design are formulated. Whether crafting a personal haven or responding to the specific requests of clients in a professional capacity, the primary goal is to create designs that seamlessly align with distinct needs and preferences.\nIn this instructional program, we emphasize a pragmatic approach to the design and conceptualization process, employing accessible tools like Excel. While more sophisticated tools like CAD and Revit exist, they often come with a steep learning curve and significant costs. Excel, on the other hand, provides a user-friendly alternative that requires no advanced skills. This makes the course not only beneficial for architects, draftsmen, and interior designers but also for individuals without formal design backgrounds.\nThe intention is to demystify the design process, making it approachable for a wider audience. By providing insights and techniques through the lens of Excel, even those unfamiliar with intricate design software can gain an understanding of how to arrange spaces and design them to fulfill specific functions effectively. In essence, this course bridges the gap between design professionals and enthusiasts, fostering a broader appreciation for the art and science of architectural conceptualization.",

Allora sicuramente ti sarà capitato di dover usare Photoshop per ritoccare una foto di uno \"stato di fatto\" per mostrare il risultato del tuo progetto, sia per presentazioni al committente, sia per ottenere permessi dai vari enti. Questo video corso offre una serie di tutorial dedicati alla correzione ed elaborazione di architetture, creazione di varianti cromatiche, ritocco di rendering\nSi parte con una carrellata dei vari strumenti di ritocco per sistemare lo stato di fatto: dall'eliminazione di scritte e zone ridotte, al lavoro su aree più ampie con strumenti come Toppa e l'algoritmo in base al contenuto.\nVedrai poi come modificare i colori delle pareti: dell'esterno dell'edificio e dell'interno di una stanza. Con l'uso delle mascherature e dei metodi di fusione, imparerai a modificare colori e carta da parati senza perdere ombre e zone più luminose, per un risultato più realistico delle varie versioni che andai a fare per l'arredo di un soggiorno. Con le composizioni di Livello imparerai a creare varianti in maniera veloce e fluida.\nNella sezione dedicata al foto-inserimento vedrai come inserire un nuovo edificio e come aggiungere verde ed alberi in un fotomontaggio.\nAlla fine del videocorso troverai un extra con alcuni aggiornamenti degli strumenti più recenti di Photoshop e una pillola sull'utilizzo del Riempimento Generativo, ossia dell'intelligenza artificiale inclusa all'interno del programma.",

      "description": "Este é um curso on-line e, por conseguinte, para que o aprendizado tenha pleno efeito, é necessária a participação ativa do aluno e assim, oferecer questionamentos, bem como, buscar o aprofundamento do conteúdo. O dinamismo do curso é resultado de maneira inexorável da proatividade do aluno. Ademais, o aprendizado depende em boa parte da vontade de quem quer aprender (!).\n\n\nEste curso tem como objetivo preparar os estudantes para gerenciar o escritório de Arquitetura, compreendendo o impacto da maneira como ele é administrado sobre a eficiência do processo de produção de projetos como atividade de prestação de serviços. Ademais, ao administrar uma empresa, o Arquiteto assume o papel dos papéis: o de gerenciador do processo de desenvolvimento de projetos e do funcionamento do escritório do ponto de vista funcional ou organizacional. O objetivo primordial, portanto, é fazer o aluno entender que a Arquitetura é também uma atividade comercial e que não basta o talento para a colocação no mercado de trabalho. O dono de um escritório de arquitetura é também um administrador.\n\n\nAs escolas de Arquitetura omitem em sua grade curricular a preparação dos estudantes para a realidade do mercado de trabalho e para assumir o papel como empreendedor, levando a uma transição traumática da vida acadêmica para a de profissional.\n\n\nNa primeira seção, o conteúdo é dedicado às questões relacionadas ao gerenciamento do escritório de Arquitetura como empresa e ao Arquiteto na condição de empresário e empreendedor. Sendo assim, entre os temas tratados estão: a necessidade em firmar contratos de prestação de serviço; as maneiras vigentes para a cobrança de honorários; a importância do marketing digital para impulsionar os negócios; a proatividade no ambiente de trabalho; o estabelecimento de metas e objetivos; o domínio dos recursos tecnológicos; e a constante atualização do profissional em todos os aspectos relacionados à sua atividade: técnicos e administrativos.\n\n\nNa segunda seção, o conteúdo é dedicado ao engajamento do Arquiteto no Processo Construtivo. Nesse sentido, o curso ensina como o arquiteto deve atuar como protagonista desse processo, que se inicia antes mesmo do projeto - na relação com o cliente – até à execução da edificação no canteiro de obras. O curso, entretanto, não ensina o desenvolvimento de Projeto Executivo ou como gerenciar obras, demandando um curso aparte. O conteúdo aqui oferecido tem como mote principal, como o que foi dito acima, questões mais relacionadas à administração de um escritório de Arquitetura e o papel do Arquiteto no Processo Construtivo.\n\n\nO curso parte do princípio de que o Processo Construtivo compreende o cumprimento de etapas de trabalho. Quais sejam:\n\n\n1- O contato com o cliente\n2- O Estudo Preliminar\n3- O Anteprojeto e a compatibilização de projetos complementares.\n4- O Projeto Final e de Aprovação\n5- O Projeto Executivo e Detalhamento\n6- O Acompanhamento da obra.\n\n\nAlém das aulas, como recursos pedagógicos são oferecidos links de vídeos e artigos para que o conhecimento seja aprofundado por meio de pesquisa.  Nesse sentido, outro objetivo é o de induzir o aluno a perceber a necessidade da especialização em temas aqui apresentados de maneira introdutória, como por exemplo, os relacionados ao universos jurídicos e contábil no sentido da busca das habilidades necessárias para gestão de escritórios ou empresas de Arquitetura e que não estão relacionadas às habilidades técnicas construídas durante o curso. Entende-se que muitos desses temas sequer são mencionados durante a graduação, passando que ser Arquiteto basta saber desenvolver um projeto ou uma ideia aos moldes do que é feito a cada semestre nas matérias de projeto.\n\n\nAlém de vitalício, o curso oferece a possibilidade de que as aulas sejam atendidas de acordo com a disponibilidade de tempo.\n\n\nAos inscritos será oferecido o link para acessar o documentário: \"Oscar Niemeyer . Sensibilidade e Erudição\", produzido pelo Documenta . Canal da Arquitetura.\n\n\nInscreva-se e comece desde já a preparar-se para ser reconhecido pelo elevado grau de confiabilidade. Para alcançar o sucesso não basta ser talentoso. O alto grau de profissionalismo é um fundamento para o reconhecimento do Arquiteto pela sociedade como alguém de caráter profissional confiável.",

      "description": "Tasarıma ilk adım attığımda çizimlerim çok kötüydü. Bu problem üzerine çok vakit kaybediyor, kaliteli çizim yapan arkadaşları başarılı buluyor ve kendimi kötü hissediyordum. Bir tasarım odaklı düşünce makalesine göz atarken bir cümle okudum, \"Nasıl çizdiğinin önemi sandığın kadar büyük değil, önemli olan neden çizdiğin?\" yazıyordu. Bu cümlenin önemi hemen kavrayamasam da eğitimim ve daha sonrasında kariyerim ilerlerken çok sık bir şekilde bu cümlenin önemini fark ettim. Temiz çizemiyordum, el yeteneklerim harika değildi ama bir noktadan sonra bazen beni tatmin edecek, bazen birlikte çalıştıklarımı tatmin edecek ürünler ortaya koymaya başlamıştım. Aslında tam da bu süreç bana kaliteli çizimlerin değil de kaliteli fikirlerin değer bulduğunu öğretti. Kaliteli çizim her zaman önemli bir artıdır fakat kötü bir fikri kaliteli çizmenin de bir faydası yoktur.\nBu eğitim seti bahsettiğim düşünce yapısıyla tasarıma yeni giriş yapan arkadaşlar için perspektif ve eskiz çizimleri üzerine sıfırdan üretmeyi  öğretir. Uygulamalar ve ödevlerler ile eğitime katılanları olabildiğince  kalemle ve kağıtla baş başa kalmaya motive eder. Doğru soruları sormanın önemini açıklar, bununla birlikte araştırma yapma, analizler oluşturma noktasında tavsiyeler verir. Konsepti, bakış açısını, temayı beslemeninin doğru çizime giden yol olduğunu savunur ve bu noktada pratikleri uygulamalı olarak gösterir.\nEğitim başlangıç seviyesi bilgilerle başlayarak bir bilgi havuzu oluşturur. Somut ve soyut kavramları bir arada kullanmayı amaçlar. Ne yaptığımızın zamanla değişeceğinden ama önemli olanın neden yaptığımız olduğundan bahseder. Çizimlerimizin bol pratikler sayesinde gelişeceğine, aynı özeni fikir aşmasına da göstermemiz gerektiğini yorulmadan vurgular.\nAnlatımların hepsi kullanıcı deneyimini arttırmak için kağıdı dik bir açıdan gören kamerayla yapılmıştır. Teknik noktalar adım adım açıklanmış ve eğitime katılanların net bir şekilde izleyerek takip etmesi sağlanmıştır.Eğitimin temel amacı katılımcıları sürekli olarak çizim, konsept ve analiz gibi konularla ilgili olmasını hedeflediği için haftalık, on beş günlük ya da aylık yeni içeriklerle kendisini güncel tutar. Bahsi geçen konuların yorumları, eleştirileri ve gelişmesi yönünde soru-cevap imkanı sağlar.",

      "description": "En este curso realizaremos un modelo virtual de \"La casa sobre el arroyo\" ubicada en Argentina, aprendiendo así sobre el modelado arquitectónico en Revit 2025 además del computo de materiales, exportación de documentación y renderizado realista en twinmotion.\nEl curso consiste en 6 módulos, en el módulo 1 empezaremos con una breve introducción al proyecto, a la metodología BIM y a la interfaz de Revit. En el módulo 2 aprenderás la forma adecuada de crear la topografía del proyecto, comenzando desde su importación de la referencia de AutoCAD hasta la manera de realizar la terracería para emplazar el modelo arquitectónico. En el módulo 3 realizaremos en un archivo distinto la creación del proyecto arquitectónico, con la finalidad de implementar el concepto de vínculos entre las disciplinas que abarca Revit. En el modulo 4 haremos una introducción al computo de materiales generando tablas de cuantificación. En el módulo 5 aprenderemos el renderizado en twinmotion desde su instalación hasta ver y comparar los tipos de render que el software puede realizar, al ser un programa gratuito no tendremos limitaciones. Y en el módulo 6 finalmente aprenderemos a editar el modelo para sacar planos arquitectónicos técnicos y a crear y configurar tamaños de hojas para colocar los planos previamente realizados, diagramaremos las hojas para posteriormente exportar el anteproyecto en PDF y observar resultados.\nAdemás al adquirir el curso te llevarás material adicional como biblioteca de materiales, biblioteca de mobiliario 3D, biblioteca de familias para Revit y muchos tips que te ayudarán y que podrás aplicar a tus proyectos personales.\nAl completar este curso, no solo habrás adquirido conocimientos técnicos en el uso de Revit 2025 y Twinmotion, sino que también habrás desarrollado una visión integral del proceso de modelado arquitectónico, desde la concepción hasta la presentación final. ¡Estamos emocionados de acompañarte en este viaje de aprendizaje y creatividad!",

Render ayarlarının içinde kaybolmazsınız, hazır ayarları vardır ve bir çocuk bile kullanır.\n8-Render saatler içinde değil, saniyeler içinde biter ve üstelik sürpriz de olmaz çünkü final sahneyi en baştan sizin yerinize Lumion tahmin eder.\n9-En önemlisi de tasarımcılar V-Ray'in işini bitirmesini beklerken Lumion sizin yaratıcı fikirlerinizi bekler. Sizi bekleyen bir programı öğrenmek istemez misiniz?\n\n\nAceleniz varsa doğru yerdesiniz!\nBitmeyen render sürelerinden bıkmış mimarlar, iç mimarlar, öğrenciler, tasarımcılar için hazırlanmış bir yazılım var: LUMION\nAcelesi olan her tasarımcı doğru programın adresini bilir. İşte ben de bu hız canavarının eğitimlerini veriyorum.\n\n\nA'DAN Z'YE LUMION EĞİTİMİ isimli kursumda teorik olarak Lumion'a ait her şeyi konuşuyoruz. Bu uygulamalı derste ise teoride anlatılmayan, ancak pratik yaparken karşımıza çıkabilecek sorunları çözmüş olacağız. Bir örnek uygulama üzerinden animasyon render alacağız. Böylece anlatılanlar teorik seviyede kalmayacak, örnekler ve uygulamalar ile pekişmiş olacak.\n\n\n3ds Max,  SketchUp, Cinema 4D gibi programlarda bir şekilde modelleme yapabiliyor ama hızlı ve kaliteli render almak ile ilgili problemler yaşıyorsanız, bu ders tam size göre! Belirli bir düzeyde render alabiliyor ama çalışmanızın ne gibi sorunlara sahip olduğunu bir türlü kestiremiyorsanız da öyle çünkü kaliteli bir görselin sahip olması gereken temel kriterleri konuşmaya devam ediyoruz.\nHam bir modelden başlayarak malzemeler, ışıklar, efektler nasıl ayarlanır, insan, ağaç gibi objeler nasıl yerleştirilmelidir, kusursuz render almak için ne gibi detaylara dikkat etmek gerekir, hepsi tek derste!\n\n\nLumion kullanarak etkili görseller hazırlayabilirsiniz. Bu dersin size bir şeyler katması için temel düzeyde 3D bilmeniz yeterli. Hazırlanmış modellerin Lumion için uygun hale getirilmesinden başlayarak ağaç, insan, manzara, peyzaj ögeleri ekleyeceğiz, kaliteli bir render için kritik ayarları yapacağız.\n\n\n\"Uçurum Evi\" dediğim bir proje üzerinden gittik. Kar, çöl, iç mekan, animasyon, gece gibi farklı render koşullarını anlatan derslerim de mevcut. Animasyonda kamera ayarları ve efektler nasıl kullanılmalıdır, püf noktalar nedir, bunları konuştuk.\n\n\nMimar, Yazar ve yirmi yıllık sinefil olarak estetik, görsellik, tasarım tecrübelerimi bu işin heveslisi ile paylaşmaya karar verdiğimden beri mimarlara, sinemacılara, fotoğrafçılara görselleme dersleri veriyorum.\n\n\nDers, üç ayrı program üzerinden yürüyecek ama bunları öğrencinin bilmesi şart değil. Yani bu ders sadece bir Lumion render dersi olmanın dışında AutoCAD, 3ds Max ve Photoshop ile dirsek temasını da bünyesinde barındırıyor. Yani bir kursta üç programa uğramış olacağız.\n\n\nBu kursu anlayarak tamamlamış olan öğrenci ise belirli bir düzeyde konuya hakim olacak, CV'sine bildiği programlarla ilgili güvenle istediği notu düşebilecek.\n\n\nİşi uzmanına bırakın...\nSoru ve görüşlerinizi dikkatle dinliyor olacağım.\nBu kurstan faydalanabilmeniz için içerisinde Lumion 9 ve üstü bir sürüm yüklü bir bilgisayar yeterlidir.\nTüm kurslarım \"Ek Ders\"ler ile devamlı güncellenmekte ve büyümektedir.\n*\nYILDA İKİ MİLYON DAKİKA EĞİTİMİN SIRRI\nProfesyonel meslek yaşamını İzmir'de sürdüren mimar, yazar ve eğitmen Emre Timur; tasarım, görselleştirme, animasyon, seslendirme, fotoğrafçılık gibi disiplinlerde aktif olarak çalışmalarını sürdürmektedir. Yayımlanmış dokuz kitabı olan Emre Timur, AutoCAD, 3ds Max, V-Ray, Corona, Lumion, Photoshop, Renk Tasarımı ve Sinemada Işıklandırma gibi eğitimler vermektedir.\n*\n1. Artık hız ve acele çağındayız. Kimsenin ninni gibi devam eden dersler, uyuyakalan eğitmenler için vakti yok. Zamanınızın değerini biliyorum çünkü benimki de değerli.\n2. Çoğu İngilizce, İspanyolca olan dünyanın en yetkin eğitimlerini gözden geçirerek, yalnızca Udemy veya Türkçe için değil, küresel bir kalite standardı yaratmaya çalıştım. Bunu sağladığıma da inanıyorum.\n3. Piyasada bulunan çoğu eğitim tarihi eser gibi, antika ve son kullanım tarihi geçmiş. Ben yorum ve eleştiriler doğrultusunda her gün devamlı güncelleyerek geliştirmeye çalışıyorum. Değişim çağının gereği bu.\n4. Sorulara ve yorumlara hızlı dönüş sağlıyorum ve hiçbirisini cevapsız bırakmıyorum.\n5. Pandemi gibi, deprem gibi doğal felaketler dolayısıyla verimsizleşen örgün eğitim için iyi bir online alternatif olmak istedim. Burasının aktif, canlı bir tasarım okulu olmasını istedim.\n*\nThe Secret of Two Million Minutes of Education Each Year\nEmre Timur, a professional architect, author, and educator working in Izmir, is actively engaged in various disciplines such as design, visualization, animation, voiceovers, photography, and more. Emre Timur, who has published seven books, offers training in software like AutoCAD, 3ds Max, V-Ray, Corona, Lumion, Photoshop, Color Design, and Lighting in Film.\n1. We are now in the age of speed and urgency. There is no time for lessons that continue like lullabies, especially for educators who fall asleep. I understand the value of your time because mine is precious too.\n2. By reviewing the most competent English and Spanish language education available globally, I have strived to establish a global standard of quality, not only for Udemy or Turkish learners. I believe I have achieved this.\n3. Most of the education available in the market is like historical relics, antique and outdated. I am constantly trying to improve and update them every day based on feedback and criticism. This is the need of the changing era.\n4. I provide quick responses to questions and comments and do not leave any of them unanswered.\n5. I aimed to be a good online alternative for traditional education that has become less efficient due to natural disasters like the pandemic or earthquakes. I wanted this place to be an active, lively design school.",

      "description": "*Güncelleme: Ağustos 2025\nMilyonlarca parametre içinde kaybolmadan, birkaç tıkla V-Ray'de malzeme hazırlamak\n\n\nMimar, Yazar Emre Timur Kimdir?\nYılda 2 milyon dakika eğitim veren, 82 bin kayıtlı 35 bin öğrencisi olan, 7 binden fazla yorum almış, ortalama 4.7 eğitmen puanına sahip, Bestseller rozetli, basılı 9 kitabı olan, 15 yıllık mimar.\n\n\nDemek gerçekçilik istiyorsunuz, doğru yerdesiniz!\nAcelesi olan tasarımcılar olarak toplandık ve birlikte en pratik 3ds Max Eğitimi ile modellemede uzmanlaştık. Artık hayallerimiz hayal olarak kalmıyor.\nŞimdi sıra render almakta.\nDünyanın en çok kullanılan CPU tabanlı render motoru olan, V-Ray’e hoş geldiniz!\nFiziksel dünyada ışık, optik kurallarıyla hareket eder. İnsanlık olarak bizler ışığın davranışları üzerinde uzun yıllardır çalışıyoruz. Bilgisayar ve görüntüleme teknolojilerinin gelişmesiyle birlikte yarattığımız sanal gerçeklik, insan beynini kandırmak konusunda uzmanlaştı. Artık gerçek ile ayırt edilmez görseller yaratabiliyoruz.\nİşte V-Ray budur! Işığı, malzemeyi, evreni, atmosferi ve kamerayı birebir kopyalayabilen bir ışık simülatörüdür.\nMimarlar, İç Mimarlar, Peyzaj Mimarları, Tasarımcılar, Mühendisler tasarımlarını teknik çizimin diliyle anlatmakta güçlük çeker. O yüzden gerçeğiyle ayırt edilemez görseller sunmak ister. Uzun yıllardır gerçek fotoğraftan ayırt edilemez imajlar üretmekte uzmanlaşmış olan V-Ray, tüm tasarımcıların ve öğrencilerin istediği şeyi sunar: Photorealistic Render’lar.\nMetaverse dünyası yaklaşıyor. Her meslek grubu şöyle ya da böyle simülasyon dolu bir evrenle işbirliği içinde olmak zorunda. Önümüzdeki yüzyıl, simülasyon bilenlerin yüzyılı olacak. Siz de hangi meslek grubu içinde olursanız olun, bir an evvel en bilindik render motoru ile, V-Ray ile tanışın.\nV-Ray kadar çok kullanılan bir yazılımda pek çok eğitim var elbette fakat benim ilkem her zaman acelesi olan tasarımcılar için eğitim hazırlamak oldu. Aceleniz olduğunu biliyorum. Bitmeyen, yavaş ilerleyen, aşırı detay veren kurslardan sıkıldınız. Bir mimar, bir yazar, bir eğitmen olarak pratik eğitimler hazırlayacağıma söz vermiştim. Pek çok render yorum eğitimi, AutoCAD eğitimi ve uygulamalı render eğitimlerinin yanında, dünyanın en kapsamlı Lumion eğitimi de tarafımdan hazırlandı. Ve akabinde Mimarlar için Photoshop ve 3ds Max Eğitimi geldi.\nŞimdi de V-Ray’de gerçekçi malzemelerin nasıl hazırlanacağını konuşalım. Sahnenizde metal, ahşap, beton gibi malzemeler kullanıyorsunuz ama gerçekçiliği bir türlü içinize sinmiyor. Gelin, fotoğraftan ayırt edilemez gerçekçilikte malzemeler nasıl hazırlanır, onu konuşalım.\n\n\nGelin, 3ds Max ve V-Ray kullanarak gerçekçi sahneler yaratalım!\n\n\n*Bu kurs 3ds Max 2023 ve V-Ray 5.2 kullanılarak, hiç bilmeyenler ve orta seviyeye seslenecek şekilde anlatılmıştır. O yüzden bu bir ileri V-Ray kursu değildir.\n*Belirli bir meslek grubuna seslenmeksizin, 3ds Max 2023 ve V-Ray 5.2 kullanılarak nasıl gerçekçi ve pratik malzemeler hazırlanacağı öğretilir.\n*Detaylı V-Ray render eğitimleri yakında gelecektir. Bu bir material eğitimi olduğundan render konusuna yüzeysel değinilmiştir.\n*Kuantum Fiziği'ne girmeden, milyonlarca ayar içinde kaybolmadan, birkaç pratik ayarla nasıl gerçekçi malzemeler hazırlayabiliriz, onu konuşacağız.\n\n\nACELESİ OLAN TASARIMCILARIN EĞİTMENİ\n*\nYILDA İKİ MİLYON DAKİKA EĞİTİMİN SIRRI\nProfesyonel meslek yaşamını İzmir'de sürdüren mimar, yazar ve eğitmen Emre Timur; tasarım, görselleştirme, animasyon, seslendirme, fotoğrafçılık gibi disiplinlerde aktif olarak çalışmalarını sürdürmektedir. Yayımlanmış dokuz kitabı olan Emre Timur, AutoCAD, 3ds Max, V-Ray, Corona, Lumion, Photoshop, Renk Tasarımı ve Sinemada Işıklandırma gibi eğitimler vermektedir.\n*\n1. Artık hız ve acele çağındayız. Kimsenin ninni gibi devam eden dersler, uyuyakalan eğitmenler için vakti yok. Zamanınızın değerini biliyorum çünkü benimki de değerli.\n2. Çoğu İngilizce, İspanyolca olan dünyanın en yetkin eğitimlerini gözden geçirerek, yalnızca Udemy veya Türkçe için değil, küresel bir kalite standardı yaratmaya çalıştım. Bunu sağladığıma da inanıyorum.\n3. Piyasada bulunan çoğu eğitim tarihi eser gibi, antika ve son kullanım tarihi geçmiş. Ben yorum ve eleştiriler doğrultusunda her gün devamlı güncelleyerek geliştirmeye çalışıyorum. Değişim çağının gereği bu.\n4. Sorulara ve yorumlara hızlı dönüş sağlıyorum ve hiçbirisini cevapsız bırakmıyorum.\n5. Pandemi gibi, deprem gibi doğal felaketler dolayısıyla verimsizleşen örgün eğitim için iyi bir online alternatif olmak istedim. Burasının aktif, canlı bir tasarım okulu olmasını istedim.\n*\nThe Secret of Two Million Minutes of Education Each Year\nEmre Timur, a professional architect, author, and educator working in Izmir, is actively engaged in various disciplines such as design, visualization, animation, voiceovers, photography, and more. Emre Timur, who has published seven books, offers training in software like AutoCAD, 3ds Max, V-Ray, Corona, Lumion, Photoshop, Color Design, and Lighting in Film.\n1. We are now in the age of speed and urgency. There is no time for lessons that continue like lullabies, especially for educators who fall asleep. I understand the value of your time because mine is precious too.\n2. By reviewing the most competent English and Spanish language education available globally, I have strived to establish a global standard of quality, not only for Udemy or Turkish learners. I believe I have achieved this.\n3. Most of the education available in the market is like historical relics, antique and outdated. I am constantly trying to improve and update them every day based on feedback and criticism. This is the need of the changing era.\n4. I provide quick responses to questions and comments and do not leave any of them unanswered.\n5. I aimed to be a good online alternative for traditional education that has become less efficient due to natural disasters like the pandemic or earthquakes. I wanted this place to be an active, lively design school.",

Dijital ortamda bir tasarımın ortaya çıkmasında gerekli tüm aşamalar bu kurs süresince detaylıca anlatılmıştır.\nEğitimin 1.bölümünde, AutoCAD yazılımı ile plan ve kesit görünüşler anlatılmaktadır. Mimari bir plan ya da ürün tasarımına ait teknik çizimlerin oluşturulma sürecini, hızlı çizim teknikleri ve pratik yöntemlerle bu bölümde bulabilirsiniz. Toplamda 13 ayrı konu başlığından oluşan derslere ait “dwg” dosyaları her dersin kaynaklar bölümünde kursiyerlere sunulmuştur. Derste kullanılan kısayol tuşları özellikle ilk derslerde yoğun olarak ekranın sol tarafında gösterilmektedir. 1.bölüm 2 saat 17 dakikalık ders içeriğine sahiptir.\n2.Bölüm, ilk bölümde plan ve görünüşleri çizilen sahnenin 3 boyutlu olarak modellenmesi aşamalarını içerir. Toplamda bu bölümde 25 ayrı ders başlığı ve 5 saatlik ders içeriği sunulmaktadır. 2. Bölümde 2D nesnelerin referans olarak alınması ve tüm sahnenin 3ds Max programı ile modellenmesi adım adım anlatılmaktadır. Nesneleri modellerken olabildiğince farklı modelleme teknikleri kullanılmıştır. Gereksiz tekrar ve detaylardan kaçınılmış, olabildiğince yalın bir dille modelleme aşamaları anlatılmıştır. İlk derslerde daha yoğun olmak üzere, modelleme süreci boyunca kullanılan kısayol tuşları ekranın sol alt köşesinde kursiyerler ile paylaşılmıştır.\nSon Bölüm ise, 18 konu başlığı ve yaklaşık 3.5 saatlik ders içeriği bulunmaktadır. Bu bölümde Vray render motoru ile görselleştirme, aydınlatma, malzeme ve bazı görsel efektler anlatılmaktadır. Bu bölüm, orta düzeyde kullanıcıların mekan, ışık ve nesne algısını geliştirecek, malzeme bilgisini uzman düzeyine çıkaracak bir eğitim algoritmasına sahiptir.\nKursun sonunda kullanıcılar, kendi tasarım yeteneklerini kullanarak, referans 2boyutlu çizimler yapabilecek, tasarımlarını 3 boyutlu olarak modelleyebilecek, sahneyi diledikleri gibi aydınlatabilecek, modelleri üzerinde her türlü malzemeyi uygulayabilecek ve finalde tasarımlarını yüksek kalitede resimlere dönüştürebileceklerdir.",

Em seguida, falaremos um pouco sobre boas práticas para visualização e utilização de comandos essenciais para os processos de modelagem do projeto. Aprenderemos a diferença entre os diferentes tipos de parâmetros que o Revit possui e como utilizar cada um deles.\nNo decorrer do treinamento, o aluno aprenderá a criar suas próprias famílias de identificadores e formatos para documentar o projeto.\nO aluno aprenderá a elaborar o seu próprio template com os conhecimentos adquiridos neste treinamento, pois iniciaremos o projeto utilizando um template padrão do Autodesk Revit, e ao final do curso, teremos um template no padrão Prefeitura.\nAs práticas abordadas nesse treinamento, estão totalmente relacionadas a fluxos de trabalho onde são integradas novas soluções Autodesk, entendemos que o BIM não é basicamente fazer tudo no Revit, mas desenvolver um projeto de maneira que outros profissionais possam colaborar, mesmo que não seja utilizando as soluções da Autodesk.\nAprenderemos ao término do treinamento a exportar arquivos nos formatos IFC, PDF e DWG, vamos aprender como transformar o projeto em um template e como exportar as famílias utilizadas no projeto para criar uma biblioteca.\nNota:\nEste treinamento não acompanha apostila! O roteiro em PDF apresentado durante o treinamento poderá ser adquirido em formato de ebook.

From camera position and lighting, to adding materials, merging objects and creating stunning imagery. In this course, we are going to share the workflow we use to create photorealistic renders. We are hoping that you’ll grow to enjoy this process as much as we do!\nWe have used 3ds Max 2023 and vray 6 through the course.\nWe will be sharing the 3ds Max models so that you can follow along.\n\n\nThroughout the course, we generally approached problems from the point of view of a 3D Artist. However in some cases we found it more practical to approach things like a photographer. This combination of approaches helps us understand and solve problems very effectively.\n\n\nEnroll now and get instant access to:\n1.20 hours of easy-to-watch video lessons\nDownloadable project files to follow along with\nInstructor support if you have questions\nLifetime access to course updates\nAbout the Instructor\nhamid mohseni is a expert 3d artist.\nAs a 3D Artist, he is an expert with 10 years of experience in 3D Modeling, 3D Sculpting and 3D Rendering. He worked on creating various of graphical content including interior and exterior renders.\nAs a teacher, he shared his passion and experiences to teach how to use 3ds Max, V-Ray and Corona Render in universities and private institutes. His experiences in solving many type of problems with tight deadlines allows him to impart a practical understanding of his craft.",

      "description": "¿Qué es BIM,? ¿Cuáles son las dimensiones del BIM? ¿Cómo puedo desarrollar un proyecto en su totalidad con ArchiCAD? ¿Cómo puedo modelar, documentar, exportar y presentar un proyecto BIM con ArchiCAD? ¿Cómo puedo exportar a otras plataformas como AutoCAD en formato DWG? Estas son algunas de las preguntas que te resolveré en esta guía completa sobre BIM con ArchiCAD.\n\n\nBuilding Information Modeling (BIM) destaca como una metodología de trabajo que revoluciona el sector de la arquitectura, ingeniería y la construcción (AEC), y ArchiCAD -solución desarrollada por Graphisoft desde 1982- es uno de los diversos instrumentos que posibilitan esta forma de trabajo, permitiendo por medio de la centralización de información en una base de datos BIM obtener una mayor calidad proyectual y productiva en menores tiempos al esquema de trabajo en 2D CAD.\n\n\n¡Bienvenidos! Mi nombre es Valentyn-Vladyslav Kotsarenko, soy Maestro en Arquitectura y Coordinador BIM. Además de estar certificado como usuario avanzado en el manejo de ArchiCAD, he tenido oportunidad de colaborar con Graphisoft México para la implementación del BIM en el sector profesional; tengo más de 8 años de experiencia en este y otros temas, pero aún más experiencia capacitando en universidades, empresas y particulares en el empleo de diversas soluciones BIM, buscando optimizar al máximo los procesos de trabajo y producción, y en esta ocasión te guiaré a ti.\n\n\nEsta asignatura representa el segundo paso de una serie de capacitaciones pedagógicamente estructuradas; si todavía no has generado tu primera experiencia con BIM, te encuentras en la incertidumbre de cómo iniciar, desarrollar y finalizar un anteproyecto arquitectónico, o quieres aprender ArchiCAD como una alternativa más de modo conciso, esta formación es para ti.\n\n\nA lo largo de esta capacitación:\n\n\nTe explicaré a profundidad qué es BIM, sus ventajas, dimensiones, ejemplos análogos y más.\nTe guiaré en tus primeros pasos con ArchiCAD\nTe enseñaré todo lo necesario para poder trabajar en 2D y 3D con ArchiCAD\nTe enseñaré todo lo necesario para saber documentar plantas, cortes, alzados, perspectivas, monteas y más.\nTe enseñaré cómo estructurar tus vistas y colocarlas en el libro de planos (layouts).\nTe enseñaré a publicar todo tu material con un sólo click.\nTe explicaré todo lo necesario para exportar tus resultados en DWG a plataformas como AutoCAD.\nY más.\n\n\n¡BIM ha transformado los esquemas de trabajo alrededor del mundo, y el día de hoy tú también puedes lograrlo! ¡Inscríbete!",

      "description": "Yapı ya da nesne modelleme artık çok önemli bir konu. 2 boyutlu projeler eskide kaldı. Her şeyi 3 boyutlu ve gerçeğe yakın şekliyle görmek mümkün. Bunun için çok çeşitli modelleme yöntemleri var. En pratiklerinden biri SketchUp.\n\n\nBu kurs size, kalem tutmaktan başlayıp detaylı ve uzun anlatımlarla SketchUp kullanmayı öğretecek. İzlerken siz de bu anlatım içerisinde ilerleyecek ve kurs sonunda, birlikte modellediğimiz bina ile beraber, kendiniz, istediğiniz bir yapıyı modelleyebilecek seviyeye geleceksiniz.\nKısayol kullanmak, program kullanma hızınızı en az 2 kat artırır. Bu kurs sayesinde, klavye kısayollarına çok net bir şekilde hakim olacaksınız. Kurs boyunca anlatım yapılırken her kısayol kullanıldığında ekranda hangi kısayola basıldığı çıkıyor.\nBu kursu izlerken yönetmeliklerden, şartnamelerden ve yeni inşaat teknolojilerden de bahisler duyacaksınız.\nArtık yeni bir inşaat yöntemi olan BIM yazılımlarının temel mantığı, 3 boyutlu çizimlere dördüncü, beşinci boyutları kazandırmak üzerine kuruludur. SketchUp, size 3 boyutlu bir yapıyı oluşturma mantığını öğretir. SketchUp öğrendiğinizde, artık 3 boyutlu uzayda çalışma mantığını da öğrenmiş olursunuz. Bu kurs sayesinde diğer 3 boyutlu modelleme programlarının da temel mantığını anlamış olacaksınız.\nSaha mühendisiyseniz, mimarsanız, modelleme ya da maliyet işleri yapıyorsanız her türlü durumda planladığınız yapıyı anlatabilmek için gereken en önemli araç iletişim. İletişim kurarken artık 2 boyutlu araçları değil, 3 boyutlu gerçek araçları kullanın.",

      "description": "Merhaba, hoş geldin! Yüksek ihtimalle mimarlık öğrencisisin. Şu an yürümekte olduğun yollardan ben de geçtim ve seni çok iyi anlıyorum. Okulu okurken üst dönem abi ve ablalara çok soru sorar, daha iyi bir öğrenci olmak için çok çabalardım. Sen de biliyorsun, yaşıyorsun.. mimarlık diğer bölümler gibi kitaplardan okunmuyor; çok soru sormak, araştırmak ve yanıtları yaşamak gerektiriyor. Üst dönemdekiler benim bu sorularıma yanıtlar bulurken \"Mezun olduktan sonra ben de böyle olacağım\" dedim, üstelik okulda olmadan...\n\n\nBu amaçla arkitell mimarlık platformunu kurdum. 40 binden fazla takipçiye milyonlarca izlenen, okunan ve paylaşılan içerikler, bilgiler, fikirler sundum. Öğrencilerle online da olsa içli dışlı oldum; kimi zaman yorumlarda kimi zaman mesaj kutusunda sorularına yanıtlar buldum...\n\n\nŞimdi ise yine aynı amaçla 7 saatlik mimarlık öğrenciliğine dair videolarımla karşınızda bulunmaktayım! Mimarlık okulunda yaşanılan sorunları ve soruları bilen, yaşayan bir mimar olarak size fikir ve bilgi dolu içerikler hazırladım. Proje dersini A'dan Z'ye inceledim mesela. Proje konunu öğrendiğin gün ne yapman gerektiğinden final jürisine kadar proje dersine dair her aşamayı örnekler ve tavsiyelerle anlattım. Okul döneminde yaptığım 5 mimari öğrenci projemi şu anki bilgimle inceledim. Kendimi eleştirdim, mimari öğrenci projesi hangi sınıf düzeyinde nasıl olmalıdır sorusuna iyi bir şekilde yanıt verdim. Örneğin, 2.sınıf mimari projemi 2.sınıf bir öğrenci düzeyince; bitirme projemi ise mimar olmaya dair birinin nasıl ilerlemesi gerektiğine dair fikirlerim ve eleştirimle analiz ettim. Mimari projenin konseptinden jürisine, kritik alırken dikkat edilmesi gereken tavsiyelerden proje süreç stratejilerine kadar tüm bildiklerimi sizlerle ilettim.\n\n\nMimarlık öğrencisi için en kıymetli olan mimari proje dersidir fakat bu dersin yanı sıra diğer derslerde başarılı olma tüyolarını, jürinin iyi geçmesine yönelik tavsiyelerimi, iletişim ve zaman yönetimine dair önemli notlarımı, hangi sınıf düzeyinde hangi mimarlık programlarını kullanman gerektiğine dair fikirlerimi ve nicesini eğitime yükledim.\n\n\nMimarlık öğrencisini çok iyi anlıyorum, yaşadığı yolcuğu çok iyi tanıyorum. Ve sevgili mimar adayı dostum, izninle seninle bu yolcuğu paylaşmak; fikirlerim, bilgilerim ve incelemelerimle sana yoldaş olmak istiyorum. Bana ne zaman istersen soru sorabilirsin. Konuşabiliriz ve takdir edersen danışmanlık alabilirsin.\n\n\nTeşekkür ederim, eğitimime beklerim...",

Aprenderás proporción, perspectiva, línea y sombra, composición y storytelling visual para convertir ideas en croquis, plantas, alzados y secciones claros y atractivos. Del boceto al CAD/BIM y a la postproducción: texturas, color y presentación lista para cliente y portfolio.\nEn Udemy, 100% online y para todos los niveles, avanzarás con un método práctico y progresivo, ejercicios guiados y plantillas descargables. Gana velocidad y precisión, mejora tu portfolio de arquitectura e interiorismo, y presenta proyectos con impacto visual profesional: más claridad, mejor comunicación y decisiones de diseño seguras.\nEl Dibujo Arquitectónico se caracteriza por representar arquitectura, sea esta como detalle arquitectónico o como espacio arquitectónico. Puede ser expresado en planta, alzado, sección, perspectiva o perspectiva axonométrica.\nEl curso de dibujo técnico arquitectónico te permite adquirir un conocimiento de cómo dibujar e interpretar cada línea de un plano, así como descodificar su información con las leyendas o símbolos que en él se detallen. Durante el curso, aplicarás conocimientos sobre la documentación necesaria para ejecutar un diseño que no existe.\nDentro de la parte de dibujo arquitectónico, al acabar el estudio estarás capacitado para empezar a delinear planos con el criterio normalizado universal de cualquier profesión técnica. Este curso se centra en la creación de representaciones visuales convincentes y atractivas de diseños arquitectónicos, utilizando técnicas de dibujo a mano y herramientas digitales.\nDentro del diseño, ya sea a nivel arquitectónico, urbano, de interiores y de paisaje, la información se organiza a través de dibujos. La información recogida para realizar un proyecto, los primeros avances y hasta los últimos detalles para construir se explican a través de los dibujos arquitectónicos. Un curso práctico que enseña técnicas de dibujo para representar ideas de diseño de interiores, desde bocetos a mano hasta dibujo técnico.\nEn el dibujo arquitectónico aparecen distintos aspectos como medidas, habitabilidad, los medios para llevar a cabo su construcción. También se tratan otros factores como pueden ser la distribución de los espacios dentro de la construcción, el color y el trabajo conceptual, por lo que el dibujo arquitectónico también está relacionado con otros ámbitos como el diseño arquitectónico.\nEste curso es una introducción al dibujo a mano alzada pensado con fines arquitectónicos, aunque puede ser realizado por estudiantes que deseen introducirse en el desarrollo de este tipo de dibujo pensando en otros campos diferentes al propio de la arquitectura o la edificación.\n\n\nItinerario Formativo:\nIntroducción y Bienvenida al curso \"Experto Dibujo Arquitectónico.

( organik formların yapılması , kafes sisteminin çözülmesi )\n2- yarışmalara katılmak için ihtiyacınız olacaktır.\n3-bu program 3 - 5 yıl arasında daha çok rağbet görecektir , Avrupa ve Amerika'da yaygın bir şekilde kullanılmaktadır. Ayrıca organik ve parametrik tasrımı yapmak için sadece kullanılmıyor artık, codlama yaparak bazı zamanlar da program çözümler öğretmeye başlıyor kendisinden.( Strüktür, plan ve cephe tasarımlarında )4- Sürekli kütleler eklenecek ve ona göre fiyat yükselecek.. ama şimdi alırsanız, sonra ki gelen kütleler size bedava olarak eklenir. ?\n\n\nteşekkür ederim zamanınız için.",

Biz ise bu eğitimimizde kat planını ana program Sketchup olmak üzere Enscape, Lumion, Lightroom, Canva, Photoshop gibi programları da kullanarak öğreneceğiz. Eğitimde bu programların hepsinden kısa ve anlaşılır şekilde bahsedildi. Bu programları kullanırken eğitimi dikkatle izlediğimiz takdirde hiçbir şekilde zorluk çekmeyeceğiz. Enscape ya da Lumion'u daha önceden kullanmamış biride rahatlıkla kullanabilecek.\nİlk önce Autocad üzerinden mimari planı okuyacağız ve kat planı yaparken aşamaları planlayacağız. 2. aşamada bütün tefrişleri duvarları ayarlamaları Sketchup üzerinden yapacağız. Çünkü enscape ve lumionda sketchup bağlantılı çalışan programlardır. Fakat Enscape ya da Lumion üzerinden yerleştirilen bir tefriş birbirlerinde açılmıyolar. Bu sebeple ana programımız Sketchup olacak.\nLightroom programından renderlarımızı ve kat planlarımızı daha gerçekçi kılmak için efekt ayarları yapacağız. Bu eğitimde Lightroom programından da bahsettik. Lightroom programını kullanmamızın sebebi oluşturduğumuz bir ayarı diğer fotoğraflara rahatlıkla aktarabiliyor olmamız.\nSon olarak Canva programından bahsettik. Bizim yaptığımız kat planları bir iş olarak sadece bir kat planı olarak kalmayacak bunları sergilememiz müşterilere sunmamız gerekecek. Canva programı bunun için en uygun program olmaktadır. Canva programı yapay zeka desteği ve kullanım kolaylığıyla bizlere bu konuda çok yarımcı olacaktır.\nEğitimimizde diğer kat planı çizimlerine göre bize hem hız kazandıracak hem de farklı farklı programlar öğrenmemiz gelişimimiz açısından olumlu olacaktır.",

      "description": "Welcome to Learning & Exploring Civil Engineering Concepts & Softwares Practically.\nAutodesk Revit is a building information modelling software tool for architects, landscape architects, structural engineers, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers, designers and contractors. The software allows users to design a building and structure and its components in 3D, annotate the model with 2D drafting elements, and access building information from the building model's database. Revit is 4D building information modeling application capable with tools to plan and track various stages in the building's lifecycle, from concept to construction and later maintenance and/or demolition.\nTake your Revit skills to the Advanced level. First, get comfortable with the Revit environment, and learn to set up a project and add the grids, levels, and dimensions that will anchor your design. Then we dive into modeling: adding walls, doors, and windows; creating and mirroring groups; linking to DWG files; and working with floors, roofs, and ceilings. I will also shows advanced techniques for modeling stairs and complex walls, adding rooms, and creating schedules. Finally, discover how to annotate your drawing so all the components are perfectly understood, and learn how to output sheets to PDF and AutoCAD.\nFinally i will also covers basics to Intermediate level of dynamo in Revit.\nThis course is going to be constantly updated. So once you purchase the course you will get updated sessions, with Q & A.\nHerewith I had created many videos for civil engineering students & professionals in order to learn concepts & softwares practically.\nIn this Course you can learn following most demanded civil engineering softwares from very basic level to advanced level.\nAutoCAD 2D\nAutoCAD 3D,\nRevit Architecture,\nRevit Structure,\nRevit MEP\nRevit Dynamo,\nStaad Pro,\nEtabs,\nRevit to Lumion Pro,\nPreliminary Designs of Structural Members,\nLeaning Bar Bending Schedule with AutoCAD & Excel,\nQuantity Surveying / Building Estimation with AutoCAD & Excel,\nAutoCAD Raster Design,\nIntroduction to ISO Global BIM Standards\n\n\nWith Warm Regards,\nAshish Pandit\nB.E.

      "description": "V-Ray for 3ds Max, mimari görselleştirme, ürün tasarımı, iç mekân modelleme, oyun geliştirme ve animasyon gibi birçok alanda kullanılan, endüstri lideri bir render motorudur. Gelişmiş özellikleri, esnek ayar seçenekleri ve yüksek performansı sayesinde, 3B sanatçılar ve tasarımcılar için vazgeçilmez bir araç hâline gelmiştir. V-Ray, iş akışınıza kolaylıkla entegre olurken; render kalitesi, hesaplama hızı, kullanım kolaylığı ve güvenilirlik konularında sektördeki standartları belirlemeye devam etmektedir.\nBu eğitim içeriğinde, özellikle gerçekçi malzeme oluşturma ve özelleştirme konularına odaklanacağız. Çünkü başarılı bir görselleştirme, yalnızca doğru modelleme ve kompozisyonla değil, aynı zamanda yüzeylerin doğru şekilde ışıkla etkileşim kurmasıyla mümkündür. Bu bağlamda, V-Ray’in materyal sistemini kullanarak gerçekçi yüzeyler oluşturmayı, farklı dokularla zenginleştirme yöntemlerini ve çok katmanlı malzeme kombinasyonlarını detaylı olarak ele alacağız.\nEğitim boyunca tuğla, ahşap, cam, metal, kumaş gibi mimari projelerde sıkça karşılaşılan yüzeylerin dijital ortamda nasıl gerçeğe en yakın şekilde üretileceğini öğreneceksiniz. Ayrıca kirli, eskimiş, yıpranmış yüzey efektleriyle projelerinize karakter ve derinlik kazandırmanın yollarını keşfedeceksiniz. Cilalı ve mat yüzey farkları, yansıma ve kırılma ayarları, şeffaflık değerleri gibi teknik detaylar da uygulamalı örneklerle açıklanacaktır.\nTüm bu bilgileri, HDRI aydınlatma ve V-Ray fiziksel kamera sistemleriyle birlikte kullanarak etkileyici sahneler oluşturabileceksiniz. Eğitim sonunda, profesyonel görselleştirmeler için gerekli olan ışık, malzeme ve gölgelendirme konularında güçlü bir altyapıya sahip olacak; projelerinizi bir üst seviyeye taşıyabilecek beceriler kazanacaksınız.",

Po ukończeniu tego szkolenia będziesz w stanie w pełni korzystać z narzędzi i technik, aby tworzyć własne rysunki, dokumentacje techniczną czy projekty 3d.\n\n\nPoznasz interfejs programu\nNauczysz się korzystać z linii konstrukcyjnych\nPoznasz specjalne techniki szkicowania\nStworzysz szkice i wiązania\nPoznasz narzędzia konstrukcyjne\nZastosujesz wyciąganie proste oraz obrót profilem\nNauczysz się stosować fazy i zaokrąglenia\nStworzysz otwory i szyki\nDokonasz kopiowania i odbicia lustrzanego\nPołączysz elementy w zespoły\nStworzysz kompletny rzut rysunkowy\nStworzysz przekrój oraz bryły 3d\n\n\nOpanuj środowisko programu\nW kursie nauczysz się podstawowych zagadnień związanych z projektowaniem i tworzeniem modeli w programie. Dzięki temu będziesz mógł wykorzystać to świetne narzędzie w swojej pracy. Kurs omawia kolejno okno programu oraz podstawową konfigurację. W kolejnych krokach zobaczysz praktyczne wykonywanie projektów. Przebrniesz przez narzędzia modelowania oraz edycji. Zapoznasz się ze środowiskiem rysunkowym, środowiskiem zespołów, środowiskiem modelowania i prezentacji.\n\n\nTwórz zrozumiałe projekty\nZrozumienie właściwego procesu projektowania jest kluczem do budowania kariery zawodowej jako projektanta. Naucz się programu Inventor, aby szybciej projektować, wprowadzać innowacje, symulować, ulepszać i wytwarzać lepsze produkty. Dowiedz się od eksperta z branży, jak najlepiej wykorzystać to potężne narzędzie, aby zrealizować swoje pomysły.\n\n\nDlaczego Autodesk Inventor?\nAutodesk Inventor to jedno z najlepiej sprzedających się na świecie narzędzi do modelowania 3d i cyfrowego prototypowania, tworzenia rysunków technicznych. Z powodzeniem stosowany wszędzie tam gdzie potrzeba zaprojektować konstrukcję mechaniczną, stworzyć przekrój bryły 3d, zasymulować działanie maszyn lub stworzyć dokumentację. Odnajdzie się zarówno w rysowaniu 2d jak i modelowaniu 3d. Cechą z której słynie program to automatyzacja, pozwalająca oszczędzić mnóstwo czasu oraz zniwelować dużo błędów. Co ważne program wspiera projekty wykonane w AutoCad.\n\n\nInventor vs inne programy CAD\nWiele osób porównuje Inventora to znanego wszystkich Auto Cada. Tak naprawdę te dwa programy są podobne do siebie i wybór między nimi zależy od Twoich wymagań. Auto Cad sprawdzi się w prostszych projektach gdzie przeważa środowisko 2d. Natomiast Inventor to o wiele bardziej złożone oprogramowanie, które świetnie radzi sobie zarówno z projektami 2d jak i 3d.\nProgram zawiera zintegrowaną symulację ruchu i analizę naprężeń montażowych, dzięki czemu użytkownicy mają opcje wprowadzania obciążeń, aby sprawdzić, jak produkt będzie działał w scenariuszu rzeczywistym. Te narzędzia symulacyjne umożliwiają użytkownikom projektującym na przykład samochody lub części samochodowe, sprawdzić wytrzymałość auta podczas zderzenia.",

      "description": "Perspektif, iki boyutlu yüzeye üç boyutlu görsel etki kazandırmak için nesnenin ve mekanın görünümünün belirli teknikler kullanarak kağıda aktarımıdır. Nesneler ve Mekan farklı bakış açılarından değişik görünüm şekilleri oluşturabilirler, en basit ifade ile nesneler uzaklaştıkça görünüşleri gerçek görünüşlerinden farklılaşarak küçülür, bu farklılaşma çizimin yanı sıra perspektif bilimi ile optik ve matematik olarak ta ifade edilebilir. Perspektif çizim teknikleri başta mimarlar, mühendisler, endüstri planlayıcıları tarafından çok kullanılır.\nÇift kaçışlı perspektife açısal perspektif de denir. Kutu hafifçe çevrilirse kesişme noktası ufuk hattı üzerinde dönen yönün aksi istikametinde kayar. Tek nokta perspektifinde yatay boyutlar (genişlikler) çizim kağıdı kenarlarına paraleldir. iki nokta perspektifinde iki kesişme noktası vardır ve her iki kesişme noktasına göre çizilen resimde derinlik çizgileri, çizim kağıdı kenarına paralel değildir. İki kesişme noktası arasındaki ölçü resmin basit orantısıdır. İki nokta perspektif resim çizimini kolay anlamak için, demiryolu üzerinde duran ve elinde tuttuğu bir cam tabakayı sağa ve sola hafifçe çeviren bir kişinin gördüğü manzarayı düşünmek yeterlidir. Cam tabaka biraz sola çevrilirse tren raylarının ufuk hattında kesiştiği nokta sanki sağa kaymış gibi görülür.\nÇizim yatay doğrultuda iki kesişme noktasına ilave olarak dikey doğrultuda da üçüncü bir kesişme noktası ihtiva ediyorsa buna üç boyut perspektifi denir. Kullanma alanı çok sınırlı olup, tatbikatta bu tür çizimler yerine modeller kullanılır.",

Estaremos utilizando as versões do AutoCAD 2022 e 2021 que são muito similares, porém estaremos destacando o que é novidade e exclusivo da versão 2022. Para aqueles que possuem versões mais antigas, a partir do AutoCAD 2017 já é muito similar e possível acompanhar o curso tranquilamente. É um curso bem objetivo, direto ao assunto, e sem enrolações. Embora seja um curso rápido, por ser um curso objetivo e sem enrolação, isso faz dele um curso bem completo para aqueles que querem aprender a desenhar projetos arquitetônicos ou plantas diversas. Durante o curso vocês aprenderão os principais comandos de desenho, os comandos auxiliares, comandos de detalhamentos e faremos na pratica um projeto contendo pranchas, carimbo, planta, cortes e vistas, e deixaremos o projeto pronto, na escala desejada para plotagem ou geração de PDF.  Embora AutoCAD seja um software voltado principalmente ao 2D, ainda sim é de suma importância que todos os projetistas e desenhistas tenham afinidade com ele, pois a maioria dos projetos, mesmo os elaborados em softwares BIM, muitas vezes acabam sendo finalizados em extensão de AutoCAD, portanto ainda é uma ferramenta fundamental e indispensável.",

Özellikle Rhinoceros ve Grasshopper eklentisiyle geliştirilen bu araçlar, kolay öğrenebilen ve kullanıcı dostu arayüzüyle dünya çapında en etkin tasarım platformu olarak göze çarpıyor. Parametrik tasarım araçları görsel olarak kolaylıkla anlaşılabilecek ilişki ağlarının kurulmasıyla geliştirilen kodlardan oluşuyor. Bu araçları basit geometri bilgisi ve matematiksel ilişkiler kullanarak genel hatlarını kavramanız mümkün.\nBu temel eğitim setinde Rhinoceros parametrik modelleme eklentisi olan Grasshopper programını başlangıç seviyesinde öğreneceğiz. Grasshopper, mimarlar, sanatçılar ve tüm diğer tasarım alanında çalışan yaratıcı disiplerin kullanabileceği açık kaynaklı ve kolay öğrenilebilen görsel kodların üretildiği bir parametrik tasarım eklentisidir. Bu eklenti sayesinde akışkan formlar, parametrik yüzeyler ve dokular modellemenin yanı sıra, farklı eklentilerle mimari, üretim ve yaratıcı işler üretmeniz mümkün olacaktır.\nGrasshopper’a giriş niteliğindeki 3 saatlik eğitim kapsamında aşağıdaki kavramlar ve bilgler aktarılacaktır.\n-Grasshopper arayüzünün temellerini\n-Parametrik etki alanı modellemesi\n-Eğri yüzey modellemsi\n-Parametrik kule\n-Eğri yüzeylerde panel üretimi\n-Pythonla kodlama\nEğitim kapsamında hazırlanan Grasshopper kodları da katılımcılarla paylaşılacaktır.\nRhinoceros’un 6 ve sonraki sürümlerinde Grasshopper entegre edilmiştir. Önceki sürümler için bilgisayarlarınıza Grasshopper yüklenmesi gerekmektedir. Rhinoceros programına sahip değilseniz, program websitesinden 90 günlük deneme sürümünü indirerek bu eğitime katılabilirsiniz.\nUzun yıllar ABD’de hesaplamalı tasarım alanında araştırmalarda bulunduktan sonra 2017 yılında Türkiye’ye döndüm ve bu alanda çalışmalarıma devam ediyorum. Ülkemizde yeni gelişmekte olan bu alanda tüm öğrencilere açık bir eğitim platformu yaratabilmek için online webinar serisi hazırlamaya karar verdim.

Após o término do curso o aluno receberá um certificado válido, e estará preparado para executar qual projeto 2D e 3D no AutoCAD, estando habilitado para o mercado de trabalho.\n\n\nUma mensagem!!!\nE buscar-me-eis, e me achareis, quando me buscardes com todo o seu coração.\nJeremias 29 :13\n\n\nEis que estou à porta, e bato; se alguém ouvir a minha voz, e abrir a porta, entrarei em sua casa, e com ele cearei, e ele comigo.\nApocalipse 3: 20\n\n\nVocê que está passando por alguma dificuldade, procurando meios de achar uma saída para seus problemas, sentimento de vazio, não consegue ser feliz, você já descobriu de tudo para resolver seus conflitos, mas no fim das contas o problema continua aí? Seja qual for o seu problema, posso te dizer que há uma esperança, e uma esperança viva, que o mundo não pode dar, essa esperança se chama Jesus, Ele quer nos fazer nova criatura, quer cuidar de nós, de todas as áreas de Nossas vidas, quer que tenhamos vida em abundância João 10 10, e o mais importante, nos preparamos para uma vida eterna com Ele, porque o mundo vai passar; mas para isso precisamos tomar uma decisão de entregar nossa vida a Jesus, e andarmos na sua retidão, sermos obedientes a sua palavra, aos seus ensinamentos. Você pode me dizer que já tentei procurar Deus, mas não obtive resposta, e eu te digo que se você perseverar, ama-lo e buscá-lo de todo seu coração, Ele te responderá e receberá a mudança de sua vida; então faço um convite se dê uma chance e verá a glória de Deus se manifestar em sua vida, Jesus seja contigo.",

Aslında bir eğitimden ziyade bolca mimari proje üzerinden binalara mimar gözüyle bakmayı anlatan ve bunu yormadan yapan bir monolog da diyebiliriz.\nBinaların tasarım öyküleri, son kullanıcıya ve işverene yansıyan izdüşümleri bu kursta sizlerle olacak. Mimarlık; kültür ve sanatın tam  merkezinde yer alan, tarihin şekillenişine tanıklık eden mekan tasarlama işidir.\nMimarların farklı sınırlayıcılar ile nasıl çalıştıklarını, mekan tasarımına etki eden doğal ve insani faktörleri örnek yapılar üzerinden sizlere yorumladım. Manzara, kuzey, insan ve araç sirkülasyonu, yayaların yapıyı deneyimleme biçimleri üzerinden kütlesel form denemelerini izleyerek öğrenebileceksiniz. Tüm bunları konsept projeler özelinde analiz edebilme yeteneği kazanarak eğer profesyonel olarak bu işi yapıyorsanız da daha geniş bir tasarım spekturumu üzerinden yorumlayabileceksiniz.\nBu işi prefosyonel olarak yapıyor olmasanız bile binaların ne anlattığını, tasarımcıların projeyi şekillendirirken neleri düşündüğünü en iyi o binaları soluyarak, tadarak, koklayarak deneyimleyebilirsiniz. En iyi ihtimalle yaşadığınız mekanlara ve yapılara daha farklı bir bakış açısıyla yaklaşma şekillerine tanıklık etmiş olacaksınız.\nBu kurs, size mekan deneyimi ve binaların şekillenişini maksimum verimle deneyimleme fırsatı sunacak. Günümüzün modern yapım teknikleri ve popüler mimarlık kavramları da bu eğitimde sizlerle.\nÖzetle yapıların nasıl okunduğunu anlatan, mimariyi ve mimarlık kavramlarını örnekler üzerinden gerçek hayata dayandırarak açıklayan bu eğitim, tersine mühendislik yöntemiyle tasarım sürecine katkı sağlayabilecek verilerin nasıl üretildiğini sizlere sunmuş oluyor. Eğitim içeriği ve müfredatı zaman içerisinde güncellenmeye devam edecektir. Bu noktada geri dönüşler ve talepler titizlikle değerlendirilecektir.",

      "description": "Sono soddisfatto di presentarti il corso più pratico ed immediato che ci sia in Italia. Ci ho lavorato nei ritagli di tempo (che tanto ritagli non sono stati). Ho spostato appuntamenti di lavoro, ho registrato di notte, nei weekend e sotto le festività natalizie: tutto per riuscire a creare un corso che contenesse tutto l'essenziale per chi si affaccia per la prima volta su Revit, per chi è esperto di Revit e vuole confrontare le proprie abilità o scoprire come vengono affrontati alcuni temi in modo differente; si rivolge a chi si affaccia per la prima volta nel mondo della libera professione e a chi, magari più esperto, vuole approfondire determinate tematiche.\nDieci anni fa, avessi avuto io un corso così completo sulle più svariate tematiche della vita progettuale e professionale (dalla fattibilità all'esecutivo, passando per i primi dati di potenziali costi dell'opera, attraversando il progetto preliminare con lo sviluppo del computo metrico estimativo, al progetto definitivo e la consegna degli elaborati all'ente comunale fino ad arrivare all'esecutivo da cantiere) non ci avrei pensato due volte a vederlo tutto di un fiato. Molte cose le ho apprese con il tempo e con gli errori. Molti errori.\nProprio per questo motivo ho deciso di dedicare una gran fetta delle mie ore giornaliere su questo corso.\nChe tu sia un Architetto, un Ingegnere o un Geometra: il mio intento è farti capire il processo di un nuovo incarico professionale: dall'impianto base fino all'esecutivo. Quando ho iniziato la professione ho trovato tante difficoltà nell'affrontare, da solo, un progetto. Mi domandavo sempre:\n\n\ncome faccio a sapere come e quanto costruire, quale normativa seguire?\nquali sono e quanti sono i documenti da rappresentare?\ncome stimare il costo di un fabbricato nella fase di prefattibilità?\ncome si sviluppa un computo metrico estimativo?\ncome devo impaginare per rendere di facile lettura le tavole per l'ente comunale?\ncosa devo rappresentare come esecutivo da girare all'impresa per il cantiere?\ncome si scrive una relazione tecnica?\nIn teoria tutti siamo bravi grazie ai vari manuali ma nella pratica è stato duro scontrarsi senza un tutor che mi accompagnasse in ogni passo.\nInoltre spero di poter essere di aiuto a futuri professionisti, giovani o meno giovani, che sono scoraggiati da come affrontare un incarico più o meno complesso mentre si stanno affacciando per la prima volta nel mondo della libera professione.\n\nCon questo corso, che ha richiesto più di quattro mesi di registrazione e altri due mesi di sola preparazione, avrai solide fondamenta per innalzare il tuo impalcato professionale. Capirai il funzionamento del programma e di molti meccanismi collegati alla professione. Ricorda: Revit è uno strumento nelle tue mani. Devi essere veloce, immediato e diretto per poter affrontare la concorrenza e rendere un servizio di alta qualità.\nTi sei mai chiesto perché dei potenziali Clienti dovrebbero scegliere te invece di un altro professionista? Grazie a questo corso imparerai ad essere efficiente, veloce, professionale, preciso nei dati perché sfrutterai la potenza di un software B.I.M. nel modo più intuitivo e veloce possibile che gioverà sia alla tua attività che ai tuoi Clienti andando ad abbattere costi e problematiche burocratiche e di cantiere.",

Profesyonel olarak mimarlık yapmaktayım ve Youtube platformu üzerinden İngilizce olarak pratik Archicad videoları çekmekteyim. Fakat bu Archicad'i hiç bilmeyenler için yeterli değil. Temel seviye Archicad bilgisi gerekiyor. Dolayısıyla bu video serisi Archicad'i Türkçe olarak öğrenmek isteyenler için tamamen Türkçe olarak çekildi ve detaylarıyla anlatıldı.  Bu eğitim sonunda Archicad'i hiç bilmeseniz bile artık aktif olarak kullanabileceksiniz. Eğitimde temel içeriği verdikten sonra yeni uygulama bölümü sunuyorum. Bu bölüm sürekli güncelleniyor ve yeni videolar ekleniyor. Uygulama bölümü sayesinde aldığınız eğitim sadece teoride değil aynı zamanda pratikte de gelişecek. Böylelikle bir problem karşısında ne tarz çözümler üretmemiz gerekiyor bu konuda da kendinizi geliştireceksiniz. Kursa kayıt olmak için eğitimciye destek olmak adına yukarıda her ayın başında vermiş olduğum indirim kodunu kullanabilirsiniz.\nBir mimar olmak, tasarım fikirlerinizi ifade etmekten geçmelidir. BIM, bunu bilgisayar teknolojisi ile yapabileceğiniz bir dildir. Mimari modelleme bilginizi, BIM ve görselleştirme becerilerinizi geliştirmenin yolunu bu eğitim setinde bulabilirsiniz. Beni takip ederek BIM becerilerinize çok daha fazlasını ekleyeceksiniz.\nKurs içerisinde;\nDers 1:Giriş\nDers 2:Duvar Aracı Giriş\nDers 3:Birim Değiştirme\nDers 4:Kat Ekleme Çıkarma ve Duvar Yükseklikleri\nDers 5:Duvar Aracında Gelişmiş Seçenekler\nDers 6:Kısayol Düzenleme\nDers 7:3D Ekranda Gezinme\nDers 8:3D Modifikasyon\nDers 9:Döşeme Aracı\nDers 10:Kapı Aracı\nDers 11:Pencere Aracı\nDers 12:Sihirli Değnek Aracı\nDers 13:Merdiven Oluşturma\nDers 14:Merdiven Detayları\nDers 15:Korkuluk Aracı\nDers 16:Çatı Aracı\nDers 17:Çatı Sihirbazı ve Çatıları Düzenleme\nDers 18:Boşluk Aracı\nDers 19:Kolon Aracı\nDers 20:Kiriş Aracı\nDers 21:Shell ( Kabuk ) Aracı\nDers 22:Tonozda Boşluk Oluşturma ve Dış Hat Belirleme\nDers 23:Kesit ve Görünüş Oluşturma\nDers 24:Görünüm Ayarları ve Otomatik Çizgi Kalınlıkları\nDers 25:Mesh Aracı ve Arazi Yapımı\nDers 26:Katı Modelleme Aracı\nDers 27:Arazi Aracında Çizgi ve İzohips Görünümünü Düzenleme\nDers 28:Obje Oluşturma\nDers 29:Giydirme Cephe oluşturma (Curtain Wall)\nDers 30:Mahaller\nDers 31:Ölçü Verme\nDers 32:Sıvalı Duvar Yapma\nDers 33:Profil Aracı\nDers 34:Morph Aracı\nDers 35:Metraj Çıkarma\nDers 36:Katmanlar ve Kombinasyonlar\nDers 37:Görünüm Kombinasyonları ve Görüntü Kaydederek Kat Planı Oluşturma\nDers 38:Pafta Hazırlama\nDers 39:Paftayı Autocad'e Gönderme\nDers 40:Publisher Sets\nKonularını detaylı bir şekilde bulabilirsiniz.",
