We’ll explore this Dr. Cialdini principle and several other traits of superhero negotiators.\nLastly, we’ll introduce the concept of a negotiation center of excellence and the advantages that this structure can bring to an organization.\n\n\nModule 2: Negotiation Planning.\nIn this module you’ll learn about market intelligence gathering and we’ll introduce you to macro and micro market intelligence sources that will be the foundation for developing a negotiation plan.\nWe’ll talk about our positions in the negotiation plan. What should we open with? Where should we anchor? And lastly, when should we walk away and utilize our Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement or BATNA.\nLastly, we’ll introduce a concept used by large companies for delegating negotiation authority and controlling risk.\n\n\nModule 3: Negotiation Strategy and Tactics.\nIn Karrass’s Book “Give and Take”, he describes over two hundred tactics used in negotiations. We highly recommend his books and seminars as great foundational training on the topic. For this module however, we’re going to introduce just a few tactics that we believe are most effective at delivering results and used by the best negotiators every day.\nPlease keep in mind that the use of any tactics should be complimentary to a solid negotiation plan. Being great at tactics won’t make up for a lack of preparation! Also, the best negotiators strategically use a variety of tactics at different stages of the negotiation. We often say, don’t be a “one trick pony” or “predictable”.\n\n\nModule 4:  Other Negotiation Topics.\nIn this module we’ll cover a variety of topics starting with business ethics. Corporate negotiators need to align to a high standard. We’ll test you with several scenarios.\nWe’ll discuss the importance of competition and several ways to create it when lacking options.\nTitles and status have a way of intimating us. Don’t let it. You may be a kitten, but your negotiation planning skills learned in module 2 have made you a lion.\nVirtual negotiations are the new normal. We’ll provide tips from the best negotiators on how to navigate the new environmental challenges.\nKnowledge is power! Ask good questions before and during negotiations to gain the competitive edge. The best negotiators couple asking questions with reading body language.\nWe’ll discuss the best way to break deadlocks and make concessions.\nPractice, practice, practice. We’ll showcase a company called Mursion used by large companies for negotiation simulations with Avatars.\nWe’ll introduce eAuctions and when it’s best to consider these tools for negotiating price through competitive bidding.",

Tech-based solutions towards making individuals safe and organizations secure have emerged, and continue to adapt to evolving situations across the globe. Then there are solutions that promise to optimize the use of real estate and building services. However, organizations need to tread with caution and not resort to ‘off-the-shelf’ buying when it comes to such new-age solutions. Solutions need to support organizational goals and be integrated with the organizations’ vision and respective post-Covid strategy thereof.\nMost of the solutions out there are based on Artificial Intelligence or Big Data analysis or Cloud Computing or Internet of Things or a combination of some of these. What do these terms really mean? Learn the basics of these in a simple format, with examples. If you are looking to adopt new-age technology to bring about efficiencies or improve safety/security, knowing the basics will enable you to relate to the solutions better and make an informed decision. If you are generally interested in understanding the base-level tech on which businesses run today, you will secure a better appreciation of how technology can boost business in the new era.\nThis course guides you through the basics of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Cloud Computing, and the Internet of Things in the first four lectures....and much more towards the end, about how humans will soon work and live off the metaverse.\nSoon, most organizations may expect employees to work from metaverses. What is the metaverse all about? How will different technologies be at play? How will it make life easier for employees and businesses alike? The last lesson looks at how technology is evolving to build a new way of working and living for humans.",

In this comprehensive course, we delve into both microeconomic and macroeconomic realms, offering a holistic understanding of how economies function and evolve.\nMicroeconomics, the cornerstone of our study, scrutinizes the intricate behaviors of individual economic actors such as consumers, workers, firms, and market forces. Through meticulous analysis, we unravel how consumption, production, and income distribution interlace within the market's intricate web, empowering us to navigate real-world scenarios with informed decision-making.\nMeanwhile, macroeconomics unveils the broader canvas, shedding light on pivotal phenomena such as national income, unemployment, and inflation that sculpt the socioeconomic landscape. Yet, we transcend mere observation by delving into the intricate dynamics of government intervention. From the indispensable role of the Federal Reserve Bank to the nuanced workings of monetary and fiscal policies aimed at steering unemployment and inflation, we meticulously explore how regulatory measures can shape economic trajectories within defined boundaries.\nEmbark on this enlightening journey with me as we delve deep into the intricate tapestry of economic principles, providing you with invaluable insights into both the micro and macro dimensions of economic phenomena, guiding you towards gaining a comprehensive understanding of the intricate workings of our domestic and global economies .",

Copyright protection, in particular, gives creators the right to control the use of their work and the ability to earn from it. Failing to protect your intellectual property can have far-reaching financial and reputational consequences for the creator or business. This is the reason why it is essential to understand how to create, protect and use your intellectual property.\nThis course focuses on one of the most important areas of intellectual property law: copyright law. I'm sure you are aware that copyright law is a complex subject that causes concern for many because of the legal implications.\nThis course aims to provide you with the most informative overview of the basics of copyright. We will discuss the kinds of creations that copyright law does and does not cover and the requirements the work should meet in order to be protected. I will tell you about the rights of the copyright holder and how can they be exercised. You will learn what remedies you may pursue against any abuse of your rights and how to avoid copyright infringement in your own work.\nMoreover, I want to share with you my insights on the best practices in the field of copyright law, which you can also apply in your work to mitigate the risk of infringing third-party rights. I hope that this course will help you gain a better understanding of the fundamental concepts of copyright law and it will be useful in your daily work.\nWithout further ado, welcome to the course.",

Once you try this you will be hooked, just as I was. And that is why I made this course. It's great technology that map makers and everyday folks will soon use to get locationally relevant data. As a daily map maker, I am excited about what this software allows and want to share it with everyone.\nWe cover all the basics of this software, like how to find maps, upload your own maps. We also dig into other ancillary software that you can use along with Soar, such as Pics from Space, QGIS, GIMP and Darktable. By the end of the course you will be uploading your own data and / or downloading other map information and learning about things all over the earth. The best part about Soar in my opinion is the way it brings people together around the globe. So come join me and I will teach you all about this great technology. I even kept the class to under 2 hours so you can watch for free. Cheers!",

It provides the legal framework for the collection of customs duties and taxes, and sets out the rules and procedures for the import and export of goods in India.\nUnder the Customs Act, customs duties are levied on imported and exported goods, and these duties are based on the value of the goods and the nature of the goods being imported or exported. The Customs Act also provides for the collection of other types of duties and taxes, including anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties, and safeguard duties, which are designed to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.\nIn addition to regulating the collection of duties and taxes, the Customs Act also contains provisions related to the control and regulation of the import and export of goods in India. For example, the Act contains provisions related to the issue of licenses and permits for the import and export of certain types of goods, as well as provisions related to the seizure and confiscation of goods that are being imported or exported in violation of the Act or any other laws of India.\nOverall, the Indian Customs Act is an important piece of legislation that plays a vital role in regulating the import and export of goods in India and in protecting the country's domestic industries.\nCourse Content\nModule 1-Overview of Custom law\na.

      "description": "The majority of the world’s population is affected directly or indirectly by the use of office space.\nEvery individual works for or knows someone that works for an office-based business, or they use goods or services that have been created by an entity that occupies office space.\nThe global Covid-19 pandemic also affected every member of the population.\nMany office-based businesses found that, during lockdown periods, they could continue to survive, and many found that they could thrive, without the use of an office.\nFor this reason, the collective business world is now re-evaluating its usage of physical office space.\nOffice space is amongst the top 3 costs to most businesses, along with payroll and IT, and it is imperative to a business’s success to get all 3 correct.\nBusinesses are looking to recoup losses experienced during the pandemic and to create revised future-proof operations models.\nAnd many employees are demanding increased levels of flexible working within their contracts, through full remote work roles or hybrid working.\nPayroll, IT and office space are interconnected and there is now an opportunity to add more flexibility to working practices - in the forms of remote and flexible working, and in the strategic use of office space - through hybrid working.\nRemote work and hybrid working are by no means new – models were first conceived in the 1970s, although the technology was not available, at the time, to fully support them.\nIt was trialled by many businesses in the 1990s, however, it was still not fully practical – a 1-hour video call cost the same as a high-end laptop today (£1,500/$2,000), for instance.\nAs IT developed, remote work was increasingly trialled by businesses with varying levels of success and adoption – however, even in the run-up to 2020, it was still seen as somewhat of an employee perk.\nAnd a survey in 2018 found that only around 3% of American employees worked from home more than half of the time.\nThe enforced lockdowns brought on by the pandemic pressure-tested remote working practices as well as the IT available to businesses in the 2020s.\nNow, video conferencing is practically free, file-sharing and email is now in the cloud, most employees have a home pc, tablet or smartphone, and domestic broadband is the fastest it has ever been.\nBusinesses are looking to capitalise on the findings of this enforced homeworking experiment, create efficiencies, improve employee well-being, and remain competitive.\nTraditionally rented office space can be difficult to experiment with – the average lease length is 6 years in the UK, for instance.\nBusinesses are now looking to the flexible office space market for workspaces with which they can trial new operations models.\nThe flex space market has been building for the last 40 years, seeing a great acceleration in the decade following the Great Recession.\nThe flexible office space offered by this market offers ready-to-go solutions that act as testing beds for new working models, so the pandemic has created a further catalyst in its growth and adoption.\nIt is difficult to recall a time when the office space industry received so much mainstream media press – many headlines, during lockdowns, proclaimed that ‘the office is dead’.\nIt is certainly not dead, but it is changing, and it is becoming more flexible.\nWhy We Have Created This Course?\nGetting the office space and the workplace operations of a business correct is critical to its success. As the business world goes through a process of re-evaluating how it uses physical office space, there are a growing number of considerations.\nThe pandemic reminded us that elements of certain businesses can be run remotely, and businesses are now looking at how much of their operations can continue to be run in this way in post-pandemic times.\nThe technological advances over the past 30 years have made remote working and hybrid working less of an idealistic possibility but now an undeniable reality if a business wishes to use them.\nThe socioeconomic responsibilities of businesses, of all sizes, are becoming increasingly important and visible. Including how environmentally friendly a business is as well as how it looks after the mental health and wellbeing of its people.\nBusinesses are now juggling how to balance elements of flexible working, remote working and in-office work, and how this aligns with their long term commercial real estate strategies.\nFlexible office space options are being increasingly utilised by companies of all sizes as testing grounds for new operations models.\nWith the growing number of workspace options available to a business, as well as the increasingly large grey area between traditionally leased office space to rent and flexible office space options, it is important to understand the nuances between the formats.\nAs a flexible office space agency, it has always been important to us to be one that is regulated by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). We were the first flexible space broker to be regulated by the body and remain the only one that is.\nIt was important because even when we were founded, in 2009, there could be a lack of clarity about how rented office space differed from flexible space options.\nIt was important that we could help companies efficiently and accurately understand the differences between the two formats and appreciate the differences in the pricing structure, entry procedure, ongoing property management requirements, the obligations of all parties, exit protocols and other elements.\nThe flexible workspace industry has seen exponential growth over the last decade following the Great Recession, and this trajectory shows no signs of blunting. The events created by the Covid-19 pandemic further increased appetite for flexibility.\nThe increasing number of office space options available to businesses is a major positive, however, there is an increasing number of crossover points between different methods of occupation, creating a grey area that is growing in size.\nBusinesses increasingly see space that is advertised somewhat ambiguously as ‘flexible office space for rent’, ‘flexible workspace for lease’, ‘office space rented on flexible contract terms’, ‘flexibly leased offices‘ and other variations. These phrases can be somewhat confusing because, as we explain in this course, flexible office space is not ‘rented’, in the true definition of the term.\nThere is also a growing number of online platforms that offer direct access to flexible office space options. These are often highly efficient but don’t always provide commercial real estate consultancy services that allow a business to make a fully informed decision about one of the most important elements within an entity’s business model canvas.\nWhilst this course in no way constitutes commercial property advice, it does provide an overview of the office space solutions available to a business, how they work and how they differ.\nIt has been created as a starting point in learning about the office space market and the increasing number of options, and nuances, within it.\nWhat You Will Learn on This Course:\nHow traditional leased office space works.\nWe will examine what flexible office space is.\nWe will define serviced offices.\nWe will define managed offices.\nAnd we will define coworking spaces.\nWe will discuss the fundamental differences between leased offices and flexible office space.\nWe will discuss how flexible office space is priced.\nWe will examine hybrid working and hybrid workplace models.\nWe will discuss the importance of seeking professional advice from brokers and solicitors or lawyers during the office space acquisition process.\nAnd it will signpost further resources and information that will aid further learning about this growing industry.",

On the one hand, it is a friendly, casual and easy environment. But it is also ruthless and high-demanding, with no sympathy for the weak.\nIt is a complex and subtle working culture that is almost impossible for a new arrival to figure out. The unwritten rules can take a lifetime to understand.\nBased on working with hundreds of Indian consultants over a 30-year period, it combines elements of emotional intelligence and consulting skills and is designed to lift the veil and explain these hidden rules. It provides a practical step-by-step framework, following the phases of a typical IT project.\nThe course contains an introduction, followed by five phases:\n1. Preparation, that is understanding the basics of working here.\n2. Meeting a client for the first time: just how important it is and exactly how to make a good first impression, remotely or in person.\n3. Getting the lay of the land: how to best get an understanding of the technical and other aspects of your job: to find out what the priorities are and what’s really needed.\n4. Requirements gathering: the best way to get the detailed information and requirements you need for your particular job.\n5. Delivery: how to become a high-performing team member.",

Bunun dışında popüler diğer ai araçlarından da bahsetmek iyi olmuş. Teşekkürler.\" Emirhan Girgin\n\n\n\"Yapay zekaya adapte olanlar iş hayatında fark atmaya başladı.\"\nChatGPT ve diğer yapay zeka araçlarıyla işlerinizi saniyeler içinde halletmek mümkün. Bu kursta, bu teknolojileri nasıl etkili kullanacağınızı öğrenerek iş gücünüzü artıracaksınız.\n\n\nChatGPT ile sınırsız içerik üretebilir, mail, makale ve hatta kod yazdırabilirsiniz. Midjourney, Dall-E gibi araçlarla saniyeler içinde görseller oluşturma yeteneği kazanacaksınız.\n\n\n\"Yapay zeka işimi elimden alacak mı?\" popüler sorusu, yerini \"Bu işi yapay zekaya nasıl yaptırabiliriz?\" sorusuna bıraktı.\n\n\nChatGPT gibi üretken yapay zekalar hayatımıza girdiğinden beri çalışma hayatında devrim niteliğinde değişiklikler oldu ve olmaya devam ediyor.\n\n\nAncak boş bir metin kutusuyla karşı karşıya kaldığımızda doğal olarak aklımıza sadece mesajlaşma geliyor. Bu problemden dolayı birçok insan ChatGPT'nin ne yapabileceğini öğrenemiyor veya çok kısıtlı şekilde öğreniyor. Sıfırdan Uzmanlığa ChatGPT eğitimi, bu problemleri çözmek için hazırlandı.\n\n\nBu kurs ile ChatGPT ve diğer 10'dan fazla yapay zeka aracıyla sıfırdan uzmanlığa ulaşabilir, kariyerinizde sıçrama yapabilirsiniz!\n\n\nBilimsel makalelere dayanan \"Prompt Mühendisliği\" teknikleriyle, ChatGPT'nin kabiliyetlerini sınırlarına kadar kullanmayı öğreneceksiniz.\n\n\n\"ChatGPT: Sıfırdan Uzmanlığa\" eğitimi, ChatGPT başta olmak üzere Sora, Claude AI, Midjourney, Copilot, Dall-E, Adobe Firefly, Ideogram gibi 10'dan fazla araçla, yapay zeka dünyasının kapılarını aralamanız ve bu alanda kendinizi geliştirmeniz için eşsiz bir fırsat sunuyor.

Aksini düşünmeniz halinde 30 gün içinde iade hakkınız da bulunuyor.\n\n\nBu Kurs Neden Diğer ChatGPT ve Yapay Zeka Eğitimlerinden Farklı?\n\n\nBilimsel ve Pratik Dayanaklar: Kursta anlatılan teknikler bilimsel kaynaklara dayanır ve uygulamalı olarak yararı gösterilir.\nEğitmen Tecrübesi: Kursu hazırlayan eğitmen, girişimci olarak 2 adet yapay zeka uygulaması yaptı ve bu ürünler binlerce kişiye ulaştı. Eğitmenin, yapay zekanın üretici tarafında da yer alması kursun daha profesyonel bir düzene girmesini sağladı.\nUygulama Dersleri: Anlatılan her tekniğin ardından uygulaması gösterilir ve kursiyerin de en az 1 örnek yapması teşvik edilir.\nTopluluk: Topluluğa katılarak ChatGPT uzmanlığıyla ilgilenen diğer profesyonellerle bilgi alışverişi yapabilir, sorularınızı sorabilirsiniz.\n\n\nNeden ChatGPT ve Yapay Zeka Öğrenmelisiniz?\n\n\nGeleceğin İş Gücü: Yapay zeka ve otomasyon, geleceğin iş dünyasının temelini oluşturacak. ChatGPT gibi araçları kullanabilen profesyoneller, bu yeni dünyada öne çıkacaklar.\nZaman ve Verimlilik: Yapay zeka araçları, tekrarlayan görevleri otomatikleştirmenize ve zamanınızı daha verimli kullanmanıza olanak tanır.\nSınırsız Üretkenlik: ChatGPT ve Midjourney gibi yapay zeka araçları, sanat, tasarım, yazılı içerik ve daha birçok alanda üretkenliğinizi katlayacak veri tabanına sahiptir.\nRekabet Avantajı: Yapay zeka becerileri, işverenlerin aradığı yetkinlikler arasında hızla yükseliyor. Bu alanda uzmanlaşarak rakiplerinizin önüne geçin.\n\n\nNeden Sıfırdan Uzmanlığa ChatGPT Eğitimimizin Online Kurs Olması Daha Avantajlı?\n\n\nHazırlanan videolar için günlerce çalışma yapılıyor ve en ufak seslendirme hatası dahi düzeltiliyor. Konuşulan kelimeler ve cümleler defalarca kontrol ediliyor. Dolayısıyla, izleyiciye en kısa sürede en fazla bilgi verilmiş oluyor. Bir eğitim merkezinde 10 saatte verilen bilgi online kurs ile dakikalar içinde ve hatasız olarak veriliyor.\n\n\nGüncellemeler ile kursa gelen yeniliklere devamlı olarak ulaşılabiliyor.\n\n\nFiyat olarak birçok eğitim merkezine kıyasla bedava sayılacak bir ücrete sunuluyor.\n\n\n100'lerce kurs katılımcısının yorumlarıyla kursun yararlılığına emin olunabiliyor.\n\n\nSatın aldıktan sonra saniyeler içinde kursa başlanılıyor dolayısıyla eğitim merkezindeki gibi bekleme süreleri bulunmuyor.\n\n\nİzleyici daha eğlenceli vakit geçiriyor çünkü dersler animasyon, hareketli yazılar ve görseller ile anlatılıyor ve öğrencilerin geri bildirimleriyle devamlı iyileştiriliyor.\n\n\nÖğretilen bilgilerin kaynaklarının da paylaşılmasıyla internet üzerinden bilgilerin doğruluğu ve güvenilirliği doğrulanabiliyor.\n\n\nSoru&cevap bölümü ile herhangi bir zamanda eğitmenden birebir yardım almak mümkün oluyor.\n\n\nGeleceğin dünyasında yerinizi almak ve yapay zeka devriminin bir parçası olmak için aramıza katılın!\n\n\nKurs hakkında daha ayrıntılı bilgi için tanıtım videomuz ve ücretsiz önizleme videolarımıza göz atabilirsiniz.\n\n\nKursu bir kez satın aldığınızda sınırsız erişim hakkına sahip oluyorsunuz.

These habits include effective time management practices, structured work routines, and strategies that enable them to tackle tasks methodically. These habits become the cornerstone of their productivity, allowing them to achieve more in less time.\nNurturing a Growth Mindset\nHaving the right mindset is crucial for high achievers. They cultivate a growth mindset, seeing challenges not as obstacles but as chances to learn and evolve. Instead of being discouraged by setbacks, they extract valuable lessons from them. Their resilience in tough times fuels their ongoing success, allowing them to adapt and thrive despite difficulties.\nMindset shapes productivity. Successful individuals adopt a growth-oriented mindset, viewing challenges as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles. They maintain an optimistic outlook, leveraging setbacks as valuable learning experiences. This resilient mindset propels them forward, empowering them to navigate adversities and fueling their relentless pursuit of success.\nLeveraging Technology and Methodologies\nHigh achievers excel in embracing new technology and adopting effective methods. They actively seek out and utilize tools and systems that optimize their work processes, making them more streamlined and effective. By leveraging these resources, they significantly boost their productivity and efficiency, giving them an edge in their endeavors.\nCreating a Conducive Environment\nHigh achievers recognize that their surroundings profoundly impact their productivity. They intentionally engineer environments tailored to foster optimal performance. This involves meticulous attention to detail, from designing a clutter-free workspace with minimal distractions to curating a supportive network of individuals.\nA clutter-free workspace allows for a clear and focused mind. High achievers meticulously organize their workstations, eliminating unnecessary clutter that might distract them from their tasks. This orderly setting helps maintain concentration and boosts efficiency, enabling them to stay on track and accomplish more in less time.\nFurthermore, they understand the significance of the people surrounding them. High achievers curate a supportive network, surrounding themselves with individuals who inspire, motivate, and encourage them to excel. This network might include mentors, colleagues, or friends who share similar aspirations and values. This supportive environment provides them with invaluable feedback, guidance, and encouragement, fostering an atmosphere conducive to growth and success.\nAdaptability: Embracing Change for Growth\nAdaptability is key to thriving in dynamic environments. Successful individuals exhibit a willingness to embrace change and adopt innovative tools and methodologies. They stay abreast of technological advancements and readily incorporate them into their workflows.

Having to prepare one in guiding the basic lessons in Public Administration also is a daunting task. However, the most important task of all, is to give out the basic lessons in Administration, so that the Public Administrator who may lead us from the front tomorrow, has a staunch set of Fundamentals and Ideals in Public Administration and would lead us in such a way that they truly remain the most admired leaders of the Society.\nThis course is one among the many beginner’s courses, that may give a more basic insight to Public Administration fundamentals, from whatever has happened in the past few decades of developments, in the field of Public Administration, that would prep the Public Administrators to steer way, well towards future developments in the same field.",

I, Dr. George Flinn, go over several anecdotes, personal testimonials, and real-world examples of how one can overcome and persist in the world of business and innovation. This course is meant to give people actionable steps that will allow them to bolster their local economies as well as give them a heads up on business and what is occurring in 2022. I even go over how the government is out of money and how we as Americans can avoid the tragedy, which is headed our way, better known as inflation! one two three four five six. Additionally, most people don't realize how crime contributes to debt, the lack of innovation, and our independence as a country. In this course, I go over a frightening instance where I came home seeing the lights on, the door open, and the glass was broken out in the door which I naturally assumed, someone did in order to gain entry into my home.  I came home to see my television had been ripped off the wall, computers, and ipads had all gone, and drawers had been opened with the contents thrown to the floor. The feeling of infringement had truly taken hold of me as I couldn't do anything but stand there and feel totally violated in a sense. Ultimately, if we have harsher penalties for people who commit crimes, perpetrators will not roam the streets and people will feel more comfortable starting businesses as well attempting innovation. But, you can't do that if you don't feel safe, period!",

Leadership is your fundamental disposition towards life. It is what separates those who live intentionally from those live on autopilot. It is the core of living a good life.\nThis course will help you to identify and activate your latent leadership potential. We all have this potential, the question is simply how well we develop it and how regularly we deploy it. Through the course of these lessons, you will be guided through the theoretical foundations of leadership, its inner and outer manifestations, and the process that will lead to your own flourishing as a leader.\nBased on a workshop originally taught at the Center for Advanced Education in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, this course synthesizes key lessons from a range of disciplines including philosophy, psychology, systems theory, and organizational development.\nThroughout this course you will be asked to engage in a combination of active and reflective practices each designed to move you closer to your full leader self. While it is possible to go through this course passively and to come away from it with a better understanding of the material and a few useful tools, the course is designed for those willing to engage with it deeply. This means time spent trying out and perfecting new behaviors. It also means honestly thinking about what is important to you, who you want to be, and what you want to achieve. Personal transformation does not come cheap.\nRegardless of the arena, elite performance is always, to some degree, a question of leadership. If you are ready to level up your life, this is the course for you.",

You will learn how to properly set up your workstation for success regardless of your environment, because I’m going to teach you all my little tricks as an Occupational Therapist and Certified Ergonomist.\nThe thing is, no one ever shows you how you should set up your workstation. You don’t learn in school or on the job, unless they hire someone like to me to perform ergonomics evaluations. Most companies don’t include setting up your workstation during on-boarding. Typically, when you start a new job, they show you to your workstation and issue your equipment and that’s it.\nOnce you learn how to set up your workstation, the cool thing is you can apply them wherever you work with a little creativity, because it’s about positioning the equipment to match you and not the other way around.\nI hope you enjoy this course and are able to position your equipment to match you because we are all unique and special.\nLessons in This Class:\n1.

These credit card debts are generated when credit card holder purchases products from these cards and accumulates due to the interest charged on it. Difficulty arises because people are not able to repay their loans effectively or in time. When a card holder is unable to pay his debts he is declared as \"defaulter\".\nIn this book, “Living with Credit Card Debts”, we are looking at how we can overcome the obstacle we often face when it comes to managing our credit cards. The basic ideas discussed in the book are as follows:\n• Plan your financial life. Financial problems are something most of us will have to manage eventually in life. In order to cope with the pressure that may arise, we need to have a proper financial plan and even financial goals.\n• Credit card ratings and debts. We need to know what we should do and not be overburdened by debts.\n• Study of financial management. We should make money work for us and not the other way round. We should have control of our money and not money have controls over us.\n• Avoid bad debt. This may be as a result of poor privatization that may make us go for what we do not necessarily need.",

      "description": "This course is designed from a completely fresh and unique perspective. Because your grant application likely has between a 50-97% chance of being rejected, this course is specifically designed to ensure you have the skills to make sure that your application sits in the percentage that it is funded!\nThis course has been built from the ground up to help you to avoid both the common and less common mistakes in grant writing. It will completely change the way in which you approach each element of your grant funding application.\nBy ensuring you have a full understanding of how and why proposals are reject, you will approach the different sections of your grant application in a different way, allowinf you to mitigate flaws and errors and write proposals that are convincing and flawless. Importantly it gives you best practice for how to write each section of your grant, including your case for support, your justification of resources, and your plans for evaluation.\nMost importantly, it will teach you how to craft your proposal to ensure it is highly competitive, so that the funder will find it extremely hard to find a reason to reject it.\nA unique aspect of this course is you will learn about how to write an effective grant application from an instructor (Professor James Smith) who actually Chairs a number of funding panels and who is actually responsible for making grant funding decisions\nYour instructor, Professor James Smith, PhD, is an established and popular instructor on the Udemy platform. Feedback that he has received from Udemy students includes;\n\"Very easy to understand and the instructor spoke slowly enough that I could let the information sink in\" - KW\n\"Very informative and thorough. Getting ready to take the next course. The assignments with the instructor's example following were very helpful\" - KR\n\"Very helpful information from a well-qualified Professor. Concisely presented in a format that facilitates easy notetaking\" - BDP\nThis course is ideal for you if;\nYou want to learn how to write successful grants, rather than applications that are rejected.\nYou are an academic or Lecturer or Assistant Professor who wants to secure grant funding\nYou are grant writing for a 501.C3, a non-profit or a small/medium sized enterprise\nYou want to craft a grant proposal that is difficult for the funder to reject\nYou are undertaking fundraising and want to target your effort effectively and professionally\nIn this course you will develop an advanced understanding of how to approach and write a professional grant application that lacks any serious faults.\nThis course is split into four modules. Module 1 is called Issues with the Application Process and it covers how the decisions you make at the application stage can influence how the funder makes decisions on your project. The funder will assess your application against a number of criteria including eligibility, complete information and adherence to grant guidelines. The reviewers that are appointed by the funder will assess elements such as attention detail and the feasibility and timeline of a project. These are all areas where the funder will be assessing your ability to comply with the requirements that they have set out, and these are the most common areas where a grant is rejected at a very early stage in the review process.\nIn Module 2, we will actually deal with the specific elements of your proposal that are highly scrutinised during the grant application process. These specific elements of your proposal are tested and assessed for weaknesses and issues and we will cover how the reviewers will use the information that you provide to make a recommendation. This module covers elements like a weak case for support, poor objectives, budgetary issues, lack of external partnerships and critical errors in the approach or methodology. We will also cover poor communication of outcomes and ensuring full alignment to what the funder wants. If you have already completed a grant application and unfortunately received a rejection decision then you will recognise and appreciate that these issues cover some of the most common reasons for why reviewers will support rejection an application.\nIn Module 3, we cover the main issues that are raised in terms of the application team i.e. you and your colleagues or collaborators who are writing and submitting the application. We will cover issues like your track record, how you can impart your own views in the application without it appearing biased, how you can align your grant applications to your expertise and why its important not to stack applicants on your grant proposal. All of these areas fall under issues with the applicants and since the applicants are assessed with an equal weighting to the project or proposal itself, it’s important for the application team to be properly justified and defined.\nIn the final module (Module 4), we cover about conceptual issues in your grant. The grant concept is what you are trying to sell to the funder. The concept is something that is new, something that can actually demonstrate impact or real world change, something that is good value for money and something that can actually be achieved. In this module we cover the common issues in all of these areas so that when you write and review your application, you’ll be able to identify how or what the reviewers will see as negative points.\n\n\nIn summary, this course contains accessible and comprehensive classes which will train you not only to craft an effective application, but will give you a full understanding of where grant writing mistakes and faults can occur, why funders will reject an application because of these mistakes and most importantly, how you can avoid them.",

I will also talk about setting up your database on a computer as well as a mobile phone.\nPart 2 of the program will be all about USING your databases. We will get a bit technical there, as I will look at how to do a mail merge and how to set up and use an automated email system.

How will you say it, and what is the most crucial thing to remember when communicating to your supporters?\nThis program focuses on using a database in the Fundraising and Marketing strategy of a non-profit organisation specifically. I will show you that a database is your most powerful tool. You will learn how to personalise your mass emails and monthly newsletter by merging your database with MS Outlook. We will also look into the details of using an automated email system.

However, you can rebrand your book to make it stand out and increase sales.\nSo, what will you learn from this course?\nWhat are PLR products, and how do you use them to make money?\nThe places to buy the PLR materials.\nHow to choose a company to buy it.\nThe difference between PLR books and books with resell rights.\nHow to rebrand your eBook.\nHow to market your product.\nWhen you read this course, you will learn a lot about selling PLR books and turning them into a business.

      "description": "A rapid evolution of intelligent threats necessitates an organized and proactive counterintelligence approach. On a smaller, more visible scale, one can observe parallels in marketing—where information gathering and techniques to influence behaviour are similar to and sometimes overlapping with those employed in intelligence operations. These same principles are leveraged within defense and security frameworks to manipulate individuals and exploit vulnerabilities. While no one willingly signs up to be treated as an intelligence product, this is a reality many face unknowingly. Through instruments of coercion, adversaries achieve their objectives by targeting individuals based on their sphere of influence and activities. This course aims to equip participants with theoretical and practical knowledge and tools to recognize, mitigate, and counteract such threats effectively.\nThis course is designed for the demands of its participants—you can skip sections and revisit them at your convenience.\nTraditional cybersecurity and Technical Security Countermeasures (TSCM) resources are available in supplemental course offerings and are not represented in detail throughout this course. The course content is based on publicly available information.\nBy demonstrating essential knowledge and achieving a passing result in all course components, participants will obtain a Certificate in Counterintelligence Essentials, or ‘CIECert’.\nYour purchase includes lifetime access to all course materials.",

Several times you don't have the opportunities to sit down with somebody and talk to them you really have to rely on your writing skills to convey the message you need.\nWe have to be able to communicate with the customer, to answer in a way they try to contact us, via email or via chat. Most people communicate verbally, but being able to write is a tough talent to find.\nWhen you are writing in business enviroment you think about how to send a message, but summarizing information so you can move along and get action done.\nOne of the things that people do is a judging based on your grammar. In this course you will have also a complete grammar review to help you write your letters better. It is a fact and if you are not good enough using a proper grammar it will reflect poor organization.\nWe have to think about the tone we want to convey. It is crucial to look at what I want them to understand. You really need to think about the response that you're going to get from the person as they read it. That is the most important because the written word is a lot different than the spoken word because there is no real way that they can see your reactions so what I try to do is write something, read it a few times, maybe put it away for a little while. It is very important and make sure to take a second look.\nLearn how to develop good letters suche as, Thank you letters.\nComplaint letters.\nApology letters.\nOffice memorandum.\nWelcome letters.\nRequest letters.\nAnnouncement letters.\nTermination letters.\n...and more.\nIf you leave somebody with questions it diminishes your credibility.",

Similarly, digilocks are seen everywhere costing anywhere from £30-£250, but are they as secure as the price suggests? How long does it really take to decode them?\n\n\nWe are told the strengths of a product, but we also need to understand the weaknesses to use them properly.\n\n\nThe criminals already know about these techniques - they aren't secret. The public need to understand the techniques to get an idea of who will use them. Lockpicking Lawyer and his ilk make this look so very easy but you'll only understand how easy it is when you come to try it yourself. You may go from thinking Master Lock key boxes are a scourge to understanding there is a place and a correct application for everything.\n\n\nThese are instructional videos and guides, not skills demonstrations, which is what differentiates this course from the YouTube style videos.

However, it's important to note that this is just a median figure, and there is a wide range of bequest sizes. Some bequests can be significantly larger, while others may be much smaller.\n\n\nNot all planned giving donors will be major donors, but all planned gifts are major gifts.\n\n\nIf you feel intimidated by the idea of building out a planned giving program, I'm here to tell you that it can actually be really, really simple. You don't have to be the \"expert\" or know a lot about estate planning or taxes... you just need to give your donors the information they need in a really simple, easy-to-understand way.\n\n\nThat's where this course comes in.\n\n\nPlanned giving, sometimes referred to as legacy giving, is a powerful tool for nonprofits to create a lasting impact. In this course, you'll learn how to develop a basic framework for your planned giving program and how to identify your main planned giving prospects. You'll also discover the different types of planned gifts that anyone can make and the steps to take to begin promoting your program.\n\n\nThis course is designed for nonprofit founders, fundraisers, volunteers, and anyone interested in planned giving. With this course, you'll gain the tools and knowledge to build a foundation for your planned giving program and give your donors what they need to leave a lasting legacy that reflects their values and impact.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll understand the basics of planned giving and know how to lay the groundwork for your own program. You'll receive the language to use on your website and you'll build a brochure for your program in one of the lessons.\n\n\nIt is my goal to help you feel confident as you begin laying the groundwork for your nonprofit's planned giving program.\n\n\nEnroll in Planned Giving 101: Laying the Groundwork for Planned Giving and start building a lasting legacy for your cause or community today.",

      "description": "Welcome to Stress-Free Strategic Grant Readiness, Planning & Management. This unique course is based on a system I used for my employers and clients since 1989, and continues to be improved. It is unique in that it gives you proprietary tools for managing your readiness:\nto win grants\nto receive grant awards\nto report outcomes\nto track every aspect of the proposal preparation and submission process\nto organize and keep current every piece of data that you might need to use in any proposal\nto plan funding for several years in advance\nto choose the right funder, for the right program, at the right time, and in the right sequence\nIf you've ever applied for Funder A's grant for your healthcare program costs only to find that Funder A was the only one who would fund your construction or administration costs, while Funder B would gladly have funded your healthcare program costs, you can appreciate how important it is to plan carefully, especially when future funding will be affected.\nIf you've ever wished you had a way to choose which funder, for which program, in which order and at what time, this is the course for you.\nTHREE COURSES IN ONE\nAs you know, more and more funders are requiring their non-profit applicants be be “GRANT READY.\" When you and your beneficiaries are depending on these funders to keep your programs running, becoming GRANT READY is one of the most important actions you can take. This course includes the full Win More Grants by Becoming Grant Ready course, including the full text and checklist download.\nThe Strategic Planning section of this course is unique and available only as part of THIS video course. As a grant writer, nonprofit, or consultant, you will find this course gives you a complete solution for developing a system of grants management and strategic planning. It includes a series of data management and tracking forms, three funder-selector calculators, and a system to tie them all together into stress-free, grant planning and management system. You'll be so organized you, and your teammates, will actually be able to take your lunch breaks.\nThe full course, CQI/TQM for the Rest of Us is also included along with the downloadable textbook and the PowerPoint slide set to use in training your staff or clients. Along with the quality improvement tools you need to develop specific, measurable criteria and to evaluate the progress of your programs and projects, you'll get a detailed presentation of why CQI is so valuable, how it can improve your entire nonprofit operations, and how to get people to cooperate with any changes you want to implement.\nGRANT MAKERS, you'll find the tools and systems presented in this course useful for evaluating the readiness of your applicants to make the best use of your funds in achieving your goals.\n**********\nStress-Free Strategic Grant Planning and Readiness will provide you a truly stress-free planning and management system, including:\nthe forms and a database, to manage your entire grant funding system\nfunding opportunity calculators that you will use to weigh the fit between your programs' goals and each funder's goals and to help you choose the right funder, for the right program, at the right time, and in the right sequence. This is especially valuable for organizations that have a large number of grant applications and multiple projects going on at any given time.\nincluded is my 1-hour \"Win More Grants by Becoming Grant Ready\" course with its detailed checklist, that you can use, as is or modify, to ensure and maintain your GRANT READY status.\nincluded is my 2-hour quality improvement course, \"CQI/TQM for the Rest of Us\" along with the forms and the presentation slides that you can use to train your staff or clients in developing useful measurable criteria for each of your programs, or for your entire organization, as well. You'll see how we used it to get every employee to participate, and in every aspect of running our hospital district.\nWhat you'll learn in this program is how to develop a strategy for funding all of your projects and programs for the foreseeable future, say five or ten years ahead:\nHow to MAKE YOUR non-profit Grant-Ready - A vitally important aspect of NPO management. Grant Readiness is often overlooked, causing NPOs to lose grant funding\nHow to IMPLEMENT this proven proposal-writing management process\nWHO BELONGS ON YOUR proposal-writing and management teams\nWhat to INCLUDE IN YOUR proposal writing and management policies and procedures\nHow to manage each phase of YOUR proposal-management process\nHow to ESTABLISH CRITERIA for choosing your funding sources\nHow to AVOID SUBMITTING MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS for the same RFP\nHow to DECIDE WHICH RFP to apply for each program or project\nHow to DETERMINE WHEN to apply for each grant you have identified\nHow the tools in the Strategic Planning Toolkit (included) are used to create a system that flows SMOOTHLY AND STRESS-FREE.\nAnd to wrap all of this together, the grant management system provides a sample written procedure for a smooth-flowing process from the moment you begin to choose a funder to the moment you submit the proposal to the funder. I show you, also, how to select members for your grant management team, and for your strategic grant planning team.\nThe system ensures that your grant applications will be error free, thoroughly reviewed, checked for accuracy and completeness and submitted error free and with essentially no stress or last minute crises (conditions most likely to cause errors.)\nI've successfully implemented this system in small and large organizations. It's flexible enough to accommodate the many unique aspects of different nonprofits' management practices.\nIt starts with a review of our robust \"GRANT READY\" checklist. This review will take you section by section through the list of preparations that will set you up to spend you efforts and time on processing your applications and not on constantly checking to be sure you have the minutia in order.\nOnce you know how to make your nonprofit \"GRANT READY\" you'll learn how to use the strategic planning and management tools. These tools provide storage for your most current data, to grab and insert in your proposals and budgets. They also provide the tracking records needed to keep your proposal moving through the writing, review and editing stages. In addition you'll have three different methods of evaluating your programs against funders and RFAs to identify the best fits.\nAt any point you can jump into the CQI/TQM for the Rest of Us course and learn the secrets of developing effective \"specific and measurable criteria\" by which to measure your programs' effectiveness. Or maybe you just want to do an audit with measured outcomes, assess needs, or develop improvement plans for your programs, to find out exactly how well your program is being managed.\nAnd finally, I'll show you how to put them all together in a streamlined system that you'll love for its utter simplicity.\nWhat isn't covered is that it won't teach you how to write a grant proposal.\nFunding, as you know, is not just the result of submitting a qualifying proposal, but of developing relationships and credibility. When your organization is able to show a funder that you've covered all the essentials and are operating at the highest standards, in other words, that you are Grant Ready, you improve your credibility in the eyes of funders. With this system, you can organize your nonprofit in ways that will make your competition wonder what you've got that they don't have.\nNot a bad spot to be in.",

      "description": "Expertise is often treated as a mysterious concept – few can explain it, but you know when someone has it. Dr. Gary Klein, renowned cognitive psychologist and pioneer in the field of naturalistic decision making, has devoted the last 35 years to understanding what makes experts so capable of making timely and accurate assessments.\nIn this course, Dr. Klein introduces the concept of the Cognitive Dimension: the hidden layer of awareness that underpins effective decisions, accurate sensemaking, and increased adaptability. Through a series of real-world examples and practical insights, learners will understand how experts recognize patterns, refine their mental models, and interpret ambiguous or conflicting data. You’ll explore why controlled studies often miss the nuances of expert behavior, how over-reliance on evidence-based data can be misleading, and what it takes to “see the invisible” in complex decision-making tasks. You'll also gain exposure to powerful tools like ShadowBox scenario-based training and the AIQ toolkit, which are designed to help surface and strengthen expert reasoning.  After participating in this course, you will have a much deeper understanding of the skills, strategies, and techniques that experts use to make sense of their instincts.\nThis course is ideal for individuals who want to deepen their cognitive skills, move beyond superficial data interpretations, and learn to navigate uncertainty with greater clarity and confidence. Unlock the thinking that drives expertise—discover the Cognitive Dimension.",

      "description": "Do you want to implement a safety framework to meet (or exceed) general standards, and to ensure the safety of your employees? Would it be helpful for you to implement policies and procedures to expedite recovery and downtime caused by work emergencies? Are you interested in learning the core principles of responding to emergencies to save precious lives at the workplace? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this course is for you!\nWork emergencies can sometimes be inevitable, which is why leaders, managers and stakeholders must work together to build strong procedures and policies to help minimise damage and downtime associated with natural or manmade disasters within the workplace. These emergencies can vary in severity, but under the right conditions, such as during fires, earthquakes or explosions caused by human error, these emergencies have the potential to not only shut down businesses for the short-term but also to take precious lives and cause significant and lingering mental trauma for survivors.\nAccording to a 2024 study conducted as per the UK-based statutory instrument Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations, work-related incidents occurring during 2023 and 2024 resulted in the death of around 138 workers in the UK. This statistic highlights the devastating potential of work emergencies and their profound impact on human life. This course is specifically designed to teach business leaders about the importance of building frameworks for work emergencies and the benefits of having policies, training and procedures to help minimise the impact of these emergencies in the workplace.\nOver a series of short, engaging video lectures, this course equips you with the essential tools to handle workplace emergencies confidently and competently. You will begin by exploring the fundamentals of crisis management, including the different types of emergencies that can affect UK workplaces and how to develop response protocols that are both preventative and adaptive. Next, you will dive into fire safety and evacuation training, learning how to identify fire hazards, implement fire prevention strategies and create legally compliant evacuation plans. You will be guided through the process of performing and documenting regular fire drills, training fire wardens and maintaining safety equipment in alignment with UK fire safety legislation. You will also practise how to lead calm and effective evacuations in high-pressure situations, whether in an office, warehouse or remote site. Building on your crisis preparedness, the course provides hands-on training in first aid at work. You will learn how to administer initial treatment for a wide range of injuries and medical conditions, including cuts, burns, cardiac arrest and allergic reactions. With guidance aligned to Health and Safety Executive requirements, you will understand how to assess a casualty, manage incidents until emergency services arrive and ensure that your workplace is always ready to meet first aid obligations.\nYou will then learn how to prepare for natural disasters, which, although less frequent in the UK, are becoming increasingly relevant due to climate change. From flood readiness to severe weather protocols, you will examine how to identify physical vulnerabilities, safeguard employees and ensure continuity of operations. You will explore how to adapt preparedness plans to your specific site and sector, ensuring a tailored approach that reflects both local risks and national guidelines. Finally, you will master the principles of effective communication during emergencies. This includes how to craft clear and timely messages that avoid panic while promoting action and how to coordinate across teams using both digital and in-person channels. You will also discover strategies to maintain two-way communication that fosters trust, as well as how to update stakeholders and authorities during rapidly changing events.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to manage multiple types of crises with composure, communicate with clarity and ensure your workplace remains compliant, prepared and resilient. Enrol now to empower yourself and your team with the skills and confidence to respond to emergencies with professionalism and care.",

In recent years we’ve dealt with recessions, a pandemic, the “great resignation,” and more.\nIn this course, nonprofit expert, Ken Goldstein, shares several case studies from his experiences of managing through crises as a consultant and interim executive director. You will learn about successful mergers, and merger negotiations that were ended without an agreement. You will learn about organizations that seemed all but doomed, and how they rebuilt to be stronger than ever. And you will hear about an organization that went into bankruptcy, and what factors led to that fateful decision.\nKen will also share several of the tools that he’s used in these situations, and with other consulting clients, for program evaluation and organizational assessment. These tools will help you determine if there are programs you need to cut or transform, and what strengths you can build on. You will also learn about mergers, and other types of cooperation and partnerships, the factors to look for in a good partner, and cautions to be wary of during negotiations.\nWhether you are the leader of an organization facing a crisis, or considering a merger, or whether your organization is thriving and you just want to build your toolbox with additional knowledge, this fast-paced course will give you insight and ideas that you can use in assuring your nonprofit’s success.",

Over the duration of the course, participants will explore the critical aspects of surety bonds, including their purposes, the parties involved, and the specific roles these bonds play in various industries.\nParticipants will begin by understanding the fundamental differences between surety bonds and traditional insurance, shedding light on surety's unique nature as a credit relationship rather than a risk transfer mechanism. The course will cover key legislation that impacts the surety industry, such as the Miller Act, which mandates surety bonds for federal construction projects, ensuring a robust legal comprehension that is crucial for practice in the field.\nThe course structure includes detailed examinations of the various types of surety bonds—ranging from bid bonds to performance and payment bonds. Each type is discussed in context, with scenarios that illustrate their applications and the consequences of bond claims. Moreover, learners will engage with the process of underwriting, learning what makes a viable surety bond candidate and the financial assessments crucial to the process.\nInteractive elements such as case studies, real-world scenarios, and quizzes are integrated throughout the course to reinforce learning and application of knowledge. Upon completion, participants will not only gain a certificate but will possess the practical skills and understanding necessary to effectively manage and advise on surety bonds in their professional roles. This course is an essential stepping stone for anyone looking to specialize in this area of risk management and insurance.",

O curso vai começar falando sobre a gestão dos processos (o que é um processo, por que é necessário mapear os processos, quais são os processos mais críticos para empresa), depois vamos mostrar as diferenças entre processos principais e subprocessos, bem como os diferentes tipos de processos que você encontra na empresa como processos primários, de suporte, gerencial e latente, e como devemos mapear cada um desses. Na sequência, mostro quais são as etapas do mapeamento de processos e quais são as primeiras informações que devemos ter como objetivo e visão da empresa em relação ao mapeamento, estrutura atual... depois, vamos definir quais são os processos da empresa que serão mapeados, principalmente aqueles que impactam no produto ou serviço final, vamos apresentar formulários para que o participante do curso tenha uma ideia de como fazer na prática. Uma vez que os processos são determinados, é a vez de priorizar quem será mapeado primeiro e nesse caso, vou apresentar duas técnicas de priorização, a matriz de impacto e severidade e a análise via KPIs. Então, é a vez de planejarmos o mapeamento, você terá a chance de fazer comigo um cronograma e conhecer as ténicas de mapeamento. Tem mais, uma vez planejado, vou te ensinar a executar o mapeamento, o que dizer, o que anotar, o que fazer... pronto, agora que temos os dados do mapeamento, vamos analisar o resultado (AS-IS) e posteriormente fazer as melhorias (TO-BE).

This course is designed for busy working mothers who are tired of doing it all and are ready to step up as a leader at home and at work.\nWhat’s the difference between a burnt-out working mom and a powerhouse executive? Not what you think. It’s not about doing more—it’s about being audacious enough to do less.\nWhen her husband suggested having a third child during an overwhelmingly stressful week of juggling toddlers and corporate life, Corinne Cavanaugh hit her breaking point. Drawing from her experience as a marketing executive and mother of three, in this course Corinne reveals how she transformed from drowning in perfectionism to thriving through radical delegation at home and audacious time management at work. Through research-backed strategies and personal insights, students will learn Corinne's Audacious Mother Leader Framework to create success at work and sanity at home.\nAttendees will leave with a proven framework for turning motherhood into a leadership advantage, equipped with actionable strategies for defending their time, delegating radically, and leading confidently. With only 28% of C-suite positions held by women, this course empowers mothers to recognize their unique leadership capabilities without sacrificing their families — they just need to be audacious enough to rewrite the rules.",

We explore the debate around the effectiveness of morality and ethics, reinforced by societal shame if breached. We then compare this to models relying on formal rules and laws, with breaches punished financially or physically. Confucian China preferred the former approach, though the Imperial Court dabbled in the latter at times in its history.\nWith a solid footing in the Imperial period, we explore the impact of European arrivals, in particular the so-called \"century of shame.\" We then move forward to modern China, examining the civil war period and the victory of the Communists. We then trace the evolution of communism in China, investigating periods of extreme control including over thought, expression, and life itself.\nFinally, we look at China's shift to a market economy and consider how that works within a Communist/socialist framework. China's joining of the World Trade Organization (WTO) was a game-changer for international trade, with huge repercussions for China and the rest of the world. Now the entire international trade legal order is being called into question- so where does that leave China ... and all other nations?\nThe \"peaceful rise\" of China is perhaps the most important geopolitical development of the 21st century.",

      "description": "Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of business, fundamentally changing how you operate your business and also gives values to your cherished customers. It can be said that its a cultural change that requires organizations to continually challenges the status quo, experiment and be prepared to received any outcome. A digital initiative can contain many different aspects. At one extreme, it can involve reinventing all facet of the organization, including supply chain, workflows, employee skill set, the product it self, how customers interact with the organization, and organization structure. More limited initiative can involve adopting digital technology to improve a specific business process, or service, reduce costs, or solve a specific business problem.\nBusiness model transformation is key, this type of transformation changes business models to adapt them to the new digital environment. This requires careful consideration of how the core business of the industry operates. A successful change can disrupt an entire industry- like Netflix did for home videos and Amazon for retail. Digital transformation has a cultural component, which is critical to the success of any digital transformation initiative. For example many organizations, this transition can be challenging. Digital transformation must start with education for existing staff, to ensure everyone understands the potential of new technology for improving the business, forging internal collaboration, and creating new methods for engaging customers. There are multiple common barriers that digital transformation initiatives, projects and strategies face. One of the main barriers is change management because changes in processes may face active resistance from workers. Related to change management is the miscommunication between workers which can lead to integration due to a too optimistic view of the process. Companies may have legal systems in place which can lead to integration difficulties with new systems.",

However, when it comes to writing essays, assignments, dissertations and academic papers; there are a lot of very useful tools that should be used, but often don't get used. This could be because the student doesn't know how to use the tools, or sometimes it's because the student doesn't know they exist.\nThis course provides the student with an extensive range of Word tools and formatting options that will not only save a huge amount of time, but will also give documents a professional 'polished' look, ready for submission.  On completion of the course, students will be able to create documents that include Table of Contents, Indexes, Citations and Bibliographies, and much more.\nThe course is divided into 6 sections and a total of 27 lectures. Each lecture will 'walk' the student through the content by way of a demonstration video (including captions and transcript) and also a downloadable document.  In total there is just over 1½ hours of video learning. The average run-time for each video is 3½ minutes, so students should find they can comfortably cover the lectures in short bursts.  Before starting a lecture, students should download the Resources  'Information' document that accompanies the video and also provides useful reminder tips and shortcuts. Students can also download the Word document demonstrated in the video, so that they can have a go by following the video instructions.\nAt the end of each section there is a short multiple-choice quiz. If the student gives the incorrect answer for any question, they will be directed to the video that contains the answer.\nStudents are encouraged to provide any comments, questions or suggestions relating to the course.  Where appropriate the course instructor will provide additional content.",

It helps filter spam in your email, powers customer support chatbots, and even suggests who to connect with on professional networks. Our company is embracing AI to remain competitive and innovative, but with that comes a shared responsibility.\nThis isn't just an internal guideline; it's a global mandate. Regulations like the EU AI Act - Article 4, the U.S. Executive Orders, and India’s DPDP Act are shaping how businesses must use this technology. To stay compliant and protect our company's integrity, every one of us must understand what's safe, what's risky, and what's prohibited when using AI.\nEvery employee is a user of AI, and misusing it—even by accident—can have serious consequences.\nAccidentally pasting sensitive client data into a public AI tool could lead to a major data breach.\nUsing AI without proper oversight can introduce bias into our work, harming our reputation and fairness.\nFailing to comply with regulations could expose our company to significant legal and financial risks.\nOn the other hand, employees who understand how to use AI responsibly and smartly will gain a huge advantage. You can save hours on routine tasks, improve accuracy in your work, and unlock new ideas and innovations.This course is designed to equip you with the knowledge to be both productive and compliant, turning a potential risk into a powerful opportunity.\nThis course is structured to build your knowledge from the ground up.\nModules 1–5 will build your foundational knowledge. We’ll explore what AI is, identify common risks, and review key global laws and our internal policies.\nModules 6–7 will focus on practical application. This is where we get hands-on with effective and responsible ways to collaborate with AI tools.\nModule 8 is our capstone. You'll get to apply everything you've learned through real-world scenarios and a final quiz to test your mastery.\nCan’t wait to see you inside the course!",

This course will be fast pace & I'll be using advance terms & concepts that you will only understand if you've taken the Beginner, Intermediate course or you are generally an advanced student already.\nIn this course I will teach you how to create the Hell Scene. Keep in mind this course is targeted for advanced users in Maya, Zbrush, Unity & Photoshop.

Its best to have fundamental understanding first before shortcuting your way through everything so at least you understand the process & you don't miss out on basics.\n\n\nSo this is everything that you have learned so far from the beginner & intermediate course:\nOrganizing & Structured Planning\nModel Efficiently in Maya 2018 & Zbrush 4r7 & 4r8\nColor Theory & Color Schemes\nCreate Gradient Textures\nImport/Export\nSet Up Scene In Unity\nLighting Scenes In Unity\nUnity Particle Effects\n__________________________\nNew modeling techniques (Let's up the complexity!)\nWe will add a Shader into the scene\nWe will apply & try out different Color Schemes in Unity\nNew VFXs\nBaking Lights in Unity\nRendering in Cinemachine\nBONUS: Animations\nIf you came from those two courses, this course will be the easiest thing drop upon you. It's the same workflow & implementation. The only difference is we're wrapping everything up so we can sell it on any platform. Also we are creating the Hell Scene from scratch just like the other courses, we start from 0. We will combine all 3 scenes when the hell scene is done, clean up everything inside unity, documentation, technicalities etc ~\nThis is the last installment from the Epic Low Poly Scenes course series.

      "description": "A self-paced, 6-course masterclass that cuts through the noise, guiding you through the real-world game development journey—asking the right questions at every stage, from concept to creation, launch, and scaling a studio that attracts investors.\nThis course comes packed with Pro Toolkits  (more learning materials) and XP Quests (assignments) designed to level your skills. Each module is a thinking, self-assessment of one's business with real-world strategies that include interactive elements, case studies, tools and templates, videos, real-world case studies, and hands-on challenges to help you create blockbuster games that captivate players and take your studio to the next level with investors.\nWelcome:\n1. Module: Validate Your Game and Studio Place in the Gaming Industry For Success\nBuilding your studio's foundation – creating a strong identity\nDEFINE YOUR VISION AND BRING GAMES TO LIFE\nWhy: A new game studio must define and uphold its core mission to differentiate itself. This question ensures that every decision—game mechanics, marketing, monetization—reinforces the studio's identity.\nPractical Use:\nA newly formed studio that wants to specialize in a genre, platform, or monetization strategy ﻿might consider identifying the Purpose of Gameplay and its audience of users. Before doing so, they must ask:\nDoes integrating features or game mechanics enhance our storytelling experience, or is it just a gimmick?\nDoes this align with our vision of immersive role-playing games?\nLesson: A strong brand identity keeps the studio from pursuing trends that dilute its purpose.\nEvery successful game studio begins with a visionary spark of creativity that inspires a team to bring a unique game to life. But creativity alone doesn't guarantee success. In an increasingly competitive game industry, which generated over $220 billion in revenue in 2023, a strong foundation built on business acumen, strategic planning, and market awareness is essential for thriving.\n\n\n2. Module: Game Business Entrepreneurship\nGame Studio Growth Blueprint: From Startup to Scale\n\n\nWhy: Many early-stage studios fail because they don't focus on the correct problems at the right time. This module teaches founders to use structured frameworks—from MVP testing to platform selection—to validate ideas before investing resources.\nPractical Use:\nA team decides to develop a multiplayer survival game but asks:\nShould we focus on adding more weapons first, or do players care more about smoother matchmaking?\nShould we optimize our graphics engine now or test the game loop first?\nLesson: Successful studios focus on the proper milestones—prioritizing game viability, engagement, and retention over non-essential polish early on.\nBy the end, participants will have actionable strategies for aligning development with business strategies, building financially sound studios, and positioning projects for success in the competitive gaming landscape.\n\n\n3. Module: Finance and Business Strategy\nMastering Budgets and Financials – Fueling Sustainable Growth\nWhy: Financial mistakes can kill a studio before its first game launches. This question ensures developers consult investors, accountants, and publishers before making significant financial commitments.\nPractical Use:\nBefore committing to self-publishing, a studio should ask:\nHave we spoken to publishers to compare revenue-sharing deals?\nHave we consulted investors on our burn rate and runway?\nWhat do successful studios say about managing cash flow in early development?\nLesson: Seeking expert financial advice early prevents costly mistakes like over-hiring, underfunding, or overextending on unnecessary features.\n\n\nWhat you will take away is mastering budgets and financials as the backbone of any successful game studio. Without a well-structured financial plan, even the most innovative and well-designed games can fail due to poor resource management, funding shortages, or unexpected costs. This module ensures that your studio has the financial stability and strategic foresight to sustain long-term growth while navigating the unpredictable nature of game development.\n\n\n4. Module: Marketing and Growth Strategies\nMarketing Mastery – Launch Strategies That Go Viral\nWhy: Financial mistakes can kill a studio before its first game launches. This question ensures developers consult investors, accountants, and publishers before making significant financial commitments.\nPractical Use:\nBefore committing to self-publishing, a studio should ask:\nHave we spoken to publishers to compare revenue-sharing deals?\nHave we consulted investors on our burn rate and runway?\nWhat do successful studios say about managing cash flow in early development?\nLesson: Seeking expert financial advice early prevents costly mistakes like over-hiring, underfunding, or overextending on unnecessary features.\nThis pivotal module explores the essential strategies for launching your game and turning it into a viral sensation. In today's crowded gaming market, simply creating a great game isn't enough—you need to know how to promote it effectively, reach the right audience, and maintain long-term momentum. This module provides the proven tools and techniques to elevate your game's visibility and ensure it stands out in a competitive market.\n\n\n5. Module: Business Expansion and Operations\nScaling for Success – Expanding Your Studio's Reach and Capabilities\nWhy: Scaling a studio requires constant iteration. Many games launch with too many features, overwhelming players, or lack critical elements that boost engagement. This question forces teams to focus on high-impact improvements.\nPractical Use:\nA live-service game struggling with player retention asks:\nWould simplifying crafting make the experience more engaging?\nShould we remove complex UI elements that confuse new players?\nWould adding a social feature like guilds increase daily logins?\nLesson: The most successful studios listen to players and iterate on what truly enhances engagement and retention.\nIn this critical module, we'll explore how to expand your game studio's reach and scale its capabilities to meet the demands of today's market and set the stage for long-term success. Building scalable systems, optimizing operations, and implementing leadership strategies that can handle more extensive projects, bigger teams, and increased complexity are essential as your studio grows.\n\n\n6. Module: Leadership and Future Strategy\nStrategic vision – creating value and preparing for the future\nWhy: Many studios start strong but fail to scale. This question is posed throughout the business stages and ensures long-term planning for new technologies, content pipelines, and business models.\nPractical Use:\nA studio expanding to live-service games asks:\nCan we sustain regular content updates without crunch?\nAre we building scalable tech that won't need a costly overhaul in a year?\nWill our monetization model hold up as our player base grows?\nLesson: Strategic foresight ensures a game studio remains competitive, adaptable, and financially viable long-term.\nWelcome to Module 6! This forward-thinking module delves into the importance of creating a strategic vision that positions your game studio for long-term success and helps future-proof your business in an ever-evolving industry. As technology advances, it's crucial to leverage emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, and VR/AR to drive innovation, enhance gameplay, and create new revenue streams.\nConclusion:\nThank You for Taking the First Step Toward Building Your Blockbuster Game Empire\nFirst, thank you for taking this vital step in securing your place in the gaming industry. Putting your creativity on the line for player acceptance takes persistence, vision, and courage. By completing this course, you've gained the foundational business strategies that transform a game into a blockbuster tentpole franchise with long-term success for your studio empire.",

      "description": "Agritourism continues to be an opportunity to increase income for some farmers and agribusinesses around the nation. Some producer organizations, state and federal government agencies, university Extension programs, state tourism offices, professional consultants, and the media are recognizing agritourism as an industry and devoting resources to address it . One estimate suggests approximately 20 million children under the age of 16 also visited farms during the year, making the total number of visitors to farms approximately 82 million.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that more than 62 million people aged 16 years and older visited farms during a one-year period in 2000 and 2001. This does not count the numerous children and youth under 16 years of age who visited farms during this time period.\nThe USDA also investigated the reasons people made trips to farms. Responses included:\nØ Enjoy the rural scenery\nØ Learning where food comes from\nØ Visit family or friends.\nØ Watch or participate in farm activities\nØ Purchase agricultural products.\nØ Pick fruit or produce.\nØ Hunt or fish\nØ Spend a night\nIn Italy, an agritourism law was passed in 1985 to regulate and encourage Italian farm stays. There are three types of agriturismo classifications in Italy: one that provides light meals or self-service snacks; one that offers full-service meals; and one that provides farm holidays that include meals, housing, and other activities. In Italy, agriturismo farmers are also allowed to sell value-added farm products including locally produced wines, olive oils, pasta, prepared meats, cheeses, jellies and jams, honey, baked goods, and crafts.\nEstimates place today’s number of agriturismo locations in Italy between 9,000 and 20,000, and their success has led many other European Union countries to enact similar national policies to help increase farm income and create jobs in rural communities.",

Does the phrase CAPACITY TO SELECT come to mind?\nCapacity to attract the visitors that are most beneficial for your business and destination.\nCapacity to attract international or domestic tourism in profitable and sustainable ways.\nCapacity to use tourism as an effective means for business and development success.\nCapacity to understand and harness the process of attracting visitors.\nCapacity to put key tools and strategies into practice.\n\n\nUltimately, building that capacity in you is what this course is all about.\nI want to show you how all these ideas come together through a simple, yet powerful, method that anyone can apply. It's a wonderful thing to help build these types of capacities by teaching others how years of experience and top science-backed knowledge come together to improve their own lives through tourism.\n\n\nYou want the capacity to select the type of visitors you desire, and you're either:\nA professional or executive looking to boost your career by providing more value to your organization.\nAn individual who wants to start in the tourism sector with a strong edge in her or his favor.\nA student who wishes to acquire a skill that will stand out in the job market.\nAn entrepreneur who wishes to boost or start his or her own business.\nA tour agency or service provider struggling to increase sales.\nA community organization that wants to improve its results.\nA public body that wants to attract visitors effectively.\nI can help you, no matter what situation you're in!\n\n\nTHIS COURSE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH:\nA refreshed perspective about what tourism really is and what it is for.\nUnderstanding of why destinations don’t actually attract tourism.\nKnowledge about the determinants to attract tourism\nAn in-depth understanding of the 2 top determinants to attract the visitors you want.\nA way to determine or revisit the type of visitors you want to attract.\nThe 9 steps to understand in the process of attracting tourism.\nThe tool to perform your own analysis to attract the visitors you want.\nThe ability to establish an action plan and monitor its performance.\nSolid tools and concepts backed by experience and science to enhance your capacities.\n\n\nAlong with the video content of the course, there is a lot of extra value for you.\nEXTRAS:\nThe key tool in editable format to conduct your analysis and monitoring;\nDownloadable resources and guides;\nAn audio version of the course to listen on the go;\nAssignments that make you productive while taking the course;\nSummaries and full scientific articles backing up the key content;\nAn instructor who truly cares about your success.\n\n\nI SHARE ALL MY SECRETS IN THIS COURSE.\nThese are techniques and lessons that I have synthesized from over +20 years as an international tourism expert, with a PhD on how to enhance capacities to access tourism markets, in addition to my experience in leading roles in destination and product development, marketing, technology transfer, capacity building, research, data analysis, strategy, education, and sustainability.\n\n\nTHERE WILL NEVER BE A BETTER TIME TO BEGIN IN TOURISM THAN NOW.\nThe key thing to know before starting is that you don't need anything to get started.\nYou don't need a market yet.\nYou don't need to know what tourism is.\nYou don't need to know how to sell tourism.\nYou just need to be persistent. You just need to believe in yourself.\nYou just need to keep your eye on the goal, whatever that may be: increase sales, improve your target segment, start your enterprise, boost your career, contribute to your community's development, etc.\nBut if you already have experience in all that, this course will help you refine and boost your current efforts to the next level!\n\n\nWHY AM I DOING THIS?\nOnline learning has great potential to change people's lives more than ever, and it will only grow. And, likewise, tourism is one of the most powerful means for individuals and communities to prosper and improve their quality of life.\nThroughout my professional career, I have had the opportunity to learn about and visit the most amazing examples of the power of tourism when applied correctly, which has made me grow professionally but, above all, personally.\nNow I want to give back and spread the word!\nIn 2000, I started working with people and destinations on how to attract the kind of tourism they wanted. Since then, I have researched, tested, and reflected on what works to make tourism have a real positive impact on people's lives.\nA lot has changed since 2000. I've spoken with and interviewed hundreds of people, performed tens of roles, and studied countless cases to learn what they're doing to achieve their goals.\nI have conceived this course as a condensed, yet very practical, method of transferring my findings in the form of creating new capabilities in people like you.\nSo, consider this course as a channel through which I give amazing, high-quality, and valuable training. Tourism is, and will continue to be the most powerful means for individuals and communities to prosper.\nThat's why I created this course: to walk with you through the entire process.\nWith our 30-day 100% money-back guarantee, there's no reason to hesitate.\n\n\nI'll give you 2 more reasons why you should enroll right this second:\n1. The types of tools and knowledge I will provide are usually accessible only to organizations that pay tens of thousands of dollars to international consultants, just to show them the techniques I share with you in a very simple and practical way. There are hundreds of gold nuggets to choose from, making this course the best investment in your own education and future success.\n2. While today is still the best day you can get started with enhancing your capacities to attract the tourism you want, it will get harder as the markets get more and more competitive. You want to start as soon as you can (like today) to take advantage of the growing tourism trend. Instead of struggling and trying to do everything yourself, just learn from someone who has already figured out what works.\n\n\nI CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR SUCCESS\nAmong other takeaways, I point out to you what the key determinants are that you can start improving right now to enhance your capacity to attract tourism!\n\nSee you inside!\nSantiago.",

It’s part art and part science; it’s part mechanical and part intuitive. With a delicate blend of both, you can successfully navigate the market and make a solid income, full time or part time.\nIt's not easy, but it can be simplified. And it's closer to your grasp than you think.\nTrading is a performance activity. It's hard if you consider everything, but it's doable because you have the ability to clearly identify something that works and something the clicks with your personality. You can then practice and get very good. If you are terrible at 99% of what's out there but are very good at just one thing, you can make a solid living.\nThis is a foundations course. Underlying theory is taught - the rules are the same as with business, sports and gambling. A discussion follows about where alpha comes from – trading is not a numbers game.

      "description": "ISO 37001: Strengthening Anti-Bribery Management Systems\nISO 37001 is an internationally recognized standard designed to help organizations implement and maintain an Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS). It provides a structured approach to identifying, preventing, detecting, and responding to bribery risks in both public and private sector organizations. The standard covers key elements such as leadership commitment, risk assessment, due diligence, training, and continuous monitoring. By adopting ISO 37001, businesses can establish a culture of integrity and compliance, ensuring that their operations align with anti-bribery laws and ethical best practices. Certification to this standard serves as a strong defense against corruption, helping organizations demonstrate their commitment to ethical business conduct.\nThe Impact of Bribery on Businesses\nBribery is a major challenge that erodes trust, distorts markets, and increases business risks. When organizations engage in or tolerate bribery, they expose themselves to legal penalties, reputational damage, and financial losses. Many countries have strict anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act, which impose severe consequences on companies and individuals involved in corrupt practices. Implementing robust anti-bribery policies, supported by ISO 37001, helps businesses prevent unethical transactions, ensuring compliance with legal frameworks while fostering fair competition and sustainable growth.\nBuilding an Anti-Corruption Culture in Businesses\nA strong anti-corruption culture is critical for businesses seeking long-term success and credibility. This requires clear policies, employee training, ethical leadership, and transparent processes to prevent corrupt practices at all levels of the organization. Encouraging whistleblowing mechanisms, conducting thorough due diligence on third parties, and continuously assessing bribery risks are essential strategies for maintaining integrity. Organizations that prioritize anti-corruption measures not only reduce financial and legal risks but also enhance their reputation and gain the trust of customers, investors, and regulatory authorities. In today's global business environment, ethical governance and compliance with standards like ISO 37001 are key differentiators for responsible and sustainable enterprises.",

They are majestic, non-aggressive and awe-inspiring and mark one of the last frontiers of experience on our planet.\nThey are also threatened and endangered and need carful protection. Thus most countries of the world have laws and regulations as to what is allowed and no allowed.\n\n\nIf you have a passion for the sea, enjoy marine creatures and are also involved in a commercial whale or dolphin watching business, this course is a must. I try to give an over-sight as to what is important, and what is correct in order to conserve the marine environment, protect the species and to also give tourists an awesome as well as a learning experience.\n\n\nThe course is not only about absorbing facts and  knowledge - I try to impart some broad knowledge and, especially a better understanding of the environment in which you will be working - in other words the entire planet! Cetaceans are not limited to specific areas, and freely roam the oceans looking for food, habitats and places to socialize and reproduce.\nThey are highly intelligent and harmless creatures that are becoming more important to us again, after we spent numerous past decades exploiting them. Watch each lecture several times to get a feel for the subject matter, so that you may manipulate it to apply for your particular area of operation. Every whale and dolphin watching excursion, as well as each area of operation is different, and there is strictly no right or wrong way to do things.",

      "description": "Hiring is hard. By most accounts, making a hiring decision is a 50-50 situation for employers. As a job seeker, this can be heartbreaking to hear. But rather than focus on what could be construed as negative, this course explores the opportunities for job seekers.\nWhile How to Write a Résumé focuses on career chronicling content, it also shows job seekers a different way of approaching the job hunting process and how to present themselves to employers. This course is for job seekers who are stuck on deciding what to include (and exclude) on a resume. It’s for job seekers who haven’t been in the job market for a while and need an update on what’s what. It is about positioning yourself in the most effective way possible so that hiring managers and recruiters know right away that they should consider you for the opportunity in question.\nMy goal is not to help you find your dream job. My goal is to help you understand the forces that influence hiring processes in modern times, and how you can best present yourself as a working professional to hiring managers and recruiters. I offer a point of view, informed by ten years of human resources and recruiting experience, that focuses on job seekers’ individual strengths and experiences while educating them on the markets they are working within. Job seekers should focus on what they can control. Put simply, it’s their professional narrative. Take this course and learn how to write yours.",

After spending years at Etrade and Bank of America, it was clear what the public is missing and how they are misguided by wall street marketing. This course will bridge that gap to start the first step in the right direction. Through the Law of Vibration, every stock in the market moves in its own distinctive sphere of activity, as to intensity, volume, and direction; all the essential qualities of its evolution are characterized in its own rate of vibration. Stocks like atoms are really centers of energies, therefore they are controlled, mathematically. Although the Law Of Vibration comprises a number of elements, the time factor is the most important. The price movement of a stock or commodity unfolds in a coherent way. This is because stocks and commodities are essentially centers of energies and these energies (or vibrations) are controlled mathematically. When the pattern is complete, it may suggest that the price is likely to find support or resistance at one of the Fibonacci levels calculated based on the price level of point D. Note that the Fibonacci levels are only displayed for the last Fibonacci pattern on the chart. Markets demonstrate repetitive patterns where prices oscillate between one set of price ratios and another making price projections possible. Market trends can be defined by geometric relationships as they exhibit harmonic relationships between the price and time swings. Many investors/traders use cycles and harmonic relationships to project future swing price/times. These harmonic price movements produce symmetric rallies and decline to give traders an advantage to determine the key turning points. Symmetry is visible in all markets and in all time frames.",

      "description": "最強の学問と言われる統計学。この統計学を手軽に活用するためのツールがExcelです。Excelに実装されているアドインのExcelデータ分析ツールを使って、医療、教育、経済、人材育成、防災など、あらゆる分野のデータを解析して今まで見えなかったものを見ましょう。広範囲な分野に応用の利くツールの操作方法を、このコースで身につけましょう。\n前半３回が理論編で、有意、標本誤差、ベイズ推定を解説します。「有意」は、一般的な用語としても使用されますが、統計学で使われる場合には、その裏にサンプルの存在がありました。かつてテレビで放映された、にぎり寿司を人間（板前さん）がつくった場合と機械（寿司ロボット）がつくった場合でどちらが美味しく感じられるかの勝負を題材に、「有意に美味しい」とは10番勝負だったら何回勝つ必要があるかを検証します。また、標本誤差について知ることは、マスコミなどが調査公表する世論調査などの数字を冷静に受け止めることにつながります。どのくらいのサンプル数があれば、標本誤差を±2.5以内にすることができるのか、などの解説を行います。是非、惑わされない知識を身につけていただければと思います。そしてベイズ推定では、がん検診やＰＣＲ検査を題材に、意外性のある興味深い分析方法を提示します。\n\n\n中盤３回はスモールデータツール編で、Z検定やｔ検定など、平均に有意な差があるか検定する方法を解説します。Z検定では、実際に受講者に出題したハワイの人口当てクイズのデータをもとに、分析を進めます。ｔ検定には、標本が一対の場合のｔ検定と、そうでない場合のあらかじめF検定をした結果に応じて行われるｔ検定の分析がありますのでそれらの道筋を整理して解説します。標本が一対のｔ検定は、かつて実施したExcel操作研修の効果測定データを使って検定し、一対でない方のｔ検定は、2019年にリアル研修で行った、割り箸を横に咥えると世の中が面白く感じられるか否かを試した実験で得られたデータを使います。\n\n\n後半３回はビッグデータツール編で、単回帰分析、ＣＳ分析（相関分析）、重回帰分析を解説します。ここで御紹介する回帰分析は、ＡＩを実現している要素のひとつである機械学習に使われます。単回帰分析では、スポーツ庁公表の高齢者歩行データを使った未来予測を行います。ＣＳ分析（相関分析）では、若手職員に実際にアンケート調査を行って得られたデータを使い、若手のやる気を引き出す手法を考察します。非常に応用度の高い分析手法です。重回帰分析では、面接官が途中で退席してしまう場合に、残りの面接官の採点で、退席した面接官が下したであろう評価を推測するＡＩ面接官を作成してみます。\nすべてが、身近なデータを使っています。講師がかつて行ったExcel操作研修受講生の上達度データ、若手職員のやる気アンケート、プライミング効果やアンカリング効果を試す簡易な実験結果のデータは実際に得られたものです。また、架空ではありますが、実際のデータを参考に作成したオリジナル面接試験データなど、すべてが興味深い題材をもとに解説しますので、統計学を学ぶ楽しさを感じていただき、統計学やExcelデータ分析が好きになっていただけると思います。\n2021年6月：このコースのすべての動画で、字幕をご利用いただけるようになりました。",

      "description": "Have you ever wondered how to structure an initial meeting with a donor, especially with someone who is - or may become - a donor to your organization?\n\n\nFundraising is both a science and an art... but when it comes down to it, raising funds from individuals starts by getting to know them and developing a relationship - one that is centered around your mission and their philanthropic interests.\n\n\nIn this training, you will learn how to structure your first meeting with a donor and the questions to ask to help you learn more about your donors' philanthropy and personal story about why they support your mission.\n\n\nNot only that, you'll learn that these meetings don't need to be intimidating (though it's OK to feel intimidated). They can be fun and make for an incredibly rewarding conversation and visit with your donors.\n\n\nAnother incredibly useful process that you will learn in this training is called, “Moves Management,” a framework for your major gifts initiatives. Moves Management is a simple process that will help you track the status of your individual donor relationships – from identifying who may be your best prospects for a major gift, to asking them to give, to receiving the gift – every step of the way.\n\n\nThis training goes into the \"discovery and qualification\" stages. You will learn how to answer the question, \"Could this person become a major donor?\" with the use of a few simple tools.\n\n\nAnd what’s even better is that the more you begin to use the process you will learn in this course, the easier it will become. The first few times you have an initial meeting with a donor may be the most intimidating as you’re laying the groundwork and are learning a LOT… but after you've met with one, two, three, and more? You’ll begin to get excited for these meetings and feel the structure flow with ease…\\\n\n\nI'm so excited to jump into Major Gift Fundraising 101: The First Donor Meeting with you!",

      "description": "Why Study Economics? Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the significant world's problems. Today prepares you to be a good citizen and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.\nMicroeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic perspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries. The macroeconomic perspective looks at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living, unemployment, and inflation. Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary policy and fiscal policy.\nCourse Descriptor: An introduction to the economic principles of employment, money, and growth. This course will teach students about significant macroeconomic measures and policies. Students will learn how measures of unemployment, inflation, national income, inequality, and wealth shape policy. We also focus on achieving economic growth and sustainability through the effective functioning of the financial system, monetary and fiscal policies, and international trade policies.\nLearning Objectives: Students will develop an understanding and basic proficiency in the theory and application of macroeconomic concepts. The text uses conversational language and ample illustrations to explore economic theories and provides many examples using fictional and real-world applications. We will explore recent developments and provide a more profound background on diverse contributors and their impacts on economic thought and analysis.",

I have tried to cover the aspects of ROI Calculations, Net Metering mechanism, import-export billing system, financial models, their comparative, monitoring system of the solar plants and finally cleaning needs of the solar plants.  Net Metering, Different types of Installations, Monitoring etc.\nSome of these aspects like Net metering, import-export billing and monitoring are generally missed in the other courses. I understand how difficult it is sometimes to explain the technical aspects, therefore I have tried to take the help of analogies and simple to relate examples and calculations for developing an easier understanding of the complex technicalities.\nBeing working as a Solar Energy consultant and executed approximately 50 projects with an aggregated capacity of 4000 kWp or 4 MWp, I have been able to gain useful experience and insights. I have tried to pour all my experience into this course, hope this would be valuable.\nExamples from the industrial experience coupled with tips and thumb rules, average calculation formulae etc would really equip the viewer to gain a great command and grip. After, taking this course, a very detailed understanding of all the fundamentals involving Technicals, financial, execution, would help in building up the required confidence for taking up Solar projects or assignments in this field.\nBe ready to cover tons of topics in the Solar field to charge yourself for your Solar expertise. We will be covering topics such as-\nhow to calculate the Savings and ROI period of your solar plant with easy to understand examples.\nHow to choose the best financial model for your solar plant, Comparative of different financial models.\nUnderstand the net metering and calculate the bills from import and export readings.\nRole of monitoring and cleaning in increasing the output of the Solar Plant.\nThis course has been designed for: anyone who wants to explore the ins and outs of Solar PV Energy. The course has been designed in such a way that it is suitable for beginners and some of the detailed calculations and concepts would benefit the advanced learners as well. I am sure, it will also prove awesome for experienced Solar Professionals who want to enhance their skills and increment knowledge as some of the concepts presented here are not shared in other equivalent courses.\nYou would see them once you go through the course. And finally, if you are looking to enhance your knowledge in a comprehensive manner, Switch this Course On! Yes, Take the course and let the lamp of knowledge brighten your career and endeavours. Best wishes to you. Practising as a consultant in the solar field, I would share more in the coming days and I do wish to add the experience as upgraded content and I look forward to keeping updating the content with the latest developments.\n\n\nAll the best!",

You'll discover strategies for identifying potential hazards, evaluating their severity and likelihood, and prioritizing interventions. Uniquely, this course addresses the human element of risk assessment, teaching valuable skills for facilitating collaborative assessments that build team cohesion rather than creating workplace tension.\nThe final section delivers comprehensive guidance on remedial action implementation and follow-up—often the most crucial yet overlooked aspect of the risk management process.

Whether the failure is on the part of the notary or the employer, liability doesn't disappear, and it is important to understand the details of each subsection to avoid legal problems. This course includes clauses from various parts of the statute and provides students with the tools they need to prepare for the test or simply clarify the purposes behind the statutory language.\nYears ago, when I was the Office Administrator for the Lieutenant Governor's Office, I wrote nearly all of the questions for the test along with the Notary Study Guide, so I know what you need to study. Most of the material is still used today, and if you think it is complicated now, you should have seen the test when it was administered through a contractor in another state; roughly 35 percent of applicants were failing the test. Test administrators justified the super-wordy approach under the claim that the State needed to filter out less qualified applicants. I disagree. Becoming a notary should not be a complicated process, and if you watch my videos before you take the test, you will have the material I wanted to share with all notaries when I managed the program.  Refer back to these videos as much as you need, and good luck on the test!",

      "description": "The island of Taiwan has been home to peoples from both near and far over the centuries. Polynesians, Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, and Japanese have all called the island home. The strategic location of the island has made it sought after and fought over throughout its history. Each wave of visitors and conquerors left its imprint on the cultural, political and legal fabric of the societies on Taiwan.\nIn the 20th century, Taiwan became the last outpost of the Nationalist forces who were driven from the Chinese mainland in the Chinese civil war. To get a feel for the authoritarian period which followed, Living Law® travels to the Matsu Islands, which used to be at the front lines of the inner-Chinese military conflict. We cover the key features of the long period of martial law, as well as the bilateral defence treaty which (militarily and economically) tied the United States to Taiwan throughout the Cold War. More than once it looked as though Taiwan could become the trigger to a Third World War.\nThe US pivot to the People's Republic in the 1970's had dramatic repercussions for Taiwan. We examine the diplomatic agreements which aimed to maneuver through international waters as treacherous as those of the Taiwan Straits. We focus especially on the role of state recognition under international law.\nDespite the geopolitical shifts and the death of its President, the Taiwanese people hardly stood still. Within just two decades, Taiwan emerged from one-party rule and martial law to become one of Asia's economic tigers. We cover Taiwan's reaction to a \"rising China,\" tracing a series of cross-Straits cooperation agreements which helped de-escalate historic tensions.  Finally, we consider the prospects for Taiwan's future under application of the \"One China\" policy of the People's Republic. Is it possible to bring a democratic society of 23.6 million people within the framework of a Communist system which rules over 1.4 billion people? Recent events (August 2022) have shown just how precarious the situation in the Taiwan Straits can get!",

As part of this process (called Tendering), they will develop and issue an invitation to tender.\nSimultaneously, contractors are constantly on the lookout for work. Obtaining information about upcoming projects is a big part of the overall marketing effort of a construction company.\nBut what does this mean, and how do you go about responding to it?\nIn this course, you and me will be learning about the process of tendering / bidding for construction projects, but specifically from an estimator’s role within a construction company.\nDuring the course, we will be using a past tender to make the learning journey as real as possible so that you will be provided with the confidence and foundation skills to take your first steps into estimating.\nIf you are already employed in the construction industry or wanting to learn what the role of an Estimator is during the tendering / bidding process for a construction project, then this course is for you.\nSo that said, enrol now and learn about the tendering / bidding process for a construction project from the Estimator’s seat.",

The potential for serious incidents in these industries is clear, and permit-to-work systems are a vital part of effective management of the hazards.\nThis course will help students to learn the basics of permit-to-work systems. Before they start working, employers and their workers should agree on the details of the system and sign the agreement. These details include the type of workers that are allowed to work for a particular company, what activities these workers will be doing while working, whether they will be using specific machines, etc.\nWorkers can also sign a contract in which they agree that they will not be doing anything illegal or unsafe while they are working for the company. It is essential for a worker to be knowledgeable about the permit-to-work system. Workers need to know how the company manages health and safety. They should also know the different risks that might threaten their safety and health. A permit-to-work system will ensure that no one is exposed to these risks and that workers are properly trained. It is also good to have a training program for workers.\n30 Day Money Back Guarantee\nDon't forget, all my Courses have an unconditional, 30 Day Money Back Guarantee.

I noticed that most people were quite ignorant and weak in managing change coming into their lives. However, it is not entirely individual fault too, it is because we were not taught how to manage the change too.\n\nFor more than a decade long, I have been involved in large scale of transformation or change projects that dealt with structural, cultural, technology & strategic types of change. With all these experiences and knowledges, they do come with price as it would disrupt thousands of lives and at times involving political interferences too.\n\nHowever, you don't have to go through such pain process in order to acquire such valuable experiences. You can now be able to access this information and learn within your finger tips, where most adults currently facing challenges could use such tool that priority meant for Big firms to use.\n\nThese tools and models are priceless, but you don't have to pay a single cent on it for this course. Most importantly you could immediately leverage this course in managing the change in your work and life. Especially if you are running your own businesses or working for large corporate firm. The idea is not equipped this knowledge for you to be consultant and make a living but simple quickly leverage it and take advantage as part of you repertoire while facing challenges ahead.\n\nI trust you have all the necessary wisdom since you are reading this description now. Now is time for you to take advantage of these knowledge and tools in equipping yourself further.\n\nI can't wait and so excited for you to be participating this course.

Students will begin by exploring the meaning of a Joint Stock Company, which is a legal entity formed by shareholders to conduct business with shared ownership and liability. The course will delve into the various features of such companies, including their ability to raise capital, limited liability, and separate legal identity. Key terms such as perpetual succession, common seal, artificial person, and oligarchic management will be explained in detail to provide clarity on their significance in the corporate structure.\nThe course will also highlight the merits and limitations of a Joint Stock Company, enabling students to evaluate its advantages, such as access to large-scale capital, and disadvantages, such as complex legal formalities. A comparative analysis of Public and Private Companies will be provided, focusing on their differences, privileges, and exemptions. Students will explore why some larger companies choose to remain private and the process of converting a private company into a public one.\nAdditionally, the course emphasizes the importance of selecting an appropriate form of organization and discusses the factors influencing this decision, such as capital requirements, liability, and regulatory compliance. By the end of the course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of Joint Stock Companies, their operational dynamics, and their role in the modern business landscape.

      "description": "Investment is key to how many people build their fortunes. After all, wealthy people do not get rich through hard work as often as they get rich through smart work. As so many of us toil long days, working late at the office, trying to save every penny we can, there are others who have their money working for them. But this isn't a concept exclusive to the wealthy. Anyone can do it and the stock market represents one area in which normal people can have their money \"work for them\".\nAlthough most people are aware of the stock market, few actually understand it. This class hopes to fix that. We will simplify the fundamentals of securities investment so that you become part of the \"enlightened minority\". The course covers stocks vs. shares, market capitalization;  the pros and cons of different security investments (including stocks, bonds, and options);  futures contracts vs. options contracts,  how to earn derivative payments, how to differentiate between common and preferred stock; the difference between primary and secondary markets; shorting a stock, and the appeal and danger of penny stocks. These terms and concepts can come across as overly-complicated at first, but our goal is to make them easy to understand in hopes that all of our students can confidently begin engaging with the stock investment.\nThis course serves as a definitive introduction to how the stock market works. If you don't \"get it\" now, you certainly will by the end of this class. Welcome to the world of Wall Street.",

      "description": "Confidence is a delicate human emotion; it goes up and it goes down.\nYou may think that confidence is a fixed thing, that you either have it or don’t and that you are not a confident person. Here’s the good news: you can grow your confidence and protect it by following some simple steps. You can.\nI used to think I was not a confident person and I worked ultra-hard to compensate. Over time – many years – I discovered things to do, processes to follow that seemed to work, and my confidence grew. But then it fell back when things went wrong. I learned that my confidence was a dynamic – it went up and down; also, that I could do something about it and so I did. And the more I worked on my confidence, the more robust it and I became. People see me as a confident person, but believe me, I’m still working on it.\nI also used to think money was the life blood of success. Now from experience I know it is confidence.\nConfidence is the lifeblood of your success, your results, and your career. Likewise, confidence is the lifeblood of your team’s success. More than that, it’s a multiplier for team and organisational results and sustained success.\nBut we live in challenging, tricky times with significant change foisted upon us from all directions. This constant change causes us uncertainty and disrupts our confidence. And so growing and protecting our confidence is a constant work in progress. I hear you saying, “Yes, I get it but how? How do I grow and protect my confidence in these tricky times?”\nThis short course answers that question for you.\nYou will learn:\n1. Why confidence is so important\n2. About confidence as a dynamic and the need to protect it.\n3. How to grow and protect your confidence\n4. How to grow confidence in teams plus its multiplier effect\nYou will learn the simple steps!\nThe course is straightforward – no fluff, no preamble, no adverts. It’s lite on theory, more experiential – based on my tried and tested work strengthening and protecting my own confidence. It’s everything you need to know to become an inwardly ‘confident person’ - though you have to do the work, implement and then practice your learning.\nIf you already consider yourself to be a confident person, this course will give you the insight to better understand those around you who are not so confident. And with this understanding you will become a better leader.\nThere is a series of short videos covering my own confidence methodology, each with an assignment for you to try out and develop your own approach. You write up your experience of doing the assignment in the Workbook (provided at the end of video 1) along with your reflections and learning. As you progress through the course, your Workbook becomes a reflection on your learning journey.\nYou do the work at your own pace, wherever and whenever you want - a spare moment on the train or a dedicated study period at work or home. There is no exam and no test - this course is for you. It’s for your confidence, your success. You don't have to tell people you are doing it, though they will notice the difference and so will you.\n\n\nWho am I to be teaching you this? Well, so far I've been in industry for over 48 years, the last 25 as a leadership team coach. In my earlier career I lacked confidence and went into my shell at first sight of my boss and his boss. I attempted to make up for this by working harder and harder. This came at great personal cost. As I started to climb the career ladder I learnt about myself and ‘people’ and the ingredients of success. I became fascinated by ‘confidence’, my own and that of others, as well as the impact of confidence on results. Now I am sharing the best of what I have learnt, so you can develop your own confidence system and move forward from here with confidence.\n\n\nSincerely,\nDave Stitt",

I wanted to create something powerful enough to make you feel balanced, fulfilled, excited about tomorrow, motivated about today and of course experience less stress and have more money. But not just for a week, or a month, or a year, but everlastingly.\n\n\nThe truth is there is a possibility of you being even a multi-million dollar lawyer or a billion dollar lawyer. And that possibility can become a reality if you have a solid system where you have direct control over your profits. I will give you that system in session 1 and the mindset for it in session 3.\n\n\nBut the money part is just 25% of the everlasting benefit you will receive form this. The other 75% lies in the “better you” part.That part has everything to do with you being aligned with the vibrational frequencies of the future you desire and living balanced. Aligned and balanced is when you effortlessly flow to more success, happiness, love, money health, fulfillment, peace and serenity.\n\n\nWho is this program for? Lawyers who believe that they can dominate their field of law and make a high six-figure even seven-figure income doing it, people who want to advance personally, those who want to be successful in several areas of their life, willing to have some “skin in the game” and understand that they need to invest some money to grow their law practice and take it to that next level\n\n\nWho is this not for? Lawyers who are stuck doing the same thing hoping to just hit a big case one day, people who make excuses and complain, people who are stuck in “information gathering” mode and are not prepared to take action or get results, anyone not serious about growing their law practice by another $100,000 - $1,000,000 in the next 12 months.\n\n\nWhat is included in the progrsm?\nSession 1 - everything about increasing your law firm's/law practices profits, performance, efficiency and effectiveness.\nSession 2 - reducing stress, defining your life goals to feel balanced, becoming less affected by hardships, making your happiness depend on nothing and no one.\nSession 3 - aligning your intention, attention and feeling to manifest that what you want faster than ever.\nSession 4 - guided meditation designed for you to rise to higher vibrational frequencies and align yourself with the future you desire\nSession 5 - phone call during which you will be able to ask me  questions, in addition we will go over all of your goals in each area of your life: financial, social, emotional, spiritual and mental. We will generate a goal list that will have:actionable steps, vividly identified intentions, exactly what you have to give your attention to and how to avoid placing your attention on that what will slow down your progress, and lastly what inner work you would have to do to accomplish them.\n\n\nThe 4 sessions are like your college and when you graduate, the 5th session will be a guided application of all the lessons, strategies, skills and realizations that you have learned to ensure you have the deepest level of understanding in everything that you would learn in the 4 sessions.\n\n\nTo clarify, you are not paying for 4 videos and a phone call. That is just a formality. You are paying for a life altering experience that will facilitate a lasting change into your foreseeable future. You are paying for 3 hours that will change the trajectory of your life forever. Happy, Balanced, Fulfilled, excited about tomorrow, motivated about today, with less stress and more money. A lot more money. Welcome my friend.",

      "description": "FULL COURSE DESCRIPTION\nSpare parts have been around since humans invented things that break and need to be replaced. Service parts supply chains deliver spare parts management as a service. They are an integral part of any hardware based operation, regardless of the industry in question, that do not always get the attention they deserve. Service Parts must be delivered to the customer, and faulty units must often be returned in order to be repaired or otherwise processed. Therefore this area of Supply Chain Management is especially fascinating as it faces challenges from a forward as well as a reverse logistics perspective.\nIn this course you will learn the basic operational principles of service parts supply chains:\nWhat they are, their key functions, and how they fit into supply chains in general.\nThe drivers behind the decision to outsource service parts to an external service provider.\nThe main steps involved in preparing for the delivery of the service, from contract analysis, to logistic design, through to system modeling and inventory dimensioning.\nThe approach to service implementation and how service delivery and operations works, including order intake, warehousing and distribution, and repair.\nHow to go about managing a service parts supply chain, covering strategy, demand and supply integration, or cost management.\nA glimpse into the new technologies that are already making their way into service parts supply chains around the world.\nBONUS MATERIALS\nThe course includes three .pdf files with an overview of service preparation, service delivery and operations, and managing the service parts supply chain. You can download these files for your archives, and to keep the big picture in mind as we explore each section.",

      "description": "My goal is to help lift the standard of procurement and encourage people to pursue it as a profession, rather than something they just fall into. With that in mind, many do just fall into procurement and kind of just \"wing it\". Sure they get there in the end, but often engaging in questionable practices and finding out they have bound their organisation to a contractual obligation which may not provide value, or even solve the initial problem.\nThis program will start by uncovering the basic elements of procurement, this will be looking at the key components and allowing us to define procurement and understand its impact to the business environment.\nWe will then explore the core aspects which impact on procurement including contracts and other associated legislation. Once we have completed this quick dive we will jump into some practical stuff looking at the commencement of the procurement life cycle; the discovery stage.\nThis what I've called Part 2 and this is where the course gets practical. To get the most out of this section it's recommended that you have an active procurement or something you can apply the learning to; after all the real learning happens when you apply it.\nIn my experience I find that most of the issues faced in procurement can be traced back to the Discovery and Planning stages. That is where we identify our needs and when we make a plan to meet them. In this course we are going to focus on the discovery stage, there will be a follow on course which will look at procurement planning so if you end up getting value here you will be able to continue the application of your learning.\nIn Part 2 we will explore and hopefully you will follow along and apply things starting with gathering all required inputs such as legislation, policy and understanding governance requirements, I find that many times these are not proactively uncovered and become roadblocks later in the process.\nOnce you've understood the requirements we will then work on uncovering the internal and business needs; considering and defining the problem, working with stakeholders to frame their needs as well as discussing the importance of lessons learned and starting with insights from the past.\nFinally we will take a look into the supply side talking about things including market research and market sounding.\n\n\nBefore closing out into what should pave the way for you to develop either a great business case or procurement plan.",

      "description": "Volunteer Surveys are a common element of most Volunteer Programs, however I have often found completed Volunteer Surveys left in a drawer, no data was taken from them, no improvements were implemented, in fact, they were just gathered and then forgotten. This is surprisingly common. Many Volunteer Managers know they should have a Volunteer Survey but they're not particularly clear on why they need it.\nAs data becomes a more and more important element of modern business, your leadership team will be expecting more data from you. If your CEO comes asking and you have nothing to tell them, you don't look good, but in addition your program might quickly become expendable, no matter how vital it actually is to the running of your organisation.\nAs a Volunteer Manager it's your job to be ahead of the game, collecting data that can easily and dramatically demonstrate the enormous value your volunteers bring to your organisation, and the Volunteer Survey is your first step.\nIn this course I will teach you what sorts of things to include in your survey, what sorts of questions to ask, how different question styles will impact your results, what to do with your results and how to use your Volunteer Survey to build respect and admiration for your volunteers and your program.\nThis course has video content, in addition it has worksheets with questions to ask yourself, examples of Volunteer Survey questions and ways to organise your reports to make your data more impactful, be sure to check out the resources to get the full value of the course.\nThe skills you learn on this course will help you develop increasingly more effective and efficient Volunteer Surveys over time, we'll also talk about other ways you might be able to make your program more measurable.\nI hope you find this course useful and use it to improve your program and empower your volunteers to do more to change the world.",

You’ll work through 120 original, non-repeating practice questions that closely mirror real exam style, format, phrasing, and difficulty, so you become familiar with what to expect on test day. Each question is paired with a clear, concise explanation that tells you why the correct answer is right and why the distractors are wrong, helping you learn from mistakes and reinforce correct reasoning.\nThis course covers the most-tested topics in depth: common policy types and their features, basic and intermediate underwriting principles, core risk-management concepts, state and federal regulatory frameworks, and essential ethical practices. You’ll practice across multiple question formats—multiple choice, scenario-based items, and real-world application questions—so you can sharpen reading comprehension, improve question interpretation, develop effective time-management strategies, and avoid common exam traps. The course also includes tools to highlight your weak areas and track performance over time, so you can target study time where it matters most and make steady progress.\nBy the end of the course you’ll be able to confidently compare policy options, recognize and evaluate key underwriting factors, apply risk concepts to coverage and beneficiary decisions, adhere to primary compliance rules, and navigate typical ethical scenarios you’re likely to face on the exam and in practice. Ideal for first-time test takers and anyone seeking a structured, practice-driven approach, this course provides the repetition, targeted feedback, and measured confidence-building necessary to walk into exam day prepared and composed.\n\nWhy this course works:\nStrengthens the critical thinking and decision-making abilities required on exam day by using realistic problem-solving scenarios. Identifies weak spots and knowledge gaps so you can target your study time more efficiently and progress more quickly. Boosts confidence through repeated practice with realistic exam questions and timed sets. Suitable for preparing for state licensing exams as well as various industry certifications and continuing education needs. Perfect for self-study learners, review groups, and training programs looking for a dependable, exam-focused resource.",

      "description": "We all experience challenging times. This is our common human experience. What's important is how we respond. Our ability to navigate stressful times can make or break our success. Resilience helps us face those challenges head on and bounce back from them, meaning, we don't quit, we learn.\nWhen we’re emotionally resilient and emotionally healthy, our ability to handle stress and challenges increases. We are more creative, authentic, innovative, and have better personal and professional relationships. Successful emotion regulation is key to resilience (Troy & Mauss, 2011).\nWithout emotional resilience, communication and interpersonal skills suffer, leading to conflict and misunderstandings that could have been avoided. If we want to be the best versions of ourselves as entrepreneurs, leaders, and professionals, our emotional resilience is our hidden superpower.\nAs emotionally resilient people, we can approach business challenges with a growth mindset, viewing obstacles as opportunities rather than setbacks. This perspective opens doors to creative solutions and adaptability. As entrepreneurs or business professionals, how many of us are looking for business strategies or ways to be more productive at work, instead of fixing our eyes on the deeper issues? According to studies from Harvard Business Review, resilient leaders tend to be more productive, creative, and satisfied in their roles.\nOur emotional health is a crucial part of this whole equation — and prioritizing it can change our lives and business. It’s not easy to face the inner critic, the voices inside, and the limiting beliefs we carry, but we must. We have to begin to acknowledge that external activities are not cutting it. We must dig deeper.\nWe often get so caught up in strategies, growth, business planning, and pushing ourselves to achieve that we forget the one thing that holds it all together: our well-being.\n\n\nThis isn't just a typical course; it's an interactive and experiential TOOLKIT with tried, tested, and verified techniques and strategies to help you develop practical skills to build emotional resilience.\n\n\nThere are 113 mini-lessons and exercises led by several licensed mental health professionals, industry experts, and healthcare professionals to enhance your emotional well-being, empowering you to move through challenges with strength and clarity for long-term professional sustainability.\nEmotional health and resilience are non-negotiable advantages in our professional toolkit. These directly impact performance, relationships, and physical well-being, and investing in emotional resilience is as essential as investing in any other skill for business growth.\nHealth is the foundation from which everything else is built and impacts every area of our life, that is why being our healthiest — mind, body, and spirit — is so important to living a fulfilled life and having a thriving career.\n\n\nIf you're ready to develop a growth mindset, cultivate more self-compassion and self-love, strengthen your ability to manage stress, prevent burnout, and build up your resilience, then you are in the right place!",

This Course Will Teach You 40 Strategies You'll Need To Know For Jump Starting Your Business Flipping Medical Commodities AND I Will Share With You a Buyer’s List You Can Use to Start Selling Your Products To.\n\n\nHere's What You Receive When You Buy The Medical Commodities Blueprint Course!\n\n\nWhat is flipping medical commodities? Introduction to an unknown market with profit margins like you’ve never seen before!\nThe 5 steps you need to take to start your own Highly Profitable Medical Commodities Business...and the 7 deadly mistakes to avoid\nA complete breakdown on how to find test strips and flip them to your end buyers for major profit\nAccess to me, a mentor that has done it and knows all the pitfalls and can show you the way to avoid them and guide you to build your own business.\n\n\nDo you have the knowledge that will make you win?\n\n\nLots of people have the drive and even the right mindset to make the money, but without the specialized knowledge I can provide, access to people who have done it before and that can show you the ropes using and a tried and tested formula, you probably won’t go anywhere. You’ll end up wasting a lot of time and opportunity, ultimately quitting because of how lost you are.\n\n\nTrust me, I’ve been there, done that, and that is why I’m dispensing with this advice.\n\nBut who am I, anyway?\n\n\nMy story\n\n\nBack in September 2020, I discovered the beauty of re-selling medical commodities.\n\n\nMore exactly, diabetic test strips. Using the internet, something that hasn’t been done very often in the medical commodities business, I was able to grow this business to five plus figures a month.\n\n\nThere was something else I was doing that I didn’t see a lot of people doing - I got the product before I had to pay for it, which meant that I had a lot more cash flow than my competition.\n\n\nWhen I realized no one was teaching my method of doing things, I thought to myself that there have to be more people who would like to know how to do things my way and get rich while trying!\n\n\nBefore Flipping Medical Commodities\n\n\nLike you, I faced one major problem; I made enough, but not enough to do what I wanted. I used to work long hours slaving away in two jobs. I found myself doing back-breaking work that didn’t earn me more than between 15 to 25 dollars an hour. I don’t have to tell you how energy-consuming and especially hope-consuming that was. It made me realize that most honest jobs keep you trapped in working long hours for little money and never having enough to fulfill your dreams.\n\n\n“I know it sounds like a fantasy, but buying and reselling affordable products that people need consistently is the key. When I found out, only in September, of the existence of flipping medical commodities business I couldn’t believe it. This led me to the first diabetic test strip reselling. From there I was able to get started with just a few hundred dollars and grow to $5,000, $10,000, and more per month without having to learn any complicated systems, tools, or methods.\n\n\nThe Start of The Business\n\n\nI started with $40 buying my first couple of supplies, invoicing, waiting for payment, then shipping. I kept consistent and turned that $40 into 5.3k in sales (2.6k profit) in my first month. Now, with all my consistency, I have a stable business with many repeat clients that hit me back up with more strips every 14, 30, 60 days later. My business just keeps growing.\n\n\nAlthough this may seem like easy money, you have to realize that just like with every business, you must be relentless and consistent. If you have what it takes, you can take control of your finances with this money-grabbing business. And I want to teach you how you can succeed by flipping medical commodities, most exactly, test strips.\n\n\nThe process is simple. You buy, sell to your end buyer and repeat.\n\n\nThese commodities are in high demand and you will find thousands of them in every city across the United States. You will NOT regret this investment you make in yourself. Don’t waste another minute in starting your own business and your journey to getting rich! What are you waiting for?",

Has your budget been cut yet you're still asked to deliver the same results? If any of these resonate with you then this course is designed to help!\nWith the recent pandemic, global wars and climate change, the world has become an uncertain place. As an HR professional, you may have found yourself ‘firefighting’ during COVID-19 and then adjusting to hybrid work and budget cuts, which may have taken a toll on your wellbeing and that of your HR team. In addition, the incredible pace of human civilisation has far outrun nature’s ability to update the design of our brains to help us cope with it. We are bombarded by information and mentally drained by constant demands on our energy and time. If we want to be healthy, we must take time to honour one of the body’s most fragile organs - the brain, the heart and the gut. To do this, we need to integrate wellbeing into our workday.\nBased on the latest research with Softer Success and King's College London, it has become evident that when leaders, CEOs and HR teams set wellbeing as a business goal it can help prevent burnout, enhance wellbeing and improve cognition. Wellbeing can be thought of as 'being well' but what does that really mean? And how do you integrate wellbeing as a business goal in your HR role, so that you can be healthy and sustainably productive, and help others around you be the same?\nThe course is designed to help you manage stress, overwhelm and worry with a three-step strategy to prevent burnout, focusing on holistic health. Over a series of video-based lectures, you will learn how to integrate wellbeing into your daily work and your team's work. You will identify daily practices that can kickstart long-term positive habits and even alter neural pathways in the brain. We will equip you with practical tools to help you implement short-, medium- and long-term wellbeing goals and you will become more aware of the risks that contribute to burnout with a scientifically backed 90-second wellbeing assessment. Once you know how to define new metrics of success, you can make mental connections between the success of the business and your wellbeing as its most precious resource. Each individual is different and the triggers for the compulsive behaviour that may lead to burnout can be highly individual. Here, you will learn how to 'burnout-proof' your job, no matter how many stakeholders are in your life, and understand how to do this with your teams.\nThis course will equip you with easy-to-use tools for managing stress, finding more balance and improving your mental focus. You will learn several strategies to increase your confidence and inner strength when dealing with multiple stakeholders. Here, we will ensure that wellbeing is embedded in your work and systems!\nSo, are you ready to do your job with ease and effortlessness? To influence and show others to do the same? To have the right energy and easily bounce back from any challenge that comes your way? Then enrol now to learn more.",

      "description": "この講座では独学かつ短期間で中小企業診断士試験に合格する方法論をお伝えします。\n\n\n中小企業診断士という資格をご存じでしょうか。\n「国が認めた唯一の経営コンサルタント」資格と言われ、日経新聞の調査によると取得したいビジネス関連資格で1位となった、今ビジネスマンを中心に注目を集めている資格です（2016年1月12日 日本経済新聞）。\nこの試験は1次試験（択一式）、2次試験（記述式）、口述試験と3つの関門を潜り抜ける必要があります。\n合格率も1次試験20%・2次試験20%が過去の平均値で単純計算した最終合格率は4%（20%×20%）という難関資格の一つと言われています。\n※ここ数年その傾向は変化しています。講座の中ではその理由について、中小企業診断士資格の位置づけの変化とともに解説していきます。\n\n\n1次試験では\n・経済学経済政策\n・財務会計\n・企業経営理論\n・運営管理\n・経営法務\n・経営情報システム\n・中小企業経営政策\nの7科目をすべて合格しなければならず、それぞれの科目ごとに幅広い知識が必要とされます。\n\n\nさらに1次試験合格者だけが受験できる2次試験では、\n・事例Ⅰ：組織、人事\n・事例Ⅱ：マーケティング、流通\n・事例Ⅲ：生産、技術\n・事例Ⅳ：財務、会計\nの4領域について論述式での試験が課されます。\n\n\nその後、論述式試験合格者を対象に口述試験があり、その合格者が最終合格者として官報に記載されます。\n\n\nここまで読んで頂いて勉強量の膨大さに頭がクラクラされた方がいらっしゃるのではないでしょうか。\n実際、1次2次全ての標準的なテキスト・模擬問題・過去問集等を積み上げると１ｍくらいになったりもします。\n「興味はあるけど、自分には到底無理そうだな」\n「予備校に通う時間もお金もないよ」\n\n\nそう思われた方、大丈夫です。\n中小企業診断士試験は「一定期間正しい努力を継続できれば」働きながら独学で合格できます。\nある程度まとまった時間を受験勉強に集中する必要はありますが、幸いなことにこれらの勉強は知的好奇心旺盛なビジネスマンにとって刺激的で楽しい体験になるでしょう。\n勉強したことが日常業務に直結するという副次的な効果もあり、受験勉強にありがちなひたすら無機質に知識を詰め込むといった苦痛からは縁遠いものです。\nこの講座では、短期間で独学合格した私のノウハウ（使ったテキスト、参考書、問題への取り組み方）をお伝えし、悩める独学者に合格までのルートを示すことができればと考えております。\n\n\n「自分のやり方は正しいのだろうか」と悩んでいろんな市販教材に手を出し続ける日々はもう卒業しましょう。\n自分のスタイルを確立し、迷わずにすべてのリソースを集中投入することが短期合格へのカギとなります。\n\n\n迷いを捨て、目標達成へ向けた効率的な努力を継続することが合格への近道です。\n\n\n＜講座の内容＞\n■中小企業診断士とは何か\n資格の位置づけ\n取得のメリット\n■なぜ今中小企業診断士なのか\n1次試験合格率が急上昇中\n社会的ニーズの変化\n中小企業経営者の高齢化と事業承継\nコロナ禍での中小企業支援の必要性\n地方におけるビジネスリーダー不足\n■学習計画\n心構え\n必要な時間は575時間\n■1次試験の勉強法\nおすすめ教材\n全体把握編\n過去問への取り組み方\n重要科目テコ入れ\n■2次試験の勉強法\n所要時間は213時間\n2次試験独学は自己採点が肝\n事例１～３までの勉強法\n事例４の勉強法\n口述試験対策\n■二次試験解答例と解き方イメージ（私の実例）",

Promised.\nFood Design is a vast discipline that in one sense is about 23-25 years old, since the moment when it seems the term Food Design was first coined, but in another sense this discipline is as old as human beings, because the first time we put a piece of meat on a fire we were applying innovation to food, so we were food design-ing. After that we have continued applying our creative abilities to food, and today we enjoy extremely refined dishes that result from hundreds of cooking techniques, we eat in space in zero gravity, we have functional food, we are able to preserve food’s properties for decades, etc. We have also applied innovation to everything that is outside of our plate but directly correlated to it: production, procurement, transportation, transformation, distribution, presentation, consumption, and disposal. Therefore, Food Design propositions are more than food, but are applied to any point in the food chain. These innovations would not be possible without available research on psychology, engineering, material production, sociology, sustainability, biology, chemistry, architecture, all of the Design disciplines, etc. Food Design is a discipline that does not stand on its own but is intimately intertwined with all other disciplines of human knowledge.\nFind all my Food Design books here: francescazampollo dot com/books",
