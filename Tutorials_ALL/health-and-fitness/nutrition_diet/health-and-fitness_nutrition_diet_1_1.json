      "description": "The Course That Rewires Your Brain For Lean, Healthy Eating\nIf you're like most people, anytime you want to lose weight you probably go on a diet. Here's the problem. When it comes to weight loss, your DIET is extremely important...but GOING ON A DIET is different.\nGoing on a diet doesn't work--and that's pretty much a fact at this point. Loads of studies and research confirm this pretty conclusively. (Watch the first free preview video lecture to learn why.)\nSee, trying to lose weight by going on a diet is like going into a garden that's overrun with weeds...and TRIMMING the weeds, instead of pulling them out by the roots.\nYeah, that might make things look better for a little while, but it doesn't fix the source of the problem. And because the roots are still there under the surface, the weeds quickly grow back--just like your love handles always seem to grow back.\nIf you've been unable to get the body you desire, and the body you deserve, it's probably because you've been trying to change your end behaviors (the foods you eat, the exercises you do) without first creating the right foundation of habits & beliefs to support these new behaviors.\nYou see, real weight loss doesn't begin on your plate. And it doesn't begin in a gym. It begins...in your head. Because that's where you form your beliefs, forge your habits, and make the little day-to-day decisions that add up to make you the person you are today.\nAnd that's why in this course you'll learn how to lose weight by starting at the root source of the problem. (Lecture Four)\nYou'll learn how to re-wire your brain for healthy eating that's automatic (no willpower required) using the science of neuroplasticity. (Lecture Twenty-Two)\nYou'll learn how to find where your limiting and disempowering beliefs are hiding, and replace them with more empowering beliefs and a stronger self-image. (Lecture Seven)\nYou'll learn how to avoid the common weight-loss pitfalls you keep falling into, again and again, without even realizing it. (Lecture Eight)\nFinally, and most importantly, you'll learn how start thinking like a lean person...so you'll start acting like a lean person. (Lecture Twenty-Four)\nAnd before you know it, you'll BE a lean person--inside and out.\n* Note: This is not a diet. This is a mental reframing system that you can use with ANY diet in the world--including no diet at all, if you prefer to simply eat the foods you enjoy and still lose weight at a slow but steady clip. *",

[Including over 100 scientific references/studies quotes to support my claims]\nIn today's modern world, two problems exist that makes taking dietary supplements almost necessary:\n\n1) The food that we eat is losing its nutritive value. the way it's grown, the way its transported and the way we store it and cook it.\nUnless you are buying your produce from a local farmers market and taking every precaution to store it effectively and consume it by cooking on medium heat and obviously not overcooking it, there is almost a loss of close to 50-70% loss of nutrients in your food.\nThis is true only in case of people who actually consume healthy foods. But this is far from the reality.\n60% of calories come from processed foods for Americans. The reality is no different than in the rest of the world.\nFactory foods are highly processed and offer very little or no nutritive value. It's very simple. The companies that manufacture these processed and fast foods reliance is on taste and convenience and obviously on how much profits they'll earn by the end of the day.\n\nAnother huge factor why people have supplements is the convenience factor.\nSupplements will also vary based on your goal.\nIn Module 2, I'll start with the most common supplement known: Protein Powders and will discuss 7 different types of protein powders and will suggests which ones are the best and which ones to avoid.\nIn Module 3, I will let you in the confusing world of vitamins and minerals supplements and will make it quite clear which companies manufacture the best vitamins and minerals supplements and which ones to buy.\nIn Module 4, we shall discuss the best supplements for fat loss.\nIn Module 5, I will provide you a list of all muscle building supplements and will recommend the best ones\nIn Module 6, I will discuss one of the most researched supplement 'Creatine' and will discuss its types and very important questions on when and how to take it, if required based on your goals.\nModule 7, is all about optimizing your health. Not only I discuss more than 10 different health supplements, but at the end of this module, I have categorized them into following health goals:\n-Immune support\n-Digestive health\n-Heart health\n-Liver health\n-Bone and Joint health\nand of course, how can I miss this one:\n\n\nTop supplement companies from where you should buy your supplements from.\nI personally haven't used all the supplements that I have listed in this course, but based on my research I have provided top companies that you can place your trust in.\nIn various lectures, I have mentioned that there are third-party organizations like consumer lab that independently test the supplements for their potency and safety and I have provided a list of organizations that do that very job.\nSupplements industry is a huge multi-billion dollar industry.\nFinding good supplements is like searching for a needle in a haystack and with this course, I'll make it simple for you.\n###IMPORTANT###\nWe offer a CPD Certificate which is different from the Udemy's Certificate of Completion.

      "description": "*Updated AUGUST 2016\n\n*Join over 3,000 students who are losing weight and losing body fat with Intermittent Fasting\nQuestions to consider\n\nAre you suffering from having low energy?\nDo you feel tired or exhausted all the time?\nDo you have trouble focusing or getting work done?\nHave you been stuck in a period of low or limited productivity?\nDo you feel like your mental quickness or sharpness is starting to slow down?\nAre you having trouble remembering things?\nDo you need to lose weight and shed body fat?\nHave you noticed that your muscles are slowly or quickly disappearing?\nBecoming Superhuman\nIf I were to ask you these questions 10-20 years ago, it would seem that you either need to A) Be a superhero or B) have a miracle pill to solve all of these problems.\nThe reality is that most of the bullets listed above are a natural byproduct of aging and getting older.\nSome of them are just byproducts of not knowing how to take care of yourself properly, or not having the time or patience to cook and eat healthier.\nEventually, your memory begins to go, your cognitive function slows down, you get tired more easily, you gain weight, gain body fat.\nSo how do you optimize your body and your mindset without spending THOUSANDS of dollars on...\nA gym membership $40-$149/month\nFitness classes $180-$349/month\nPersonal training: $60-$100/session. Typically at 2-4 sessions per week\nSemi-private training: $20-$40/session. Typically at 2-4 sessions per week\nSee how this can all start to add up? Don't get me wrong here, I believe that your health is absolutely worth it. Treating your body right with the proper diet and exercise program is not only a means of having more energy, increasing your productivity, losing weight, getting a ripped physique, and showing off your six pack abs.\nExercise and eating right can save you tens or HUNDREDS of thousands of dollars of the years on doctors appointments, physical therapists, medications, and even surgeries.\nWhat if I told you that there were a way to naturally...\nSlow the negative visible and mental effects of aging\nImprove your memory, focus, productivity and brain function\nBuild muscle mass and retain it\nOptimize your hormones\nLose weight and lose body fat\nYou may think it sounds crazy, but the more we find out about the benefits of intermittent fasting the closer we are to unlocking the keys to the fountains of youth and health.\nWhat you may think: “Fasting sounds Terrible and Intimidating\"\nDon't be intimidated by the word fasting. You may think that this word implies “starving\" but that could not be further from the truth.\nAs a trainer, I have found that my clients have a hard time eating the recommended 4-8 smaller meals per day because it is inconvenient. It sounds like a great idea, but it comes with it's own costs.\n*You are never really full or satisfied when eating 4-8 meals a day.\nSo if you are trying to lose weight, you are going to be more tempted to overeat and sabotage your own weight loss.\nYou have to lug around refrigerated lunch bags and pounds of tupperware to make sure that you eat every couple of hours.\nEating that frequently also makes you sluggish and drains your energy because your body is constantly working to digest your food.\nSounds like a blast, right? Who has the time to eat or think about eating ALL THE TIME during their busy work day?\nIntermittent Fasting: The Solution to Your Current Diet\nFasting doesn't mean that you will be starving, in fact it is the exact opposite. Most Intermittent Fasting schedules REQUIRE YOU to eat 2 massive meals per day so that you are full and completely satisfied for HOURS.\nYou may even be using intermittent fasting right now, and haven't been aware of it. And with some simple changes, you could master it and transform your body and mind.\nWhy Intermittent Fasting is the Natural Solution to become Superhuman\nIf you are trying to…\nImprove your focus\nIncrease your productivity\nHave more energy during the day\nReduce stress\nLose weight\nLose body fat\nBuild muscle\nAnd slow the visible and cognitive effects of aging\n*Intermittent Fasting is the simplest solution to accomplish all of those. No crazy smoothie recipes, no prescriptions, no supplements, no memory games, and no gym membership required.\nJust hard results from making a few simple, natural changes to the way you are eating.\nGetting Ripped with Intermittent Fasting\nYour body's response to intermittent fasting is fairly incredible when it comes to losing body fat, losing weight, building muscle, and getting ripped.\nIntermittent fasting changes how your body uses energy, and allows your body to switch gears from using carbohydrates as its primary source of energy, to burning pure fat.\nIf you want to lose body fat and lose weight and don't have time to spend hours in the kitchen or at the gym, IF is the solution to your health goals.\nHow Intermittent Fasting Can Save You Thousands of Dollars every YEAR\nIf your family has a history of\nHuntington's Disease\nAlzheimer's or age related memory loss\nObesity\nDiabetes\nDepression\nOsteoporosis\nLow growth hormone or testosterone production\nIntermittent fasting is the natural solution for you to dramatically decrease your chances of contracting any of these life altering health conditions and diseases.\nThat doesn't even include all the money that you would be saving on a\nGym membership\nFitness classes\nPersonal training\nNutrition consulting or dietary counseling\nand Home fitness equipment\nNo Risk. Maximum Reward\nWhy should you try intermittent fasting? Because you have absolutely no risk, and can reap the maximum benefit.\nTry this course for 30 days and if you aren't completely satisfied with the results that you are seeing, you can get 100% of your money back.\nIf intermittent fasting isn't the solution for you to improve your energy, focus, cognitive function, and get into the the best shape of your life, I want you to find the solution that works best for you.\nI am so excited and thankful that you are taking the time to view this course, and hope that you will enroll so that you can transform your body and mind forever.\nTo unlock the door to your superhuman-self, click “Take this course\" to get started now.\n-Trainer Jack",

      "description": "THE #1 BEST-SELLING KETOGENIC DIET COURSE\nKETO MADE SIMPLE! KETO DONE RIGHT!\n\nREVIEWS\n\"Very good presentation and hearing Keto explained by an authoritative source provides clarity. My husband and I are using this course as our bible to going keto. Not only is the curriculum comprehensive, but it is also explained in layman's terms for newbies, such as myself, to understand. I've watched the course several times because that is how I learn, but each time I seem to focus on something different and it has helped me plan and execute my journey to ketosis. So thankful I found this course, thanks for sharing it with those who are interested in a logical and proven way to a healthier lifestyle.\" - Angie Norris\n\n\"This was an excellent course and very motivating. I'm new to the Keto diet and this was the perfect place to start. Instructor was engaging and direct. This diet is the perfect fit for my lifestyle as i have already seen the benefits of intermittent fasting and as I'm trying to gain more energy and burn more fat to fuel my love of cycling.\"  - Kevin Frank\n\"Excellent, videos carefully explaining Ketosis and it's benefits. Of all the books I purchased on Keto, I finally understood it's meaning and application from this course.\" - Jose Carbo\n\n\"Very informative! I've been doing Keto for about 4 months for weight loss and haven't lost that much weight. This helps me see where I have been going wrong a tweak things and keep on track.\" - Teresa Cronin\nKeto aka Ketosis has seen tremendous growth in popularity recently for it's amazing results. Ketosis has been helping countless people BURN FAT, BUILD MUSCLE, IMPROVE ENERGY, INCREASE THEIR FOCUS, and REJUVENATE THEIR HEALTH!\nWhat if I told you that they were able to achieve these amazing benefits while eating the foods that they LOVE!\nKetosis is a state in which your body is burning FAT as it's primarily fuel source and if done properly can actually burn your own fat stores to fuel massive weight loss. Not only that but it has been shown to improve athletic performance, brain function, and energy.\nThe problem is many people are unaware of the proper strategies and tools needed to flip the switch on their metabolism for fat burning. This is leading many people attempting the ketogenic diet to make some critical mistakes that are preventing them from experiencing the full benefits of ketosis.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to get all the benefits of ketosis with as little bumps in the road and mistakes as possible. You'll also learn:\nHow to maximize the benefits of ketosis and avoid the top 3 mistakes!\nHow to use ketosis for fat loss!\nHow to combine ketosis with intermittent fasting for rapid and powerful ketosis!\nHacks for beating the Keto Flu and making the transition a breeze!\nHow to track and measure your progress along the way\nGet Recipes, Workouts, and Guides to get the maximum benefit\nThe Crash Course 2 Keto also comes with a FREE FASTING GUIDE, FREE RECIPES, and 20 FREE WORKOUTS!\nMore Praise For Crash Course 2 Keto!\n\"I really liked the course and it was straight to the point as to how to get into ketosis and also how you can combine this diet with intermittent fasting as a way to boost your results. If you really want to be healthier, in better shape and have more energy, focus and brain power, this is the course for you. I've tried myself and it's been doing great. You can feel the most difference when you put on some carbs back to your diet and have a feeling of lethargy, then when you come back to the low carb approach you feel great.\" - Felipe da Silva França\n\"The course was very informative and provided me with a blueprint on how to get started. I especially appreciated the FAQ because many of the questions I had after going through the course were addressed.\" - Saquoria\n\"Awesome!\" - Prashanth Kumar\n\"Really helpful!!! So many hacks and practical tips for getting into ketosis. I also enjoyed the way dr. brady explain complex concepts in a simple manner without information loss.\" - Marcos Medeiros",

      "description": "Have you ever worried about, or been diagnosed with, high blood pressure, diabetes or cancer? Have you tried to lose weight, but failed? A healthy diet filled with fruits and vegetables is an excellent weapon for preventing and battling cancer, heart disease and obesity. It is a proven fact: cancer cells have 20 times more receptors for sugar then normal cells. If your diet is full of sugar, cancer will be more likely to get triggered and will grow faster.\nUnfortunately we have been conditioned to rely too heavily on powerful synthetic medicines to cure these ailments. Few think about changing their diets to combat them. But throughout the history of medicine doctors never made this artificial separation between food and medicine. Treating elevated blood pressure, heart disease, cancer and diabetes with synthetic chemical medications is a recent, and largely unsuccessful, trend. You simply cannot prevent disease or restore health by taking pills.\nIn this course I teach you how to rethink every dietary choice and its impact on your health. You need this foundational knowledge to evaluate nutritional and medical claims and to design – and stick to – the food plan that is best for you.\n\nThe course explains the key role of each nutritional building block for healthy cells. It consists of 10 short lectures, each about 10 to 15 minutes long.\n\nThe first lecture is on proteins. Amino acids are building blocks for proteins. You break down the proteins in your foods into individual amino acids in your digestive tract. These amino acids are then absorbed into your blood stream and sent to all of your cells. The cells then construct from these amino acids the exact proteins they need for cell health.\nThe second lecture is about fats. Your body requires fat to function, but there are good and bad dietary fats and you will learn to select the best ones for your health.\nLecture three is about “simple” and “complex” carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy. The body and brain need a steady dose of sugars, but simple carbs can wreak havoc with your health. In this lecture you will learn about the best foods to supply the carbs you need.\nYour body needs vitamins and minerals to get all your other nutrients to where they can do their jobs in your cells.\nIn lecture four you will learn about the best fruits and vegetables you can select as sources of vitamins, minerals, fibers and sugar.\nEvery few months a new diet makes a big splash in the media, promising instant health and weight reduction. Most of these diets are hazardous to your health, and diets cannot provide long-term weight reduction. In lecture five you will learn about the pros and cons of today’s most popular diets, and how you can design your own eating plan to maintain optimum health and body weight.\nLecture six is about your “healthy plate”. It explains exactly what you should and should not put on your plate – and the right portion sizes - to make sure that you maximize your nutrients consumption to keep your body healthy and to restore health when struck with cancer, heart disease and other ailments.\nLectures 7, 8 and 9 are about structure and function of the digestive tract and it importance in overall health of your body and its cells. You will learn how a malfunctioning digestive tract will prevent absorption of nutrients, starve your cells, lead to disease, and prevent recovery.\nFinally, in lecture 10 you will learn what happens to all the nutrients in your food once they get absorbed from the digestive tract into your blood stream. The emphasis will be on how you use these nutrients to build, protect, restore and repair your cellular structures to heal yourself and keep yourself in optimum health.\nSome foods are not discussed in my lectures. For example: cookies, cakes, chips or French fries are not considered food, because they have so few nutrients and so much sugar that they can make you sick and keep you sick - you will be much better without them. Also, there are no canned foods on my “healthy plate”. Food from cans and jars has few vitamins, but is full of preservatives and coloring agents that may contribute to coronary disease, cancer. Long term health and vitality are out of questions if cookies, candy, ice cream and canned vegetables/fruit are part of your regular diet.\nI hope to see you in my course. Here’s to your health.",

Welcome to Fabulous Body! I’m Akash, your Holistic Nutrition Coach.\nLet me start by saying this: Mastering the Fundamentals is what makes you truly Advanced. This course is designed to help you master the fundamentals of GUT HEALTH as quickly and effectively as possible.\n\n\nFrom day one, this foundational course equips you with practical knowledge through self-assignments and quizzes, helping you immediately apply what you learn.

My focus is on experiential, skill-based education that empowers you to master the essentials of GUT HEALTH.\n\n\nI’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist, a Doctor of Naturopathy, a Yoga Alliance Trainer, and a NASM-Certified Personal Trainer. With decades of experience, I’ve worked with thousands of people worldwide, learning what truly works—and what doesn’t. Getting real results isn’t just a science; it’s an art.\n\n\nCourse Description:\nFood Scientists are calling the Gut ‘The Second Brain’!\nDid you know there are more neurons in our gut than our brain?\nDid you know that in our gut the bacteria outnumber human cells by 10:1?\nDid you know that a strong and healthy gut is the basic requirement if an individual wants to stay healthy?\n\n\nUnfortunately due our lifestyle choices, there is an imbalance in the microbiota of our gut. The results are surprising, with links that lead to a range of diseases, including celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Obesity may be related. And some studies have found relevance to depression, late-onset autism, allergies, asthma and even cancer.\nAn inside out approach of healing your gut can drastically boost your health. and it only takes little time to understand.\nFor decades our view of the human body was very mechanistic. It viewed every system as a separate part of a big machine. It viewed digestive system as separate from the body.

Since a dieting is a habit, changing what a person eats on a daily basis is going to be challenging, just like any other habit.\nThat is exactly why having a DIET COACH can be the key to dieting successfully as well as havign the right nutrition!  You can be the one helping people transform thier life with  this Diet and Nutrion Life Coach Certification\n\n\nWHY DO PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR DIET?\nWhen people hear the word DIET, they often assume it means someone is trying to lose weight. However, people change their diet for many reasons.\nPeople may change their diet and nutrition for the purpose of weight management, which can be related to both weight loss and weight gain.\nA person who wants to gain weight may be trying to build muscle or they may be overcoming being underweight.\nA person who wants weight loss may want to change the way they look, but they may be doing it in order to manage a health condition, such as cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, or lactose or gluten intolerance.\nOther people change their diet because they want to change their lifestyle, such as going vegetarian or vegan.\nAnd others are seeking to change their nutrition and curb a specific food habit, such as eating sweets or snacking at night.\nRegardless of the reasons, when a person is dieting, they need the SUPPORT of a diet life coach. The truth is that most diets fail because it’s hard! Having a DIET LIFE COACH provides support and accountability through the process. This Diet and Nutrition Life Coach Certification will provides the tools that your clients need.\n\n\nWHAT DOES A CERTIFIED DIET LIFE COACH DO?\nThis Diet and Nutrition Life Coach Certification  gives the tools to coaches so they can help their clients:\nClarify their health coaching, nutrition, and/or fitness priorities, values, and goals by asking the right questions.\nIdentify patterns, cravings, stress eating habits, and other potential roadblocks.\nCreate a dieting plan, including meal plans and schedules.\nIdentify skills, practices, habits, and sustainable daily actions to stay motivated and follow through.\nBuild lasting habits that allow their chosen dieting to become easy, consistent, and automatic.\n\n\nWHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE A CERTIFIED DIET LIFE COACH?\nA diet life coach does not need to be an expert at nutrition or weight loss (management), as their role is to help a client succeed at their chosen diet, not tell them what to eat. The most important skill of a diet life coach is the ability to help clients set goals and stay on track. In addition, a dieting coach needs to have knowledge of common diets as well as health coaching skills and a deep understanding of the science behind diet and weight management including:\nMacronutrients (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates)\nCalories, metabolism, and energy\nHydration, fat storage, muscle maintenance and more\nThat’s why this Diet Life Coach Certification course is designed to teach you everything you need to know about dieting and weight loss (management), as well as proven life coaching training skills and tools for supporting your clients to success.\nYou’ll receive:\nBaseline health coaching assessments including body composition, body type, BMR, and setting goals\nKnowledge about common and new diet types, including ketogenic diet, vegetarian diet, paleo diet, gluten free, raw food, fasting and more\nProven weight loss and management strategies\nLife coaching tools for providing accountability to your clients, including how to set goals and track progress\nLife coaching best practices for connect with and inspire their clients\nPlus, you’ll learn strategies for how to establish your diet life coaching business, including creating your coaching packages, running an accountability group, setting your price, and more!

The Indian Sage Patanjali has been credited with the collation of the classical work, the Yoga Sutra, a 2,000-year-old treatise on yogic philosophy. In order to still our mind, Patanjali, presented a system called Ashtanga Yoga. It is also called eight limbs of the yoga.

This will make it possible for you to create a framework for a Yoga Diet.\nRajasic and Tamasic Diets are also discussed here.\nI am a huge fan of principles and sticking with the absolute fundamentals of nutrition science.\nBecause when these fundamentals and principles are clear to you, then all you need to do is connect the dots which will eventually form into a line pointing you towards a specific direction when it comes to your or your clients nutrition and diet.\nModule 3 [BONUS] Ayurveda Fundamental Concepts. Even though this is a bonus module, the concept of Dosha is discussed here and how it relates to Yogic Nutrition. This module is optional, but very interesting and is actually the fundamental concept of Ayurveda Science.\nAlong with visually pleasing lecture slides, you will find a voiceover presentation which explains all the slides in detail plus you will find the accompanying script in case you want to read [Helpful for people who are hearing impaired]\nModule 4: Putting Everything Together-Creating Yogic Diets w/t Case Studies.

I am going to take help from our four Fabulous Body Mascots Sally, Valentina, Vincent and Rocky and based on their extend to their devotion to Yoga we shall create special Yogic diets for them.\nModule 5: Final Graded Exam.

The list of symptoms of systemic inflammation is a lengthy one including joint and body pain, weight gain, brain fog, anxiety and depression, digestive problems, migraines, skin issues and persistent fatigue to name a few of the more common ones. Inflammation is at the root of almost every autoimmune disease as well.\nIn this course, we are going to cover how to heal inflammation naturally using food as medicine and integrative medicine practices such as meditation and exercise. We will begin with understanding how the immune system works, then discuss inflammation when it is doing what it should and when it is not. We will discuss what causes inflammation, leaky gut syndrome, dysbiosis and how to determine where your “weak link of inflammation” is. Students will learn what foods to avoid, and how to create a diet plan that works right for them.\nI too used to suffer from inflammation-related issues.  I had brain fog, fatigue and skin issues.  I was on the edge of adrenal fatigue and burnt out. As a practicing Doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, this was hard for me to accept, but it was my reality.  I used the principle and techniques in this course to heal myself, and hundreds of my patients.\nThere is a new fad diet every day. Someone telling you “do not do, that do this!” In Nutrition for Inflammation, we address the root of the matter. We address the cause of the problem, inflammation, and in doing so, we treat all the branches – the symptoms. We explore the latest health and nutrition research to reverse chronic inflammation.\nThis course includes:\nA 9-week nutrition plan\nOver 60 Recipes\nMeal tracking sheets\nWorksheets to help you track your progress\nMUCH MORE...",

      "description": "It is time to learn how to choose a herbal superfood blend in the overflowing market of protein powders, energy bars, and smoothie recipes. Why do I need a superfood drink, and which one should I choose?\nOur focus in making a superfood blend isn't moderating disease symptoms. We focus on creating healthy functions and achieving your ideal body weight. With abundant health, disease is simply crowded out and replaced with optimal performance.\nYou can gain good performance back. The momentum of the \"normal\" downward spiral of declining health and shorter lifespan can be slowed, and eventually reversed to add many precious moments and experiences in the coming years.\nDelaying the onset of typical middle-age-related problems, especially the decline in sexual health and increasing obesity, is hard to explain to people who did not experience it.\nEffects of feeding yourself right will include:\nReduced fat - increased muscle = solid body shape.\nEnhanced immune function = resistance to infections.\nEnhanced memory, ambition, attitude and brain power.\nReduction of joint and body muscle aches and pains.\nSubstantial increase in sexual health, interest, ability\nIncreased stamina for both women and for men\nMore youthful appearance and body functions\nExtended life span quality and quantity\nWeight loss as your body naturally finds its ideal weight\nYou will learn about herbalism, nutrients like Coenzyme Q10, Saffron, Ginkgo Biloba, Bilberry, Siberian Ginseng, Garlic, Vitamins A-E, Niacin, Vitamin C, Pycnogenols and Bioflavonoids, plus key minerals like Chromium, as well as the Essential Fatty Acids: GLA and Omega 3.\nThe result is understanding nutrition basics for ideal health, and how it affects your ability to function, which nutrients, and in which amounts are required for optimal performance.\nSpecial Section: Vegetarian Bodybuilders\nThere is a belief that bodybuilders need meat in order to get the protein they require to build lean muscle mass. Nothing could be further from the truth. Many weight lifters thrive on meatless, even vegan diets. Herbalism and plant protein can be superior to meat in many ways.\nIn this special section, we look at Superfoods for high end athletes.",

Participants gain in-depth knowledge and action items to take to achieve optimal health. The topics are broken down into easy-to-understand video tutorials that can be rewatched at the viewer's leisure.

Not eating or drinking the right things on the court, running out of gas in the third set, not recovering properly between matches, or cramping that could have been prevented by better nutrition.\nI am a sports dietitian who works with high-level tennis players including Grand Slam winners as well as up and coming pros, juniors, and club players. Having also spent time as a college tennis coach, I know that getting players to try new things can be a major challenge. I also know that budget plays a role in the foods coaches can provide for players as well as in the choices players make on their own. With all of that in mind, this course was set up to offer easy to implement solutions, without being burdened by complicated plans or being told to eat things you don't like!\nYears of both research and practical experience in tennis have allowed me to create a course that offers coaches and players an understanding of the key sports nutrition concepts in a format that is easy to follow. Topics are broken down into short modules that can be viewed over a period of days or weeks, and you won’t need a nutrition degree to understand it and take away helpful information that will improve your results.",

      "description": "The Cycle Diet has been tested and proven for 30 years! The Cycle Diet has been used successfully by clients in the real-world to stay lean while enjoying fun cheat days where truly \"anything goes\"!\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n\"I've been a coaching client of Scott for over a decade now and have been using the cycle diet for almost that length of time too. I can say without any hesitation that this is the best diet to follow to stay ripped year round and indulge in all your favourite foods all while making cosmetic improvements to your physique.\"\n- Andy Sinclair, fitness model (Andy is featured in the course!)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Cycle Diet is not like other diets out there that promise you that you can lose weight eating whatever you want. No. The Cycle Diet is a reasonable, sustainable lifestyle, but it also takes a certain level of discipline.\nFor example, with the Cycle Diet, you don't just \"add in a cheat day.\" Instead, you put your body in what we call \"Supercompensation Mode\" so that a huge influx of calories (a \"cheat day\") is exactly what your body needs.\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to know to start Cycle Dieting: what foods to eat and how much, how to read your biofeedback,how to get into supercompensation mode and stay there, and much more.\n\n\n\"COAX THE BODY AND IT RESPONDS; FORCE THE BODY AND IT REACTS\"\nThe Cycle Diet is all about coaxing your body and your body's metabolism and your bodyweight setpoint. I've always said that the metabolic and hormonal environment into which calories enter is what really matters for sustainable weight loss. The Cycle Diet is all about manipulating that same metabolic and hormonal environment over the long term, as a sustainable solution to weight loss and weight maintenance.\nMost diets only think in the very immediate realm of time. However, you have to consider the immediate effects, the residual effects, and the more long-term cumulative effects. Most diets \"feel great\" as you're losing fat at first, but under the surface the body is responding metabolically and hormonally, and eventually you get the inevitable \"diet rebound.\" You can only force the body for so long before it reacts. To achieve longterm results, you have to coax your body. In other words, don't work \"on\" your body; work \"with\" your body.\nThis is what the Cycle Diet was designed to do. The Cycle Diet is NOT a \"weight loss\" diet; it is a \"metabolism\" diet. This is because any sustainable solution must be \"metabolism first\" in my opinion.\nTo my mind, any diet strategy must meet two essential criteria:\nIt must serve the body.\nIt must be sustainable.\nI have been doing the Cycle Diet myself and with clients for 30 years, so I consider it very sustainable. I used it myself to stay \"guest posing\" ready for bodybuilding contests, and near photoshoot ready year-round. Andy, a fitness model whom you heard from above, uses it to stay within \"striking distance\" of photoshoot ready: meaning that when he has a photoshoot, all he does is cut out a cheat day or two beforehand, and he's ready for the covers of magazines. (I should add that Andy is a fitness model, so that's just for the magazines. Truth is he still looks fantastic even when he has the cheat day.) Check out the free preview of the \"The 'Goals' of the Cycle Diet\" video, as well as some of the CASE STUDIES videos, to see more examples of what I mean.\n\n\nYou Will Learn:\nHow cheat days and overfeeds can serve the body IF you are in the right metabolic and hormonal state, what's called \"supercompensation mode,\" or simply, \"Supercomp.\"\nHow to read your own body's biofeedback to determine when you are in \"supercompensation mode\" and a cheat day is exactly what your body NEEDS.\nHow to \"graduate\" from simple cheat meals, to half-day cheats, to full-day cheats.\nThe Right Mindsets for making this diet part of a reasonable, sustainable lifestyle.\nActual daily meal plans for your diet days, plus information on how to tweak them, or construct your own from scratch.\nWhat kind of weight training works best with the Cycle Diet.\nHow to evaluate if a cheat day \"went well\" and whether you should keep them in your diet. (And what to do if it didn't go well!)\nHow to determine what foods to include in your diet day meals plans, based on your own body's needs and signals.\nVariations of the Cycle Diet that Scott has \"tweaked\" with different clients, depending on their needs, backgrounds, and goals.\n...and MUCH MORE!",

I am also a fitness writer/contributor on some renowned fitness platforms like T-Nation dot com and SimpliFaster dot com.\nThis course will help you understand the sophisticated subject that is sports nutrition in a concise and structured way. By the end of it you will know exactly how to plan your diet in order to significantly enhance your health, athletic performance and body composition, whether you’re looking to gain muscle mass, lose fat or maintain your current weight. If you are a professional trainer you will be able to use these skills to offer nutritional guidance to your clients and help them achieve their goals more efficiently.\nThe course begins by covering the fundamentals of sports nutrition and gradually progresses into more elaborate topics, like the crucial role of hormones and neurotransmitters in human metabolism and body composition. The material is presented via a plethora of mediums like videos, articles and slides, and was gathered through years of academic and applied knowledge.\nMy purpose was to build a succinct, to-the-point lesson series that will simplify complex concepts and provide essential theoretical and practical foundation by concentrating on what really matters while filtering out unnecessary, stretched-out overexplaining. The truth is that we live in an age of information bombardment and are constantly overwhelmed by the abundance of choices and stimuli. Obviously, there is not enough time to keep up with everything, and this is why in my opinion, today more than ever, learning should be smart and time-efficient.

This is a course you will actually finish.\nCOURSE SUMMARY\nBasic Principles of Sports Nutrition\nThe energy systems and energy requirements of an athlete\nThe nutrition pyramid\nHow to calculate the \"Calories In VS Calories Out\" equation (Basal Metabolic Rate - BMR & Total Daily Energy Expenditure - TDEE)\nMuscle growth & fat loss specifics - Which comes first?\nHow to determine your body fat percentage by yourself\nNutrients\nMacronutrients (macros) and micronutrients (micros): how much and how often?\nPre, intra and post-workout (peri-workout) nutrition specifics\nThe ideal meal and nutrient timing\nSupplementation\nWhich supplements are actually backed by sports science?

Followed by the food processors adding neurotoxins to your drink or food, and farmers growing hollow foods on depleted soils. Then grocers soaking their carrots in chlorinated water to keep them clean, and teachers sterilizing every surface with antibacterials, or soap makers adding \"fragrance\" to your detergent, and everybody else asking you to sit, take a ride, and avoid hard work.\nToxicity, Malnutrition, Environment and Stagnation\n\nAt some point the immune system cracks. It begins to mistake some parts of your body as a foreign invader. Depending on a combination of factors - which nutrient is missing, which toxin has not been eliminated, which virus you contracted, and what type of stress you have endured - you develop one or more autoimmune disorder(s).\n\nThe mainstream medical mindset focuses on symptoms and their suppression. It is possible to suppress a symptom using poisons, but unless the cause is dealt with, it will return with a greater strength, or at a broader and deeper level, which will be even more difficult to deal with. It is known as \"aging\", and \"you'll have to get used to that.\" We don't quite agree with this.\n\nToxins - heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, organo-chlorines, volatile organic compounds - they are all around you, in your air, water, food, clothes, beds, homes, cars, schools, offices.\nMalnutrition - Is it possible to be fat and malnourished at the same time? Phytonutrients, Minerals, Enzymes, Vitamins, Microbes - the makings of healthy life are nearly absent from industrial processed food. When your food is a hollow, low nutrient density, calorie rich, taste enhanced pretender - you can never eat enough. Even after a meal your body says: \"Feed Me!\". There is no wonder you are putting on weight.\nStagnation - All life is based on pulsating energy: inhale/exhale, shorten/lengthen, close/open, squeeze/relax. When these movements seize, you soon are dead. Your body is designed to function under load - it is in dynamic (not static) balance that we find life's expression. Sedentary life is the antithesis to healthy function. A stagnant body if water is a swamp - rotting, decomposing, putrid smelling. If your feet stink, or your breath is bad, it is because of stagnation - you need movement.\nEMF stands for Electro-Magnetic Frequency. You cannot see it, but these days it is hard to find a place that is not being bombarded by signals of varying wave lengths. The shorter the wave, the higher the frequency, and the closer to affecting your health. It is used to deliver both energy and information, making our lives much more convenient, but at the same time it is threatening our health.\n\nIN this course, you will learn more of how you got where you are and what you can do to get to where you want to be.\nWe have designed this course to provide you with the right knowledge, techniques and advice to be able to get back to your natural state of Peace, Love and Joy.\n\nOur Motto: Restoring Vitality to You and The Planet!",

      "description": "For thousands of years, Ayurveda has protected human health in a simple yet effective manner. You may have heard of Ayurveda before and have wanted to learn more.

Why don't you feel like that everyday?\nEach day you make hundreds of small decisions that can either promote energy or sap it. Most of these are made without you realizing the consequences. Eating the wrongs types of foods at the wrong times of day can be kryptonite to having long-term energy.\nThe fact is that some people need to “be on\" more than others. If you work long hours, have a busy social life, have a family that requires your attention, or need to complete copious amounts of schoolwork, then tailoring your nutrition to maximize your energy is critical.\nMany factors contribute to your energy level throughout the day, but the biggest one is what you put into your body, how you fuel yourself. This course breaks down how to optimize every decision you make regarding your nutrition in order to have the maximum amount of energy possible. It covers a range of situations that commonly befall busy professionals.\nMost people know, deep down, what's healthy and what's not. The problem is that most of the time, the healthiest option is not convenient, or even possible. This course illustrates the best course of action for any situation.\nThe course provides a framework for exactly what makes you tired and how to avoid and counteract those causes. But even more importantly than a blueprint for decision-making, this course is actionable. The information is broken down into 11 lectures with a total of around 1.5 hours of content. Each lecture will provide you with specific and actionable takeaways that can be implemented into your daily regiment immediately.\nA few things you'll learn in this course:\nWhat to do before and during flights to avoid jet-lag\nWhy we go into “food comas\"\nHow to get the most out of a protein shake\nMeal timing for maximum energy\nIdeal macronutrient structures for each meal\nMost effective uses of caffeine\nThis is just a small sample of what this course has to offer. The information is beneficial to anyone looking to improve his or her health and daily output.\nIf you have any questions as you're going through the material, or even additional content requests, feel free to let me know. I will personally respond, add the items to the course and demonstrate how you can apply this information directly to your life. So sign up now.\nTalk soon,\nMichael Gross",

Our genetics differ based on where we are born besides other factors!\nUdemy has students from 190 countries. As a Master Diet and Nutrition Coach I wanted to design a course that appeals to all!\n\nBut with a Ketogenic Diet this proved to be very challenging.\n\nAfter all, most diets around the world including Indian, Mediterranean, Standard American Diet [SAD], Mexican have a significant percentage of calories from carbohydrates, the very nutrient restricted on a Ketogenic Diet.\n\nA Standard Ketogenic Diet is a diet with close to 70 percent of calories from fats, 20-25 percent protein and less than 5 percent carbohydrates, somewhere between 20-50g/day.\n\nJust think if you eat a large banana there is a high probability that you may go out of ketosis (a metabolic state where our bodies start to use ketones as fuel)!\n\nTo an Asian Indian this is a nightmare. For generations they have thrived on a 70-80 percent diet of carbohydrates!\n\nAsking them to skip— rice, roti, pulses, beans, milk (lactose is a form of sugar, so this needs to be limited), potatoes, & most importantly fruits is asking for trouble.\n\nAnd trying suggesting an Italian or a Greek to skip their pastas! Good luck with that:)\nIt does help to be a non-vegetarian especially if want to pursue a Ketogenic Diet, but unfortunately 99 percentage of meat (includes eggs and dairy products) comes from CAFO’s (confined animal feeding operations) [1] and are loaded with antibiotics, hormones and are grain-fed. This can cause lot of health problems.\n\nAnd I think this is one of the main reasons (besides spiritual reasons) why in the past many years, lot of Americans are turning vegetarians and/or vegan!\n\nWhat’s my point? Why then I created this course in the first place?\n\nGood Question.\n\nLet me start by saying that if you are a non-vegetarian, being on a Ketogenic Diet is relatively easy.\n\nAlthough it does not give you the ticket to eat processed foods just because they uphold the Ketogenic Diet Macros (Fat 70%, Proteins 25%, Carbs 5%). This some experts term as the ‘bacon phenomena’\n\nEven on Keto, Food Choices Matter, and if you adhere to the guidelines and tips I have provided in this course, amazing health benefits will accrue to you overtime. I have discussed Keto & its Fabulous Benefits in Module 2.\n\nIn my more than a decade long experience of creating diets for people all around the world, I strongly believe in this statement:\n\nOnly a very minor percentage of people can restrict their carbs to less than 5 percentage or 30g/day.\n\nLook around you, there are carbs in literally everything. Only in the past 100 years, sugar consumption has increased to 180lbs (up from 90lbs per person per year).\n\nStaple foods like rice, wheat have become super refined and processed. Most beverages are sugar sweetened and are the leading cause of the obesity epidemic.\n\nAnd this is THE MAIN REASON why I created this course—To help people be mindful of the carbs they are consuming, reduce it’s consumption and only select the one’s that are healthy for you (Yes, carbs can be healthy too!)\n\nA Large Majority of you will be able to:\n\n-Lose fat in a rapid and enjoyable manner\n-Drastically improve your health\n-Build lean muscles\n-Triple your energy levels\n-Optimize your sleep\n\nprovided you reduce your calories from Refined and Processed Carbohydrates.\n\nThis is where Module 5, 6 & 7 will come to your rescue:)\n\nModule 5 is where I will discuss the types of Ketogenic Diet. There are mainly 4 variations based on your goals & preferences.\n\nModule 6 is taking a step by step approach to creating a customized Ketogenic Diet for yourself and your clients.\n\nI am super-exited about Module 7. This is my in-house variation of the Ketogenic Diet called the FAB-D Diet.\n\nAs Buddha say “ Take the middle road ”\n\nAnd this diet does just that.\n\nI strongly believe that cutting a macronutrient completely is not enjoyable and sustainable for most people.\n\nAnd therefore FAB-D Diet ‘takes the middle road’ by keeping the calories from carbohydrates in a low-to-moderate range! It can keep you in Ketosis for few days a week!\n\nIn Module 8 you will find a comprehensive 21-Day Keto Reboot Challenge.\n\nThis will help anyone to get on their selected variation of the Ketogenic Diet. Its a step-by-step program which covers everything from what needs to be done everyday including recipes, meal and diet plans, shopping list, tips, guidelines to maximize fat loss and/or muscle building.\n\nThis course has everything what you need to become a Master Keto Coach if that is what your goal is. You will be required to give an exam and once you score more than 70% you will be able to secure a CPD Certificate.\nYour coach,\nAkash\n###IMPORTANT###\nWe offer a CPD Certificate which is different from the Udemy's Certificate of Completion.

Research shows good evidence of a faster and sustainable weight loss when going on a ketogenic diet as a very low carbohydrate diet when compared to people on a traditional low-fat diet.\n...(The Ketogenic Diet) It is a diet that causes the body to release ketones into the bloodstream. Our cells have used blood sugar, which comes from carbohydrates, as the body’s main source of energy. As in the the Ketogenic Diet the carbohydrates intake is reduced to 5% of the daily calories, not to exceed 20grams of Net carbs a day, in the lack of blood sugar from food, the body adjusts and starts breaking down stored fat into molecules called ketones in a process called ketosis.\n\n\nStudents who complete this course will receive an official health coaching certificate offered by Transformation Academy in collaboration with instructor Sanda Kruger of Mystic Core Movements.

You see diets are designed to fail, heck, the first three letters of DIET spell DIE, in fact I argue that diets actually lead to the death of weight loss.\n\nThe Merriam Webster Dictionary defines diet as: \"A regimen of eating or drinking sparingly so as to reduce one’s weight\". But, with the 30 in 45 program there are no restrictions on how much you can eat and no counting calories. With this program you eat whenever you are hungry as long as you eat from the prescribed list of acceptable foods which is liberal in choice and even better one day per week you MUST indulge yourself and eat anything and everything you want.This includes pizza, cupcakes, fried foods, pancakes, beer, cheesecake and anything else you desire (although only once every 7 days).\nAdditionally, the 30 in 45 program allows you to workout at home with no equipment other than your own bodyweight for as little as 48 minutes a week. It’s perfect for anyone who is truly serious about taking control of their weight, health, and future.",

It is also intended to people interested in making their organization compliant with the ISO 22000 standard or food specialists who are looking for a more organized approach to handle and manage food safety in their enterprise.\nThe consequences of unsafe food can be serious. ISO’s food safety management standards help organizations identify and control food safety hazards, at the same time as working together with other ISO management standards, such as ISO 9001. Applicable to all types of producer, ISO 22000 provides a layer of reassurance within the global food supply chain, helping products cross borders and bringing people food that they can trust.\n\n\nISO 22000 sets out the requirements for a food safety management system and can be certified to it. It maps out what an organization needs to do to demonstrate its ability to control food safety hazards in order to ensure that food is safe. It can be used by any organization regardless of its size or position in the food chain.\n\n\nISO 22000 is the most popular voluntary food safety international standard in the food industry with 39,651 sites certified (as per the ISO Survey 2019). The ISO 22000 family are international voluntary consensus standards which align to Good Standardization Practices (GSP)[3] and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Principles for the Development of International Standards.[4] Defining the requirements for a Food Safety Management System (FSMS) and incorporating the following elements which as defined as FSMS principles:\ninteractive communication\nsystem management\nprerequisite programs\nHACCP principles\nCritical reviews of the above elements have been conducted by many scientists.[5][6][7][8] Communication along the food chain is essential to ensure that all relevant food safety hazards are identified and adequately controlled at each step within the food chain. This implies communication between organizations both upstream and downstream in the food chain. Communication with customers and suppliers about identified hazards and control measures will assist in clarifying customer and supplier requirements.\nRecognition of the organization's role and position within the food chain is essential to ensure effective interactive communication throughout the chain in order to deliver safe food products to the consumer.",

The IAOTH has approved all our courses. Once you graduate from this course, you can apply to become a member with them as a Therapist.\nIn addition, Fabulous Body Inc. is proudly affiliated with the following:\n-AHHA (American Holistic Health Association).

[study link]\nYet, despite these good intentions, less than one-third of Americans are at a healthy weight, and most are not eating healthy either. The latest data show that nearly 23 percent of Americans report consuming vegetables and fruits less than one time daily.\n\n\nThe ‘few things’ that are probably preventing you from losing weight and being healthy are:\nA) Making a lot of mistakes, believing in myths that are circulated by the weight loss industry. In Module 2, I bust the Top 10 Weight Loss Myths & Mistakes that are keeping you weak, fat and flabby!\nB) Relying too much on motivation and willpower. If you come to think of it, these commodities are not really there when you need them!\nIn Module 4, I will provide you with 11 Weight Loss Habits and an action plan for each habit that will help you lose weight effortlessly.\nC) Having the wrong mindset, negative and limited deep satiated beliefs that stop you results in failure every time you try a weight loss transformation.\nModule 3 is about the Mental Game of Weight Loss. Your mindset, reasons and beliefs are actually more important than you think it is!\nModule 1 starts with an introduction about what you can expect from the course. It discusses the basic principles of weight loss, takes help from my fat loss program SHRED and elaborates on 3-phases that any person goes through when trying to lose weight and they can intelligently maneuver their caloric intake for best results.\nModule 5 provides the best guidelines and strategies when it comes to diet & nutrition.\nWe already know diets don’t work. If you want permanent weight loss results, these guidelines should be the bedrock of any nutrition plan you wish to follow.\nWeight loss is a three-legged stool- mindset, nutrition and training.\nIn Module 6, you will understand and learn about the best training system that will make losing weight effortless.\nAt Fabulous body, the results of my clients and students are very important to me and I am all for achieving weight loss in the fastest way possible.\nBUT, do note that the fastest way is often the realistic and the enjoyable way.\nOnly and only if you enjoy what you eat and look forward to pursuing the type of activity will it be possible for you to lose weight and keep it off permanently.\nCrash dieting, starvation diets and chronic cardio may help you drop the weighing scale the fastest, but unfortunately, these methods, in the long term, will result in all and more weight bouncing back, leaving you worse off than where you started!\nCertificate in Weight Loss course will work on your mindset, show you a realistic and enjoyable way to lose weight, at the same time, ensure that you learn the science behind (you will find dozens of scientific studies quoted) literally everything that I discuss in this course.\n21 Weight loss FAQs and comprehensive case studies are provided to better grasp the weight loss concepts discussed.\nWith the best strategies, tips and scientific methods to push your progress, there is nothing stopping you from losing the unwanted fat weight.\n\n\nI will see you on the inside.\n\n\nYour weight loss coach and instructor,\nAkash\n\n\n###IMPORTANT###\nWe offer a CPD Certificate which is different from the Udemy's Certificate of Completion.

I’m sick of Subway. Should we just eat cereal?”\n“I think we have some eggs…”\n“Whatever -- let’s just go to that restaurant.”\n\n\nIf this sounds like you, this course is for you. A lot of people don’t know what they’re going to eat for lunch or dinner, and then end up eating fast food or going out where they spend a lot more money than they would like. By learning a few simple cooking techniques, you can eat healthy, delicious food without spending a lot of time or money.\n\n\nThis is not a traditional cooking class in that the focus is on specific cooking techniques rather than recipes (although, you will also find many simple recipes). You’ll learn how to prepare food; how to cook meats, vegetables, and grains in several ways; how to bring a lot of flavor to your meals by putting together flavor profiles composed of certain spices; and how to safely clean your cooking area. Throughout the course, you’ll also learn about basic nutrition (e.g., carbs aren’t the enemy).\n\n\nAbout Your Instructor\nYour instructor, Brad Kunkel, has been a personal chef for the last eight years and founded 1505 Kitchen in San Jose, California. He is passionate about helping people eat well, eat healthy, be well, and be healthy.\n\n\nThis course will help you develop a healthy eating lifestyle, and integrate it into your day-to-day.",
